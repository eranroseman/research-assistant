    # Test Type Markers
    unit: Unit tests with mocks - fast, isolated, no external dependencies
    integration: Integration tests - test component interactions, may use real services
    e2e: End-to-end tests - test complete user workflows through CLI
    performance: Performance and benchmark tests - measure speed and resource usage

    # Speed Markers
    slow: Tests that take > 5 seconds - can be skipped with '-m "not slow"'
    fast: Tests that complete in < 1 second - for quick feedback loops

    # Dependency Markers
    requires_kb: Tests that require a built knowledge base
    requires_api: Tests that need external API access (should be mocked in CI)
    requires_gpu: Tests that require GPU/CUDA support
    gpu: Tests that use GPU acceleration
    requires_zotero: Tests that need Zotero installation

    # Execution Markers
    serial: Tests that must run serially - not safe for parallel execution
    flaky: Tests that may fail intermittently - retry on failure
    critical: Critical path tests - must pass for release

    # Feature Markers
    cli: Tests for CLI command functionality
    search: Tests for search functionality
    quality: Tests for quality scoring system
    gap_analysis: Tests for gap analysis features
    discover: Tests for external paper discovery
    citation: Tests for citation generation and formatting
    logging: Tests for command usage logging system
    error_formatting: Tests for unified error message formatting
    help_formatting: Tests for unified help text formatting
    knowledge_base: Tests for KB building, indexing, and management
    output_formatting: Tests for unified output and progress formatting
    safe_prompt: Tests for safe user prompt system
    asyncio: Tests that use asyncio functionality
    api: Tests for API utilities and retry logic
    batch: Tests for batch command functionality
