# Root Directory File Analysis - Python, JSON, XML, GZ Files

## Summary
- **Python files**: 4 (all kept - working implementations)
- **JSON files**: 2 (1 obsolete checkpoint, 1 potentially useful)
- **XML files**: 2 (both can be deleted - test outputs)
- **GZ files**: 2 (both obsolete - Azure VM deployment archives, 2.2GB total)

## Detailed Analysis

### Python Files (4 files - ALL KEPT)
Already analyzed and copied to v5_design/implementations/:
1. `extract_zotero_library.py` - Main extraction script (KEEP)
2. `grobid_overnight_runner.py` - Overnight runner (KEEP)
3. `grobid_post_processor.py` - Post-processor (KEEP)
4. `retry_all_failed.py` - Retry script (KEEP)

### JSON Files (2 files)

#### 1. `grobid_checkpoint.json` (Aug 29) - **OBSOLETE**
- Old checkpoint from a Grobid extraction run
- Contains 1004 lines of processed keys
- From an older extraction attempt before the successful one
- **Recommendation**: DELETE (obsolete checkpoint)

#### 2. `zotero_doi_mapping.json` (Aug 28) - **POTENTIALLY USEFUL**
- Maps Zotero storage paths to DOIs
- 344 lines of mappings
- Could be useful for DOI lookups
- **Recommendation**: KEEP (might be needed for DOI resolution)

### XML Files (2 files - BOTH OBSOLETE)

#### 1. `coverage.xml` (Aug 23) - **OBSOLETE**
- Test coverage report from pytest
- Generated by coverage.py
- Old test run data
- **Recommendation**: DELETE (regenerated on test runs)

#### 2. `retry_test_output.xml` (Aug 31) - **OBSOLETE**
- Grobid TEI XML output from a test
- Single paper extraction test
- Not needed anymore
- **Recommendation**: DELETE (test output)

### GZ Files (2 files - BOTH OBSOLETE)

#### 1. `vm1_pdfs.tar.gz` (1.0GB, Aug 30) - **OBSOLETE**
- PDF archive for Azure VM 1
- Part of failed Azure deployment
- Contains Zotero PDFs for distribution
- **Recommendation**: DELETE (Azure deployment artifact)

#### 2. `vm3_pdfs.tar.gz` (1.2GB, Aug 30) - **OBSOLETE**
- PDF archive for Azure VM 3
- Part of failed Azure deployment
- Contains Zotero PDFs for distribution
- **Recommendation**: DELETE (Azure deployment artifact)

## Space Usage

### Current Space Used by Obsolete Files:
- `vm1_pdfs.tar.gz`: 1.0 GB
- `vm3_pdfs.tar.gz`: 1.2 GB
- Other files: < 1 MB
- **Total: ~2.2 GB**

## Recommendations

### Files to DELETE (5 files, 2.2GB):
```bash
# Remove Azure VM archives (2.2GB)
rm vm1_pdfs.tar.gz vm3_pdfs.tar.gz

# Remove test outputs
rm coverage.xml retry_test_output.xml

# Remove old checkpoint
rm grobid_checkpoint.json
```

### Files to KEEP (5 files):
- All 4 Python scripts (working implementations)
- `zotero_doi_mapping.json` (potentially useful for DOI lookups)

## Rationale for Deletion

1. **VM archives**: These were created for Azure deployment that failed and has been abandoned in favor of local processing
2. **Test outputs**: These are regenerated when tests run
3. **Old checkpoint**: From a previous extraction run, superseded by successful extraction in `zotero_extraction_20250830_235521/`

## After Cleanup
Root will contain only:
- 4 working Python scripts
- 1 DOI mapping JSON
- Essential config files (.gitignore, requirements.txt, etc.)
- Core directories (src/, tests/, v5_design/, etc.)
