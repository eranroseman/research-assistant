# Parallel execution notes:
# Run with parallel execution:
#   pytest -n 4              # Use 4 workers
#   pytest -n auto           # Auto-detect CPU count
#   pytest -n 4 -m "not slow"  # Fast tests in parallel
#
# Run specific test types:
#   pytest -m integration    # Only integration tests
#   pytest -m "not slow"     # Skip slow tests
#
# For serial execution (debugging):
#   pytest -n 0              # Disable parallel execution
#   pytest                   # Default (no parallel)
