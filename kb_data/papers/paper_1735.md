## Abstract
Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) and flash glucose monitoring (FGM) systems have revolutionized diabetes management by delivering real-time, dynamic insights into blood glucose levels. This article provides a concise overview of the evolution of CGM technology, highlights emerging innovations in the field and explores current and potential future applications (including insulin management, early diagnostics, predictive modeling, diabetes education and integration into automated insulin delivery (AID) systems) of CGM in healthcare.
