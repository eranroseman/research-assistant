A hallmark of subclinical metabolic decline is impaired metabolic ﬂexibility, which refers to the ability to
switch fuel utilization between glucose and fat according to energy demand and substrate availability.
Herein, we propose optimizing metabolic health with digital twins that model an individual’s metabolic
ﬂexibility proﬁle to gamify the process of health optimization and predict long-term health outcomes.
We explore key characteristics of this approach from technological and socioeconomical
perspectives, with the objective of reducing the burden from metabolic disorders through driving
behavior change and early detection of metabolic decline.
Public health burden and challenges in managing and
preventing cardiometabolic diseases
Aging, unhealthy diets, and sedentary lifestyles are key risk factors of car-
diometabolic diseases (CMDs), which include metabolic syndrome (MetS),
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)1–3.
MetS is a cluster of metabolic disorders including obesity, hypertension,
escalated blood glucose lipid, which could progress to T2DM and CVDs if
not managed effectively2–4. Globally, there is a high prevalence of poor
cardiometabolic health (Table 1), with CVDs causing 20.5 million deaths in
2021 (approximately one-third of all global deaths)4,5. Overall, the pre-
valence of metabolic disorder increases with age. However, there has been a
notable rise in youth-onset obesity and T2DM, driven by factors such as
increased consumption of calorie-dense foods, more sedentary behavior,
structural racism, and other social determinants of health6,7. Since 1990,
adult obesity rates worldwide have more than doubled, while adolescent
obesity rates have quadrupled8. In the US, the prevalence of youth-onset
T2DM among children aged 10–19 years nearly doubled from 2001 to
20179, with the most pronounced increase occurring in racial and ethnic
minority groups6,9,10. In 2023, a consensus recommendation from the
American Heart Association Presidential Advisory and the American
Academy of Pediatrics called for annual obesity screening and blood pres-
sure assessment from 3 years of age7.
Notably, early-stage metabolic disorders can oftenbe reversed through
lifestyle modiﬁcation and medication,and small habit changes maybe more
effective than medication alone3,11,12. Key challenges of disease management
and prevention may be attributed to low adherence to healthy lifestyle and
the lack of early detection of asymptomatic metabolic abnormalities7,13,14,
which highlight the critical need for effective methods to facilitate perso-
nalized care plan to drive long-term adherence to lifestyle changes in
decentralized settings, as well as early detection of metabolic decline across
diverse populations including those who are generally healthy.
From a socioeconomic perspective, the potential to use early metabolic
health biomarkers for identifying subclinical metabolic decline is
strengthened by a growing public interest in self-monitoring health bio-
markers and tuning lifestyle habits to achieve optimal health15. This trend
can be attributed to multiple factors. First,there is an increasedawareness of
the adverse effects of unhealthy diets and physical inactivity on the risk of
metabolic disorders. Second, policy initiatives aimed at fostering environ-
ments that facilitate healthy lifestyle choices while rendering unhealthy
options less attractive have gained traction. For instance, the sugary drink
tax, advocated by the WHO, has beenimplemented in over100 countries to
deter consumption16. Similarly, Singapore has implemented “Nutri-Grade,”
rangingfromAto D,toprovideguidanceonsugarandsaturatedfatlevelsin
beverages. Additionally, many countries have launched national public
healthcampaignstopromotehealthylifestyleatthesocietallevel,suchasthe
“Active People, Healthy Nation” initiative in the US17, “LumiHealth” in
Singapore18, and “LiveLighter” in Australia19. Lastly, the advent of digital
health technologies and wearables has enabled continuous monitoring of
various health-related metrics during daily activities.
Optimizing metabolic health with a metabolic ﬂexibility-
based digital twin
Unlike at-risk individuals who are screened for cardiometabolic risk factors,
professional athletes undergo a distinct set of comprehensive examinations

for their metabolic health. These evaluations focus on assessing the meta-
bolic dynamics in response to exercise, aiming to optimize performance
during intense physical activity. Metabolic ﬂexibility, the ability to switch
fuel utilization between glucose and fat to maintain homeostasis, is a key
indicator of metabolic health as it reﬂects how adaptive the body is
throughoutphysiologicchallenges20–22.Studieshaveshownthatprofessional
athletes exhibit a greater level of metabolic ﬂexibility compared to moder-
ately active individuals and those with MetS23–25. The enhanced ﬂexibility
allowsathletestoreadilyswitchbetweenutilizingglucoseandfatinresponse
to energy demand and substrate availability. Conversely, individuals with
impaired metabolic function, particularly the elderly and individuals with
metabolic disorders, have declined metabolic ﬂexibility21,22,26–29, making
themlessadaptive to nutritional changesand disturbanceinenergy balance.
MetS patients and professional athletes represent the extreme ends of
the spectrum of metabolic health. For individuals who are non-athletes and
free of metabolic disorders, there also exists a varying degree of metabolic
ﬂexibility due to interindividual biological differences such as genetic
characteristics and overall health and ﬁtness level25,28,30–33. Indeed, many
studies have shown that evaluating metabolic ﬂexibility could improve risk
stratiﬁcation and enable early detection of metabolic dysfunction even in
seemingly healthy individuals20,30,32–34. For instance, in a study that investi-
gated the metabolic response to an acute high-fat overload, substantial
variability in the ability to switch fuel to lipids was observed among healthy
adults. Notably, this degree of ﬂexibility is indicative of the propensity for
future weight gain32. Conversely, another study found that within the obese
group, some individuals exhibited a transcriptional proﬁle that was similar
to the normal weight group, suggesting they had retained a degree of
metabolic ﬂexibility33. This highlights that metabolic ﬂexibility could be
independent of body size, and not all obese individuals experience the same
degree of metabolic impairment. Taken together, metabolic ﬂexibility could
serve as an early biomarker of metabolic abnormalities, in order to (1)
differentiatemetabolichealthstatuswithinthegenerallyhealthypopulation.
(2) reﬂect the level of metabolic health at an individual level, which evolves
over time as a result of lifestyle choices and health management strategies
(diet, intermittent fasting, physical activity, sleep, etc).
One of the decentralized health solutions emerging as a transformative
paradigm for personalizedmetabolic disease management is the digital twin
technology35, deﬁned as an evolving digital entity designed to accurately
reﬂect the object or process it represents35,36. The emergence of the digital
twin technologies may potentially transform healthcare and, importantly,
has led to personalized health management, biomarker predictions, visua-
lization of health data, and many otherfeatures35. Ina study led by Rad et al.,
the team integrated digital twins with personal health knowledge graphs
(PHKGs) and harnessed diverse health data sources to enhance diabetes
management37. For example, this patient-speciﬁc digital twin enables real-
time, personalized care including glucose level predictions and insulin dose
optimization. In a similar study, Zhang et al. developed a digital twin fra-
mework using multi-omic data, mechanistic models, and knowledge graphs
coupled with machine learning (ML) to enhance clinical decision support
for T2DM patients38. Furthermore, a study leveraged generalized metabolic
ﬂuxes (GMF) to build a digital twin model that predicts and identiﬁes
chronic kidney diseases among T2DM patients39. Of note, human digital
twin initiatives, such as the EDITH program40, have been funded by the
European Commission to build a roadmap toward an ecosystem for virtual
human twins. Taken together, digital twin technologies present a promising
approach to personalize treatment strategies with tailored interventions
especially for metabolic diseases, which often require longitudinal
monitoring35.
In this perspective, we introduce the concept of a metabolic ﬂexibility-
based digital twin model designed to drive adherence to lifestyle changes,
enable personalized health management and early detection of subclinical
metabolic decline. Two key modules of the proposed digital twin are, (1) the
gamiﬁcation module based on longitudinal monitoring of fuel switching
and metabolic ﬂexibility trends, (2) the artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)-powered
integrated digital twin module for analyzing and predicting long-term
health outcomes associated with sustained adherence to health regimen and
metabolic ﬂexibility assessment. Importantly, we discuss the technical fea-
sibility of constructing the proposed digital twin, the challenges in its
developmentandimplementation,alongwiththeassociatedsocioeconomic
perspectivesthatneedtobetakenintoconsiderationtorealizeimprovement
in metabolic health on a population level (Fig. 1).
Gamiﬁcation module of the digital twin—promoting
adherence to health regimen through fuel switching
monitoring
Metabolic ﬂexibility is conventionally determined by measuring the
respiratory quotient (RQ), which is deﬁned as the ratio of carbon dioxide
produced (VCO2) and oxygen consumed (VO2) (VCO2/VO2) from rest to
exercise, or from fasting to feeding using the indirect calorimetry
technique20,30,41. The RQ generally ranges from 0.7 during pure fat

metabolism to 1.0 during pure carbohydrate metabolism42. Past computa-
tional models of metabolic ﬂexibility are primarily based on mechanistic
simulation of energy expenditure and metabolic ﬂuxes at tissue level or
whole-body level using a system biology approach. In one study, genome-
scalemetabolicmodelswereemployedtocomputetheRQofcomputational
model of skeletal muscle42, accounting for energy expenditure and enabling
the simulation of metabolic ﬂexibility in response to varying energy
demands. Another notable study developed a computational model of
human metabolism to predict changes in RQ in lean and obese men, using
differential equations to represent nutrient uptake and ATP production43.
These approaches were implemented in in silico testing or retrospective
analysis. In this perspective, we introduce an alternative approach to assess
metabolic ﬂexibility by tracking the dynamic changes in blood glucose and
ketone bodies(KBs) during healthinterventions, with the aim to implement
this as a digital twin solution to support decentralized metabolic health
management in real-world scenarios.”
In a glycogen-depleted state, adipose tissues release free fatty acids that
further break down into ketone bodies (KBs), such as β-hydroxybutyrate,
acetoacetateandacetone,toserveasenergysubstratesinplaceofglucose44,45.
KBs have received tremendous attention as a biomarker of elevated fat
metabolism in the context of metabolic disease prediction46, diabetic

and
health
optimization50. In a recent work, self-monitoring of metabolic dynamics for
a healthy subject based on serial measurements of blood KBs and blood
glucose (ﬁngerstick- and wearable-based) was reported50. Notably, a speciﬁc
glucose and KBs trajectory indicative of fuel switching (also known as
ketosis) was observed after 1–5 days of a sustained regimen of ﬁtness and
dietary interventions50. This important work indicated the possibility of
evaluating metabolic ﬂexibility by monitoring the ease and rapidity to reach
fuel switching under ﬁxed health regimen. Interestingly, the knowledge that
the implemented health regimen successfully induced ketosis motivated the
subject to consistently adhere to the regimen. More importantly, visualizing
thedynamicsofthebiomarkers,especiallytheketosis-drivenKBstrajectory,
also motivated the subject to sustain the regimens, which are essential
toward achieving fuel switching50. This adherence persisted throughout the
study and beyond its completion, even in challenging situations like tra-
veling. Similarly, gamiﬁcation strategies have also been implemented in
clinical trials for disease prevention. For example, physical activity was
signiﬁcantly increased among families with game-based intervention in a
clinical trial51 (NCT02531763). Furthermore, gamiﬁcation interventions

were deployed to incentivize physicalactivityforpatientswho maybeatrisk
with CVDs and T2DM, and the participants engaged in more physical
activities in the trials52,53 (NCT02961192; NCT03749473). In summary,
these demonstrated the successful application of gamiﬁcation strategies in
promoting and sustaining adherence to health regimens and potential long-
term behavior change.
The module 1 of the proposed digital twin is designed to monitor fuel
switching and promote adherence to healthy behaviors (Fig. 2). It begins
withinputdata—glucoseandKB measurementsand detailsof aﬁxed health
regimen, followed by pattern analysis to identify the occurrence of fuel
switchingwithin a preset period.A Metabolic Flexibility Score (MFS) will be
computed based on the fuel switching speed. For instance, an MFS of 90% is
assigned if fuelswitchingoccursrapidly(e.g., day2), encouragingadherence
to the current regimen. If fuel switching occurs with delay (e.g., day 10), an
MFS of 60% is given, recommending adherence and continued monitoring.
Iffuelswitchingdoesnotoccurwithin14days,itwillpromptapotentialrisk
of metabolic disorder and immediate adjustments to the health regimen
(e.g., reduce carbohydrate intake). The output provides actionable scores to
gamify adherence, motivating individuals to optimize metabolic ﬂexibility
and healthy behavior.
A key challenge associated with developing the proposed module is
the difﬁculty in obtaining KB measurements due to its invasive nature, as
blood ﬁngerstick test strips are currently the gold standard method.
Although minimally or non-invasive methods for measuring KBs in
human interstitial ﬂuid54, sweat55, urine56, and breath57,58 have been
reported, their accuracy and reliability remain uncertain. An accurate
and non-invasive KB monitoring method may eventually become
available with further technological advancements. For example, a recent
study reported a stretchable wearable sensor for measuring solid-state
epidermal biomarkers, showing strong correlation with blood bio-
markers and dynamic correlation with physiological activities59. Alter-
natively, considering the convenience of using continuous glucose
monitoring (CGM) to collect glucose data and the partially inverse
correlation between glucose and KB, it is worthwhile to investigate if KB
level or fuel switching occurrence could be estimated using CGM data.
ML pipelines like neural networks have been applied to train models
using CGM data for accurate and timely forecasting of future blood
glucose levels31,60. In selected diabetes clinical trials, blood KBs were
measured during hyperglycemia for early identiﬁcation of DKA61. Using
such datasets, Cichosz et al. utilized a supervised binary classiﬁcation ML
approach to train a model using labeled data, enabling it to predict
elevated KB level based on CGM data obtained from patients with type 1
diabetes for the ﬁrst time47. Based on the retrospective CGM data col-
lected for 4 h before the KB measurements, the authors obtained an
acceptable prediction accuracy. While further studies are warranted to
validate the results in other cohorts and comparing different ML algo-
rithms, this work underscores the possibility to correlate CGM patterns
indicative of ketosis.
Harnessing AI for predicting long-term health out-
comes with the digital twin
The gamiﬁcation module provides real-time feedback and a reward
mechanismthatgamiﬁesadherencetohealthregimen,empoweringusersto
adopt interventions that most effectively induce and maintain a beneﬁcial
state of ketosis. Another critical feature to be integrated into the digital twin
is the predictive analytics for evaluation of long-term health outcome
resulting from sustained fuel switching (Fig. 3). Frequent post-intervention
checkpoints could include self-trackable measurements like body weight,
BMI, blood pressure, and body fat composition. Additionally, a panel of
metabolic health and aging biomarkers such as Apolipoprotein A (ApoA),
ApolipoproteinB(ApoB),HemoglobinA1c(HbA1C),Interleukin-6(IL-6),
C-reactive Protein (CRP), and blood lipids could be measured as baseline
and ﬁnal health outcome. The relationship between fuel switching occur-
rence, longitudinal trends of MFS, and changes in health metrics and bio-
markers will then be mapped using AI-powered models.
Existing health management technologies like the “January AI”
application have leveraged ML pipelines to learn an individual’s phy-
siology and provide personalized recommendations based on predicted
blood glucose response to speciﬁc behavior patterns31,62. Excitingly,
generative AI (GenAI) models offer signiﬁcant potential to speed up the
development of digital twins63, as well as enhance the predictive accuracy
and user engagement of digital twin platforms. First, GenAI model could

be evaluated together with traditional ML models for the simulation of
long-term health outcomes based on implemented interventions,
potentially outperforming conventional ML approaches. Second, GenAI
can generate synthetic data for unmeasured biomarkers to aid in health
trajectory forecasting64 and minimize the need for invasive testing. Lastly,
conversational GenAI tools powered by large language models (LLMs)
can be integrated into digital twin platforms to provide real-time
coaching and motivational feedback to users. An example user interface
of the digital twin includes longitudinal trends of MFS and predicted
long-term biomarker changes (Fig. 4).

GenAI solutions have the potential to improve the performance of
digital twin models for health management. However, addressing chal-
lenges related to data privacy and security, trustworthiness and
explainability, and bias in GenAI is crucial to ensure its safe and effective
integration into wearables and digital health technologies65–67. Developing

challenges include the implementation of advanced encryption and
anonymization techniques before feeding data into generative models.
Additionally, federated learning allows models to be trained across
multiple devices or servers holding local data samples without exchan-
ging them, thus enhancing privacy.
Challenges in implementing and achieving success
with digital twin solutions
Although there is signiﬁcant potential for digital twin technologies to
improve health management and patient outcomes, their widespread
implementation and successful utilization have been hindered by var-
ious social factors, (1) disparities in the accessibility of digital health
tools, (2) socioeconomical challenges in adopting and adhering to a
healthy lifestyle, particularly healthy dietary patterns. For instance,
studies from the US and Europe have found that digital health tools are
more frequently used in urban areas, while usage is lower among ethnic
minorities and individuals with language barriers68,69. Furthermore,
younger populations, as well as those with more advanced education
levels and higher economic status, tend to use these tools more exten-
sively. In other words, people with poor health are among those facing
the greatest challenges in accessing digital health tools. These challenges
primarily stem from the digital divide that exists between different
countries, ethnicities, and communities, with signiﬁcant disparities in
digital infrastructure and inclusiveness, which encompasses accessi-
bility, affordability, digital literacy, and attitudes—such as trust and
enthusiasm—toward digital technologies68,70. The number of people
who have access to the Internet has been steadily increasing over the
years. As of 2023, approximately 67% of the global population has
internet access, nearly double the ﬁgure from ten years ago71. Notably,
Singapore ranks ﬁrst in digital inclusiveness among 82 countries in
202072, primarily due to initiatives like free public WiFi and ﬁnancial
support for digital skills training. In contrast, other Southeast Asian
countries fell below the global average mainly due to substantial low-
income populations.
Alongside tackling the digital divide to boost the adoption of digital
health technologies, it is crucial to develop effective strategies to over-
come access barriers for disadvantaged groups who currently lack any
form of healthcare. For instance, training programs could be deployed for
community health workers who will provide education and facilitate
access to services in underserved communities. Languages and culturally
tailored platforms could be developed to help bridge gaps for ethnic
minorities and non-native speakers. Furthermore, it is important to
recognize that the effective use of digital health does not always demand
continuous or sustained use. One potential strategy to reduce the
healthcare burden of CMDs could involve a system-wide, short-term
implementation of remote monitoring technologies (e.g., CGM) to
identify pre-diabetic or diabetic populations. Following this, longitudinal
monitoring could be introduced for individuals undergoing lifestyle
modiﬁcation. This approach may necessitate a redesign of healthcare
systems that begins with clearly deﬁned goals and rapidly collects data to
assess the current landscape73,74.
Second, the adoption and adherence to healthy dietary patterns is a key
challenge that needs to be addressed for achieving successful outcome from
digitaltwin technologies,asa balancedand nutritious diet is the cornerstone
of metabolic health management. This challenge could be addressed by
improving nutrition education and food security. In the US, fewer than 1 in
10 adolescents and adults consume enough fruits or vegetables and too
much sodium75. In many countries, clinicians are recommended to provide
nutrition care to patients, yet most feel their nutrition training was inade-
quate. A study from the UK found that over 70% of medical students and
doctors reported receiving less than 2 h of nutrition training in medical
school76. A systematic review indicated that nutrition is insufﬁciently
incorporated into medical education, regardless of country, setting, or year
of medical education77. Among the general population, many consumers
lack a clear understanding of what constitutes healthy carbohydrates. A
survey conducted in Australia indicated that 50% of participants did not
know precisely what constitutes a whole grain78. Moreover, a study in Sin-
gapore revealed that while most respondents were able to identify hidden
sourcesofsodiuminfoodlikeinstantnoodlesandprocessedmeats,only4in
10 were aware that sweeter-tasting dipping sauces and foods are higher in
sodium79. Taken together, it is essential to improve nutrition education for
healthcare providers, as well as public awareness campaigns for the general
population, to promote healthy eating.
Furthermore, similar to the varying levels of access to digital health
tools, access to nutritious food also varies widely across different popula-
tions. Food security is one of the key social determinants of health for CMD
risk7,80,81; however, more than 1 in 10 children and adults report food
insecurity in the US, indicating that this issue extends beyond low-income
regions82,83. The roles of various stakeholders—including insurers, health-
care providers, the food industry, and public health organizations—are
critical within this ecosystem14,84. Insurers inﬂuence access to nutritional
services and resources, while healthcare providers are key in referring
patients to nutrition programs. The food industry must prioritize the pro-
duction and marketing of healthy food options. Public health initiatives are
essential for addressing food equity and security, recognizing that these
factors are interconnected and vital for improving population health out-
comes. Notably, the American Heart Association recently launched a new
Food Is Medicine research initiative14, which provides free or subsidized
healthy foods toat-risk individuals. This program aims to generateevidence
to convince insurers to cover such programs for speciﬁc groups and to drive
system-level changes that facilitate healthy eating for at-risk populations84.
Broader ecosystem perspectives on improving
community metabolic health
Improving accessibility to healthcare resources and driving behavior
change toward a healthy lifestyle are critical groundwork that may
potentially prevent CMDs and other diseases. These challenges are also
crucial to the eventual adoption as well as the implementation of the
proposed digital twin-enabled workﬂow, which may be a promising tool
for metabolic ﬂexibility improvement. However, broader ecosystem
considerations, including socioeconomic issues, should be prioritized
prior to the implementation of advanced healthcare technologies, such as
digital twins. From a broader perspective, considerations across the
ecosystem, including gig workers and health of all age groups, should also
be carefully addressed. The emergence of the gig economy in Southeast
Asia and other parts of the world has created substantial job opportu-
nities. However, gig workers experience signiﬁcant inequalities in the
context of accessing healthcare resources through insurance and
protection85. For example, in Singapore, gig workers, including hail ride
drivers and food delivery riders, only receive insurance depending on the
“goodwill” of service providers and coverages vary substantially from
different employers85. With a new law in effect later in 2024, all gig
workers will be covered under standardized insurance similar to
employees of other sectors. In other parts of Southeast Asia, gig workers
are considered independent contractors who do not enjoy the full ben-
eﬁts of typical employees, such as insurance coverage86. Therefore, it is
evident that gig workers experience substantial vulnerabilities in the
broad ecosystem, and their accessibility to healthcare resources should be
addressed87.
Moreover, gender disparities in health, especially CMDs, may poten-
tially lead to unsatisfactory treatment outcomes88. Sex should be considered

as a biological variable whenstudying disease mechanisms, as some diseases
may require sex-speciﬁc treatment strategies89,90. Notably, chronic diseases
in women are on the rise, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the
US has also developed a framework to account for sex differences for
chronic conditions in women89. This framework speciﬁcally categorizes
women-speciﬁc chronic conditions into: (1) female-speciﬁc, (2) more
common in women, (3) potentially understudied in women, and (4) high
morbidity for women. For example, around one in three women have
hypertension globally, and this condition is considered one of the most
important risk factors for women91. Conventionally, hypertension is more
prevalent in men under 50 years of age, whereas women after the age of 65
(menopause) have higher chances of developing hypertension92. Similarly,
women tend to experience stroke at a much lower blood pressure than
men91. It is evident that sex-speciﬁc treatment strategies should also be
implemented to address potential chronic diseases. Harnessing digital
platforms powered by AI may pinpoint trends and patterns in relevant
biomarkers for early detection.
In addition, in the context of birth rates in Asia, substantial declines
in countries including Korea, Singapore, and China are observed. In
contrast, the prevalence of chronic medical conditions is increasing, with
approximately 10–30% of youth diagnosed with a condition93. Youth and
adolescents age between 10 to 24 years old may be one of the most
digitally literate group, and they may be more prepared to harness digital
health devices to longitudinally monitor their health conditions. How-
ever, driving their adherence to treatment and healthy lifestyle may be
challenging. For example, a study found that youth are less likely to use
CGMs consistently for glucose monitoring when compared to adults94.
For downstream implementation, gamiﬁcation strategies should be
carefully designed and considered and implemented into health opti-
mization for all age groups.
The challenges discussed above are not siloed to health and healthcare.
Harnessing digital health approaches may not solve these broader issues in
the ecosystem. Community efforts that involve all stakeholders spanning
from pharmaceutical companies, food industry, to government agencies to
address challenges including agriculture, sustainability, energy, housing,
economy, work, transportation, community planning, and healthcare will
lay the groundwork for the success of health optimization via digital
platforms.
Concluding remarks and future perspectives
Innovativemethodsareneededtoenableearlydetectionandmanagement
of metabolic decline prior to the onset of cardiometabolic diseases. In the
absence of metabolic disorders, metabolic ﬂexibility could serve as the
differentiating factor of metabolic health among traditionally deﬁned
healthy individuals and guide health optimization at an individual level.
Recent literature has demonstrated the feasibility of digitally monitoring
the process of metabolic switching in a decentralized setting, targeting the
favorable switch to fat oxidation as the end point. Key unresolved ques-
tions for future research include (1) Is there signiﬁcant individual varia-
bility in the ease and rapidity to reach metabolic switching under a
standardized health regimen? (2) Does the magnitude of the ketosis
responsevarybased ondifferentintensitiesofinterventions?Additionally,
AImodelsincludingdigitaltwinscouldbeleveragedto(1)identifyglucose
patterns associated with the onset of ketosis during health interventions
and (2) simulate the relationship between health regimen, metabolic
ﬂexibility trends, and long-term health outcomes. It is important to note
that the proposed digital twin approach is not merely a recapitulation of
biological processes for observational or fundamental studies; it has the
potential to inform the development of proactive, pre-emptive interven-
tions tailored to steer each individual’s metabolic health in a more
favorable direction. Furthermore, this participatory health approach
empowers people to actively take ownership of learning how to improve
their health experientially and ethically, fostering both personal respon-
sibility and informed decision-making in their health journeys. Lastly, it is
essential to consider broader factors within the healthcare ecosystem,
including accessibility, nutrition education, health disparities, and sex
differences. Public health initiatives, in conjunction with the emergence of
digital health technologies, may help address the aforementioned chal-
lenges and accelerate the path toward metabolic health optimization and
healthy aging.
