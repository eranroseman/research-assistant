## Abstract
Understanding barriers to digital health adoption among elderly populations is crucial for equitable healthcare delivery. This mixed-methods study combines survey data from 2,500 adults aged 65+ with qualitative interviews from 150 participants. Key barriers identified include technological literacy (67%), privacy concerns (54%), lack of perceived benefit (43%), and physical/cognitive limitations (38%). Facilitators included family support, simplified interfaces, and integration with existing care.
