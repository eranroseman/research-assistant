## Abstract
Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have emerged as a promising approach for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention and management. The proliferation of smartphones and wearable devices enables convenient access to health monitoring tools, educational resources, and communication with healthcare providers. mHealth interventions encompass mobile apps, wearables, and telehealth services that empower users to monitor vital signs, adhere to medication, and adopt healthier lifestyles. Their effectiveness hinges on user engagement, leveraging behavioral science principles and gamification strategies. While mHealth offers advantages such as personalized support and increased reach, it faces challenges pertaining to data privacy, security concerns, and resistance from healthcare providers. Robust encryption and adherence to regulations like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are crucial for safeguarding sensitive health data. Integrating mHealth into clinical workflows can enhance healthcare delivery, but organizational adjustments are necessary. The future of mHealth is closely intertwined with artificial intelligence (AI), enabling remote monitoring, predictive algorithms, and data-driven insights. Tech giants are incorporating advanced health-tracking capabilities into their devices, paving the way for personalized wellness approaches. However, mHealth grapples with ethical dilemmas surrounding data ownership, privacy breaches, and inadvertent data capture. Despite its potential, mHealth necessitates a concerted effort to overcome obstacles and ensure ethical, secure, and practical implementation. Addressing technical challenges, fostering standardization, and promoting equitable access are pivotal for unlocking the transformative impact of mHealth on cardiovascular health and reducing the global burden of CVD.
