## Abstract
Randomized clinical trials (RCTs) often suffer from a lack of representation from historically marginalized populations, and it is uncertain whether virtual RCTs (vRCTs) enhance representativeness or if elements of their consent and enrollment processes may instead contribute to underrepresentation of these groups. In this study, we aimed to identify disparities in enrollment demographics in a vRCT, the BE ACTIVE study, which recruited patients within a single health system. We discovered that the proportions of eligible patients who were randomized differed significantly by gender and race/ethnicity (men 1.2%, women 2.0%, P < .001; White 1.8%, Black 1.3%, Hispanic 0.7%, Asian 0.9%; P < .001), and compared with White patients, non-White patients were less likely to have a valid email address on file and were less likely to click on the email link to the study webpage and begin enrollment.
