## Abstract
Abstract
            
              Background
              State-of-the-art behavioral weight loss treatment (SBT) can lead to clinically meaningful weight loss, but only 30–60% achieve this goal. Developing adaptive interventions that change based on individual progress could increase the number of people who benefit.
            
            
              Purpose
              Conduct a Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) to determine the optimal time to identify SBT suboptimal responders and whether it is better to switch to portion-controlled meals (PCM) or acceptance-based treatment (ABT).
            
            
              Method
              The BestFIT trial enrolled 468 adults with obesity who started SBT and were randomized to treatment response assessment at Session 3 (Early TRA) or 7 (Late TRA). Suboptimal responders were re-randomized to PCM or ABT. Responders continued SBT. Primary outcomes were weight change at 6 and 18 months.
            
            
              Results
              PCM participants lost more weight at 6 months (−18.4 lbs, 95% CI −20.5, −16.2) than ABT participants (−15.7 lbs, 95% CI: −18.0, −13.4), but this difference was not statistically significant (−2.7 lbs, 95% CI: −5.8, 0.5, p = .09). PCM and ABT participant 18 month weight loss did not differ. Early and Late TRA participants had similar weight losses (p = .96), however, Early TRA PCM participants lost more weight than Late TRA PCM participants (p = .03).
            
            
              Conclusions
              Results suggest adaptive intervention sequences that warrant further research (e.g., identify suboptimal responders at Session 3, use PCMs as second-stage treatment). Utilizing the SMART methodology to develop an adaptive weight loss intervention that would outperform gold standard SBT in a randomized controlled trial is an important next step, but may require additional optimization work.
