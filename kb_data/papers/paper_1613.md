## Abstract
Introduction: Postpartum weight management is difﬁcult for many mothers due to the demands of parenthood. Women have highlighted a need for support but experience barriers to engaging with lifestyle interventions hence more adaptable approaches are required. This work examined participants’ engagement with a 12-month, theory-based, automated, text message (SMS) delivered, intervention supporting postpartum weight management.
