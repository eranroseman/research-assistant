## Abstract
Abstract                                 Background                  Since HIV has evolved into a lifelong but manageable condition, improving the quality of life (QoL) of persons living with HIV (PLWHs) has become increasingly important. Living with HIV is life-altering and poses substantial challenges for both PLWHs and their partners, so identifying how HIV serodiscordant couples cope with HIV together is crucial. Here, Bodenmannâ€™s Systemic Transaction Model highlights common dyadic coping (CDC), which refers to both partners working together to alleviate the negative effects of stress.                                                Purpose                  We examined the mediating role of CDC in linking we-disease appraisal with relationship satisfaction and QoL.                                                Methods                  We recruited a convenience sample of 231 HIV serodiscordant couples via local grassroots organizations between June and October 2022. Participants completed measures of we-disease appraisal, CDC, relationship satisfaction, and QoL. We examined the mediation effect of CDC on the association between we-disease appraisal and outcomes using the common fate mediation model.                                                Results                  The mean age of PLWHs was 32.18 years (standard deviation = 8.61 years), and that of their partners was 32.55 years (standard deviation = 9.24 years). The average time since HIV diagnosis was 4.18 years. Most couples were same-sex male couples. We found that CDC mediated the effect of we-disease appraisal on relationship satisfaction. Moreover, CDC significantly mediated the effect of we-disease appraisal on the QoL of PLWHs and their partners.                                                Conclusions                  Our findings highlight the importance of CDC in dyadic illness management among Chinese HIV serodiscordant couples.
