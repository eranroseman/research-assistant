## Abstract
AbstractBackgroundOne of the most common problems encountered in transplant patients is nonadherence with immunosuppressive drugs, one of the most important reasons for graft rejection.ObjectiveThe study aimed to assess the impact of text message reminders on medication adherence among kidney transplant recipients.DesignA randomized controlled trial.ParticipantsThe study was conducted from January to October 2021. This study included a total of 100 patients receiving a kidney transplant, 50 in the intervention group and 50 in the control group.MeasurementsPatients in the intervention group were sent text message reminders four times a day during the 6th–9th months after transplantation. Control patients received no such intervention. Tacrolimus concentrations in the bloodstream were monitored for all participants through measurements taken at Months 7, 8 and 9. Data collection tools included Sociodemographic Form and Immunosuppressive Medication Adherence Scale.ResultsPatients were homogeneously distributed among the groups. Sending daily text message reminders to transplant recipients caused an independent positive effect on medication adherence scale scores at the end of the study. Mean pretest medication adherence score of all patients was 45.18 ± 4.22 and posttest score was 47.4 ± 3.6. The intervention group exhibited a significantly higher mean posttest adherence score compared to controls, with values of 48.68 ± 2.58 and 45.62 ± 4.42, respectively (p < 0.001). Findings demonstrated a substantial improvement in the final medication adherence scores of transplant patients when they received daily Short Message Service reminders, acting as an independent factor (β = 0.356, p < 0.001).ConclusionSending text message reminders to kidney transplant recipients is a statistically and clinically effective intervention to improve immunosuppressive medication adherence.
