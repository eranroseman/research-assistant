## Abstract
Background: The delivery channels and approaches related to cardiac rehabilitation (CR), such as eHealth, mHealth, and telehealth, are evolving. Several studies have identified their effects on patients with coronary heart disease, although no studies have focused on all the approaches collectively. Methods: Randomized controlled trials have investigated lipid profiles, through systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and body mass index (BMI). Stata software was used for analysis, while Egger’s linear regression test and Begg’s funnel plot were also applied. Results: Technology-based home CR revealed significantly lower total cholesterol (TC) levels (standardized mean difference (SMD) = –0.19; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [–0.27, –0.11]); triglyceride (TG) levels (SMD = –0.26; 95% CI: [–0.35, 0.17]); low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels (SMD = –0.18; 95% CI: [ –0.25, –0.11]); SBP (SMD = –0.26; 95% CI: [–0.33, –0.19]); DBP (SMD = –0.24; 95% CI: [–0.32, –0.16]); BMI (SMD = –0.12; 95% CI: [–0.18, –0.05]), and improved high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (SMD = 0.22; 95% CI: [0.14, 0.31]). Conclusions: Technology-based home CR can be used to lower TC, TG, and LDL levels, alongside the BMI, SBP, and DBP indexes, while also raising HDL levels; thus, its use should be widely promoted.
