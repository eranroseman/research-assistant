## Abstract
We investigated the acceptability of bodyweight resistance exercise breaks (REB) to disrupt prolonged sedentary behavior in the workplace. Twenty-nine individuals completed a REB, where they performed 3-min REB 4, 8, and 16 times on days 1–2, 3–4, and 5 of the workweek, respectively, and a control condition (i.e., SIT). Productivity was assessed on days 1 and 5 each week. The acceptability of each REB frequency was assessed. When asked to complete 4, 8, and 16 REB, participants completed (mean values) 3.2, 6.2, and 9.2 REB/day, respectively. Moreover, 88%, 40%, and 9% of participants expressed that the 4-, 8-, and 16-REB frequencies were acceptable, respectively. Decision-making ability and concentration levels increased from day 1–5 of the REB week (p=0.048) but were stable during SIT. REB (4/day) are highly acceptable and could be a promising intervention strategy for reducing occupational sitting, thus decreasing sedentary-behavior-induced risk.
