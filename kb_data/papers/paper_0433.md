## Abstract
Background
              Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), marked by dyspnea, cough, and sputum production, significantly impairs patients’ quality of life and functionality. Effective management strategies, particularly those empowering patients to manage their condition, are essential to reduce this burden and health care use. Digital health interventions—such as mobile apps for symptom tracking, wearable sensors for vital sign monitoring, and web-based pulmonary rehabilitation programs—can enhance self-efficacy and promote greater patient engagement. By improving self-management skills, these interventions also help alleviate pressure on health care systems.
            
            
              Objective
              This systematic review and meta-analysis assesses the clinical effectiveness of smartphone apps, wearable monitors, and web-delivered platforms in four COPD management areas: (1) quality of life (measured by the COPD Assessment Test [CAT] and St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire), (2) self-efficacy (assessed by the General Self-Efficacy Scale), (3) functional capacity (evaluated via the 6-minute walk test and Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale), and (4) health care use (indicated by hospital and emergency department visits).
            
            
              Methods
              A systematic review was conducted using predefined search terms in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science up to January 26, 2025, to identify randomized trials on digital health interventions for COPD. Two reviewers independently screened studies and extracted data. Outcomes included quality of life, self-efficacy, functional status, and health care use.
            
            
              Results
              This review included 17 studies with 2027 participants from 11 countries. Eleven trials involved health care professionals in digital platform use, and 12 reported adherence strategies. Digital tools for COPD primarily focused on telerehabilitation (eg, video-guided exercises) and self-management systems (eg, artificial intelligence–driven exacerbation alerts). The study participants were predominantly older adults. Meta-analysis results indicated that digital health interventions significantly improved quality of life at 3 months on the CAT (mean difference [MD] −1.65, 95% CI –3.17 to –0.14; P=.03); at 6 months on the CAT (MD −2.43, 95% CI −3.93 to −0.94; P=.001) and St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (MD 3.25, 95% CI 0.69-5.81; P=.01); at 12 months on the CAT (MD −2.53, 95% CI −3.91 to −1.16; P<.001), EQ-5D (MD 0.04, 95% CI 0.01-0.07; P=.02), and EQ-5D visual analogue scale (MD 5.88, 95% CI 0.38-11.37; P=.04); the General Self-Efficacy Scale at 3 months (MD 1.65, 95% CI 0.62-2.69; P=.002) and 6 months (MD 1.94, 95% CI 0.83-3.05; P<.001); and the Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale at more than 3 months (MD −0.23, 95% CI −0.36 to −0.11; P=.003). However, no significant differences were observed in the 6-minute walk test, emergency department admissions, hospital admissions, emergency department admissions for COPD, or hospital admissions for COPD.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Our findings suggest that digital health interventions may benefit COPD patients, but their clinical effectiveness remains uncertain. Further robust studies are needed, particularly those involving larger numbers of older adults with COPD.
