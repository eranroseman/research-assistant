## Abstract
Abstract
            The health care industry is currently going through a transformation due to the integration of technologies and the shift toward value-based health care (VBHC). This article explores how digital health solutions play a role in advancing VBHC, highlighting both the challenges and opportunities associated with adopting these technologies. Digital health, which includes mobile health, wearable devices, telehealth, and personalized medicine, shows promise in improving diagnostic accuracy, treatment options, and overall health outcomes. The article delves into the concept of transformation in health care by emphasizing its potential to reform care delivery through data communication, patient engagement, and operational efficiency. Moreover, it examines the principles of VBHC, with a focus on patient outcomes, and emphasizes how digital platforms play a role in treatment among tertiary hospitals by using patient-reported outcome measures. The article discusses challenges that come with implementing VBHC, such as stakeholder engagement and standardization of patient-reported outcome measures. It also highlights the role played by health innovators in facilitating the transition toward VBHC models. Through real-life case examples, this article illustrates how digital platforms have had an impact on efficiencies, patient outcomes, and empowerment. In conclusion, it envisions directions for solutions in VBHC by emphasizing the need for interoperability, standardization, and collaborative efforts among stakeholders to fully realize the potential of digital transformation in health care. This research highlights the impact of digital health in creating a health care system that focuses on providing high-quality, efficient, and patient-centered care.
