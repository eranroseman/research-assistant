## Abstract
Lay Summary
            Even though there have been numerous advances in medicine and technology in the past few decades, the length and quality of life vary significantly based on a personâ€™s race, ethnicity, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability status, geographic residence, and/or socioeconomic status. In fact, membership in one or more marginalized sociodemographic groups is particularly associated with worse healthcare access and health outcomes. Behavioral medicine is uniquely equipped to advance health equity through inclusive and innovative research and practice and exerted influence on policies and practices that contribute to health disparities.
