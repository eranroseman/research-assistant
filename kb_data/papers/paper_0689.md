## Abstract
Abstract
            
              Background and aims
              Among adolescents, risk preference and deviant behaviors are associated with marijuana use, which exhibit substantial historical trends. We examined (1) trends, (2) effect modification by sex and age, (3) associations of marijuana use with deviant behaviors and risk preferences and (4) differences by sex, age and year.
            
            
              Design
              Adjusted logistic and relative risk regression models, using data from the 2002–14 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, annual cross‐sectional surveys of US households.
            
            
              Setting
              United States.
            
            
              Participants
              
                A nationally representative sample of adolescents aged 12–17 years (
                n
                 = 230 452).
              
            
            
              Measurements
              We estimated associations between past‐year marijuana use [self‐reported using computer‐assisted personal interviewing/audio computer‐assisted self‐interviewing (CAPI/ACASI)], deviant behavior (i.e. selling drugs; stealing; attacking someone) and risk preference (i.e. getting a kick; testing oneself).
            
            
              Findings
              Marijuana use, deviant behaviors and risk preferences declined among adolescents from 2002 to 2014. There were no significant sex or age differences in the decline of marijuana use over time. There were sex [sold drugs: β = 0.90, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 0.75, 1.04] and age (attacked someone: β = 0.32, 95% CI = 0.22, 0.42) differences in the prevalence of deviant behaviors, and trends over time differed by sex and age for attacking someone.
            
            
              Conclusions
              While marijuana use, deviant behavior and risk preferences among US adolescents declined from 2002 to 2014, associations have remained stable, with marijuana use positively associated with deviant behaviors and risk preferences.
