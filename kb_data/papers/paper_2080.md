## Abstract
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) is a prevalent, chronic, and impairing mental health disorder of childhood. Decades of empirical research has established a strong evidence-based intervention armamentarium for ADHD; however, limitations exist in regards to efficacy and effectiveness of these interventions. We provide an overview of select evidence-based interventions for children and adolescents, highlighting potential approaches to further improving the efficacy and effectiveness of these interventions. We conclude with broader recommendations for interventions, including considerations to moderators and under-explored intervention target areas as well as avenues to improve access and availability of evidence-based interventions through leveraging underutilized workforces and leveraging technology.
