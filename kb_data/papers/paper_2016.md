## Abstract
People often do not receive the engagement or responses they desire when they share on broad social media platforms. Sharers are hesitant to share trivial accomplishments, and the emphasis on data often results posts that audiences find repetitive or unengaging. Ephemeral social media's focus on self-authored content and sharing trivial accomplishments has the potential to ameliorate these challenges. We explore design principles for incorporating personal informatics data like steps, heart rate, or duration in data-driven stickers as a first step towards integrating these data into ephemeral social media. We examine the effect of a sticker's presentation style, domain, domain-relevance, and background through three surveys with 506 total participants. We uncover the importance of domain-relevant backgrounds and stickers, identify the situational value of stickers styled as analogies, embellished, and badges, and demonstrate that data-driven stickers can make ephemeral content more informative and entertaining, discussing implications for platforms and tools.
