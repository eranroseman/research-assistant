## Abstract
Abstract                      Background            Health professionals face significant psychological burdens including burnout, anxiety, and depression. These can negatively impact their well-being and patient care. Traditional psychological health interventions often encounter limitations such as a lack of accessibility and privacy. Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are being explored as potential solutions to these challenges, offering available and immediate support. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically evaluate the characteristics and effectiveness of AI chatbots designed specifically for health professionals.                                Objective            This scoping review aims to evaluate the existing literature on the use of AI chatbots for psychological health support among health professionals.                                Methods            Following Arksey and O’Malley’s framework, a comprehensive literature search was conducted across eight databases, covering studies published before 2024, including backward and forward citation tracking and manual searching from the included studies. Studies were screened for relevance based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, among 2465 studies retrieved, 10 studies met the criteria for review.                                Results            Among the 10 studies, six chatbots were delivered via mobile platforms, and four via web-based platforms, all enabling one-on-one interactions. Natural language processing algorithms were used in six studies and cognitive behavioral therapy techniques were applied to psychological health in four studies. Usability was evaluated in six studies through participant feedback and engagement metrics. Improvements in anxiety, depression, and burnout were observed in four studies, although one reported an increase in depressive symptoms.                                Conclusions            AI chatbots show potential tools to support the psychological health of health professionals by offering personalized and accessible interventions. Nonetheless, further research is required to establish standardized protocols and validate the effectiveness of these interventions. Future studies should focus on refining chatbot designs and assessing their impact on diverse health professionals.
