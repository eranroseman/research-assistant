## Abstract
The aim of this paper is to share knowledge and experiences of a professional lifetime in the field of Biomedical and Health Informatics (BMHI), almost from the time of the initiation of the domain until today. The achievements and the milestones reached are not personal, but they just indicate the progress of the field as it was experienced by the observer. The challenges are still there waiting to be tackled for the benefit of healthcare. The paper is based on a systematic review of the authorâ€™s published contributions across the professional timeline. For organizing the presentation of the results, the timeline is subdivided into five phases. In the discussion an aggregation of the achievements, milestones, and the challenges is presented.
