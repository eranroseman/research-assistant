## Abstract
This paper presents an analytics platform that has been developed for designers and teachers who build and use interactive e-books for learning. The analytics dashboard aims to increase awareness of the use of the e-books so that designers (and teachers in their role as designers) can make informed decisions on how to redesign and improve them taking into account both the overall learning design and the data from their usage. This paper presents architectural and design decisions on key features of the dashboard, and the evaluation of a high-fidelity prototype. We discuss findings related to use of the dashboard for exploratory data analysis and inquiry and how these generalise and can be taken into account by our future work or that of others.
