## Abstract
The evaluation of digital health services is concerned with assessing user satisfaction, improving the quality of health services and drawing useful conclusions regarding the factors that affect citizensâ€™ acceptance and intention to use digital health services. This paper proposes a model for evaluating a health digital service, that of, the Personal Health Insurance Record (PHIR), delivered by the Greek Organization for the Health Care Provision. The proposed model is based on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), enhanced with two additional factors: a) user satisfaction and b) safety-privacy. The analysis of the results highlighted that the intention to use is significantly affected by perceived usefulness, perceived ease of use, user satisfaction and safety-privacy. Parameters such as age and familiarity with the use of e-services also seem to determine the intention to use.
