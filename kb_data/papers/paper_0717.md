## Abstract
Abstract
            
              Background and Objectives
              Significant societal and technological changes in the 2010s called for an up-to-date understanding of the digital divide among older adults in the United States. This trend study aimed to examine the effects of race/ethnicity and the intersecting effects of race/ethnicity with other marginalized identities related to gender, income, education, and occupation on the first- and second-level digital divide.
            
            
              Research Design and Methods
              Utilizing a nationally representative sample of older community dwellers from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, we conducted weighted logistic regressions at 3 time points (2011/2013, 2015, and 2019). The first-level digital divide was measured by access to working phones or computers/laptops; the second-level divide was measured by 7 activities in personal task, social, and health-related Internet use.
            
            
              Results
              The first-level racial/ethnic digital divide became nonsignificant in 2019, whereas the disparities in all second-level measures persisted. The intersecting effects of race/ethnicity with low education and/or low income became nonsignificant in 2019 for personal-task use. However, the interactions with low education and/or low income became significant for social and health-related use in 2015 and/or 2019.
            
            
              Discussion and Implications
              This study highlights the persistence of the second-level racial/ethnic digital divide among older community dwellers in the United States, especially the exacerbated social and health-related digital divide for people of color with low socioeconomic status. By considering intersections of marginalized social identities, policymakers and stakeholders should develop targeted strategies to bridge the digital divide, promote health outcomes, and reduce health disparities.
