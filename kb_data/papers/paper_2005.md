## Abstract
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) can be prevented and treated through effective care, reducing exacerbations and hospitalizations. Early identification of individuals at high risk of COPD exacerbation is an opportunity for preventive measures. However, many patients struggle to follow their treatment plans because of a lack of knowledge about the disease, limited access to resources, and insufficient clinical support. The growth of digital health-which encompasses advancements in health information technology, artificial intelligence, telehealth, the Internet of Things, mobile health, wearable technology, and digital therapeutics-offers opportunities for improving the early diagnosis and management of COPD. This study reviewed the field of digital health in terms of COPD. The findings showed that despite significant advances in digital health, there are still obstacles impeding its effectiveness. Finally, we highlighted some of the major challenges and possibilities for developing and integrating digital health in COPD management.
