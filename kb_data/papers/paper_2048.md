## Abstract
Osteoporosis and osteopenia prevailed in postmenopausal women and predisposed to osteoporotic fractures that increase mortality, morbidity, and the cost of social care. Here, we investigated the effect of 24 weeks of aerobic dancing on the bone miner density, physical ﬁtness and health-related quality of life (HRQoL) in postmenopausal women with osteopenia. Total 80 participants (control [CON]: 40; exercise [EX]: 40) were included in the ﬁnal analysis. The EX group underwent a 24-week aerobic dance intervention. Bone mineral density (BMD), physical ﬁtness, and SF-36 questionnaire were assessed at baseline and 24-weeks. The BMD change in the femoral neck at the 24-weeks were signiﬁcantly different between the 2 groups (CON: 1.3 ± 2.7%, EX: 3.1 ± 4.6%, P = .001). Grip strength, sidestep and physical functional domain of HRQoL in the EX group were signiﬁcantly improved compared to the CON. The results were suggested 24-week aerobic dance intervention could result in the lower the incidence of bone fracture through increasing BMD and decreasing fall risk for postmenopausal women.
