## Abstract
Background: Late morbidity after childhood cancer may be mitigated by healthy lifestyle behaviors. We piloted a game-based, parent–child digital intervention to increase activity in sedentary survivors.
Methods: Survivors aged 10–16 treated with cardiotoxic therapy and not meeting US physical activity guidelines were enrolled in a single-arm study with a parent. Following a 14-day run-in, participants chose a prespecified step goal and wore an accelerometer daily for 24 weeks (12-week game-based intervention; 12-week follow-up). Participants completed the Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM) at 24 weeks; a subset of dyads completed qualitative interviews.
Results: Among 129 eligible survivors, 27 enrolled (20.9% participation rate) with a parent. Four dyads were removed during the 14-day run-in period due to noncompliance. Among the 23 dyads who continued to the study, the tracker was worn for 95% of days during the 12-week intervention (95% confidence interval [CI]: 94–96) and 81% during the 12-week follow-up (95% CI: 79–82). Overall, the prespecified step goal was met for 64% (95% CI: 63–66) of days during the intervention and 37% (95% CI: 35–38) during the follow-up. At the end of study, 17/23 dyads responded to AIM; 82% of survivors and 94% of parents reported the intervention as acceptable. During qualitative interviews (n = 5), dyads noted that they liked the accountability of the “buddy system,” but would have liked more personalized goal-setting.
Conclusions: Despite high ratings of acceptability among participants, difficulties with sustained adherence and retention were encountered in this parent–child gamification intervention. Alternate, tailored designs should be considered in the future.
