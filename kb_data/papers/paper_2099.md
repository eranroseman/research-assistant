## Abstract
Growing life expectancy poses important societal challenges, placing an increasing burden on ever more strained health systems. Digital technologies offer tremendous potential for shifting from traditional medical routines to remote medicine and transforming our ability to manage health and independence in aging populations. In this Perspective, we summarize the current progress toward, and challenges and future opportunities of, harnessing digital technologies for effective geriatric care. Special attention is given to the role of wearables in assisting older adults to monitor their health and maintain independence at home. Challenges to the widespread future use of digital technologies in this population will be discussed, along with a vision for how such technologies will shape the future of healthy aging.
