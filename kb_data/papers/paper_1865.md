Abstract
            
              Background
              Weight management interventions can be extended using mobile telephone technology to deliver support in real‐time, real‐world settings. The present study aimed to determine whether text messaging helped patients maintain or lose weight following a weight‐loss programme.

              Results
              
                Compared to control (

                P 
                =
                 
                0.006; −2.2 versus 1.5 cm,

                –2
                ,
                P 
                =
                 
                0.03, respectively). QOL and depression scores also improved (−6.8 versus 1 point,
                P 
                =
                 
                0.134; −0.2 versus 0.2 points,

                =
                 
                0.228). No difference was observed in anxiety scores between the groups. Intervention versus control group follow‐up attendance improved significantly (4.4 versus 1.7 attendances,
                P

              Conclusions
              
                LEAP B
                eep promoted losses in weight,
                WC
                and
                BMI
                , and improved
                QOL
                parameters and follow‐up attendance. Text messaging is a cheap, portable, convenient and innovative medium facilitating goal setting, self‐monitoring and information exchange. Further improvements to automation at the same time as maintaining individual support are necessary to ease practitioner burden. Text messaging offers cost‐efficient dietetic input, opening up possibilities for practitioner‐to‐patient support and yields positive weight outcomes following initial weight loss.
