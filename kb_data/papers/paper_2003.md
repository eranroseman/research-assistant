## Abstract
Background: Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) is highly prevalent in China, affecting over 114 million people. While mHealth interventions have shown promise, there is limited research on T2DM management apps in real-world app stores.
Objective: This study aimed to systematically search and analyze T2DM care mobile apps in the Chinese market, describing their features, and functions, and evaluating the quality of the most popular apps using validated tools.
Methods: We conducted a comprehensive search in Chinese Android and iOS app stores for T2DM management apps. We downloaded 138 eligible ones for a general review of their key features and function. We also assessed the quality of the top 20 apps from both platforms using the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) by both researcher and patient.
Results: A total of 3524 apps were searched. 138 eligible apps were downloaded for general review and 29 popular apps were included for quality assessment. Most apps were designed for patient users (87.0 %) and developed by commercial companies (85.5 %). Common functions included blood glucose monitoring, diabetes education, integration with measuring devices, medication adherence reminders, teleconsultation services, and diabetes risk factor tracking. The researcherâ€™s evaluation yielded an average MARS score of 4.0 out of 5 for popular apps, with subscale scores of functionalities (4.5), aesthetics (4.1), engagement (3.7), and information (3.6). However, patient ratings were lower in functionality (3.5), aesthetics (3.4), and engagement (2.6), and the patient faced difficulties with information-related items. Similar trends were observed in subject quality items.
Conclusion: App developers should engage caregivers, and family members as target users, and involve government agencies as partners to improve T2DM management apps. Future apps should incorporate scientifically proven advanced functions to enhance their effectiveness. The quality assessment highlighted weaknesses in engagement and information and the importance of user-centric approaches in app development.
