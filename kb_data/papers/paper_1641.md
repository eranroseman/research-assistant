## Abstract
Introduction: Parents of children in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) experience substantial stress; a parent’s perception of their child’s illness severity, more than objective measures, predicts psychological outcomes. No tools exist to assess parents’ real-time experiences. This pilot study evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a text-based tool to measure parental experience.
Methods: Inclusion criteria included PICU stay >48 h, physician approval, smartphone access, and English-speaking caregiver. Eligible parents received a text-based baseline survey and surveys every other day while hospitalized regarding their mood/experiences and optional open-ended questions regarding stressors. They received post-discharge follow-up surveys at 1 week and 1, 3, and 6 months. Follow-up surveys assessed mood and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. Interviews and surveys about the interface were conducted 1 week and 3 months following discharge. Feasibility was assessed by descriptive statistics (eg, response rates), and acceptability was assessed by descriptive statistics (survey results) and thematic analyses of interviews.
Results: Of 20 enrolled participants, the ﬁrst 5 were excluded due to technical issues. Of the 15 included, results demonstrated feasibility and acceptability. Most participants (86%) completed all surveys during the PICU stay and continued to complete surveys at a high rate: 79%–94% 3 months post-discharge. All participants agreed that the system was easy to use and were satisﬁed with the system at discharge, and 91% remained satisﬁed 3 months post-discharge. Additionally, 76% reported comfort, and 69% reported beneﬁt. From the interviews, participants lauded the system’s convenience and applicability of content. Some proposed changes to improve ergonomics. Many suggested this interface could help teams better support families.
Conclusions: A text-based interface for measuring experience in the PICU is feasible and acceptable to parents. Further research can explore how this could identify parents most at risk of adverse psychological sequelae and lead to earlier supportive interventions.
