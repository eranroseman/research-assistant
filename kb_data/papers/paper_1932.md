## Abstract
Methods: Analysis of data from a pilot randomised controlled trial of a healthy lifestyle program for women with recent GDM. Intervention subjects received text messages providing motivation, reminders, information and feedback as well as an activity monitor. This sub-study examined step count in the 4 h after receipt of a text message, compared to the same time of day on other days among intervention subjects.
Results: Data from 7326 days where step counts were recorded, from 31 women were analysed. The median steps in the 4 h following a text message was 1237 (IQR 18–2240) and it was 1063 (IQR 0–2038) over the same time period on comparison days where there was no message (p < 0.001). The effect was similar whether the messages pertained to physical activity or not. There was no attenuation of the response over 36–38 weeks.
Conclusions: Women with recent GDM increase their step count in the hours following positive and supportive text messages. This suggests that text messaging programs can facilitate healthy lifestyle and diabetes prevention in this population.
