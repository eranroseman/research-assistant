## Abstract
AbstractMobile health (mHealth) interventions may enhance positive health behaviors, but randomized trials evaluating their efficacy are uncommon. Our goal was to determine if a mHealth intervention augmented and extended benefits of center-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) for physical activity levels at 6-months. We delivered a randomized clinical trial to low and moderate risk patients with a compatible smartphone enrolled in CR at two health systems. All participants received a compatible smartwatch and usual CR care. Intervention participants received a mHealth intervention that included a just-in-time-adaptive intervention (JITAI) as text messages. The primary outcome was change in remote 6-minute walk distance at 6-months stratified by device type. Here we report the results for 220 participants enrolled in the study (mean [SD]: age 59.6 [10.6] years; 67 [30.5%] women). For our primary outcome at 6 months, there is no significant difference in the change in 6 min walk distance across smartwatch types (Intervention versus control: +31.1 meters Apple Watch, −7.4 meters Fitbit; p = 0.28). Secondary outcomes show no difference in mean step counts between the first and final weeks of the study, but a change in 6 min walk distance at 3 months for Fitbit users. Amongst patients enrolled in center-based CR, a mHealth intervention did not improve 6-month outcomes but suggested differences at 3 months in some users.
