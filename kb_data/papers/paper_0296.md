## Abstract
Abstract
            Interest in just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAI) has rapidly increased in recent years. One core challenge for JITAI is the efficient and precise measurement of tailoring variables that are used to inform the timing of momentary intervention delivery. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is often used for this purpose, even though EMA in its traditional form was not designed specifically to facilitate momentary interventions. In this article, we introduce just-in-time adaptive EMA (JITA-EMA) as a strategy to reduce participant response burden and decrease measurement error when EMA is used as a tailoring variable in JITAI. JITA-EMA builds on computerized adaptive testing methods developed for purposes of classification (computerized classification testing, CCT), and applies them to the classification of momentary states within individuals. The goal of JITA-EMA is to administer a small and informative selection of EMA questions needed to accurately classify an individualâ€™s current state at each measurement occasion. After illustrating the basic components of JITA-EMA (adaptively choosing the initial and subsequent items to administer, adaptively stopping item administration, accommodating dynamically tailored classification cutoffs), we present two simulation studies that explored the performance of JITA-EMA, using the example of momentary fatigue states. Compared with conventional EMA item selection methods that administered a fixed set of questions at each moment, JITA-EMA yielded more accurate momentary classification with fewer questions administered. Our results suggest that JITA-EMA has the potential to enhance some approaches to mobile health interventions by facilitating efficient and precise identification of momentary states that may inform intervention tailoring.
