## Abstract
We describe the design, implementation and evaluation of a novel multi-agent scenario generation framework for interactive virtual reality simulations towards preventive medicine education. Our scenario generation framework is based on recordings of human movements from a distributed sensor networks deployed in a real-world physical setting. The components of our framework include the generation of unique virtual agent behaviors from the sensor data, and algorithms for the generation of low level or gross movement behaviors such as path determination, directional traffic flows, collision avoidance and overtaking. The framework also includes the generation of high level fine actions for multi-agents such as techniques for interactive activities in pedagogical scenarios based on environment and temporal triggers. We applied our multi-agent scenario generation framework in an interactive simulation for hand hygiene education, and conduct an initial usability study to assess the educational benefits of the simulation to nursing students and evaluated the performance characteristics of our framework. Results of our quantitative and qualitative evaluations suggest that our framework was robust in creating engaging, compelling, and realistic interactive training scenarios with multiple virtual agents in simulated hospital situations.
