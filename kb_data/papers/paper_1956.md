## Abstract
Continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring is of great significance for the real-time monitoring and early prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Recently, wearable BP monitoring devices have made great progress in the development of daily BP monitoring because they adapt to long-term and high-comfort wear requirements. However, the research and development of wearable continuous BP monitoring devices still face great challenges such as obvious motion noise and slow dynamic response speeds. The pulse wave transit time method which is combined with photoplethysmography (PPG) waves and electrocardiogram (ECG) waves for continuous BP monitoring has received wide attention due to its advantages in terms of excellent dynamic response characteristics and high accuracy. Here, we review the recent state-of-art wearable continuous BP monitoring devices and related technology based on the pulse wave transit time; their measuring principles, design methods, preparation processes, and properties are analyzed in detail. In addition, the potential development directions and challenges of wearable continuous BP monitoring devices based on the pulse wave transit time method are discussed.
