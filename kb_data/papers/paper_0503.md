## Abstract
Gestational diabetes (GDM) is associated with a long-term risk of diabetes. We aimed to determine whether a text-messaging-based lifestyle support program would improve diabetes risk factors following GDM. Women with GDM were randomised following delivery to receive four text messages per week supporting a healthy lifestyle and parenting for 6 months, with feedback from an activity monitor (intervention), or to receive the activity monitor only (control). The primary outcome was a composite of weight, physical activity and dietary goals. There were 177 women randomised, with 88 intervention and 89 control participants. All the participants experienced COVID-19 lockdowns during the study. Six-month primary outcome data were obtained for 57 intervention participants and 56 controls. There were 7/57 (12%) intervention and 6/56 (11%) control participants who met the primary outcome (relative risk, 1.08; 95%CI, 0.63–1.85; p = 0.79). Two intervention participants met the dietary goals compared to none of the control participants (p = NS). The intervention participants were more likely to record >1000 steps/day (on 102 ± 59 vs. 81 ± 59 days, p = 0.03). When analysed monthly, this was not initially different but became significant 3–6 months post-partum. Interviews and surveys indicated that with the Intervention, healthier choices were made, but these were negatively impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. Participants found the messages motivational (74%) and the activity monitor useful (71%). In conclusion, no improvement in the diabetes risk factors occurred among the women receiving the text messaging intervention when affected by COVID-19 restrictions.
