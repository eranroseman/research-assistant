## Abstract
“Digital Hypertension” is a new research field proposed by the Japanese Society of Hypertension that integrates digital technology into hypertension management and proactively promotes research activities. This novel approach includes the development of new technologies for better BP management, such as sensors for detecting environmental factors that affect BP, information processing, and machine learning. To facilitate “Digital Hypertension,” a more sophisticated BP monitoring system capable of measuring an individual’s BP more frequently in various situations would be required. With the use of these technologies, hypertension management could shift from the current “dots” management based on office BP readings during clinic visits to a “line” management system based on seamless home BP or individual BP data taken by a wearable BP monitoring device.
