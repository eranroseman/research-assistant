## Abstract
Cloud computing is a technological service that has become a trend. This paradigm adds many beneÔ¨Åts to storage of personal health records (PHR) and electronic health records (EHR), such as availability and on-demand provisioning. It also facilitates sharing of health records among doctors, family members, friends and clinicians in general. However, this technology increases the risk of leaking sensitive health data. Aiming at mitigating this problem, we present here a new architecture that takes advantage of identity federation for secure storage and sharing of PHR and EHR in the cloud environment.
