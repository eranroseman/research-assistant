## Abstract
Introduction: Innovative health promotion strategies are crucial for enhancing global quality of life and curbing premature deaths. Digital health promotion is particularly impactful for young individuals often using internet-connected devices. Collaborative methodologies in digital intervention research offer insights into supporting youth during key life stages, such as adolescence. This review sought to examine the literature on digital health interventions for youth co-designed via participatory frameworks.
Methods: Following the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual and an adapted Arksey & O’Malley’s 6-stage framework, this review utilised the PRISMA-ScR checklist for structured reporting. Peer-reviewed research where young individuals (15–35 years) contributed to digital health intervention design was analysed. Systematic synthesis adhered to Braun & Clarke’s Thematic Analysis Guidelines, mapping data to research queries and thematic framework.
Results: Eighteen articles were systematically synthesised, revealing seven main themes: digital tool, inquiry ﬁeld, report aim, participatory activities, intervention attributes and behavioural change support. Seventeen distinctive digital health interventions were assessed, mostly within risk mitigation and mental health domains. Predominantly, interventions were web-based, with mental wellness websites emerging as the prevalent tool. User experience testing stood out as the primary reported outcome.
Conclusion: Several innovative digital health interventions targeting youth have been identiﬁed. Platforms including social media, specialised apps, websites and video games are instrumental for health advice and clinical support dissemination, overcoming access and cost barriers. Participatory techniques are integral for the efﬁcacy of digital health resources, encompassing youth aspirations and anticipations. Continued efforts will enrich comprehension of optimal practices in digital health promotion and intervention formulation.
