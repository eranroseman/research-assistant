## Abstract
Abstract
            
              Background
              Evidence supporting physical activity for older adults is strongly positive. Implementation and scale-up of these interventions need to consider the value for money. This scoping review aimed to assess the volume of (i) systematic review evidence regarding economic evaluations of physical activity interventions, and (ii) of cost utility analysis (CUA) studies (trial- or model-based) of physical activity interventions for older people.
            
            
              Methods
              We searched five databases (January 2010 to February 2022) for systematic reviews of economic evaluations, and two databases (1976 to February 2022) for CUA studies of physical activity interventions for any population of people aged 60+ years.
            
            
              Results
              We found 12 potential reviews, two of which were eligible for inclusion. The remaining 10 reviews included eligible individual studies that were included in this review. All individual studies from the 12 reviews (n = 37) investigated the cost-effectiveness of structured exercise and most showed the intervention was more costly but more effective than no intervention. We identified 27 CUA studies: two investigated a physical activity promotion program and the remainder investigated structured exercise. Most interventions (86%) were more costly but more effective, and the remaining were cost-saving compared to no intervention.
            
            
              Conclusions
              There is a scarcity of reviews investigating the value for money of physical activity interventions for older adults. Most studies investigated structured exercise. Physical activity interventions were generally more effective than no intervention but more costly. As such an intervention could be cost-effective and therefore worthy of wider implementation, but there is a need for more frequent economic evaluation in this field.
