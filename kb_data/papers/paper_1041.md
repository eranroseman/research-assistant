## Abstract
Abstract          Mobile health (mHealth) with continuous real-time monitoring is leading the era of digital medical convergence. Wearable devices and smartphones optimized as personalized health management platforms enable disease prediction, prevention, diagnosis, and even treatment. Ubiquitous and accessible medical services offered through mHealth strengthen universal health coverage to facilitate service use without discrimination. This viewpoint investigates the latest trends in mHealth technology, which are comprehensive in terms of form factors and detection targets according to body attachment location and type. Insights and breakthroughs from the perspective of mHealth sensing through a new form factor and sensor-integrated display overcome the problems of existing mHealth by proposing a solution of smartphonization of wearable devices and the wearable deviceization of smartphones. This approach maximizes the infinite potential of stagnant mHealth technology and will present a new milestone leading to the popularization of mHealth. In the postpandemic era, innovative mHealth solutions through the smartphonization of wearable devices and the wearable deviceization of smartphones could become the standard for a new paradigm in the field of digital medicine.
