## Abstract
Despite the significant advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, the burden of hypertension remains a major global health care concern. In Japan, estimates show that more than two-thirds of the population have uncontrolled hypertension, regardless of whether they were taking antihypertensive medication. To improve hypertension management, hypertension guidelines have been developed and updated regularly by hypertension societies across various countries and regions. The Japanese Society of Hypertension (JSH) updated the Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension in 2019 (JSH 2019). The JSH 2019 aims to establish a standard management strategy for hypertension and provide evidence to all health care providers. One of its updated main features is its proposal for multidisciplinary team-based care (TBC) involving physicians, pharmacists, nurses, dietitians, and other health care providers. The TBC will help initiate and intensify the management of hypertension, as well as combat clinical inertia, which is expected to contribute to uncontrolled blood pressure and subsequent development of cardiovascular diseases. This is consistent with the recommendations from recent major guidelines on hypertension management. Moreover, to reduce the evidenceâ€“practice gap in hypertension management, it is essential to disseminate the essence of the guidelines and provide hypertension education programs for all health care providers and patients. This review summarizes the points of the JSH 2019-based strategy for improving hypertension management and discusses guidelines for its implementation into actual clinical practice.
