## Abstract
Background Hypertension is a major contributor to cardiovascular diseases globally. Pharmacists can help patients with hypertension to reduce blood pressure (BP) with telemedicine technology. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a new pharmacist-led telemedicine disease management model based on mobile application for elderly hypertensive patients.Methods Elderly patients aged 60&amp;ndash;85 years old, diagnosed with hypertension, and taking at least five medications were enrolled in a pharmacist-led telemedicine disease management program for six months, during which patient transmitted BP and blood glucose (BG) to pharmacist via a new telemedicine system, and pharmacists provided interventions such as monitoring indicators, medication therapy management (MTM), medication consultation, and measured HbA1c and blood lipid of patients every three months. If necessary, pharmacists also communicated with community physicians about patients&amp;rsquo; medications adjustment plan.Results After the six-month intervention, systolic blood pressure (132.30&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;9.88 vs 134.54&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;15.59, p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.013), LDL-C (1.85&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;0.77 vs 2.09&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;0.85, p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.001), and HbA1c (6.59&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;0.98 vs 6.91&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;1.17, p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.009) showed significant reductions in all patients. Moreover, BP control rates (80% vs 63%, p&amp;thinsp;&amp;lt;&amp;thinsp;0.001) and LDL-C control rates (82% vs 71%,p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.002) showed significant improvements, comparing against the baseline. 99.3% patients selected 5 points for satisfaction scores.Conclusions This study showed that disease management for elderly patients provided via telemedicine by pharmacists could effectively improve patients&amp;rsquo; clinical outcomes such as BP, BG, and blood lipids, and all patients were satisfied with this new telemedicine disease management model. The pharmacist-led telemedicine disease management for elderly patients is feasible.Trial registration: ChiCTR, ChiCTR2000033095.Registered on 20 May 2020.
