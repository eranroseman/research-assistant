## Abstract
Background: Despite the well-documented adverse outcomes associated with obesity during pregnancy, this condition remains a promising modiﬁable risk factor.
Objectives: The aim of this study was to ascertain the most effective treatment modalities for gestational weight gain (GWG) in pregnant women classiﬁed as overweight or obese.
Methods: A systematic search was conducted across 4 electronic databases: Embase, EBSCOhost, PubMed, and Web of Science. To assess the quality of evidence, the Conﬁdence In Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) approach, grounded in the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework, was employed. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted to synthesize the comparative effectiveness of treatment modalities based on GWG outcomes.
Results: The analysis incorporated 60 randomized controlled trials, encompassing 16,615 participants. Modes of intervention administration were classiﬁed as remote (R: eHealth [e] and mHealth [m]), in-person (I), and a combination of both (IþR). The interventions comprised 5 categories: education (E), physical activity (PA), dietary (D), behavior modiﬁcation (B), and combinations thereof. The quality of the evidence, as evaluated by CINeMA, ranged from very low to high. Compared to the control group, the I-D intervention (mean difference [MD]: 1.27; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI]: 2.23, 0.32), I-PADB (MD: 0.60, 95% CI: 1.19, 0.00), and I-B (MD: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.10) interventions showed signiﬁcant efﬁcacy in reducing GWG.
Conclusions: Preliminary ﬁndings suggest that the I-D intervention is the most efﬁcacious in managing GWG among pregnant women who are overweight or obese, followed by I-PADB and I-BþR-B(m) treatments. These conclusions are drawn from evidence of limited quality and directness, including insufﬁcient data on PA components used in the interventions. Owing to the absence of robust, direct evidence delineating signiﬁcant differences among various GWG management strategies, it is tentatively proposed that the I-D intervention is likely the most effective approach.
