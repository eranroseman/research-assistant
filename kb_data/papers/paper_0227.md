## Abstract
Introduction
              Dynamic Bayesian networks improve the modeling of complex systems by incorporating continuous probabilistic relationships between covariates that change over time. This study aimed to analyze the complex causal links contributing to child undernutrition using dynamic Bayesian network modeling, examining both the best- and worst-case scenarios. The Young Cohort of the Ethiopian Young Lives dataset from 2002–2016 was used to analyze the complex relationships among various covariates influencing child undernutrition. We used a built-in Bayes server tool to identify potential features, followed by building the structure of the directed acyclic graph using a structural learning algorithm. The maximum posterior is determined using the relevance tree algorithm. The node with the highest values of mutual information and target entropy reduction, along with the lowest value of target entropy, was considered to have the strongest predictive power in the dataset.
            
            
              Results
              This study revealed that long-term participation in programs increased the likelihood of children being in a normal nutritional state. Key factors influencing the nutritional status of children under two years of age include the mother’s education level, her subjective well-being, and the household’s wealth quintile. Children with educated parents were more likely to have a healthy nutritional status. Additionally, the causal pathway of intervention programs → wealth quintile → child nutritional status consistently exceeded 90% in Waves 3, 4, and 5, indicating a strong relationship. Similarly, the relationship between intervention programs → food security → child nutritional status was nearly perfect at 99.99% in Waves 4 and 5, indicating a strong association. Finally, the study revealed that household participation in intervention programs significantly reduces undernutrition in best-case scenarios, while the absence of support poses a higher risk in worst-case conditions.
            
            
              Conclusion
              The comprehensive intervention program strongly improved household wealth, food security, and maternal well-being, which in turn affected children’s nutritional status.
