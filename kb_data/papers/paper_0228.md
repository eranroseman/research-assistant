## Abstract
Background
              Despite the increasing popularity of mHealth, little evidence indicates that they can improve health outcomes. Mobile health interventions (mHealth) have been shown as an attractive approach for health-care systems with limited resources. To determine whether mHealth would reduce blood pressure, promote weight loss, and improve hypertension compliance, self-efficacy and life quality in individuals with hypertension living in low-resource rural settings in Hubei, China.
            
            
              Methods
              In this parallel-group, randomized controlled trial, we recruited individuals from health-care centers, home visits, and community centers in low-resource rural settings in Hubei, China. Of 200 participants who were screened, 148 completed consent, met inclusion criteria, and were randomly assigned in a ratio of 1:1 to control or intervention. Intervention group participants were instructed to use the Monitoring Wearable Device and download a Smartphone Application, which includes reminder alerts, adherence reports, medical instruction and optional family support. Changes in the index of Cardiovascular health risk factors from baseline to end of follow-up. Secondary outcomes were change in hypertension compliance, self-efficacy and life quality at 12 weeks.
            
            
              Results
              
                Participants (
                n
                = 134; 66 in the intervention group and 68 controls) had a mean age of 61.73 years, 61.94% were male. After 12 weeks, the mean (SD) systolic blood pressure decreased by 8.52 (19.73) mm Hg in the intervention group and by 1.25 (12.47) mm Hg in the control group (between-group difference, −7.265 mm Hg; 95% CI, −12.89 to −1.64 mm Hg;
                P
                = 0.012), While, there was no difference in the change in diastolic blood pressure between the two groups (between-group difference, −0.41 mm Hg; 95% CI, −3.56 to 2.74 mm Hg;
                P
                = 0.797). After 12 weeks of follow-up, the mean (SD) hypertension compliance increased by 7.35 (7.31) in the intervention group and by 3.01 (4.92) in the control group (between-group difference, 4.334; 95% CI, 2.21 to −6.46;
                P
                &lt; 0.01), the mean (SD) hypertension compliance increased by 12.89 (11.95) in the intervention group and by 5.43 (10.54) in the control group (between-group difference, 7.47; 95% CI, 3.62 to 11.31;
                P
                &lt; 0.01), the mean (SD) physical health increased by 12.21 (10.77) in the intervention group and by 1.54 (7.18) in the control group (between-group difference, 10.66; 95% CI, 7.54–13.78;
                P
                &lt; 0.01), the mean (SD) mental health increased by 13.17 (9.25) in the intervention group and by 2.55 (5.99) in the control group (between-group difference, 10.93; 95% CI, 7.74 to 14.12;
                P
                &lt; 0.01).
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Among participants with uncontrolled hypertension, individuals randomized to use a monitoring wearable device with a smartphone application had a significant improvement in self-reported hypertension compliance, self-efficacy, life quality, weight loss and diastolic blood pressure, but no change in systolic blood pressure compared with controls.
