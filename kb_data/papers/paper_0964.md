## Abstract
Abstract
            
              As an emerging trend in big data science, applications based on
              the Quantified-Self (QS)
              engage individuals in the self-tracking of any kind of biological, physical, behavioral, or environmental information as individuals or groups. There are new needs and opportunities for recommender systems to develop new models/approaches to support QS application users.
              Recommender systems
              can help to more easily identify relevant artifacts for users and thus improve user experiences. Currently recommender systems are widely and effectively used in the e-commerce domain (e.g., online music services, online bookstores). Next-generation QS applications could include more recommender tools for assisting the users of QS systems based on their personal self-tracking data streams from wearable electronics, biosensors, mobile phones, genomic data, and cloud-based services. In this paper, we propose three new recommendation approaches for QS applications:
              Virtual Coach
              ,
              Virtual Nurse
              , and
              Virtual Sleep Regulator
              which help QS users to improve their health conditions.
              Virtual Coach
              works like a real fitness coach to recommend personalized work-out plans whereas
              Virtual Nurse
              considers the medical history and health targets of a user to recommend a suitable physical activity plan.
              Virtual Sleep Regulator
              is specifically designed for insomnia (a kind of sleep disorder) patients to improve their sleep quality with the help of recommended physical activity and sleep plans. We explain how these proposed recommender technologies can be applied on the basis of the collected QS data to create qualitative recommendations for user needs. We present example recommendation results of
              Virtual Sleep Regulator
              on the basis of the dataset from a real world QS application.
