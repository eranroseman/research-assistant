## Abstract
Abstract        Background Adherence to complex drug regimens and polypharmacy are among the challenges of old age, which may negatively affect their motivation to continue drug therapy or lead to incorrect drug administration. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of using a drug management application on drug adherence and outcomes in polypharmacy older adults.Methods In this randomized clinical trial study conducted in 2022, 192 Iranian older adults with polypharmacy were selected according to the inclusion criteria and allocated to case and control groups using the block randomization method. The data collection tools included a demographic questionnaire, drug outcome questionnaire, and Morisky Medication Adherence Scale. The intervention was done using a drug management application for 8 weeks. The collected data were entered into the SPSS software version 22 and analyzed using descriptive (frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation) and inferential (Chi-square, Fisher’s exact test, independent t-test) statistics.Results The case and control groups were homogeneous in terms of demographic variables and drug adherence level before the intervention. A significant difference was found in the drug adherence level after using the app (p < 0.001). Moreover, a significant difference was found in drug outcomes, including re-hospitalization due to disease aggravation, re-hospitalization due to medication error, falling, hypo or hypertension, and hypo or hyperglycemia, and medication use accuracy between the groups after the intervention (p < 0.05).Conclusion The results showed that using a drug management application that meets the specifications of older adults can improve drug adherence and reduce the adverse outcomes of drug use.
