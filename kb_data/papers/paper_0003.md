Introduction
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a chronic metabolic disorder
primarily characterized by persistent hyperglycemia due to
insulin resistance or inadequate insulin secretion [1]. The
International Diabetes Federation [2] reported that the global
prevalence of diabetes reached 533 million cases in 2022, with
projections indicating a surge to 783 million by 2045, of which
over 90% are expected to be T2DM cases [3]. This condition
often manifests insidiously, progressing over an extended period,
with chronic hyperglycemia as its hallmark clinical feature [4].
Poorly controlled blood glucose levels over time can inflict
severe damage on vital organs and tissues, including the heart,
brain, and kidneys [5], leading to debilitating complications
that significantly compromise patients’ health and quality of
life [6].
T2DM is a lifelong condition, and short-term treatment is
insufficient to achieve effective blood sugar control. Patients
require lifelong management and a long-term, standardized
approach to home care [7,8]. International scholars universally
agree on the importance of home management for individuals
with T2DM [9]. Research by Yan et al [10] has highlighted the
high demand among patients with diabetes for home blood
glucose monitoring, a finding consistent with the observations
by Simsek et al [11] regarding chronic disease management in
older adult populations. An increasing number of patients now
seek personalized, home-based guidance from health care
professionals (HCPs), underscoring the pivotal role of the home
environment in diabetes rehabilitation [12,13]. Moreover, studies
demonstrate that home blood glucose self-monitoring effectively
improves glycemic control and reduces the risk of long-term
complications [14].
Traditionally, home blood glucose management has relied on
clinician-led, face-to-face consultations. However, such offline
consultations are time-consuming for HCPs and impose
economic burdens on patients. In addition, these short-term
interactions often fail to adequately support patients’long-term
self-management efforts, rendering them less effective [15].
Mobile internet technology has brought about a revolution in
diabetes management by introducing digital platforms designed
for home-based patients with T2DM. Digital diabetes
management entails using advanced tools to gather
self-monitoring of blood glucose (SMBG) data, which is
subsequently sent to HCPs for analysis and feedback. This
technology simplifies blood glucose monitoring and boosts
patient-provider communication [16]. Research indicates that
it allows HCPs to assess data in real time, reducing the necessity
for outpatient visits and easing the burden on both health care
facilities and patients [17].
Despite its benefits, the manual entry of SMBG data during
home care remains time-intensive, particularly for older adult
patients, and is prone to errors, including transcription
inaccuracies or intentional misreporting [18,19]. In addition,
HCPs often face challenges in interpreting SMBG data to
identify lifestyle or treatment issues. Recent advancements in
SMBG devices now allow automatic uploads of blood glucose
measurements to secure digital health applications accessible
to HCPs [20-22]. Real-time monitoring of this data enables
timely interventions when abnormal readings are detected,
thereby facilitating more accurate management of hypoglycemia
or hyperglycemia. Furthermore, this technology supports
long-term diabetes care by informing adjustments to insulin,
diet, and exercise regimens [23].
Currently, no meta-analysis has systematically assessed the
effectiveness of digital SMBG-based diabetes management
technologies. Evaluating the impact of these technologies on
blood glucose control in home settings is essential for
understanding their utility in managing T2DM. This study aims
to synthesize global research findings through meta-analysis,
examining the effects of digital SMBG-based diabetes
management on glycemic control in home-based patients with
T2DM. The results are intended to provide evidence to support
the broader application of digital SMBG technologies in home
care environments.
Methods
Overview
This review followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items
for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines
published in 2020 [24], and a search protocol retrospectively
registered on July 5, 2024 on PROSPERO (CRD42024560431)
formed the basis of the review process.
Search Strategy
We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, Cochrane
Library, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, Wanfang,
and the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database using the terms
“Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2,” “Internet,” and “RCT” from
inception until December 25, 2023. The search strategy used
Boolean logic to combine medical subject headings and text
word searches. We also screened references from relevant
previous systematic reviews as additional sources, and the
languages were limited to Chinese and English. The complete
search strategy can be found in Multimedia Appendix 1.
Eligibility Criteria
Inclusion criteria were formulated based on the populations,
interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS)
framework:
1.
Populations: Participants with T2DM
2.
Interventions: Patients used a digital blood glucose
management system that allowed for the automatic upload
of SMBG data from home to a secure platform via
Bluetooth or other wireless technologies, and HCPs
provided timely and responsive personalized guidance
3.
Comparisons: Traditional home blood glucose monitoring
methods (including routine outpatient follow-up, blood
glucose monitoring logs, etc)
4.
Outcomes: Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), fasting blood glucose
(FBG), 2-hour postprandial blood glucose (PBG), and BMI.
HbA1c is the gold standard for long-term blood glucose
control, reflecting the average blood glucose levels over
the past 2 to 3 months. FBG can present information on
blood glucose in the fasting state, which helps to understand

basic glucose metabolism. Measuring the PBG can evaluate
the body’s ability to handle the glucose load after a meal
and provide insights into the PBG regulation. BMI is a
practical tool for assessing overall body fat, which is
associated with health risks caused by obesity and metabolic
disorders, and the included studies reported at least one of
these findings.
5.
Study design: Randomized controlled trials
Exclusion criteria included (1) studies involving patients with
gestational diabetes or type 1 diabetes, (2) review or discussion
papers, and (3) studies with insufficient data.
Study Selection
Two reviewers (YX and NX) independently performed the
screening and selection of studies. Disagreements were resolved
through discussion or consultation with a third reviewer (ZW).
First, we imported the retrieved literature into the NoteExpress
software (Beijing Aiqinhai Software Company) and used it to
identify and remove duplicate literature. Then, we evaluated
whether the titles and abstracts were eligible. In addition, clearly
incompatible studies were excluded after screening the titles
and abstracts. Finally, full texts of qualified studies that strictly
adhered to the inclusion and exclusion criteria [25] were
screened to determine their final eligibility for the review.
Data Extraction
Data extraction from the studies included was performed by 2
independent reviewers. Characteristics of the studies (author,
year, country, and sample size) and intervention characteristics
(equipment used by the intervention, intervening measures,
control measures, duration, and outcomes) were included.
Risk-of-Bias Assessment
The quality of the included studies was assessed using the
Cochrane risk-of-bias tool, administered by 2 independent
assessors. This tool evaluates the quality of study methodology
across seven core dimensions: (1) the process of randomization
sequence generation, (2) the concealment of allocation, (3)
blinding of participants and researchers, (4) blinding during
outcome assessment, (5) completeness of outcome data and
handling of missing data, (6) selective reporting of study results,
and (7) the potential for other sources of bias. The risk of bias
for each domain was categorized into 3 levels: low, unclear, or
high. Disagreements between the assessors were resolved
through discussion, or, if necessary, consultation with a senior
reviewer (ZW).
Data Analysis
The meta-analysis was conducted using RevMan 5.3 [26], a
desktop version of Review Manager software used for Cochrane
intervention and flexible reviews. For continuous outcomes, we
calculated the mean difference (MD) as a metric; while for
dichotomous variables, the risk ratio was used and visualized
by forest plots. In each analysis, I2 was used to measure
statistical heterogeneity among studies. According to the values
of P and I2, the fixed-effect model (P>.10, I2<50%) or
random-effects model (0<P<.10, I2≥50%) were selected [27].
Results
Results of Literature Search
A total of 5177 papers were retrieved from 7 databases. After
removing 3460 duplicate records, 1360 articles were deleted
due to unqualified titles and abstracts. A more detailed full-text
screening was conducted on the remaining 357 articles, and 345
of them were excluded for not meeting the established criteria.
As a result, the final systematic review included 12
meta-analysis studies [28-39]. The detailed research screening
process and results are shown in Figure 1.

Study Characteristics
The research includes trials conducted in 5 countries: China
[28-34,36], the United States [35], India [37], the United
Kingdom [38], and Italy [39]. These trials were published
between 2015 and 2023. The sample size ranged from 64 to
285 participants, and the intervention duration varied from 1 to
12 months. Among the 12 studies, 6 used Bluetooth technology
to achieve automatic upload of blood glucose values
[28,29,32,34,38,39], one study adopted an implantable blood
glucose sensor for automatic data transmission [33], and another
5 studies used local area network technology to automatically
upload blood glucose measurement values [30,31,35-37].
Multimedia Appendix 2 [28-39] presents the author, year,
country, sample size, equipment used by the intervention,
intervening measure, control measure, duration, and outcomes.
Risk of Bias
Based on the Cochrane criteria, a risk-of-bias assessment is
presented in Figures 2 and 3 [28-39]. A total of 12 studies were
included, all of which were assigned a literature quality grade
of B [28-39]. Randomized methods were reported in detail in
9 (75%) of the 12 studies [28-30,34-39]. The remaining 3 studies
did not provide detailed randomization methods. In terms of
allocation concealment, 5 studies explicitly mentioned the
methods used [30,32,35-37]. In all studies, participants were
not blinded due to the specificity of the intervention method.

Results of the Meta-Analysis
Effects on HbA1c
Twelve studies reported the effectiveness of digital diabetes
management in improving HbA1c [28-39]. The meta-analysis
results showed a significant improvement in HbA1c (n=1669;
MD −0.52%, 95% CI −0.63 to −0.42; z value 9.67, P<.001;
I²=34%; fixed-effects model) compared to the control group
(refer to Figure 4 [28-39]).

Effects on FBG
Seven studies were reported on FBG [28-34]. The results
indicated that participants in the intervention group experienced
a significantly greater reduction in FBG compared to the control
group (n=839; MD −0.42, 95% CI −0.65 to −0.19 mmol/L; z
value 3.59; P<.001; I²=5%; fixed-effects model; refer to Figure

Effects on PBG
Five studies reported on PBG [29-33]. The results showed that
participants in the intervention group had a significantly greater
reduction in PBG compared to the control group (n=540; MD
−0.64, 95% CI −0.97 to −0.32 mmol/L; z value=3.92; P<.001;
I²=46%; fixed-effects model; refer to Figure 6 [29-33]).
Figure 6. Forest plot of 2-hour postprandial blood glucose.
Effects on BMI
Six studies reported on the effectiveness of digital diabetes
management in improving BMI [28-33]. The meta-analysis
results showed a significant improvement in BMI (n=720; MD
−1.55, 95% CI −2.92 to −0.17 kg/m2; z value=2.20; P=.03, I²=
93%; random-effects model) compared to the control group
(refer to Figure 7 [28-33]). Due to high heterogeneity, 3 studies
were identified as contributing to the variability, as revealed by
sensitivity analysis [29-31]. After removing these 3 studies, the
heterogeneity was reduced to 0% (MD −2.16, 95% CI −2.55 to
−1.76 kg/m2; z value=10.70; P<.001).

Publication Bias and Sensitivity Analyses
Most of the points in the distribution of HbA1c, an outcome
measure, were clustered within the funnel plot; however, the
distribution was not entirely symmetrical, suggesting the
possibility of publication bias in the results for HbA1c in digital
diabetes management (refer to Figure 8). We also performed a
sensitivity analysis to assess how the results varied when
individual studies were excluded and to evaluate the stability
of the findings. When we removed a study from the model and
recalculated the pooled estimates for the remaining studies,
heterogeneity either disappeared or decreased, and the pooled
results remained consistent, indicating the robustness of our
findings.

Discussion
Principal Findings
This meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of digital diabetes
management technology based on digital SMBG for home-based
patients with T2DM. The findings demonstrated significant
improvements in HbA1c, FBG, PBG, and BMI. Key features of
effective digital health interventions include frequent patient
engagement in SMBG and timely, personalized guidance
provided by specialized HCPs.
Studies have shown that while the compliance rate for blood
glucose control among patients with T2DM during
hospitalization can reach as high as 80%, this rate significantly
decreases by 25% to 30% once they are discharged and
transition to home self-management [40,41]. Consequently,
there is an urgent need to support home-based patients with
T2DM in managing blood glucose fluctuations [42]. This study
demonstrates that compared with traditional home blood glucose
management, digital diabetes management technologies can
significantly improve blood glucose levels in home-based
patients with T2DM. Twelve studies [28-39] reported
improvements in HbA1c levels among home-based patients with
T2DM following the use of digital diabetes management
technologies, 7 studies reported that digital diabetes management
technologies effectively improve FBG levels [28-34], and 5
studies examined the impact on PBG levels [29-33]. In
conclusion, digital diabetes management technologies play a
pivotal role in blood glucose management for home-based
patients with T2DM and should be widely implemented in
clinical practice. Ongoing focus on blood glucose monitoring
is essential for maintaining stable blood sugar levels in these
patients [43].
At the same time, the meta-analysis results of this study suggest
that digital diabetes management technologies can reduce the
BMI of home-based patients with T2DM, consistent with the
findings of a systematic review by Marcolino et al [44].
However, the heterogeneity in this study is relatively high.
Sensitivity analysis, conducted by excluding studies one at a
time, indicated that the variability may be due to differences in
intervention durations. Subgroup analysis based on intervention
duration showed that when the intervention lasted less than 3
months, it effectively improved BMI. In contrast, when the
intervention duration exceeded 6 months, no similar
improvement was observed. Given the relatively small sample
size, future large-scale, double-blind randomized controlled
trials are needed to further validate the impact of digital diabetes
management technologies on BMI.
With continuous innovation in sensor, microelectronics, and
data analysis technologies, researchers have been actively

investing in research and development. Meanwhile, the market’s
strong demand for convenient and efficient blood glucose
monitoring has spurred the rapid development of continuous
glucose monitoring (CGM) technology. Medical staff assist
patients in accessing blood glucose data via supporting mobile
apps to formulate treatment plans. CGM technology offers
continuous, dynamic blood glucose data, enabling a
comprehensive grasp of blood glucose fluctuations, allowing
timely detection of asymptomatic hypoglycemia and
hyperglycemia, and contributing to optimized treatment plans
and prevention of diabetes complications.
Nonetheless, CGM technology has limitations. Its equipment
is costly, making long-term use unaffordable for some patients.
In addition, frequent blood glucose checks may cause
psychological stress in some, negatively affecting blood glucose
control. Therefore, SMBG continues to play an indispensable
role in diabetes management. SMBG offers patients immediate
blood glucose readings at specific time points, enabling prompt
adjustments to diet, exercise, or insulin dosage to maintain
glucose levels within a safe range and prevent hypoglycemia
or hyperglycemia. Furthermore, compared to CGM, SMBG
devices are simpler, more affordable, and thus more accessible
to a broader patient population, especially those with limited
financial resources or relatively stable glucose fluctuations.
SMBG also promotes active patient participation, increasing
their awareness of disease management and enabling them to
better understand the impact of daily factors on blood glucose
levels. This process fosters improved lifestyle adjustments,
enhances confidence in glucose control, and strengthens
compliance with self-management regimens.
Among the 12 included randomized controlled trials, only 2
studies evaluated the impact of SMBG frequency on blood
glucose levels [28,36], so a meta-analysis was not conducted.
Both studies demonstrated that more frequent home blood
glucose monitoring improved blood glucose control in
home-based patients with T2DM. We observed that the
frequency of SMBG in the intervention group was significantly
higher than in the control group, and the digital diabetes
management technology notably enhanced blood glucose
control. Tomah et al [45] reported that higher SMBG frequency
correlated with greater improvements in HbA1c, suggesting that
the frequency of measurements may directly influence clinically
relevant outcomes, with 4 to 8 measurements per day being the
most effective. Similarly, Mannucci et al [46] found that SMBG
was more effective when a structured monitoring plan was
implemented, and HCPs used the collected data. None of the
12 randomized controlled trials included in this study considered
the frequency of contact with HCPs as an outcome measure to
assess improvements in blood glucose levels. As a result, a
meta-analysis could not be conducted. However, an analysis of
the intervention strategies in these studies revealed that the
frequency of contact with HCPs was higher in the intervention
group than in the control group. In addition, a systematic review
found that SMBG without support from HCPs did not yield
significant clinical benefits [47]. This lack of benefit may be
attributed to treatment inertia, where poor adherence to lifestyle
changes and prescribed medications is common among patients
with T2DM [48,49]. When feedback from HCPs is minimal,
patients may feel anxious and uncertain when faced with poor
SMBG control. In conclusion, digital diabetes management
technologies, along with SMBG supported by HCPs, can
significantly improve blood glucose control in home-based
patients with T2DM.
This study advocates for the promotion of digital diabetes
management technologies based on digital SMBG for
home-based patients with T2DM. Such technologies can help
eliminate transcription errors associated with manual data entry
and offer increased convenience for patients, especially older
adult individuals with T2DM, who may struggle with inputting
blood glucose values due to poor vision or limited dexterity.
This technology provides an age-friendly solution for blood
glucose management. In addition, for older adult patients who
live alone or have limited mobility, HCPs can remotely monitor
blood glucose data, offer timely care, and quickly detect and
address hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. This improves the
continuity and responsiveness of diabetes management.
Furthermore, the use of digital devices in clinical practice can
reduce the workload of clinical nurses and enhance overall work
efficiency. Thus, it is recommended that this technology be
widely implemented in both home and clinical settings to
improve the safety and efficiency of diabetes management.
Comparison to Previous Work
The results of this meta-analysis align with those of previous
studies on the effectiveness of digital diabetes management
technology for improving blood glucose levels in home-based
patients with T2DM. However, in many previous studies, SMBG
devices required manual data entry for glucose measurements,
whereas this study focuses on digital SMBG technologies
capable of automatic data uploading [50-56]. To date, no other
meta-analysis has specifically evaluated the application of digital
diabetes management technology based on automatic SMBG
for home-based patients with T2DM.
In addition, the results of this study revealed that digital diabetes
management technology can significantly reduce BMI levels
in home-based patients with T2DM, consistent with the findings
of a systematic review by Marcolino et al [44]. However, several
other systematic reviews suggest that digital diabetes
management technology has no significant effect on BMI
improvement [57-59]. This discrepancy highlights the need for
future high-quality, large-sample studies to further investigate
the impact of digital diabetes management technology on BMI.
Such studies should explore potential differences in results due
to variations in patient populations, intervention measures, and
follow-up durations. Moreover, standardizing research
methodologies and evaluation criteria will enhance the
comparability and reliability of findings, providing a stronger
evidence base for determining whether this technology can
effectively improve BMI in patients with T2DM.
Strengths and Limitations
This systematic review and meta-analysis has several notable
strengths. First, to the best of our knowledge, it is the first
meta-analysis to evaluate digital diabetes management
techniques based on digital SMBG for improving blood glucose
levels and BMI in home-based patients with T2DM. Second, a

with strict adherence to established methodological tools to
ensure the reliability and transparency of the research process.
Third, this study included a detailed subgroup analysis of BMI
outcomes, confirming that the duration of intervention
significantly influences the effectiveness of digital diabetes
management technologies in home-based patients with T2DM.
Finally, by analyzing multiple outcome indicators, this review
provides a more comprehensive understanding of the role of
digital health in diabetes management, offering valuable
references for clinical practice.
We also acknowledge that this meta-analysis has some
limitations. First, confined to Chinese and English literature, it
excluded non–English and Chinese materials, failing to reflect
global research. Future reviews should cover more languages.
Second, most selected studies lack blinding details, risking
measurement biases. Future research must focus on blinded
outcome evaluation to minimize performance biases. Third, the
HbA1c funnel plot asymmetry indicates publication bias. Future
studies should use multicenter, large-sample, randomized
controlled trials for reliable results. Fourth, done over a year
ago, the study may miss recent research due to the field’s rapid
development, and lacking timeliness. Future research needs
constant updates. Fifth, 8 (67%) of the 12 studies were from
China, with regional limitations as China’s medical resources
and telemedicine acceptance differ from elsewhere. Future
studies should include more diverse regions to boost conclusion
generality.
Future Directions
Overall, future digital health research can fill the existing gaps
and improve the approach in 5 key areas. First, for the diabetes
management technology based on SMBG, continuous
exploration should be carried out on its advantages in blood
glucose control. In particular, the impact of SMBG supported
by HCPs on blood glucose should be assessed to tap more
potential. Second, the intervention measures should be
elaborated in detail so as to achieve the maximum degree of
reproducibility and universality in different clinical contexts.
Third, a comprehensive evaluation system will be constructed,
covering aspects such as cost-effectiveness, patient satisfaction,
and technology availability. This system is used to measure the
value of intervention measures for the sustainable development
of digital health in diabetes management. Fourth, researchers
should be encouraged to study the differences in the efficacy
of different population subgroups or provide patient-level data,
enabling future reviews to identify the patient characteristics
related to treatment outcomes. Fifth, researchers should actively
collect and report patients’ views on the intervention measures
to improve the design basis.
Conclusion
This meta-analysis demonstrates that digital diabetes
management technologies can effectively regulate blood glucose
levels, improve glucose metabolism, and reduce BMI in patients
with T2DM. However, due to the variation in intervention
strategies, frequencies, and content across the included studies,
future research should prioritize multicenter, large-sample,
high-quality randomized controlled trials to refine and
standardize these interventions. Notably, effective digital health
interventions share a common characteristic: frequent patient
engagement in SMBG, supported by HCPs who provide timely
and personalized guidance.
