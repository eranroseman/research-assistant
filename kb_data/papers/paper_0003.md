## Abstract
Abstract

              Long wait times, limited resources, and a lack of local options mean that many people with severe obesity cannot access treatment. Face-to-face group-based interventions have been found effective and can treat multiple people simultaneously, but are limited by service capacity. Digital group interventions could reduce wait times, but research on their effectiveness is limited. This systematic review aimed to examine the literature about online group-based interventions for adults with severe obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m
              2
              ). The review followed the PRISMA and PICOS frameworks. MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. Two authors independently screened articles. Data extraction, analysis, and quality assessment (using RoB2 and MMAT) was shared between two authors. A meta-analysis was conducted on eligible studies; other results were descriptively analysed. 20 papers reporting on 15 studies were included. Most studies reported some evidence of weight loss, but evidence of weight-related behaviour change was mixed. A meta-analysis on four studies indicated that online, group-based interventions had a statistically significant impact on weight loss (
              p
               = 0.001; 95% CI −0.69 to −0.17) with a small-to-moderate effect size, compared to waitlist or standard care conditions. Online interventions were considered more convenient but lack of familiarity with the group or counsellor, accessibility issues, and time constraints hindered engagement. Technical support, incentives, and interactive forums to improve group cohesion could mitigate these barriers. The findings suggested that online, group-based interventions are feasible and potentially beneficial, but barriers such as internet accessibility, digital literacy, and unfamiliarity with group members need to be mitigated. Key recommendations to improve experience and impact include providing instructions and run-throughs, building group cohesion, and providing session and additional content throughout the intervention. Future studies should focus on the influence of specific intervention characteristics and investigate the effect of these interventions compared to face-to-face interventions.

INTRODUCTION
Obesity is a signiﬁcant public health problem, which puts a major
burden on health services and limits access to treatment [1].
Obesity is strongly associated with a number of health conditions,
including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer, stroke, and
depression [1–3]. More severe obesity increases health risks,
making access to obesity treatment essential [4, 5]. Group-based
interventions, which can reduce the number of staff needed to
deliver interventions, can improve accessibility to services and
reduce weight times, and also provide opportunities for social
support and sharing of strategies [3, 6]. Delivering group-based
interventions digitally could improve their accessibility by redu-
cing barriers for patient attendance and healthcare delivery.
Previous research has examined online [7–11] and in-person
group-based weight management interventions [12–14] sepa-
rately, but there is a lack of synthesis of evidence of the impact of
integrating the two strategies. This review aims to address this
gap by providing a comprehensive review of the existing literature

on online, group-based interventions for people with severe
obesity.
The prevalence of obesity is increasing, particularly in the
American and European regions, with 60% of European citizens
reported to have obesity or overweight in 2022 [15]. In the
United Kingdom, over 25% of adults have clinical obesity [4, 5].
Over a third of people with obesity report never having accessed
any weight-management services and access to Tier 3 and
4 services - targeted for people with BMIs over 35 kg/m2 - can be
even more difﬁcult [16]. Lack of availability of services is an
issue, with over 40% of Clinical Commissioning Groups not
commissioning Tier 3 services, resulting in long waiting times
and a lack of local resources for people who need them [16, 17].
For instance, in one study, nearly 75% of people with BMIs
greater than 35 kg/m2 (and almost 60% of people with BMIs over
40 kg/m2) did not access any obesity services over a 7 year
period [18]. Obesity is strongly associated with a number of
noncommunicable health conditions (such as type 2 diabetes,
cardiovascular conditions, and cancer [1, 19, 20]), with 40% of
people with obesity having high or very high health risks, with
increased risk in women [5]. Behaviours associated with obesity,
such as an unhealthy diet and reduced physical activity, are
commonly known to link obesity with these conditions [21].
Behavioural weight management interventions can help address
some of the contributing factors for these conditions, and
accessing them in a timely manner is important to reduce the
risk of long-term complications [21, 22].
Delivering behavioural interventions in a group-based setting
can help improve availability of services by reducing the number
of staff needed to deliver interventions. When delivered face-to-
face, group-based interventions have generally been found to be
effective at supporting weight management [12, 13], potentially
even superior to individual interventions [23–25]. The challenge
with group-based interventions is that they can be difﬁcult to offer
and access in-person due to time, budget, travel, or facility
constraints. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, the use of digital
technology is becoming increasingly common in healthcare [26].
Evaluations of digital interventions for weight management have
yielded mixed results [7–11]; some research suggests that digital
interventions are more effective than no intervention, but less so
than face-to-face interventions [27].
Integrating digital and group-based approaches to weight
management interventions has the potential to further improve
access by reducing burden on services and wait times for patients.
Despite
this,
no
published
or
planned
systematic
reviews
(registered in PROSPERO) synthesising evidence around online,
group-based
interventions
were
identiﬁed
(detailed
in
our
published protocol [28]). This demonstrates a gap in the literature
and the need for a comprehensive overview of online, group-
based interventions for people with severe obesity. If group-based
interventions can be delivered to the same or better effect online,
this could enable more patients to access support in a more timely
manner. Examining how these interventions are being evaluated
and what evidence there is of their effectiveness at achieving
health and behavioural outcomes will inform future intervention
development and evaluation.
AIMS AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS
The primary aim of this review was to synthesise the available
evidence about the effectiveness and user perceptions of online,
group-based interventions for adults with severe obesity. Based
on the previous literature around group-based and digital
interventions, we hypothesised that online, group-based inter-
ventions would have the potential to be effective at supporting
weight management but that there may be barriers to sustained
engagement with them. To achieve this aim, the review was
centred on two research questions:
1. What methods of delivering online, group-based behaviour
change interventions for adults with severe obesity are the
most effective at establishing and maintaining positive
health behaviour changes and weight loss?
2. What are the perceptions of the acceptability, usability, and
overall user experience for different online, group-based
behaviour change interventions for adults with severe
obesity?
METHODS
Overview
The population, intervention, comparator, outcome, study type
(PICOS) framework was used to structure the scope of the review
[29] and the report adheres to the Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines [30].
The PRISMA checklist is included in Supplementary Table S1. The
methods are detailed in a previously published protocol [28].
Eligibility criteria
The PICOS framework (Table 1) was deﬁned based on the research
questions and used to structure the scope of the study and the
eligibility criteria.
Search strategy
The search was executed in ﬁve databases: MEDLINE, Embase,
CINAHL, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Central Register of
Controlled Trials (CENTRAL). We chose not to search grey literature
to ensure that the studies included had been peer-reviewed and
should be of reasonable quality. In a change to the protocol, the
databases ‘APA PsycINFO’ and ‘ProQuest Dissertations and Theses’
were not searched due to website unavailability. An initial review
of the literature was used to identify key terms and develop the
search strategy (detailed in the published protocol [28]). The
search string was based on three key themes joined with the
following structure: online (MeSH OR Keywords) AND group-based
(MeSH OR Keywords) AND severe obesity (MeSH OR Keywords).
The original search was conducted in March 2021, but the
screening and analysis of the results was delayed. To allow for this
delay, the searches were re-run in April 2022 and again in May
2024. See Supplementary Table S2 for a record of all of the
searches and results at all three time points.
Inclusion criteria
Studies that examined online, group-based interventions for
adults (18 years or older) with severe obesity were eligible for
inclusion; however, to ensure inclusion of all relevant studies,
those with participants below 18 years of age were included as
long as the means and standard deviations of ages of the study
samples indicated that a majority of participants were adults
(Box 1). The scope of this review was focused on people with
severe
obesity
because
of
the
evidence
of
their
greater
inaccessibility to services [16–18]. Severe obesity was deﬁned as
BMI ≥35 kg/m2; however, to ensure that relevant studies were not
excluded, study populations that included a range of BMIs
beyond the ≥35 kg/m2 limit were also included, if the mean BMI
at the start of the study was greater than or equal to 35 kg/m2.
“Group-based” interventions were deﬁned as interventions that
were primarily group-based (involving 3 or more participants),
although group interventions with some independent elements
were eligible for inclusion. Interventions were considered to be
‘online’
if
they
were
enabled
via
technology
to
connect
participants, whether or not they were ‘live’ (i.e. synchronous or
asynchronous).
A broad range of studies were eligible for inclusion, including
randomised controlled trials, quantitative, qualitative, cohort, and
case studies as long as they evaluated the intervention, with or

without a comparator, and reported outcomes. Outcomes could
include behaviours (such as eating, physical activity, etc.) or
anthropometric measures. Studies published in any year were
eligible for inclusion.
Exclusion criteria
Any studies that did not evaluate the intervention (e.g. protocols,
posters, conference abstracts, reports, or intervention descriptions)
were excluded; reviews were also excluded due to time and
resource restrictions. Studies examining child, parental, or family
interventions that focused primarily on childhood obesity outcomes
were also excluded, as were dietary or physical activity interventions
that had a primary purpose other than managing obesity (e.g.
supporting rehabilitation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
diabetes, etc.). Studies where the mean starting BMI of the sample
was <35 kg/m2 were also not eligible. Papers for which the full-texts
were not accessible were also excluded from this review.
Screening and article selection
All references were retrieved and stored in EndNote X9 for
duplicate removal and then uploaded into the Rayyan systematic
review software. Title and abstract screening and full-text screen-
ing was conducted independently by two authors against the
eligibility criteria, with disagreements resolved by consensus. The
updated search and screening in 2024 was conducted by one
author. The screening and selection process details were recorded
in a PRISMA ﬂow diagram.
Data extraction
Two independent reviewers extracted data from included studies
based on the predetermined data extraction form (Box 1) [28]. Any
disagreements were discussed and resolved by consensus. The
2024 update was conducted by one reviewer.
Quality appraisal and risk of bias assessment
Risk of bias was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration Risk
of Bias 2 (RoB 2) tool for randomised controlled trials [31, 32]. In
the protocol [28], we planned to use the Risk Of Bias In Non-
randomised Studies - of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool [33] for non-
randomised trials, but given the wide range of study methodol-
ogies included, the Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) was
used instead [34]. Quality appraisal and RoB assessments were
conducted by three authors.
Data analysis and synthesis
Study and intervention information was summarised in tables.
Descriptive analyses using counts and percentages were used to
quantitatively synthesise intervention outcomes. Narrative analysis
was used to synthesise qualitative data relating to acceptability,
usability, patient feedback, and factors inﬂuencing engagement. A
meta-analysis was conducted on eligible studies to assess the
impact of online, group-based interventions on the primary
outcome, weight change (in kg). The effect was estimated based
on change scores (from baseline to post-intervention). For studies
that reported weight at baseline and at post-intervention rather
than weight change over the intervention period, mean weight
change was calculated using subtraction and the standard
deviation (SD) was calculated using the formula: SDchange =
(SD2
baseline + SD2
ﬁnal −2*Corr*SDbaseline*SDﬁnal)^0.5 [35], assuming
Box 1.

Population
Adults (≥18 years) with severe obesity (BMI ≥35 kg/m2)
Intervention
Online, group-based interventions aiming to change obesity-related behaviours (physical activity and dietary behaviour)
Comparator
The review included studies with and without a comparator; there were no restrictions on the type of comparator, if studies
included one (e.g. face-to-face, phone, or other online group-based or individual interventions, waitlist control, etc.)
Outcomes
The primary outcome was the interventions' effectiveness at supporting behaviour change and weight loss. Secondary outcomes
included engagement, patient experience, and study and intervention characteristics.
Study types
To avoid excluding relevant studies and to capture the variety of outcomes we wanted to examine, any type of study evaluating
an online, group-based intervention for people with severe obesity was eligible (e.g. randomised controlled trials, quantitative,
qualitative, cohort, and case studies). Reviews, protocols, and papers that described interventions without evaluating them were
excluded.

a conservative value of 0.5 for the correlation coefﬁcient. A
random-effects model was used as heterogeneity was present and
statistical heterogeneity was measured via a Tau-squared test and
the I2 measure. Publication bias was assessed using the Egger’s
test [36]. Results were presented as a forest plot for weight
change. The meta-analysis was conducted using the IBM SPSS
Statistics software.
RESULTS
Included studies
From the initial two search rounds (March 2021 and April 2022),
3137 articles were retrieved from ﬁve databases. 1183 duplicates
were removed before screening using the EndNote X9 duplicate
removal feature. After title and abstract screening, 49 articles
remained. At this stage, full reports of trial registrations and
conference abstracts were sought. Six mapped to an identiﬁed
reference within the search results. Five were not associated with
a full published report. One was an ongoing trial, and one was a
duplicate. In total, 13 reports were not retrieved (Fig. 1) and 36 full
texts were screened, resulting in 17 included papers that
described 12 different studies. Four papers reported on one study
[37–40] and three papers on another [41–43]. The data was
separately extracted from each paper because many of the papers
had different numbers of participants (e.g. subgroup analyses).
The updated search in May 2024 identiﬁed 952 articles
published since the previous search (2022–2024). After duplicate
removal, the titles and abstracts of 635 references were screened.
Of these, 35 were selected for full-text review, 3 of which were
included, for a total of 20 papers describing 15 different studies.
Study characteristics
The study
characteristics of the 20 included
reports are
summarised in Table 2. Studies were conducted between 2005
and 2023 with total sample sizes ranging from 14 to 481. As
many of the studies were multi-arm trials, we have reported the
initial and analysed sample sizes for the online, group-based
intervention in addition to the total sample. Analysed sample
sizes for that condition speciﬁcally ranged from 11 to 418.
Almost all of the studies had sample populations that were
mostly female (the median was 90% female for the 17 papers or
82% for the 15 studies) and all but 3 studies had more female
participants than male (one of the studies had only male
participants as the target population was men [44]). Mean
BMIs at baseline were measured in clinic or using scales
provided to study participants and ranged from 35.2 kg/m2 to
49.2 kg/m2.
Of the various outcome measures reported, weight was the
most common, reported in all but 5 of the 20 papers and all but 3
of the 15 studies. Eight studies used other weight-related

measures, including BMI, waist to hip ratio, waist circumference,
and fat percentage [40, 44–50]. Other outcomes measured in the
studies included quality of life and mental health-related out-
comes (including depression, eating disorder, and late life
function)
[45–47,
49,
51],
participant
experience
regarding
acceptability and barriers [44, 45, 51–53], self-efﬁcacy [45, 49],
and engagement (including attendance, self-monitoring, and
completion) [39, 43, 44, 51, 54]. Several studies also measured
key obesity-related behaviours such as physical activity (which
also included changes in ability, such as the 30 s sit to stand test,
mobility, and walk and grip strength) [41–43, 47, 51, 52] and
dietary behaviours (such as adherence to a mediterranean diet
(PREDIMED scores), energy and macronutrient intake, diet quality,
and diet self-efﬁcacy) [42, 43, 46, 48, 50, 52]. Two studies also
collected biometric data, speciﬁcally blood pressure [44, 48], total
cholesterol [44], capillary fasting blood glucose, and venous
HbA1c [48], and another study examined the accuracy of
participants’ self-reported weight measurements [38]. The full

material
(Supplementary Table S3).
Intervention characteristics
The characteristics of the interventions are summarised in Table 3.
There was considerable heterogeneity in the reported character-
istics of these studies. There was a range in group sizes, from 3 to
43 participants, although most of the studies had group sizes of
less than 20 (9/15, with 4 studies not reporting group size). The
number of sessions provided also ranged widely, from 6 to 47.
Only 60% of the papers (12/20) reported session length, and these
ranged from 45–75 min. There was more similarity in the duration
of the intervention, with approximately half of them lasting for
6 months (8/15 studies). Of the remaining studies, 5 lasted for
3–4 months, 1 lasted for 12 months, and 2 lasted for 18 months.
Less than half of the studies (7/15) reported that their
interventions were based on any speciﬁc theory. Five of the
interventions used the Social Cognitive Theory [46, 47, 50, 51, 55].
Other theories used included the Self-Determination Theory
[44, 53], the technology acceptance model [51], problem-solving
and
relapse

Aim 1: Impact and effectiveness of interventions
The outcome measures and key ﬁndings of each of the included
studies are summarised in Table 4. Common outcome measures
included weight-related outcomes (e.g. weight loss, BMI, waist-to-
height ratio), participant perceptions of the intervention, engage-
ment, and behavioural outcomes (e.g. physical activity, dietary
habits).
Health outcomes.
Less than half of the studies (5/15) reported
signiﬁcant differences between conditions in terms of weight loss
metrics. Three of these directly compared the effect of the study
intervention against a comparator and found different results.
One, a retrospective cohort study, reported that the group
receiving a video conferencing-based intervention lost weight
while the control group, who did not receive any intervention,
gained weight [45]; the second, an RCT with low risk of bias, found
that in-person intervention was associated with signiﬁcantly
greater weight loss than internet and hybrid interventions [37].
The third study, another RCT with low risk of bias, found that a
telehealth intervention resulted in statistically signiﬁcant weight
loss compared to treatment as usual [47]. The other two studies

examined the difference between speciﬁc features of online,
group-based interventions. One RCT with low risk of bias found
that participants in a condition with incentives lost signiﬁcantly
more weight (and achieved clinically meaningful loss ≥5%) than
those without. The difference in total weight loss between groups
was no longer signiﬁcant at 12 months, despite ongoing
incentives, although signiﬁcantly more of the incentive group
participants had stable weights at 12 months [42, 43]. The other
study, a pilot RCT with low risk of bias, found that participants in
the version of the intervention with pre-scripted feedback
(compared to counsellor-crafted feedback) lost signiﬁcantly more
weight [55].
A ﬁfth of the studies (3/15) reported ﬁnding no signiﬁcant
difference in weight loss between conditions; in two cases, the
online intervention was compared with conventional delivery of
the service [49, 53] and in the other, the addition of motivational
interviewing did not improve outcomes compared to the standard
web-based program [54]. The remaining studies (7/15) reported
weight loss over time but did not compare weight loss in the
online,
group-based
intervention
with
another
condition
[39, 40, 44, 46, 48, 50–52].
Behaviour change outcomes.
Seven studies reported on physical
activity or dietary behaviour change as well as health outcomes.
One pilot study found a mean change in weekly walking time of
116 min, although there was a huge range and standard deviation
in their small sample of 12 participants [52]. Another found
signiﬁcant improvements in the 30 second sit-to-stand and
6 minute walk tests, but not in gait speed or grip strength [51]
and a third found that there were higher rates of positive
behaviours when the online intervention included incentives
compared to when it did not [42]. An RCT found a signiﬁcant
difference between the intervention and treatment-as-usual
group in accelerometer data (activity increased for the interven-
tion group and decreased in the control group) but no signiﬁcant
difference between groups in mobility [47], while another, a pilot
RCT, found no signiﬁcant within-group changes for physical
activity [44].
Three studies reported on dietary outcomes, of which two did
not ﬁnd a difference between groups (on calorie intake, which was
reduced in all conditions [37], or on eating psychopathology [49]).
The third study found no signiﬁcant within group changes in
eating practices, although fruit and vegetable intake did increase
in the intervention group.
Meta-analysis of impact on mean weight change.
Of the 15
identiﬁed studies, 13 reported weight change and 9 of these were
RCTs; however, only four [44, 45, 47, 49] had consistent
comparison groups (waitlist or standard care) and were sufﬁciently
similar to conduct a meta-analysis. The remaining studies had
various comparisons - including between online and in-person
group-based interventions [40, 48], the intervention delivered with
and without additional components [42, 54, 55], and a social-
media based intervention compared to a conference call [50] - but
they were determined to be too heterogeneous for a meta-
analysis to be meaningful and too few to conduct separate meta-
analyses [56]. The studies included in the meta-analysis compared
the intervention with either a waitlist control or standard care and
included a total of 356 participants (179 intervention, 177 control).
Three of the four included studies had conducted sample size
calculations and were sufﬁciently powered to detect a reduction in
weight of 3–10 kg with 80% power [45, 47, 49]. From this small
sample, the results of the meta-analysis indicated that online,
group-based interventions have a statistically signiﬁcant effect on
weight loss compared to no intervention or standard care with a
small-to-moderate
effect

be interpreted with caution. Heterogeneity was small (I2 = 31%)
and the Eggers’ test indicated no publication bias (p = 0.28).
Aim 2: User experience with the interventions
Engagement.
All but one of the papers [40] reported data
relating to engagement. Most of the reported outcomes were
related to completion rates, which ranged from 30% [52] to 95%
[55] (data for each study is provided in Supplementary Table S3).
Of the papers that reported comparisons of engagement between
online and other conditions (e.g. traditional route, in person or
hybrid), most found no signiﬁcant difference [37, 48, 54]. One
study did ﬁnd signiﬁcantly higher engagement with an internet-
based intervention when incentives were provided (91% com-
pared to 81% retention) [42]. Three studies examined how user
characteristics were associated with engagement: one found that
older and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnicity (BAME) patients were
less likely to choose the online-based intervention when it was

offered to them [57], while another found that older and male
participants were more likely to engage in self-monitoring [39].
One study found that the most common reasons for declining to
participate in the online intervention were a lack of digital skills or
access to the internet [57].
All but three of the studies reported some information about
facilitators to engagement in the group intervention. Approxi-
mately half of them (7/15) tailored the intervention in some way
to improve engagement. Two studies [37, 51] added in-person
group sessions alongside online sessions, but one of them [37]
found no signiﬁcant effect of this. The other [51] provided
additional technical support, which was reported to have a
positive impact on engagement. About a quarter of the studies (4/
15) included interactive forums or group chat functions to
improve
engagement.

Two
studies
[52,
53]
asked
participants
for
engagement-related feedback and received suggestions to help
improve engagement, including reminders of sessions, team
building activities, and having someone familiar in the chat room.
Two-thirds of the studies (10/15) also reported barriers to group
engagement. Common barriers included a ‘digital divide’ in internet
accessibility (access to internet and usability of technology) and lack
of familiarity with other group members. Two studies [52, 55]
reported hectic schedules resulting in a lack of consensus for
session times as a signiﬁcant barrier to engagement. One study [52]
had its components on multiple platforms which participants
highlighted as a burden, while another [37] had a different
counsellor in person versus online, which reportedly reduced the
alliance. Another study [54] used text-based communication rather
than video, which hindered engagement as the lack of verbal cues
and absence of tone led to the text being easily misconstrued. In
another study, the virtual environment itself was considered a
barrier to social support and consequently, engagement, by some
of the participants [44].
Acceptability,
usability,
and
satisfaction.
Six
of
the
studies
examined some outcome related to acceptability, usability, or
satisfaction. Four studies reported positive outcomes related to
patient experience: one intervention had high satisfaction ratings
[51], one identiﬁed themes such as reduced travel, time, and cost
burdens and a less stressful or daunting environment for
introverts [53], another hypothesised that the use of an online
intervention enabled continued engagement and connection
throughout the Covid-19 lockdown, mitigating its negative impact
on health behaviours [48], and the fourth reported that receiving
the intervention online was convenient [44].
Some studies also identiﬁed concerns with the online interven-
tions. Two studies reported that a lack of familiarity limited
participants’ comfort sharing information [50] and potentially also
their engagement [52]. A couple of studies also identiﬁed
technical issues such as difﬁculty accessing the Internet [52, 53]
and managing intervention components on different platforms
[52].
One study also collected participants’ suggestions for improve-
ment, which included: digital calorie counting applications, food
scales, more frequent sessions, more reminders and incentives,
adding team-building exercises, inviting friends, and facilitating
face-to-face interaction by connecting participants directly [52].
Risk of bias and quality assessment
The risk of bias of the randomised trials was evaluated using the
Cochrane Collaboration RoB 2 tool (Table 5) [31, 32]. Five of the
nine studies were assessed as having low risk of bias in all
domains and only one was considered to have high risk of bias. Of
the various domains, the randomisation process had the most
concerns, with three studies failing to report sufﬁcient information
about allocation, schedule generation, or concealment. Three
studies also provided only limited drop-out information, although
this was not thought likely to be related to the outcomes. Only
one domain - measurement of the outcome - was assessed as high
risk; this was because the patients measured their own BMI, which
could have been affected by their knowledge of the intervention
conditions. This was not the planned procedure for outcome
measurement protocol; self-measurement of weight and circum-
ference data was necessitated by Covid-19 lockdowns and
participants had previously been instructed on how to take
measurements themselves.
The Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT) [34] was used to
assess the quality of the remaining ﬁve studies. Generally, the
studies met the criteria, with the exception of confounders being
accounted for in the design and analysis of the study. The full
assessment (with comments) for all of the 12 studies is provided in
Supplementary Table S3.

DISCUSSION
Principal ﬁndings
Fifteen studies were identiﬁed that examined the impact of online,
group-based weight management interventions for people with
severe obesity (BMI ≥35 kg/m2). There was substantial variability
among the interventions, in terms of online platform (including
videoconferencing, websites, and chat functions), group size, and
number of sessions, but they most commonly lasted for around
6 months and had 1 hour sessions. Overall, the evidence
supported our hypothesis that online, group-based interventions
could have a positive impact on weight management, as most of
the studies observed weight loss associated with participating in
the intervention. A meta-analysis also indicated a small-to-
moderate effect of the interventions at reducing weight compared
to no intervention. Drawing implications from these ﬁndings
should be done cautiously, for a couple of reasons. Only four of
the 15 studies were sufﬁciently comparable to be eligible for the
meta-analysis and many of the studies had small and non-
representative sample sizes (9/15 had samples of less than 100
participants and most of the studies had predominantly female
participants). Additionally, although less than half of the studies
(7/15) looked at behavioural outcomes, the evidence of impact of
the interventions was limited, particularly for dietary behaviour.
This is a common limitation in digital health research [58, 59],
often due to barriers such as motivation, a perceived lack of social
connection, and limitations with the recruitment methods [60].
With the available evidence, it was difﬁcult to draw strong
conclusions around the ﬁrst research question of what methods
of delivering online, group-based behaviour change interven-
tions for adults with severe obesity are most effective. The
relatively small set of studies included in this analysis made a
subgroup analysis of intervention methods infeasible. For the
remaining studies, the heterogeneity in the intervention types
and the variety of comparisons conducted in the RCTs meant
that there was little evidence to support any particular type of
intervention. Some results suggested that adding incentives and
using pre-scripted modular feedback can help support weight
loss but that adding motivational interviewing might not
increase the impact of the intervention. However, the small
number of studies, heterogeneity, and ﬂaws in design, all serve
to limit the conclusions that can be drawn.
We were better able to address the second research question,
which focused on users’ perceptions about different online,
group-based weight management interventions, although our
ﬁndings are limited by the fact that less than half of the studies
(6/15) examined user experience. Online, group-based interven-
tions were considered to be more convenient, but we identiﬁed
several major barriers to engagement - including lack of access
to fast internet, usability issues, and digital literacy issues - that
prevented some people from participating and caused frustra-
tion in others.
Implications for practice and future intervention design
To mitigate barriers related to usability of the speciﬁc platforms
used, most studies provided detailed instructions and run-
throughs prior to the sessions, both of which were considered
helpful by participants. Organising times for the sessions that
would be convenient for all participants was difﬁcult in some
studies, but having set dates and times for the sessions
made attendance easier [52, 55]. A lack of familiarity with other
group members had a negative impact on group cohesion, as
did having different facilitators for different sessions [37, 50, 52].
The reviewed studies used a variety of methods to improve
engagement, but only a few methods demonstrated positive
impact in more than one study. One such method was sending
the week’s content to participants ahead of the sessions, making
them feel prepared and increasing comfort levels as participants
knew what to expect. Attempts to remove technical barriers also
largely had positive results, with participants giving positive
feedback about early run-throughs. Incentives such as weekly tips
and tricks, access to recipes, and detailed feedback from
facilitators have also been reported as helpful. Feedback from

in the short term, although these analyses have been hampered
by small sample sizes and variable methods [7, 61, 62]. Even
though these reviews did not focus speciﬁcally on severe obesity
or group-based interventions, they also only found small numbers
of eligible studies - 8 [62], 9 [61], and 11 [7].
Evidence on the effectiveness of group-based weight manage-
ment interventions (with various types of delivery) is stronger
[12, 13]. Interestingly, one meta-analysis found that men-only
groups had signiﬁcantly higher weight loss than mixed-gender or
women-only groups [12]. The review mentioned that this ﬁnding
was consistent with previous literature about men beneﬁting from
group interventions, but did not speculate on the possible reasons
for this difference. The majority of participants in the studies
included in this review were women. The literature suggests that
this could potentially be a factor affecting the effectiveness of the
interventions, although this could not be examined with the
limited evidence available in this review. Future research should
further explore the relationship between gender and mode of
intervention delivery.
The ﬁndings of this review related to technical barriers to
engagement, with a greater negative impact on marginalised
communities such as older individuals or those from minority
ethnic backgrounds [57], aligns with existing literature on digital
inequalities [63] and should be considered while designing new
digital interventions. One way to bridge this divide could be via
referral to digital literacy programmes such as the NHS Digital
Health Champions programme [64] before the start of the
intervention [57].
Future interventions should continue using mitigation strate-
gies highlighted in the reviewed studies, such as providing
technical instructions and allowing time for run-throughs. To help
reduce the issue of lack of familiarity, future studies could
introduce a social communication component to encourage
better group cohesion, while limiting all activities to as few
platforms as possible to reduce burden on participants [52]. Any
delays between expressing interest and beginning the interven-
tion would also need to be kept at a minimum to avoid
participants losing motivation. Co-production activities aimed at
getting patient inputs speciﬁcally discussing challenges faced and
ideas to improve their comfort levels and motivation could
potentially lead to better engagement in future interventions.
Given the growing shift towards digital healthcare, especially
since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, it will be essential to
understand the participant and intervention characteristics that
are associated with the greatest beneﬁt from online, group-based
interventions to enable intervention designs to be optimised and
tailored for speciﬁc groups. It would also support personalised
medicine by helping healthcare providers and patients to choose
the type of intervention most likely to beneﬁt them - in-person or
online, individual or group - while increasing the availability of
services. To this end, it will also be important for future studies to
explore
patients’
perceptions
of
the
intervention
and
the
facilitators and barriers that they experience.
Strengths and limitations of the review
Some of the strengths of the review are that the search was
conducted using broad search terms in several databases to
minimise the likelihood of missing a relevant study, and that the
screening was conducted by two independent authors. The
review included a range of studies using different methods, which
provided different perspectives on evidence around the impact
and experience of online, group-based weight management
interventions.
This
enabled
us
to
conduct
qualitative
and
quantitative analyses and synthesise barriers and facilitators to
group engagement, providing a more holistic interpretation of the
body of literature on these types of interventions. This analysis
also enabled us to outline key factors that can support the
successful implementation of these interventions, which can
inform the future development and delivery of online, group-
based interventions for people with severe obesity.
One limitation was that due to time and resource constraints,
two authors shared the work of data extraction and risk of bias
and quality assessment. Another limitation is that due to the
considerable heterogeneity of study design, comparisons, popula-
tions, and reported outcome measures, only four of the studies
could be included in the meta-analysis, making it difﬁcult to
generalise the results of the analysis and provide meaningful
knowledge [65]. Additionally, one of the studies included in the
meta-analysis was underpowered [44]. This was included despite
the limitations of including underpowered studies in meta-
analyses [66] due to the small number of studies eligible for this
analysis. This is a common issue in meta-analyses [66] and limits
the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn from it. The low
sample size of a majority of the studies included in this review also
limits the other conclusions, and all the results found in this
systematic review must be treated with caution. Given that
underpowered studies and low sample sizes are a common
limitation of digital health research [58, 60], future reviews should
adjust for this issue while conducting statistical analyses to
address this limitation. Finally, the heterogeneity of intervention
characteristics, population characteristics, and comparison types
also limit the ability to conclude who might beneﬁt most from
such interventions.
CONCLUSION
The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesise evidence on
the effectiveness of, and user experience with, online, group-based
interventions for people with severe obesity. The evidence was
mixed, but overall suggested some positive effect of the interven-
tions on weight loss. The results from the meta-analysis tentatively
suggest a small to moderate impact of the interventions compared
to wait list controls, but this was based on a small sample and there
was insufﬁcient evidence to determine how digital group-based
interventions compare with individual interventions (online or in-
person) or face-to-face group-based interventions. Due to the
heterogeneity of interventions and analysis types, it was difﬁcult to

conclude what speciﬁc intervention characteristics had the strongest
impact on weight loss, but we identiﬁed key barriers to engagement
including internet accessibility, digital literacy, a lack of time, and
lack of familiarity with group members and the counsellor. Some of
these barriers were mitigated by speciﬁc efforts made by study
teams including detailed technical run-throughs and additional in-
person sessions to improve group cohesion, but they were not
always effective. Future studies into such interventions would
beneﬁt from co-production activities with diverse groups emphasis-
ing the inclusion of marginalised communities, speciﬁcally focusing
on
mitigating
the
identiﬁed
barriers
and
further
facilitating
engagement. To improve access to and reduce the strain on weight
management services, there is a need for further investigation in
how to implement digital group-based interventions to maximise
their potential beneﬁts, which could inform decision and policy-
making regarding obesity services.
