## Abstract
AI-based clinical decision support systems (CDSS) show promising diagnostic accuracy across multiple medical specialties. This systematic review analyzed 89 studies comparing AI diagnostic performance to clinical experts. In radiology, AI achieved 94.5% sensitivity and 95.3% specificity for detecting malignancies. Dermatology applications showed 91.2% accuracy for skin cancer detection. However, real-world implementation faces challenges including algorithm bias, interpretability, and integration with clinical workflows.

Introduction

Artificial intelligence has emerged as a transformative technology in healthcare, particularly in diagnostic imaging and pattern recognition. This systematic review evaluates the current state of AI diagnostic accuracy across clinical specialties...

Methods

We searched MEDLINE, Embase, and IEEE Xplore for studies published between 2018 and 2023 comparing AI diagnostic performance to human experts or established diagnostic standards. Quality assessment used QUADAS-2 criteria...

Results

Radiology applications dominated the literature (n=42 studies), with deep learning models achieving expert-level performance in chest X-ray interpretation (AUC 0.94), mammography (AUC 0.92), and CT lung nodule detection (sensitivity 94.5%). Dermatology studies (n=18) showed comparable accuracy to dermatologists for melanoma detection...

Challenges and Limitations

Despite impressive accuracy metrics, several challenges impede clinical translation. Dataset bias remains problematic, with most training data from high-resource settings. Algorithmic interpretability is limited, creating trust barriers among clinicians...

Conclusions

AI demonstrates diagnostic accuracy comparable to or exceeding human experts in specific domains. Successful implementation requires addressing technical, ethical, and workflow integration challenges...
