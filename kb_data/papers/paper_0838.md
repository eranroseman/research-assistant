## Abstract
Lipid metabolic diseases have substantial morbidity and mortality rates, posing a significant threat to human health. PPARα, a member of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), plays a crucial role in lipid metabolism and immune regulation. Recent studies have increasingly recognized the pivotal involvement of PPARα in diverse pathological conditions. This comprehensive review aims to elucidate the multifaceted role of PPARα in metabolic diseases including liver diseases, diabetes-related diseases, age-related diseases, and cancers, shedding light on the underlying molecular mechanisms and some regulatory effects of natural/synthetic ligands of PPARα. By summarizing the latest research findings on PPARα, we aim to provide a foundation for the possible therapeutic exploitation of PPARα in lipid metabolic diseases.
