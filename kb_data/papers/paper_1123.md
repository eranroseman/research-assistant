## Abstract
MRI completion, cancer detection rates, and false‑positive rates. Patient sociodemographic information and clinic‑level variables will be examined as moderators of nudge effectiveness. Qualitative interviews conducted at the trial’s conclusion will examine barriers and facilitators to implementation. Discussion This study will add to the growing literature on the effectiveness of behavioral economics‑informed implementation strategies to promote evidence‑based interventions. The design will facilitate testing the relative effects of nudges to patients and clinicians and the effects of moderators of nudge effectiveness, including key indi‑cators of health disparities. The results may inform the introduction of low‑cost, scalable implementation strategies to promote early breast cancer detection. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05787249.
