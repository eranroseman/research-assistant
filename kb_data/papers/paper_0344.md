## Abstract
Abstract
            
              Background
              Virtual patient-to-provider messaging systems such as text messaging have the potential to improve healthcare access; however, little research has used theory to understand the barriers and facilitators impacting uptake of these systems by patients and healthcare providers. This review uses the Capability-Opportunity-Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) model and the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) to explore barriers and facilitators of patient-to-provider messaging.
            
            
              Methods
              A rapid umbrella review method was followed. Medline and CINAHL were searched for review articles that examined patient-to-provider implementation barriers and facilitators by patients or healthcare providers. Two coders extracted implementation barriers and facilitators, and one coder mapped these barriers and facilitators on to the COM-B and TDF.
            
            
              Results
              
                Fifty-nine unique barriers and facilitators were extracted. Regarding healthcare provider oriented barriers and facilitators, the most frequently identified COM-B components included
                Reflective Motivation
                (identified in 42% of provider barriers and facilitators),
                Psychological Capability
                (19%) and
                Physical Opportunity
                (19%) and TDF domains included
                Beliefs about Consequences
                (identified in 28% of provider barriers and facilitators),
                Environmental Context and Resources
                (19%), and
                Social Influences
                (17%). Regarding patient oriented barriers and facilitators, the most frequently identified COM-B components included
                Reflective Motivation
                (identified in 55% of patient barriers and facilitators),
                Psychological Capability
                (16%), and
                Physical Opportunity
                (16%) and TDF domains included
                Beliefs about Consequences
                (identified in 30% of patient barriers and facilitators),
                Environmental Context and Resources
                (16%), and
                Beliefs about Capabilities
                (11%).
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              Both patients and healthcare providers experience barriers to implementing patient-to-provider messaging systems. By conducting a COM-B and TDF-based analysis of the implementation barriers and facilitators, this review highlights several theoretical domains for researchers, healthcare systems, and policy-makers to focus on when designing interventions that can effectively target these issues and enhance the impact and reach of virtual messaging systems in the future.
