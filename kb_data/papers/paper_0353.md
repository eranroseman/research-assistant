## Abstract
Summary
              We reviewed the effect of behavioural telehealth interventions on glycaemic control and diabetes self-management in patients with type 2 diabetes. The databases CINAHL, Medline and psychlNFO were searched in August 2012. Journal articles were selected that had been published in English with a randomized controlled trial design using a usual care comparison group, and in which the primary intervention component was delivered by telehealth. Relevant outcome measures were glycaemic control and one or more of the following diabetes self-care areas: diet, physical activity, blood glucose self-monitoring (BGSM) or medication adherence. Interventions were excluded if they were primarily based on telemonitoring. The search retrieved 1027 articles, from which 49 were selected based on their title and abstract. Fourteen articles (reporting 1 3 studies) met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. Four studies reported significant improvements in glycaemic control. Five of eight studies on dietary adherence reported significant treatment effects, as did five of eight on physical activity, four of nine on blood glucose self-monitoring, and three of eight on medication adherence. Overall, behavioural telehealth interventions show promise in improving the diabetes self-care and glycaemic control of people with type 2 diabetes.
