## Abstract
Objective Self-monitoring is a core component of behavioral obesity treatment, but it is unknown how digital health has been used for self-monitoring, what engagement rates are achieved in these interventions, and how self-monitoring and weight loss are related. Methods This systematic review examined digital self-monitoring in behavioral weight loss interventions among adults with overweight or obesity. Six databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses) were searched for randomized controlled trials with interventions ≥ 12 weeks, weight outcomes ≥ 6 months, and outcomes on self-monitoring engagement and their relationship to weight loss. Results Thirty-nine studies from 2009 to 2019 met inclusion criteria. Among the 67 interventions with digital self-monitoring, weight was tracked in 72% of them, diet in 81%, and physical activity in 82%. Websites were the most common self-monitoring modality, followed by mobile applications, wearables, electronic scales, and, finally, text messaging. Few interventions had digital self-monitoring engagement rates ≥ 75% of days. Rates were higher in digital- than in paper-based arms in 21 out of 34 comparisons and lower in just 2. Interventions with counseling had similar rates to standalone interventions. Greater digital self-monitoring was linked to weight loss in 74% of occurrences. Conclusions Self-monitoring via digital health is consistently associated with weight loss in behavioral obesity treatment.
