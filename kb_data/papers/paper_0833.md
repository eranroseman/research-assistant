## Abstract
Objective:
              Text messaging is a promising weight loss intervention modality for emerging adults who are overweight, but few studies exist to guide intervention development. Furthermore, sleep is emerging as a salient intervention target for weight management. This study examines feasibility and acceptability of two text messaging interventions for weight control in emerging adults, one of which includes sleep intervention content.
            
            
              Methods:
              Forty-three emerging adults who were overweight (BMI ≥ 25 < 30; ages 18–21) were randomized to receive either a text messaging intervention focused on diet and physical activity change, or a text messaging intervention designed to modify sleep behavior plus diet and physical activity. The interventions included motivational interviewing, education around health behaviors, physical activity, and dietary goal setting, as well as sleep goals for those in the sleep condition. All participants self-monitored diet, physical activity, and weight via text message for 3 months; those in the sleep intervention monitored nightly sleep duration.
            
            
              Results:
              Intervention acceptability and engagement were high for both conditions. In exploratory analyses, we observed that body mass index remained stable across assessments, regardless of condition. Participants in the sleep modification condition showed significantly greater sleep duration from pre- to post-intervention than those in the standard intervention.
            
            
              Conclusions:
              This study demonstrates that a weight loss intervention delivered by text messaging, including components designed to improve sleep, is acceptable and feasible for emerging adults who are overweight, and that extended sleep duration may be a benefit of the sleep modification intervention.
            
            
              Implications for Impact Statement
              This study provides support for the feasibility and acceptability of a text messaging intervention combining traditional behavioral weight loss strategies with sleep intervention in emerging adults. Results also suggest that a weight loss intervention targeting sleep improvements may increase sleep duration.
