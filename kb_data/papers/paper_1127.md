## Abstract
Background: Text messaging has emerged as a popular strategy to engage patients after hospital discharge. Little is known about how patients use these programs and what types of needs are addressed through this approach.
Objective: The goal of this study was to describe the types and timing of postdischarge needs identified during a 30‐day automated texting program.
Methods: The program ran from January to August 2021 at a primary care practice in Philadelphia. In this mixed‐methods study, two reviewers conducted a directed content analysis of patient needs expressed during the program, categorizing them along a well‐known transitional care framework. We describe the frequency of need categories and their timing relative to discharge.
Results: A total of 405 individuals were enrolled; the mean (SD) age was 62.7 (16.2); 64.2% were female; 47.4% were Black; and 49.9% had Medicare insurance. Of this population, 178 (44.0%) expressed at least one need during the 30‐day program. The most frequent needs addressed were related to symptoms (26.8%), coordinating follow‐up care (20.4%), and medication issues (15.7%). The mean (SD) number of days from discharge to need was 10.8 (7.9); there were no significant differences in timing based on need category.
Conclusions: The needs identified via an automated texting program were concentrated in three areas relevant to primary care practice and within nursing scope of practice. This program can serve as a model for health systems looking to support transitions through an operationally efficient approach, and the findings of this analysis can inform future iterations of this type of program.
