## Abstract
Objective:
Mobile health tools are feasible options for patients with serious mental illness () to encourage behavior change. The umbrella of “mobile health tools” varies widely, both in platforms used and content delivered. This literature review assessed the use of text messaging adherence enhancement interventions. It reviews original research on text messaging interventions to promote medication adherence in patients with serious mental illness.

Methods:
A systematic literature review using PRISMA guidelines evaluated short message service (SMS)/texting messaging interventions for medication adherence in serious mental illness. Databases included PubMed, Cochrane, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. Data extraction included demographics, disorder characteristics, intervention components, medication class, adherence measures, research design, and study outcomes. Study quality was also assessed.

Results:
Of 114 full-text articles screened, 10 papers were selected from nine unique trials (N=937 people with serious mental illness). Study durations ranged from 30 days to 18 months, with frequency of SMS ranging from twice weekly to 12 times daily. Of the 9 unique trials, the majority reported using an automated server to deliver SMS messages (k=7), 2-way SMS capabilities (k=6), customized message content and/or timing (k=7), and additional components (k=7; e.g., provider contact, educational content, monetary rewards). Seven of the 10 papers reported statistically significant improvement in adherence and at least one clinical outcome.

Conclusions:
Evidence to date indicates that text-messaging interventions are not only feasible but also appear to improve medication adherence and clinical outcomes in patients with serious mental illness. Future research should assess implementation approaches and how to scale-up efforts in non-research settings.
