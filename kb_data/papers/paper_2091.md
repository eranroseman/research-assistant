## Abstract
Aims: Aerobic training (AT) and resistance training (RT) can reduce blood glucose and type 2 diabetes risk, and increase muscle mass for prediabetes patients. However, the impact of long-term AT and RT on cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk remains unclear. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of AT and RT on CVD risk reduction in prediabetes patients.
