## Abstract
Background
              Poor adherence to oral medications for type 2 diabetes can increase the risk of health complications. Digital interventions can affect people’s experiences of self-managing a chronic condition, and SMS text messages may provide an effective delivery method for an intervention. The Support Through Mobile Messaging and Digital Health Technology for Diabetes (SuMMiT-D) intervention uses evidence-based SMS text messages to support people with type 2 diabetes with regular and consistent use of diabetes medication.
            
            
              Objective
              This process analysis, conducted alongside a randomized controlled trial of SuMMiT-D, aimed to explore (1) the contextual factors that may interact with the SuMMiT-D intervention and (2) the self-reported mechanisms through which change in behavior or attitude might occur.
            
            
              Methods
              A nested qualitative process study was conducted within primary care in England. A total of 43 trial participants diagnosed with type 2 diabetes were assigned to receive the SuMMiT-D intervention, were undergoing oral glucose-lowering treatment, blood pressure-lowering treatment or lipid-lowering treatment, either alone or in combination, and had access to a mobile phone, took part in semistructured telephone interviews. Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis.
            
            
              Results
              In total, 2 overarching themes were developed exploring relevant contextual factors and potential mechanisms of change. The system exerted a range of holistic benefits and supported the cognitions, beliefs, and behaviors necessary for longitudinal self-management. The perceived value of the messages was fluid and linked to contextual need. Appraisal of the system was influenced by existing routines, lifestyle disruption, people’s understanding of type 2 diabetes, relationships with other people, and subjective attitudes toward living with type 2 diabetes in contemporary society.
            
            
              Conclusions
              This work demonstrates the value of engaging people longitudinally in thinking about their general health, the importance of interrogating context, and the holistic benefit of health messaging. Many people perceived wide-ranging and unexpected benefits from using the intervention over time, challenging assumptions about who might be expected to appraise the system more positively and who should be offered access to it.
