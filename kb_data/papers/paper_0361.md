## Abstract
Abstract
            
              Background
              We investigated the effects of a physical activity encouragement intervention based on a smartphone personal health record (PHR) application (app) on step count increases, glycemic control, and body weight in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D).
            
            
              Methods
              In this 12-week, single-center, randomized controlled, 12-week extension study, patients with T2D who were overweight or obese were randomized using ratio 1:2 to a group using a smartphone PHR app (control group) or group using the app and received individualized motivational text messages (intervention group) for 12 weeks. During the extension period, the sending of the encouraging text messages to the intervention group was discontinued. The primary outcome was a change in daily step count after 12 weeks and analyzed by independent t-test. The secondary outcomes included HbA1c, fasting glucose, and body weight analyzed by paired or independent t-test.
            
            
              Results
              
                Of 200 participants, 62 (93.9%) and 118 (88.1%) in the control and intervention group, respectively, completed the 12-week main study. The change in daily step count from baseline to week 12 was not significantly different between the two groups (
                P
                 = 0.365). Among participants with baseline step counts < 7,500 steps per day, the change in the mean daily step count at week 12 in the intervention group (1,319 ± 3,020) was significantly larger than that in control group (-139 ± 2,309) (
                P
                 = 0.009). At week 12, HbA1c in the intervention group (6.7 ± 0.5%) was significantly lower than that in control group (6.9 ± 0.6%,
                P
                 = 0.041) and at week 24, changes in HbA1c from baseline were significant in both groups but, comparable between groups. Decrease in HbA1c from baseline to week 12 of intervention group was greater in participants with baseline HbA1c ≥ 7.5% (-0.81 ± 0.84%) compared with those with baseline HbA1c < 7.5% (-0.22 ± 0.39%) (P for interaction = 0.014). A significant reduction in body weight from baseline to week 24 was observed in both groups without significant between-group differences (
                P
                 = 0.370).
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              App-based individualized motivational intervention for physical activity did not increase daily step count from baseline to week 12, and the changes in HbA1c levels from baseline to week 12 were comparable.
