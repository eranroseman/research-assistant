## Abstract
Background
              Previous data have validated the benefit of digital health interventions (DHIs) on weight loss in patients following acute coronary syndrome entering cardiac rehabilitation (CR).
            
            
              Objective
              The primary purpose of this study was to test the hypothesis that increased DHI use, as measured by individual log-ins, is associated with improved weight loss. Secondary analyses evaluated the association between log-ins and activity within the platform and exercise, dietary, and medication adherence.
            
            
              Methods
              We obtained DHI data including active days, total log-ins, tasks completed, educational modules reviewed, medication adherence, and nonmonetary incentive points earned in patients undergoing standard CR following acute coronary syndrome. Linear regression followed by multivariable models were used to evaluate associations between DHI log-ins and weight loss or dietary adherence.
            
            
              Results
              Participants (n=61) were 79% male (48/61) with mean age of 61.0 (SD 9.7) years. We found a significant positive association of total log-ins during CR with weight loss (r2=.10, P=.03). Educational modules viewed (r2=.11, P=.009) and tasks completed (r2=.10, P=.01) were positively significantly associated with weight loss, yet total log-ins were not significantly associated with differences in dietary adherence (r2=.05, P=.12) or improvements in minutes of exercise per week (r2=.03, P=.36).
            
            
              Conclusions
              These data extend our previous findings and demonstrate increased DHI log-ins portend improved weight loss in patients undergoing CR after acute coronary syndrome. DHI adherence can potentially be monitored and used as a tool to selectively encourage patients to adhere to secondary prevention lifestyle modifications.
