## Abstract
The global outbreak of COVID-19 in 2020 has led to the dominance of COVID-19 prevention information on all media channels. Drawing on the ability–motivation model of information processing, this study examined how such an information overabundance hampered individuals’ ability and motivation to process in the era of COVID-19. With a survey conducted from 493 participants, we found that less message elaboration of COVID-19 prevention information was predicted by greater message fatigue, a state of low motivation due to information overabundance. In addition, greater message fatigue was accompanied by greater information overload, a state of low ability due to information overabundance. Moreover, certain motivation-related (i.e. health status, trait reactance and frequency of information seeking) and ability–related factors (i.e. health literacy, health status, trait anxiety and information quality) were found to be associated with message fatigue and information overload, respectively. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed.
