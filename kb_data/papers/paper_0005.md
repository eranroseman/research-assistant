1. Introduction
Together with cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and respiratory chronic diseases, dia-
betes mellitus (DM) is included in the category of “non communicable chronic diseases”
(NCDs). NCDs are responsible for the highest burden of morbidity and mortality world-
wide, and these four groups of diseases account for over 80% of all NCD-related prema-
ture deaths [1]. With a worldwide prevalence on the rise, type 1 diabetes (T1DM) and
type 2 diabetes (T2DM) represent significant global health threats [2]. Projections show that
by 2045, one in eight adults (approximately 783 million) will be living with DM, indicating
a 46% increase in its prevalence rate. This scenario implies an ever-growing number of
people requiring lifelong care and clinical assistance, with an increasing burden on National
Healthcare Systems.
As a “pervasive” disease, diabetes requires continuous monitoring, frequent follow-
ups and multidisciplinary management to optimize the achievement of therapeutic targets
within a holistic person-centered approach [3]. Additionally, the management of DM has to
address not only glucose-lowering therapy but also the control of the other cardiovascular
risk factors and related comorbidities [3].
Despite the recent advances in glucose-lowering therapy, achieving diabetes control
remains challenging. Key contributors to therapeutic failure include poor patients’ adher-
ence to medications and clinical inertia, which is the reluctance of clinicians to initiate or
intensify therapy according to evidence-based guidelines [4]. To overcome the multiple
and challenging obstacles to the optimal diabetes control, an organized and structured
model of chronic care should be proposed for people with diabetes (PwD) [5]. With the
increasing progress of innovative digital health technologies, the development of a “digital
virtual diabetes clinic” has provided a valuable opportunity to implement effective and
efficient diabetes management (Figure 1) [6].
Figure 1. Conceptual framework of a digital virtual diabetes clinic. The figure illustrates the concep-
tual framework of a digital, virtual diabetes clinic, highlighting the integration of innovative digital
health technologies for effective and efficient diabetes management. Through at-home blood glucose
monitoring, telemedicine consultations, and personalized digital interventions, the digital virtual
clinic offers a comprehensive approach to diabetes management, enhancing patient engagement and
clinical outcomes.
The aim of this narrative review was to evaluate the impact of telehealth and digital
technologies on the care of PwD, from therapeutic management to the assessment of
complications. The goal was to provide a comprehensive understanding of how telehealth
can revolutionize diabetes care, enhance patient care, and contribute to the efficiency of
national healthcare systems.

2. Materials and Methods
This narrative review aimed to explore the role of telemedicine and digital health
technologies in the management of diabetes, with a particular focus on their application in
addressing both systemic and neurological complications. To this end, a comprehensive
literature search was conducted in PubMed, targeting publications from January 2015 to
December 2024; however, no lower time limit was strictly applied, and earlier studies were
included if deemed conceptually or clinically relevant.
The search strategy included combinations of the following terms and keywords:
“diabetes”, “type 1 diabetes”, “type 2 diabetes”, “diabetes care”, “diabetes complications”,
“diabetes risk factors”, “digital health”, “digital therapeutics”, “telemedicine”, “telehealth”,
“televisits”, “mobile applications”, “web-based interventions”, “continuous glucose moni-
toring”, “connected insulin pens”, “automatic insulin delivery”, “unmet needs”, “treatment
gaps”, “patient needs”.
Inclusion criteria were as follows:
1.
Peer-reviewed articles published in English;
2.
Studies addressing the use of digital health tools in diabetes care, including
type 1 diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and gestational diabetes;
3.
Articles focusing on therapeutic strategies, monitoring technologies, and the manage-
ment or prevention of complications.
We prioritized peer-reviewed studies reporting clinical outcomes in people with
diabetes, including reviews, meta-analyses, randomized controlled trials, and observational
studies, if relevant to the scope. Non-English publications, editorials, and opinion pieces
were excluded. Relevant articles were identified and located to examine citing and cited-by
articles. In total, 86 articles were selected for inclusion based on their thematic relevance
and scientific contribution. The review followed the Scale for the Assessment of Narrative
Review Articles (SANRA) criteria.
A narrative synthesis was developed to describe the various digital health technologies
and to assess their role in symptom management, therapeutic intervention, and complica-
tion prevention in diabetes care. An overview of the principal digital health interventions,
their key proximal outcomes, and the long-term complications they target is provided in
Table S1 of Supplementary Materials.
3. Results
3.1. Unmet Needs in PwD
Several studies have attempted to investigate the unmet needs of people with both
T1DM and T2DM [7–9], defined as the range of difficulties and challenges experienced by
individuals throughout the course of the disease, from diagnosis to long-term therapeutic,
clinical, and psychosocial management.
The DAWN2 study [8], which took its name from its predecessor, the DAWN study [7],
was conducted in 17 states on more than 16,000 individuals, including patients with both
T1DM and T2DM, caregivers, family members, and healthcare professionals. An online
questionnaire was administered, covering several topics, such as the impact of the disease
on their quality of life, diabetes management and control, support from family members,
society and healthcare system, and unmet needs and hopes for the future. The results
showed a clear need for psychosocial support, with 44.6% reporting distress related to the
diagnosis and 13.8% showing signs of potential depression. The majority of PwD reported
to be poorly involved by their physician and emphasized the need to be provided with
a better education on self-management as well as psychological and social support. The
issue of support was also raised by family members and caregivers who perceived diabetes

J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 4240
4 of 19
as a physical and emotional burden (35.3%), with a struggle to find the appropriate way to
help their loved ones.
Raposo and colleagues [9] administered an online questionnaire to 300 individuals
newly diagnosed with T2DM and currently treated with glucose-lowering drugs. The
responses revealed a low-to-medium level of knowledge of diabetes and related conditions
prior to diagnosis (mean: 4.4 on a scale of 0 to 10); after the first visit, most responders
were very satisfied with the information received. The most important unmet needs that
emerged were the need to improve both the awareness and information about T2DM to
enable early diagnosis; the desire for better support concerning diet and dietary habits;
and lastly, the expectation for a new method of blood glucose monitoring that could be
real-time and painless.
In the light of these considerations, it became essential to highlight possible solutions
and assess the corresponding patient satisfaction. Digital health applied to the complexities
of chronic conditions has the enormous potential to improve clinical care, thus leading
to a decrease in the rate of acute and chronic complications and to an improvement of
the quality of life, relieving the economic and social burden on the healthcare system and
caregivers [10].
3.2. Telehealth and Its Application in Diabetes Care
Telehealth is defined as the utilization of digital technologies to deliver medical care,
health education, and public health services by connecting multiple users in separate
locations [11], indicating a model of care delivery rather than a specific treatment or
therapeutic strategy. As a subset of telehealth, telemedicine refers to the exchange of
medical information from one site to another via electronic communications to improve
a patient’s clinical health status [11] (Table 1). As a chronic disease requiring frequent
interaction between patients and healthcare providers (HCPs), diabetes could benefit from
a remote approach based on digital technologies.
Numerous guidelines or international panels have identified three key areas of appli-
cation for telemedicine in diabetes care to improve patients’ outcomes, increase access to
care and reduce costs: 1. secondary prevention; 2. diagnosis; and 3. treatment [6,12]. In
general, telemedicine allows for remote assistance and virtual visits monitoring diabetes-
related parameters and facilitates communications between HCPs for consultations and
the exchange of documents and reports to support clinical decisions. For these purposes,
various technologies can be employed to support telehealth delivery of programs and
services, including digital technologies such as continuous glucose monitoring (CGM)
and automatic insulin delivery (AID), smartphone apps for mobile phones, websites or
cloud-upload technologies for data download and remote monitoring algorithms, along
with combinations of multiple technologies.
In a recent systematic review, Eberle and colleagues [13] addressed the role of
telemedicine for T1DM and T2DM management, categorizing the available intervention
protocols into four groups: real-time audio intervention, real-time video intervention,
asynchronous intervention, and lastly, combined intervention. The results showed an
equivalence of these approaches for the remote management of diabetic patients; however,
it is imperative to adapt each of them to the specific needs of each patient [14].
A recent meta-analysis conducted by Tchero and colleagues [15] reviewed 42 random-
ized controlled trials (RCTs) with the aim of comparing clinical effectiveness of telemedicine
in the management of diabetes with the traditional approach. The results showed that
telemedicine could be more effective than traditional practice. In particular, telemedicine
interventions lasting longer than 6 months tended to provide better results than those of
shorter durations. Moreover, telemedicine programs have proved to be more successful

J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 4240
5 of 19
in older people and T2DM, as these subjects may undergo cognitive and memory decline.
Although this finding may seem a contradiction, it may be explained by the observation
that in patients with mild cognitive impairment, telemedicine can compensate for possible
forgetfulness in diabetes management. On the other hand, in patients with a more advanced
cognitive deterioration, remote telemanagement can help caregivers in their difficult task
of daily organization.
Table 1. Definitions and components of telehealth in diabetes management. The table provides
definitions of components of telehealth in diabetes management. Telehealth, defined as the utilization
of digital technologies to deliver medical care and healthcare services remotely, includes different
modalities such as televisit, teleconsultation, tele-education, and telemonitoring. Each modality
performs distinct functions in the delivery of remote healthcare, contributing to improved patient
care and outcomes in diabetes management.
TELEHEALTH
TELEMEDICINE IN
DIABETES MANAGEMENT
Televisit
Televisit is a healthcare act in which the doctor interacts remotely with the patient,
with the prescription of drugs or treatments during the televisit. The visit must
take place in real or deferred time. A healthcare professional who is close to the
patient can assist the doctor.
Teleconsultation
Teleconsultation represents a remote consultancy activity between doctors that
allows a doctor to ask the advice of one or more doctors on the indication of
diagnosis and/or choice of therapy without the physical presence of the patient,
on the basis of medical information related to patient care.
Tele-education
Tele-education refers to any educational or learning process in which the learner is
geographically apart from the instructor and/or the educational resources.
Tele-education can be synchronized and not-synchronized and is commonly
associated with in-person lessons or professional training procedures.
Telemonitoring
Telemonitoring corresponds to the transmission and/or the sharing of clinical data
to a healthcare provider through electronic and web-based systems.
Telemonitoring can include both non-reactive data collection and delayed and/or
continuous analytic and decision-making functions.
Finally, a recent review [16] sought to shed light on the cost–benefit of telemedicine
for diabetes to facilitate its widespread adoption. Telemonitoring interventions together
with teleophthalmology interventions for the assessment of microvascular complications
in the retina were evaluated. The most important result in terms of cost savings was in
teleophthalmology, which was found to be promising for early detection of microvascular
ocular complications. A similar significant result was not observed for telemonitoring tools;
however, several studies [17,18] showed the need to implement telemedicine techniques
especially for rural populations.
3.2.1. Continuous Glucose Monitoring
Glucose monitoring plays a key role in both the treatment and management of insulin-
treated PwD [19,20]. A CGM system measures blood glucose levels on a near-continuous
basis, providing information of blood glucose response to insulin dosing, meals, exercise,
daily activities and other factors. This information enables HCPs to make necessary
adjustments to the therapy as needed. Currently, two types of CGM devices are available:
1. real-time CGM (rtCGM), which continuously assesses glucose levels and are equipped
with automated alarms to alerts at specific glucose thresholds and 2. intermittently scanned

J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 4240
6 of 19
CGM (isCGM), which displays glucose values when swiped by a reader or a smart phone,
revealing the current glucose levels. Finally, the so called “blinded” CGM measures glucose
levels that are not immediately shown to the user but retrospectively analyzed by both
patients and physicians to evaluate glycemic patterns and trends.
Data derived from CGM can be summarized and analyzed with software that generates
reports (glucose indices, trends and statistics related to sensor usage, the time spent in
the range of normoglycemia, hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia). Numerous international
consensus statements recommend the Ambulatory Glucose Profile as the default report to
summarize CGM data over multiple days of wear [21].
In numerous RCTs, rtCGM has demonstrated an improvement of glucose control in
terms of reduction in HbA1c, increase in time in range (TIR) and a decrease in the time
spent in hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia. The benefits were more significant in PwD who
employed the sensor for an extended period [22–31]. Most of the studies were conducted
on adults and youth with T1DM treated with continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion
(CSII) or multiple daily injections of insulin (MDI). The results showed substantial benefits
associated with the use of rtCGM in adults of all ages, as long as participants in the studies
continued to use the device [32]. Few studies have evaluated the effect of rtCGM compared
with usual care in people with T2DM [27,33] or in pregnant women with T1DM on intensive
insulin regimen [34], with encouraging results.
Studies focusing on isCGM are more limited. However, there is evidence that isCGM
with optional alarms is associated with a reduction in HbA1c in people with T1DM [35]
and a decreased rate of hypoglycemia in T2DM [36,37]. Emerging evidence associates the
use of isCGM with the reduction in diabetes-related events and all-cause hospitalizations
in PwD following therapies with less intensive insulin regimen or glucose-lowering oral
drugs [38,39]. Moreover, a meta-analysis of RCTs reported that, in T1DM and T2DM, both
rtCGM and isCGM are associated with a modest reduction in HbA1c (−0.2%) with an over-
all increase in TIR of 70 min and fewer episodes of hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia [40].
Finally, T1DM, T2DM, pregnancy during intensive insulin therapy, monitoring during
regular physical exercise, new onset of diabetes, and frailty have been recognized as the
clinical scenarios best fitting the need for using rtCGM or isCGM, regardless of baseline
HbA1c or individualized HbA1c target [41].
3.2.2. Connected Insulin Pens
“Connected” insulin pens are devices capable of automatically transmitting data via
Bluetooth to management apps on smartphones, representing a new valuable frontier for
MDI therapy. These pens include tracking insulin pens (TIPs) and smart insulin pens
(SIPs). TIPs record the last dose of insulin administered by the device and offer reminders
for insulin doses through cloud connectivity. SIPs integrate data such as glucose and
carbohydrates from other technological devices or apps, elaborate reports that can be
shared with HCPs and provide clinical decision support through an automated insulin
dose calculator based on individualized insulin therapy settings.
Emerging evidence suggests that the use of connected insulin pens is associated
with increased TIR and fewer missed boluses in T1DM treated with a basal-bolus insulin
regimen [42], indicating a beneficial impact on glucose control and dosing behavior [43].
In a cost-effectiveness analysis, the use of SIPs was associated with a per-patient
improvement of 0.90 years in mean life expectancy and an increased 1.15 quality-adjusted
life-years, along with mean cost savings over standard care [44]. These results were
mainly driven by a lower frequency and delayed onset of complications. Moreover, the
lower number of severe hypoglycemia events observed when these devices are used in

J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 4240
7 of 19
combination with CGM may further contribute to the potential beneficial economic impact
of SIPs [45].
3.2.3. Automatic Insulin Delivery
AID systems include technologies that integrate data from CGM, insulin pumps and
control algorithms to automatically regulate subcutaneous insulin delivery. The earlier
AID system included insulin pumps with automated suspension of insulin delivery at
low glucose levels (low glucose suspend, LGS) or for predictive hypoglycemia (predictive
low glucose suspend, PLGS). These technologies initially enabled the glucose-responsive
regulation of insulin delivery to address hypoglycemia [46,47].
The most recent closed-loop technology currently available is the advanced hybrid
closed-loop system, which automatically and continually modulate basal insulin delivery
in response to sensor glucose levels. It can also deliver automatic correction boluses in
case of glycemic spikes but still requires the manual entry of carbohydrates consumed to
calculate prandial doses. The “full” AID will automatically adjust all the required insulin,
including prandial insulin at meals.
Studies focusing on various AID systems with different algorithms, pumps, and sen-
sors have been conducted in both adults and children with diabetes [48–51]. Meta-analysis
of RCTs provides evidence that AID systems may improve TIR, reduce hyperglycemia
and hypoglycemia and modestly decrease HbA1c levels, compared with control therapy
(conventional pump therapy or sensor-augmented pump therapy) [52,53]. PwD preference
and the selection of individuals (and caregivers) capable of safely and effectively using
the devices are relevant aspects for a valuable and effective therapy with AIDs [20,54].
This scenario is currently expanding with the advent of “Do-it-yourself” AID systems,
which use commercially available CGM systems and insulin pumps combined with an
open-source algorithm [54].
3.2.4. Digital Health Apps
The recent and rapid progress in the field of diabetes technologies has led to the
development of numerous mobile apps intended to increase the self-management abilities
of PwD, facilitate communication between PwD and HCPs and improve compliance with
tailored treatment. These Apps may help PwD improve health outcomes by supporting
healthy behaviors, promoting glucose monitoring, assisting with result interpretation,
guiding medication change, providing alerts for blood glucose variation, and ultimately,
reducing complications.
The most commonly used digital health apps in diabetes care can be divided into
three categories: 1. Apps used for tracking health and wellness, 2. apps acting as stand-
alone medical devices, and 3. apps that display, download, share and/or use data from
devices involved in self-blood glucose monitoring, CGM, insulin pumps or integrated
system of insulin delivery and CGM, such as AID or artificial pancreas.
Apps used for tracking wellness include both nutrition and physical activity apps.
These tools enable users to check the energy content of food, serve as nutrition tracker
or food diary, support in planning meals and insulin dosing [55], monitor daily physical
activity, count calories and set goals for exercise and weight management [56].
Glucose monitoring apps offer the possibility to aggregate data often derived from
an external device (i.e., a glucometer or a CGM) and build graphs to show glucose trends.
These apps are frequently integrated with a “bolus calculator”, which allows PwD to estab-
lish the insulin dose in response to the carbohydrate content of each meal, the basal insulin
dose or correction doses needed in case of sudden glucose spikes. Apps supporting insulin
delivery are connected to pens or insulin pumps to collect and display data, suggest boluses,

J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 4240
8 of 19
download insulin and glucose data, providing a comprehensive overview for decision
assistance. Finally, AID systems consist of a CGM, an insulin pump and an algorithm that
adjust the basal insulin rate or provide automatic correction boluses (advanced closed loop)
based on glucose levels captured by the sensor on patients [54].
Several clinical trials focusing on interventions based on apps to manage diabetes
have been conducted in various population, including in children and adolescents with
T1DM [57,58], adults with both T1DM and T2DM [59–62] and women with pregnancy
diabetes [63].
Most studies identified the reduction in HbA1c as the primary outcome associated with
the use of apps, compared with control strategies [59–62,64]. In many cases, the improve-
ment of glycemic outcomes was enhanced with healthcare professional feedback [60,62,64]
highlighting the importance of creating connections and sharing data between PwD and
HCPs for an effective care process. The main limitation of these studies were the short
duration of the intervention and the relatively small number of participants. Moreover,
there is evidence suggesting that mobile app intervention may have beneficial impacts on
medication adherence and glycemic parameters in people with T2DM [65].
However, since mobile apps designed for health and wellness are largely unregulated,
there is need for regulation, standardization, and quality control, to promote a safe and
effective approach, increase patient engagement, and improve disease outcomes [66].
3.2.5. Websites and Cloud-Upload Technologies
Websites and cloud-upload technologies represent a relatively recent opportunity for
managing diabetes remotely. This is further emphasized by the growing adoption of blood
glucose monitoring systems (self-blood glucose monitoring (SBGM), isCGM, rtCGM) in
clinical practice. These systems have significantly contributed to diabetes management,
regardless of the type of glucose-lowering treatment, whether MDI or CSII [40,41].
Glucose monitoring data can be collected over time and sent to the cloud to review
summary statistics and recognize trends of glucose levels. Downloading these data may
help HCPs provide individualized recommendations for therapy, evaluate the efficacy of
glucose-lowering therapy and educate patients on interventions that can improve their
clinical status. In addition, remote monitoring represents a valuable strategy to intervene
promptly with appropriate and immediate feedback providing treatment modification
if needed.
Tools for downloading data include software and web-based platforms that are ac-
cessible by both PwD or HCPs. Data are typically summarized in tables, charts or graphs
that report patterns and trends in blood glucose levels. Additionally, information on
meals, insulin doses, and physical activity can also be visualized. PwD may link their
personal accounts to HCP’s professional account for data sharing and remotely reviewing
the information.
Downloading and reviewing glucose data through web-based platforms have been
associated with a significant reduction in HbA1c in RCTs [67–69]. Evidence from clinical
trials also suggests that telemonitoring in people with T2DM leads to improvement in
diabetes control [70–72], comorbidities [71,73] and a better quality of life [73,74]. Moreover,
a recent meta-analysis of 30 RCTs, including 4678 PwD, reported that system practical-
ity, user engagement, patient characteristics and disease education are the main factors
influencing the effect of telemonitoring on glucose control [70].
3.2.6. Televisits
A higher frequency of visits has been associated by Kaufman and colleagues with a
better control of HbA1c [75]. Indeed, results of their 3-year study showed a significantly

J. Clin. Med. 2025, 14, 4240
9 of 19
lower HbA1C value for patients with 3–4 visits per year, compared to those with only 1 or
2 visits. On this basis, it should be mandatory to improve patients’ adherence to follow-up.
For patients skipping appointments for reasons like work, school or distance from DM
centers, telemedicine could be a suitable tool to overcome such obstacles.
The promising results of telemedicine for diabetes management were already investi-
gated prior to the COVID-19 pandemic. Kassar et al. [76] conducted a study on 106 inmates
with diabetes who agreed to remote visits with experienced endocrinologists, amounting
to a total of 264 televisits. At the end of the follow-up, there was an improvement in HbA1c
levels in more than half of the patients, as well as better control of cardiovascular risk
factors such as hypertension and hyperlipidemia. A pre-pandemic study conducted by
Tonyushkina and colleagues [77] recruited 10 young patients with DMT1 to attend remote
monitoring visits. At the end of each televisit, which took 25 to 45 min, the diabetologist
informed the patients about any therapeutic and lifestyle adjustments. Although no sig-
nificant changes in HbA1c values were recorded, all patients were very satisfied with the
telemedicine visits and wanted to continue clinical follow-up with the same modality.
The COVID-19 pandemic made it impossible for many patients with chronic diseases
to attend their regular check-ups at their referral centers. As a result, the number of remote
visits increased considerably, leading consequentially to an increasing number of studies
on the issue with a wider number of participants. A survey of approximately 1300 patients
who performed at least one televisit for clinical therapeutic management of diabetes showed
an overall satisfaction with remote visits [78].
Another study [79] conducted on patients with both T1DM and T2DM investigated
patients’ satisfaction with telemedicine visits. Of 111 patients, 82% were pleased with the
telehealth modality and 69% were interested in continuing in remote mode even after the
emergency status had ceased.
An anonymous questionnaire [80], including questions about the use and perception
of telemedicine in the management of diabetes during the COVID-19 pandemic, was
administered via social media in about 40 countries. A large percentage of responders
(67%) said they had consulted their doctor remotely since the pandemic began, a significant
increase from the 28% reported in a similar survey in 2020; furthermore, 83% of responders
considered remote appointments useful.
3.3. Management of Diabetes Complications
Risk Factors
Common cardio-metabolic risk factors in patients with diabetes are represented by
hypertension and hyperlipidemia (or hypercholesterolemia) and in recent years, their co-
prevalence has been increasing more and more [81]. Several interventions in telemedicine
have proved to significantly improve systolic and diastolic blood pressure, triglycerides,
and total cholesterol serum levels [82].
Telehealth could be used to help reach the objective of reducing high cholesterol level
by 1. checking tolerability when starting treatment with anti-diabetic drugs; 2. real-time
monitoring of LDL cholesterol levels to ensure that the ongoing anti-diabetic treatment
and a proper diet are effective in controlling the disease; 3. providing opportunities to
discuss cost concerns and treatment alternatives; and 4. setting goals for healthy lifestyle
changes [83].
A RCT showed that telemedicine, through home blood pressure monitoring and
remote consultations, can improve blood pressure control and treatment adherence by
facilitating timely therapeutic adjustments and reducing logistical barriers to in-person
care [84]. By allowing the exchange of clinical data in either a synchronous or asynchronous
way and by enabling remote visits, telemedicine enabled clinicians to make treatment

changes at a distance, thus saving the time required to travel to the hospital and the waiting
time prior to the visit [84].
Salisbury and colleagues [85] have proved that people at high risk of cardiovascular
diseases who received telehealth monitoring combined with in-office visits have slightly
improved their adherence to diet, exercise and medication usage and have better satisfaction
with medical care when compared with people using in-person follow up alone.
A recent cross-sectional study [83] of 375 newly diagnosed T2DM patients has shown
that telemedicine, in addition to standard antidiabetic therapy, helped reduce LDL choles-
terol levels (110 mg/dL vs. 93.1 mg/dL, p < 0.001). Notably, the intervention group relied
on messaging software through which they were able to keep in touch with a diabetologist
and send him/her daily photos of meals and glucose values. Likewise, the clinician used
this application to contact patients to make therapeutic changes or provide advice on diet
and lifestyle.
3.4. Reduction in Diabetic Complications
3.4.1. Stroke and Cardiovascular Diseases
A meta-analysis conducted by Lieber and colleagues [86] evaluated five clinical trials
to assess the role of telemedicine in reducing HbA1c levels in post-stroke PwD. Compliance
with diabetes treatment regimens is associated with an improvement in HbA1c blood levels
and therefore, a reduction in mortality and morbidity. The enrolled patients had a digital
glucometer transmitting data to the clinic at different frequencies. Four out of the five trials
showed a greater reduction in HbA1c in the intervention group using telemedicine than in
the traditional control group. Furthermore, in the group receiving remote consultations,
there was a greater propensity to adjust treatment to achieve better glycemic control [86].
Moreover, another meta-analysis of 55 RCTs including people with T1DM (15 RTCs),
T2DM (31 RTCs) or both types of diabetes (9 RCTs), revealed that when patients use
telemedicine programs, better glucose monitoring was reached, with a substantial reduction
in HbA1c levels compared to patients not using telemedicine programs [82]. A subgroup
analysis according to diabetes type showed that T2DM patients had a significantly greater
reduction in HbA1c than those with type 1 diabetes [82].
3.4.2. Diabetic Neuropathy and Diabetic Foot Syndrome
Telehealth may allow self-monitoring of foot health status for preventative, diag-
nostic and therapeutic purposes. Different approaches are available such as audio-video
consultation, photographic imaging, dermal thermography and hyperspectral imaging.
Two RCTs [87,88] compared the effect of phone/online platform tools on ulcer healing,
amputation and death with standard care. In detail, Rassmussen and colleagues [87]
evaluated the effectiveness of audio-video consultation in addition to outpatient visits on
ulcer healing compared to standard care. Smith-Strøm et al. [88] compared a weekly phone
and interactive web-based ulcer record consultation in addition to outpatient visits (every
6 weeks) to standard care (outpatient visit every 2 weeks). Both studies found no differences
between the two groups in amputation and healing time, highlighting the non-inferiority of
telemedicine over its traditional counterpart. A secondary outcome study of the Norwegian
trial [89] explored the changes in self-reported quality of life and well-being in patients
with diabetic foot receiving the telemedicine intervention compared to those receiving
standard care and found no differences between the two groups. Further, patients reported
outcome measures were found to be stable overtime (from baseline to several assessment
time-points). In line with this evidence, two non-randomized studies [90,91] comparing
video consultation with in-person outpatient visit found no difference in ulcer healing
between the two approaches.

Remote ulcer area measurement from photographs could allow a continuous and
reliable monitoring of ulcer evolution. Two studies [92,93] revealed a strong associa-
tion between remote and live assessments of ulcer area (correlation coefficient > 0.95).
Further two studies [94,95] reported a lower inter-observer variability in ulcer area mea-
surement from a photograph compared to live assessment. Hazenberg and colleagues [96]
found good feasibility and perceived usability of photographic ulcer assessment. Re-
sults of their study showed a good reliability of the combination of photographic assess-
ment and infrared thermography in the diagnosis of foot infection (sensitivity > 60% and
specificity > 79%). They also found that the combined use of both techniques was more
reliable than each one on its own.
Foot temperature alteration in DFS are the results of compromised thermoregulation
due to both peripheral arterial disease and neuropathy. It can be estimated through dif-
ferent techniques: temperature sensors based on thermistor, infrared thermography and
liquid–crystal thermography. Four RCTs [97–100] explored the effectiveness of infrared
thermography in ulcer prevention. Patients allocated to the intervention group were in-
structed to measure foot temperature in six different locations per foot, daily. Patients were
invited to contact the HCP in case they revealed a 2.2 ◦C temperature difference between
the left and the right foot in the same location for at least two consecutive days. Patients in
the control group received traditional monitoring that did not include temperature moni-
toring. Three studies out of four [97–99], including, respectively, 85, 225 and 173 patients
found a significant reduction in ulceration or recurrent ulcer rate in the intervention group
compared to the control one (respectively: p = 0.01; p = 0.038; p = 0.0046). The fourth
study [100] did not find any significant difference between the two groups (p = 0.532);
however, the sample size of the patients was not as large as that reported in the other
studies (45 patients).
The effectiveness of liquid–crystal thermography in ulcer prevention and diagnosis
was explored only in three small clinical studies [101–103]. No studies are available on
patients suffering from diabetes, suggesting a low applicability. Therefore, available data
does not allow any reliable conclusion. Only one study [104] explored the diagnostic
effectiveness of a wireless temperature sensor based on a thermistor and found that using
a temperature difference between the two sides of 2.2 ◦C as cut off, the tool correctly
recognized 97% of diabetic foot ulcers. However, the authors also found a high rate of
false-positives (specificity of 43%). Even in this case the available data did not allow the
researchers to reach a conclusion.
Hyperspectral imaging is a technique that measures tissue oxygenation levels and
generate maps of microcirculatory changes through the collection and processing of in-
formation of the near-infrared range of the electromagnetic spectrum. Four case–control
studies [105–108] on ulcers before healing revealed a reduction in oxyhemoglobin level
in healed ulcers compared to no change in oxyhemoglobin level in non-healed ulcers.
Conversely, three case–control studies [109–111] explored the specificity and sensitivity of
hyperspectral imaging for prediction of ulcer healing. The first two [110,111] found a sensi-
tivity, respectively, of 93% and 80% and specificity of 86 and 74% to predict ulcers healing
in 24 weeks; conversely, the third one [109] found a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of
86% in one month.
3.4.3. Mental Illness
Mental illness is considered to play a key role among the risk factors of chronic dis-
eases; comorbid depression predicts the onset and progression of several chronic diseases.
Indeed, having strong coping mechanisms such as emotional expression, acceptance of
the condition and problem solving was associated with a better quality of life and lower

12 of 19
HbA1c levels [112]. Conversely, low scores on the PROMIS, a questionnaire assessing
several aspects of the quality of life, were associated with depression and less frequent
blood glucose checks [113].
A systematic review [114] including seventeen RCTs evaluated the effectiveness of
digital tools in mental illness management in chronic diseases such as cardiovascular
diseases, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), stroke and diabetes. The studies
included in the review described different types of tele-interventions; several offered digital
educational content specific to the disease along with lifestyle advice and recommendations;
others included telemonitoring applications for symptoms of depression; finally, some
also provided remote psychotherapy interventions. Study results revealed a moderate
beneficial effect on depression outcomes. Moreover, patients suffering from both COPD
and diabetes received a higher benefit from the interventions compared to those affected
by cardiovascular diseases and stroke.
4. Conclusions
In this narrative review, we have highlighted the established yet ever-growing role of
telemedicine in the management of diabetes, covering daily management of risk factors
and complications and the administration of antidiabetic therapy. The presented stud-
ies revealed an overall satisfaction among PwD and their caregivers regarding remote
telemedicine management. Telehealth has demonstrated the capability to provide a fully
patient-centered approach to disease management through highly personalized manage-
ment plans. This has led to improved adherence to appropriate therapy and lifestyle,
ultimately contributing to better quality of life.
Whilst telemedicine has clearly a wide spectrum of potential benefits, it also presents
challenges that must be addressed. Firstly, many elements of the traditional approach may
be missing. Physical presence and emotional connection may be limited by remote visits,
and a complete objective examination may not always be possible due to technological
constraints. Furthermore, real-world implementation faces additional barriers, including
disparities in access to digital tools, particularly in rural or underserved areas. Inadequate
broadband coverage and unaffordable costs of digital tools may prevent equitable access to
telemedicine, reinforcing the existing disparities known as the digital divide. Moreover,
limited digital literacy, whether due to age, educational background, or sensory or cognitive
impairments, can represent a significant barrier to telemedicine access. Concerns about data
privacy, cybersecurity, and unclear reimbursement policies further complicate integration
into standard care models. Finally, other limitations are represented by the lack of standard-
ized protocols of intervention, the lack of regulation and reimbursement guidelines and the
limited validation of the digital devices in non-English languages. Although telemedicine
is already widely implemented, its future potential lies in enabling fully patient-centered
care, bringing diabetes management closer to the patient’s home.
At present telemedicine represents a valuable tool for managing diabetes and its
related risk factors and complications. However certain aspects of care may still benefit
from in-person interaction. For now, the best approach remains a balanced integration of
telemedicine and face-to-face consultations to achieve the best possible treatment and an
improved quality of life.
