## Abstract
Abstract
            
              In adaptive treatment strategies, the treatment level and type is repeatedly adjusted according to ongoing individual response. Since past treatment may have delayed effects, the development of these treatment strategies is challenging. This paper advocates the use of sequential multiple assignment randomized trials in the development of adaptive treatment strategies. Both a simple

              method for ascertaining sample sizes and simple analysis methods are provided. Copyright Â© 2004 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.
