## Abstract
Abstract
            
              Background
              Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) provides insight into the effectiveness and feasibility of smoking-related interventions.
            
            
              Objective
              The objective of this paper was to assess adherence to an EMA protocol and compare EMA-derived responses with measures collected through multiple surveys.
            
            
              Methods
              
                A subanalysis was conducted using data from a 12-week, open-label, and 2-arm pilot randomized clinical trial among adult smokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, or asthma in the last 12 months (n=109). Participants were randomized to either electronic cigarette (EC) or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) treatment arms. We compared EMA data collected through automated SMS text message prompts sent to participants 4 times daily for 12 weeks, including cigarettes smoked per day (CPD), craving, and satisfaction, to survey data collected at 12 weeks. Convergent validity between survey- and EMA-reported measures was evaluated using Pearson correlation and paired
                t
                tests. CPD was modeled using negative binomial regression. Relative rates (RRs) of reaching at least 50%, 75%, and 100% CPD reduction between two arms were calculated using both EMA and survey data.
              
            
            
              Results
              
                The majority of participants were non-Hispanic White (63/109, 58%) and female (60/109, 55%), and had a median age of 60 (IQR 54‚Äê65) years. Among the 109 participants, 59.6% (n=65) were consistently adherent to the EMA protocol over the 12-week period. Median weekly EMA response rate remained high over the 12-week study period even though a modest decline was observed (week 1, 97.8% and week 12, 89.4%). The mean CPD declined significantly (week 1, mean 14.2, SD 9.9 and week 12, mean 4.6, SD 6.7;
                P
                <.001). EMA-derived and survey-based CPD measurements were positively correlated (
                r
                =0.73, 95% CI 0.6-0.82) as were measures of craving (
                r
                =0.38, 95% CI 0.17-0.56). No significant paired difference in CPD was observed between EMA measurements and surveys. A significant effect of time on CPD EMA data (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1-week change 0.93;
                P
                <.01) and survey data was found (IRR 12-week change 0.36;
                P
                <.01). However, the treatment effect was not significant, which aligned with the RR results. An increase in the EC consumption was observed over time in the EC arm, with 12.1% (7/58) fully switched to EC (defined as CPD=0 and EC use>0) and 20.7% (12/58) mostly switched (defined as a reduction in CPD>75% and EC use>0) in week 12.
              
            
            
              Conclusions
              EMA is a suitable method to collect recall-based smoking-related data. Though results from mixed effect modeling and RR comparisons were similar using EMA or survey data, EMA provides unique advantages, namely greater granularity in the time and the capability to detect switching patterns in near real time. These findings provide the feasibility of using EMA in developing smoking cessation interventions in future tobacco harm reduction research.
