## Abstract
Hypertension is a growing public challenge as a leading risk factor for cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality. Reducing overall cardiovascular risk through early screening, initiation of treatment and ongoing monitoring remains a priority in the comprehensive management of hypertension and its complications. Community nurses are ideally positioned to play a crucial role in the early detection of hypertension and providing support for its management. Wearable cuffless devices have the potential for continuous remote blood pressure monitoring. However, there is not enough literature on the validity and usability of wearable cuffless blood pressure devices to justify their use in clinical practice. This commentary critically appraises a systematic review designed to assess the validity, features and clinical usability of wearable cuffless devices, and expands on its findings and their relevance to community nursing and future research.
