## Abstract
ObjectiveTo evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of a personalised telehealth intervention to support dietary self-management in adults with stage 3–4 chronic kidney disease (CKD).DesignMixed-methods process evaluation embedded in a randomised controlled trial.ParticipantsPeople with stage 3–4 CKD (estimated glomerular filtration rate [eGFR]15–60 mL/min/1.73 m2).SettingParticipants were recruited from three hospitals in Australia and completed the intervention in ambulatory community settings.InterventionThe intervention group received one telephone call per fortnight and 2–8 tailored text messages for 3 months, and then 4–12 tailored text messages for 3 months without telephone calls. The control group received usual care for 3 months then non-tailored education-only text messages for 3 months.Main outcome measuresFeasibility (recruitment, non-participation and retention rates, intervention fidelity and participant adherence) and acceptability (questionnaire and semistructured interviews).Statistical analyses performedDescriptive statistics and qualitative content analysis.ResultsOverall, 80/230 (35%) eligible patients who were approached consented to participate (mean±SD age 61.5±12.6 years). Retention was 93% and 98% in the intervention and control groups, respectively, and 96% of all planned intervention calls were completed. All participants in the intervention arm identified the tailored text messages as useful in supporting dietary self-management. In the control group, 27 (69%) reported the non-tailored text messages were useful in supporting change. Intervention group participants reported that the telehealth programme delivery methods were practical and able to be integrated into their lifestyle. Participants viewed the intervention as an acceptable, personalised alternative to face-face clinic consultations, and were satisfied with the frequency of contact.ConclusionsThis telehealth-delivered dietary coaching programme is an acceptable intervention which appears feasible for supporting dietary self-management in stage 3–4 CKD. A larger-scale randomised controlled trial is needed to evaluate the efficacy of the coaching programme on clinical and patient-reported outcomes.Trial registration numberACTRN12616001212448; Results.
