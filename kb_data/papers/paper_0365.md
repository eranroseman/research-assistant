## Abstract
Objective
              Smartphone apps (apps) are widely recognised as promising tools for improving access to mental healthcare. However, a key challenge is the development of digital interventions that are acceptable to end users. Co-production with providers and stakeholders is increasingly positioned as the gold standard for improving uptake, engagement, and healthcare outcomes. Nevertheless, clear guidance around the process of co-production is lacking. The objectives of this review were to: (i) present an overview of the methods and approaches to co-production when designing, producing, and evaluating digital mental health interventions; and (ii) explore the barriers and facilitators affecting co-production in this context.
            
            
              Methods
              A pre-registered (CRD42023414007) systematic review was completed in accordance with The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Five databases were searched. A co-produced bespoke quality appraisal tool was developed with an expert by experience to assess the quality of the co-production methods and approaches. A narrative synthesis was conducted.
            
            
              Results
              Twenty-six studies across 24 digital mental health interventions met inclusion criteria. App interventions were rarely co-produced with end users throughout all stages of design, development, and evaluation. Co-producing digital mental health interventions added value by creating culturally sensitive and acceptable interventions. Reported challenges included resource issues exacerbated by the digital nature of the intervention, variability across stakeholder suggestions, and power imbalances between stakeholders and researchers.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Variation in approaches to co-producing digital mental health interventions is evident, with inconsistencies between stakeholder groups involved, stage of involvement, stakeholdersâ€™ roles and methods employed.
