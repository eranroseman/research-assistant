## Abstract
Those suffering with serious mental illness (SMI), such as psychotic disorders, experience life expectancy 15 years shorter than the general population. Cardiovascular disease is the biggest cause of death in those with psychotic disease and many risk factors may be limited by healthy lifestyle choices. Text messaging interventions represent mobile health (mHealth), a nascent way to deliver physical health care to those suffering with a psychotic disorder. This paper aims to review the literature on the feasibility of text messaging to support the delivery of physical health care in those with a psychotic disorder. A thorough electronic database literature review of Medline via Ovid, Embase, APA Psycinfo, Scopus, Cochrane and Web of Science was conducted. Articles were included if text messaging was used as an intervention targeting the physical health of patients with psychotic disorders. A final sample of 11 articles satisfied the eligibility criteria, of which, 3 were ongoing randomised controlled trials. Of the 8 completed trials, all demonstrated the promising feasibility of text messaging, assessed via quotes, conversation samples, response rates, questionnaires or directly based on physical results. 36% of studies analysed those with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, 55% with SMI and 9% with schizophrenia and psychotic disorders, mood disorders or anxiety disorders. Text messaging was used as motivation or reminders (91%), service delivery (27%) or social support (27%) with studies targeting multiple themes simultaneously. This review highlights compelling evidence for the feasibility of text messaging for improvement of physical health in those suffering with psychotic disorders.
