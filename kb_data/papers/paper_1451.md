## Abstract
Over the past quarter-century, mobile health (mHealth) technologies have experienced significant changes in adoption rates, adaptation strategies, and instances of abandonment. Understanding the underlying factors driving these trends is essential for optimizing the design, implementation, and sustainability of interventions using these technologies. The evolution of mHealth adoption has followed a progressive trajectory, starting with cautious exploration and later accelerating due to technological advancements, increased smartphone penetration, and growing acceptance of digital health solutions by both health care providers and patients. However, alongside widespread adoption, challenges related to usability, interoperability, privacy concerns, and socioeconomic disparities have emerged, necessitating ongoing adaptation efforts. While many mHealth initiatives have successfully adapted to address these challenges, technology abandonment remains common, often due to unsustainable business models, inadequate user engagement, and insufficient evidence of effectiveness. This paper utilizes the Nonadoption, Abandonment, Scale-Up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework to examine the interplay between the academic and industry sectors in patterns of adoption, adaptation, and abandonment, using 3 major mHealth innovations as examples: health-related SMS text messaging, mobile apps and wearables, and social media for health communication. Health SMS text messaging has demonstrated significant potential as a tool for health promotion, disease management, and patient engagement. The proliferation of mobile apps and devices has facilitated a shift from in-person and in-clinic practices to mobile- and wearable-centric solutions, encompassing everything from simple activity trackers to advanced health monitoring devices. Social media, initially characterized by basic text-based interactions in chat rooms and online forums, underwent a paradigm shift with the emergence of platforms such as MySpace and Facebook. This transition ushered in an era of mass communication through social media. The rise of microblogging and visually focused platforms such as Twitter(now X), Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok, along with the integration of live streaming and augmented reality features, exemplifies the ongoing innovation within the social media landscape. Over the past 25 years, there have been remarkable strides in the adoption and adaptation of mHealth technologies, driven by technological innovation and a growing recognition of their potential to revolutionize health care delivery. Each mobile technology uniquely enhances public health and health care by catering to different user needs. SMS text messaging offers wide accessibility and proven effectiveness, while mobile apps and wearables provide comprehensive functionalities for more in-depth health management. Social media platforms amplify these efforts with their vast reach and community-building potential, making it essential to select the right tool for specific health interventions to maximize impact and engagement. Nevertheless, continued efforts are needed to address persistent challenges and mitigate instances of abandonment, ensuring that mHealth interventions reach their full potential in improving health outcomes and advancing equitable access to care.
