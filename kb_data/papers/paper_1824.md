## Abstract
Abstract                Background                Wearable activity trackers hold the potential for enhancing health and fitness, but the use of wearable activity trackers has remained largely unexplored in older adults. The purpose of the current study was to examine the effectiveness and acceptability of wearable activity trackers for promoting physical activity (PA) in older adults living in retirement communities.                              Methods                Forty older adult participants (mean age = 85.4 years) used a wearable activity tracker (Fitbit InspireHR) for 12 weeks. Participants were provided with personalized activity goals and weekly feedback of PA during the 12 weeks. The main outcomes were daily step counts collected at baseline and the end of the intervention, and participants’ experiences of using the wearable activity tracker assessed after the 12-week intervention through an 8-item questionnaire and individual interviews.                              Results                Participants used the activity tracker on 97.5% of measured days and had an average increase of 900 steps/day (p < 0.001). The Acceptance questionnaire revealed that the wearable activity tracker was acceptable, useful, and easy to use. Participants found that wearable activity trackers helped improve self-awareness and motivation of PA but reported a few concerns regarding the comfort of wearing the activity trackers and the ease of reading visual feedback.                              Conclusions                Wearable activity trackers lead to a small but significant increase of PA and are perceived as acceptable and useful in older adults. Given the rapidly growing older population, wearable activity trackers are promising tools that could be used in large-scale interventions to improve PA and health in older adults.
