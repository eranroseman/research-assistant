## Abstract
Technology plays a role in nearly every aspect of healthcare delivery. Health systems must continually invest in new and existing technology and analytics platforms to scale initiatives, enable innovation, and achieve interoperability to meet the needs and expectations of patients and clinicians while remaining focused on the organization’s mission and strategic priorities. In this process, decision-makers must determine how to allocate technological resources to platforms that meet clinical and administrative needs while reducing the need for frequent replacement or reconfiguration. Advances in artificial intelligence and its capabilities add urgency and complexity to technology investment decisions. An important consideration during this process is when to build new technology infrastructure and when to partner with existing companies and buy technology solutions. This case study explores a major academic medical center’s approach to that decision, including the factors that influenced it and the outcomes of two solutions that were developed in-house.
