## Abstract
Approximately 28% of American adults meet both the physical activity (PA) and strength training guidelines despite the numerous health benefits associated with a physically active lifestyle. The purpose of this paper is to provide an update of the 2017 Society of Behavioral Medicine PA Special Interest Group article that outlined future directions in sedentary time reduction interventions, technology-based PA interventions, and the dissemination and implementation of PA interventions. Since the prior review, there has been significant progress on effective interventions for reducing sedentary time. However, there has been less progress for improving the specificity of sedentary time guidelines. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of studies examining PA mHealth interventions and support for mHealth intervention has generally been positive, though sustaining engagement in mHealth interventions remains a challenge. Promising newer technologies that have been explored more extensively since the prior review including artificial intelligence (AI). Knowledge of how to implement and scale-up effective PA interventions has also increased. Several current trends in PA intervention research that continue to advance the field include examining the moderating effect of the built environment on the effectiveness of behavioral interventions, cultural tailoring of interventions, Just in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs), and exercise snacks (vigorous intensity PA sessions that are less than one minute). Overall, there has been significant progress in the PA intervention field but significant work remains for creating effective interventions that can be readily implemented into real world settings.
