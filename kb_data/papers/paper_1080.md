## Abstract
Prescribing more opioids than patients need following surgery is associated with long-term use, misuse, and diversion. Interventions are needed to increase adherence to procedure-specific guidelines while preserving the ability to manage pain.To test whether providing clinicians monthly feedback with peer comparisons and patient-reported outcomes would increase adherence to postoperative opioid prescribing guidelines.This stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted at 6 surgical departments or divisions caring for patients undergoing 30 high-volume surgical procedures in a 5-hospital academic health system in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Surgical clinicians (attending surgeons, advanced practice professionals, and resident physicians) with 5 or more opioid prescriptions per month for eligible procedures during a 3-month period at baseline were eligible for inclusion. Six clinician clusters were randomly assigned to the intervention in 3 steps offset by 2 months. Each step included a 9-month baseline, a 6-month intervention, and a 6-month follow-up. The first step of the intervention began on June 8, 2022. Follow-up concluded in October 2023, and data analysis was performed from November 2023 to April 2024.Clinicians were emailed a report on their most frequently performed procedures, which contained a figure of the following mean numbers: pills prescribed relative to guidelines, pills peer clinicians prescribed, and pills patients reported using after a procedure; an additional figure displayed patients’ self-reported ability to manage pain. Monthly reports included prescribing trends, peer comparison feedback, and reminders about how many pills patients take and how well patients reported pain management with guideline-adherent prescriptions.The primary outcome was the proportion of guideline-adherent opioid prescriptions; secondary outcomes included patient-reported ability to manage pain (measured on a 0 to 10 scale, with 0 being not at all able), pain score, pills prescribed, pills leftover, and refill rate.A total of 143 surgical clinicians treating 20 557 patients were included (10 069 at baseline, 5382 during the intervention, and 5106 at follow-up). Mean (SD) patient age was 57.0 (15.7) years, and 10 996 patients (53.5%) were female. The baseline guideline adherence rate was 57.2%. During the intervention, adherence increased to 71.8%, with an adjusted intervention effect of 5.3% (95% CI, 2.0%-8.7%). The impact of the intervention increased over time, and adherence remained above baseline at follow-up (74.4%). The largest change was noted for orthopedic procedures of knee, hip, and shoulder arthroplasty. Patient-reported pain and ability to manage pain were unchanged.In this stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial, a feedback intervention using peer comparisons and patient-reported data increased opioid guideline adherence without compromising patients’ ability to manage pain.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05358522
