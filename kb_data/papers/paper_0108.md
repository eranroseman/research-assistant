## Abstract
Background: Global obesity prevalence among pregnant women is associated with adverse health outcomes for both the mother and the infant.
Objective: This study aims to evaluate the eﬃcacy of a behavioural intervention management model for controlling gestational weight gain (GWG) in pregnant women with overweight or obesity.
Methods: The quality of the evidence was assessed using the Conﬁdence In Network Meta-Analysis technique. Moreover, a Bayesian network metaanalysis summarised the comparative eﬃcacy of various intervention methods on GWG outcomes.
Results: The analysis included 24 trials with 11,008 participants across three diﬀerent management models: in-person, remote (electronic health (eHealth) or mobile health (mHealth)), and mixed. Evidence quality ranged from very low to high. The multi-behavioural intervention delivered via a blended in-person and mHealth model demonstrated the highest likelihood of being in the top ranks of intervention eﬀectiveness compared to the other interventions included in the analysis, scoring 85.9%.
Conclusions: The multi-behavioural intervention delivered via a blended in-person and mHealth administration mode ranked highest in eﬀectiveness for reducing GWG in pregnant women with overweight or obesity compared to the other interventions included in the analysis. Future studies may focus on addressing evidence gaps through more rigorous and direct comparative analyses.
