## Abstract
An alcohol dehydrogenase linked to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide and requiring glutathione has been isolated and partially purified from two methanol-assimilating yeasts. It differs from previously described methanol-oxidizing enzymes in pH optima, electron acceptor specificity, substrate specificity, inhibition pattern, and stability.
