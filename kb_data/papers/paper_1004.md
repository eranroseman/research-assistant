## Abstract
Abstract   To diagnose hypertension, multiple blood pressure (BP) measurements are recommended. We randomized patients into threegroups: EMR–only (patients recorded BP measurements in an electronic medical record [EMR] web portal), EMR+reminders (patients were sent text message reminders to record their BP measurements in the EMR), and bi–directional text messaging (patients were sent a text message asking them to respond with their current BP). Subjects were asked to complete 14 measurements. Automated messages were sent to each patient in the bi–directional text messaging and EMR+reminder groups twice daily. Among 121 patients, those in the bi–directional text messaging group reported the full 14 measurements more often than both the EMR–only group ( P  P =.038). Also, the EMR+reminders group outperformed the EMR–only group ( P
