## Abstract
Measurements: Change in HbA1c level at 6 months.
Results: Mentors and mentees talked the most in the first month (mean calls, 4; range, 0 to 30), but calls decreased to a mean of 2 calls (range, 0 to 10) by the sixth month. Levels of HbA1c decreased from 9.9% to 9.8% in the control group, from 9.8% to 8.7% in the peer mentor group, and from 9.5% to 9.1% in the financial incentive group. Mean change in HbA1c level from baseline to 6 months relative to control was 1.07% (95% CI, 1.84% to 0.31%) in the peer mentor group and 0.45% (CI, 1.23% to 0.32%) in the financial incentive group. Limitation: The study included only veterans and lasted only 6 months.
Conclusion: Peer mentorship improved glucose control in a cohort of African American veterans with diabetes.
