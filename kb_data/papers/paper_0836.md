## Abstract
Abstract
            Gamification is defined as the use of game design elements in contexts other than gaming to increase user engagement and experience. Gamification in cardiovascular care can contribute to positively change health behaviour with possible effects and benefits on physical health and mental well-being. Based on previous literature, in this article we describe: the conceptualization of gamification, the five gamification principles for gamified digital health programmes or applications, the six most common game elements used to impact health behaviour applied in gamified digital health interventions and finally scientifically validated instruments to use for assessment of gamification in terms of self-reported psychological outcomes.
