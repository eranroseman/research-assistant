## Abstract
Abstract
            This chapter highlights the continued salience of Weiss's questions about theory‐based evaluation, especially given the often simplistic uses of program theory in evaluation.
            Theory‐based evaluation examines conditions of program implementation and mechanisms that mediate between processes and outcomes as a means to understand when and how programs work.
