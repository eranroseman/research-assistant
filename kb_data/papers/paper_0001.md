ardiometabolic disease–which includes car-
diovascular
disease,
diabetes
mellitus,
obesity,
and
metabolic
dysfunction–
associated steatohepatitis–is a major cause of death
and disability for Americans and people around the
world. Digital health technologies (DHTs) hold great
promise in helping prevent or manage chronic condi-
tions.1 Although many DHTs serve as tools that do not
necessarily
have
to
demonstrate
health
beneﬁts,
many DHTs could greatly support people with, or at
risk of, cardiometabolic disease through providing
continuous monitoring and feedback on physiological
parameters and behaviors like diet, exercise, and
medication adherence. There have been signiﬁcant
advances in DHTs for cardiometabolic conditions.
Continuous
glucose
monitors
(CGMs)
continually
monitor users’ blood glucose and can be linked to
automated insulin delivery systems. Other devices
include smart watches that can record electrocardio-
grams, cufﬂess blood pressure
monitors,
activity
trackers, and novel devices under development to
noninvasively measure blood glucose2 or provide car-
diovascular hemodynamic monitoring.3 There is also
a plethora of software-as-a-medical device applica-
tions for cardiometabolic disease. However, existing
DHTs have yet to meet their potential for a major
impact on improving health and have largely been
unable to generate a compelling, evidence-based
value
proposition
for
clinicians,
patients,
and
payers.4
The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is a
regulatory
and
public
health
agency
overseeing
regulation of medical products in the United States.
The development of successful DHTs for the preven-
tion, early detection, and better management of car-
diometabolic
disease,
in
part
through
instituting
successful behavioral changes among users, is a pri-
ority for the agency. Models leading to stronger evi-
dence
and
broader
reimbursement
for
DHTs
for
cardiometabolic disease could attract further invest-
ment in research and development of DHTs. In this
paper, we describe key gaps preventing DHTs from
meeting their potential, informed by comments from
patients, clinicians, researchers, industry, and non-
proﬁts received through an open public comment
docket (Table 1).5 We go on to discuss approaches that
could lead to greater adoption and integration of
higher-quality DHTs.
OVERVIEW OF DHT REGULATION
DHTs that meet the deﬁnition of a medical device are
regulated by the FDA, which applies regulatory con-
trols and marketing pathways based on the intended
use and potential risk of the device (Figure 1). Devices
are classiﬁed from Class 1 with the lowest risk (eg, a
toothbrush, Digital Visual Acuity Test), Class 2 with
intermediate risk (eg, CGMs, WellDoc’s Bluestar, a
digital therapeutic for type 2 diabetics to help them
manage their condition), to Class 3 with the highest
risk (eg, permanently implanted sensors that measure
pulmonary artery pressure remotely). General con-
trols, such as a requirement for good manufacturing
practice and device registration, apply to all medical

for
Class
2
devices
that
may
include speciﬁc performance standards, postmarket
monitoring, patient registries, special labeling re-
quirements,

and
guidelines. Most Class 2 devices are subject to the
510(k) premarket notiﬁcation pathway and require
FDA clearance for marketing. Class 3 devices are
subject to premarket approval, which is the most
stringent type of premarket submission. These re-
quirements are deﬁned by laws passed by Congress,
but criteria vary on a case-by-case basis and the spe-
ciﬁcs within the overall requirements written into law
can evolve through FDA guidance as new technology
emerges (eg, the Predetermined Change Control Pro-
gram draft guidance streamlines the evaluation of
adaptive

rithms).7 Further, devices that provide more

granted this designation, for example, to IDx-
DR, a software that uses an AI algorithm to
diagnose diabetic retinopathy from digital
images. To facilitate patient access to new
devices including DHTs, the FDA launched the Total
Product Lifecycle pilot program, initially focused on
cardiology and neurology devices. However, much of

Gaps in evidence
“The variety of available CGM metrics poses continuous challenges for
researchers, clinicians, and patients alike. On the one hand, in patient-
centered care, it is crucial to use CGM biomarkers that are easy to extract,
interpret, and explain to the patient. On the other hand, having accessibility
to a broader range of metrics is of value due to the multi-faceted nature of
glucose control.” – Patient and Researcher
CDRH is “uniquely positioned to advance DHTs that “can provide signiﬁcant
improvements in health care, quality of life, and wellness to diverse

“The EHR environment is too limited in its ﬂexibility, accessibility, and
computational abilities to enable wearable data to be efﬁciently ingested
and computed upon, particularly in real time. Another barrier for

model helps patients, but not people.” – Researcher
“Integrating AI-driven insights into clinical workﬂows presents challenges,

“Studies have shown that rural areas in the United States, with limited access to
health care facilities, have an increase in undiagnosed prediabetes and T2D.
These discrepancies in rural areas may be lessened with remote operation of

above include: 1) a limited amount of nondiabetic patients wearing CGMs in
real world scenarios; 2) the nonuniform landscape of EHR systems today;
and 3) the limited ability for researchers and industry to use EHR data in
combination with CGM data.” – Industry

adoption of these technologies, going beyond what
might be necessary
for FDA authorization for a
particular intended use.
GAPS IN EVIDENCE
A major limitation inhibiting widespread adoption of
DHTs is the lack of evidence of a causal link between
recommendations to use particular DHTs, actual use,
and improved clinical outcomes in the population for
whom the DHT is recommended. Although studies
have shown that the detection of cardiometabolic
disease by DHTs can be successfully validated relative
to measures like blood glucose or hemoglobin A1c, it
remains unclear whether their use makes a difference
in the clinical status of those exposed to the DHTs.
Even for traditional measures of cardiometabolic
disease, it has not been deﬁnitively demonstrated
whether the conceptual advantage of monitoring
more continuously with particular DHTs actually im-
proves long-term outcomes or just adds more mea-
surements
without
a
link
to
effective
behavior
change. There is also uncertainty about whether
beneﬁts observed from providing access to a DHT
could be largely attributable to the “healthy adherer”
effect in which those who adhere to use of DHTs have
lower baseline risk or have a propensity for behav-
ioral adherence, a characteristic that has been shown
to lead to better outcomes even
with placebo.8
In contrast, those who need intervention the most
may not be impacted or may deteriorate simply
because
they
are
unable
to
use
the
technology
effectively.
Engagement
with
DHTs
developed
for
car-
diometabolic
disease
is
particularly
important
because many rely on changing behaviors and life-
style. Of 4 high-quality, randomized, controlled trials
for digital interventions targeting behavior change in
patients with diabetes included in a systematic re-
view, only 1 showed a statistically signiﬁcant reduc-
tion in HbA1c.9,10 Widespread adoption of DHTs for
the screening and detection of cardiometabolic dis-
ease without linkage to interventions that improve
outcomes
could
result
in
overdiagnosis,
over-
treatment,
and
increased
expenditures
without
improvement in health.
The long and complicated history of CGMs pro-
vides an example of a DHT now beginning to achieve
successful adoption, including through completion of
both technology development and evidence genera-
tion steps needed to meet criteria for clinical practice
guideline
recommendation
and
reimbursement.
CGMs were suboptimal when initially introduced,
with signiﬁcant concerns about over-reaction to arti-
fact and bias in studies from the healthy adherer ef-
fect. Further research has overcome these concerns.
Their value in type 1 diabetes, including automated
insulin delivery systems, has been validated, leading

to insurance coverage and broad use in clinical care. A
recent meta-analysis of patients with type 2 diabetes
included 26 randomized controlled trials and found a
modest reduction in HbA1c for participants random-
ized to either continuous or intermittently scanned
glucose monitors.11 Recently, interoperable compo-
nents have also been developed and authorized by
the FDA, including an open-access, patient-led auto-
mated insulin delivery algorithm.12 However, even
with CGMs, gaps remain; the same meta-analysis did
not show improvement in key measurements like
weight, lipids, and blood pressure, with few trials at
low risk of bias or lasting more than 6 months. As
CGMs become more sophisticated, the variety of
potentially
useful
measurements
they
make
far
exceed the evidence of their value. Further, the
connection of CGMs to behavioral change, while
promising, remains short of needed evidence for
broader adoption.
Last, evidence generation for DHTs has often been
limited by gaps in attention to details of measure-
ment and basic tenets of clinical research. Issues
pertaining to artifact, missing data, and operating
characteristics
of
algorithms
remain
in
need
of
further development. For many DHTs intended to
stimulate positive health behaviors, signiﬁcant pe-
riods of missingness and artifact could lead to errors
with health consequences.
GAPS IN CLINICAL INTEGRATION
Lack of integration can affect the effectiveness of
DHTs, particularly in the postmarket phase. The ten-
dency for each new “app” to exist as a standalone
product or point solution without integration into a
coherent base of technologies or uniﬁed applicably at
the point of care creates an enormous barrier to up-
take and leads to skepticism among clinicians, health
systems, and payers. Many stand-alone DHTs may be
unlikely to provide deﬁnitive diagnostic information
or be comprehensive enough to provide holistic dis-
ease monitoring. There is a vast plethora of apps or
DHTs that do not operate on a uniﬁed platform.
Indeed, developers often build solutions that are
wholly incompatible with current data standards in
health care such as HL7 or Fast Healthcare Interop-
erability Resources.
Integration into existing clinical workﬂows is spe-
ciﬁcally
complex
and
involves
entire
technology
stacks, including hardware, software, and networking
components, to meet the speciﬁc needs of the clinical
workﬂow. Therefore, speciﬁc data integration tools
may be needed to optimize communication between
and among DHTs and other consumer-oriented tools
or to enable a clinical team to make use of disparate
data sources, formats, and standards. Application
programming interfaces may be needed between
different software applications to enable data ex-
change. Remote devices, such as remote patient
monitoring tools, may use an entire telecommunica-
tions infrastructure including broadband, Wi-Fi con-
nectivity, and mobile communications to support
reliable
data
communication.
Secure
cloud
computing platforms may be important for storing
data or running real time analytics such as in clinical
decision support tools.
INTEGRATION AMONG CONSUMER TECHNOLOGIES,
MEDICAL DEVICES, AND AI. Consumer technologies
such as smart watches and exercise monitors have
become
more
sophisticated.
Many
products
are
moving into FDA-regulated areas like detecting car-
diac
rhythms
as
“hybrid”
applications
in
which
medical software intended for clinical applications
are added to a consumer product. Combining data
collected by these devices with other data from the
patient could produce better longitudinal insights.
This development approach, however, has led to
preferential
adoption
by
consumers
with
higher
levels of income and health literacy. Although us-
ability, as assessed through metrics such as net pro-
moter score, is critical for the scaled effectiveness of
DHTs, it would be optimal if this was paired with
evidence of a beneﬁcial effect on health outcomes if
applicable to the use case.
Additionally, AI holds the promise of integrating
disparate data from such consumer products and
presenting it back to people using systems like large
language models (LLMs). As AI is built into both
consumer and medical applications, a major thrust
will almost certainly be to provide users and clini-
cians with comprehensive information to enable ac-
tions that could lead to better health outcomes.
Although such a technology is yet to be fully devel-
oped or authorized to go to market, LLM-wearable
integration has been shown to be capable of devel-
oping a closed-loop coaching and feedback system.13
How individual DHTs will be integrated into this
more comprehensive information source remains to
be determined. Optimizing human-machine integra-
tion and interfacing will also be needed to mitigate
emergent risks associated with LLMs (eg, data drift,
hallucinations, and systematic bias).
GAPS IN PATIENT ACCESS AND RETENTION

economic challenges. However, DHTs have greater

uptake in groups with lower disease prevalence rates,
exacerbating the “digital divide.” This digital divide
is worsened by the poor evidence base leading to
sparse insurance coverage, making these technolo-
gies accessible only to more afﬂuent patients. Many
disadvantaged groups can face additional barriers
such as mistrust of institutionalized health care and
different cultural norms about using technology for
health and language barriers. Lack of use in high-risk
high-need groups may also attenuate the demon-
strated beneﬁts of DHTs. Therefore, DHT develop-
ment that does not consider “digital determinants of
health” may miss the mark among groups with the
greatest need.14
Adherence rates for the continued use of DHTs for
chronic conditions remain low, with 1 systematic re-
view of app-based interventions for chronic disease
showing dropout rates of 43%.15 Factors associated
with greater user adherence include younger age,
higher health literacy, poorer self-rated health, and
greater patient engagement in self-care.16 Essentially,
greater need and facility for engagement reduces the
likelihood of attrition. Because of this signiﬁcant
confounding, nonrandomized comparisons of the ef-
fects of DHTs are fraught with difﬁculty in assump-
tions of causal inference where a health claim may be
concerned.
DEVELOPING A VALUE PROPOSITION FOR DHTs
The prime deﬁciency of most DHTs is a lack of evi-
dence showing their use leads to health beneﬁts for
patients, improved care management for clinicians,
and economic value to payers. Careful testing and
validation has been used for decades by manufac-
turers of drugs, devices, and biologics, resulting in
great success for manufacturers, the health system,
payers, and the public. This results in an ecosystem
wherein manufacturers have incentive to innovate,
and health systems, payers, and the public rely on the
system of evaluation. The system is built on the
blueprint that investment in research and develop-
ment
to
produce
reliable
evidence
that
beneﬁts
outweigh risks will yield attractive return on invest-
ment. This construct has not been fully realized for
DHTs.
The
ﬁrst
step
in
DHT
development
remains
analytical validation: does the technology reliably,
reproducibly, and accurately, perform as intended
(Figure 2)? For DHTs, protocols for data drift, safety,
security, and privacy could be carefully considered
and implemented. It is important for DHTs to be
tested at an early stage with their intended users (ie,
patients,
clinicians,
or
both)
for
usability
and
accessibility.
One means by which developers can increase the
accessibility,
particularly
among
disadvantaged
groups, is leveraging existing frameworks to optimize
implementation of DHTs for cardiometabolic dis-
ease.17 Factors that increase patient engagement with
DHTs include a credible source of health information,
social support, prompts and cues, graded tasks, goals
and
planning,
feedback
and
monitoring,
human
coaching,
and
personalization
components.18
Addressing these digital determinants of health is
likely to improve the probability of success if the
approach is a core tenet of development rather than
an afterthought.
DHTs may also be challenging to integrate into
diagnostic or therapeutic protocols given the newness
of these tools. The FDA strongly recommends that
manufacturers follow human factors and usability
engineering processes during the development of
DHTs, to ensure they are safe and effective for the

intended uses, considering reasonably foreseeable
misuses. One important goal is ensuring that the DHT
user interface is designed to minimize errors.
To facilitate better integration of DHTs in the pa-
tient’s home environment, the FDA is helping support
the development of user friendly and effective plat-
forms with its “Home as a Healthcare Hub” initia-
tive.19 Using intentional architectural design and
virtual reality technology, the initiative will produce
models that can inform integrating technology with
the physical environment to maintain and improve
health. This project could help stimulate the industry
into developing approaches, possibly including com-
mon interchangeable platforms, that present data and
information to patients and clinicians in a manner
that is attractive, integrated, and includes coherent,
actionable insights.
Once integrated, it is important for DHTs to be
validated using sufﬁciently large cohorts of patients
that represent the diversity of the population for
whom the DHT is intended in relevant clinical set-
tings. Longitudinal follow-up and outcome assess-
ment of cohorts can establish the predictive validity
of digital biomarkers, and the therapeutic potential of
DHT-derived treatments. Although cohorts like those
of the Health eHeart study are promising,20 the ma-
jority of DHTs have not yet been evaluated in these
types of studies. Large simple randomized controlled
trials with complete follow-up of the entire cohort
including those who do and do not adhere can be a
reliable means to answer questions about efﬁcacy.
Because studies showing better outcomes in those
who adhere do not answer the fundamental question
as to whether the DHT has a causal effect on better
outcomes, studies using the intention-to-treat prin-
ciple with complete follow-up of those who “drop
out” are necessary to determine whether recom-
mending a speciﬁc DHT causes an improvement in
clinical outcomes.
THE ROLE OF CLINICIANS AND HEALTH SYSTEMS
Clinicians can play critical roles in ensuring DHTs are
designed and tested in ways that streamline clinical
workﬂows and ensure best outcomes for patients.
One barrier to clinician engagement has been lack of
reimbursement pathways for these technologies in
clinical practice. The recent proposed revision of the
physician fee schedule rule by the Centers for Medi-
care and Medicaid includes codes for DHTs for mental
health, including payment for time allocation to assist
the patient in dealing with the DHT.21 Further, the
American Medical Association recently updated CPT
(Current Procedural Terminology) codes to include
digital therapeutic interventions for remote thera-
peutic monitoring, and revised codes to include de-
vice supply for data access or data transmissions to
support remote monitoring of patients.22 Improved
evidence generation and the demonstration of cost-
effectiveness is also likely to facilitate greater payor
coverage. Some manufacturers are taking the lead in
designing rigorous studies for DHTs, such as a phase 3
sham controlled trial of an app providing behavioral
therapy for patients with ﬁbromyalgia, which showed
signiﬁcant beneﬁt vs the sham control app.23
Clinician adoption may be improved through user
experience testing and user-friendly design specif-
ically within the context of highly complex clinical
workﬂows. This involves manufacturers working in
concert with clinicians, patients, and health systems,
not only in pilot testing and deployment, but as early
as ideation and product wireframing. Health systems
too can work toward implementing a workﬂow that
allows for integration of DHTs and considers the wide
array of clinical touchpoints involved in long-term
patient care. To ensure that DHTs are integrated
into clinical workﬂows, and digitally derived end-
points are appropriately validated, it will be essential
to integrate health systems into the development
process, including by linking to the electronic health
record. Although challenges related to data stan-
dardization remain, the increasing consensus about
the critical adoption of data standards based in Fast
Healthcare Interoperability Resources could accel-
erate the integration of DHTs with electronic health
record data.
Manufacturers need to work with patients and
clinicians to develop coherent platforms that reduce
friction and disconnection among different DHTs, the
patient, their caregivers, and the clinical team. Miti-
gation strategies could resemble the “glass cockpit”
project
led
by
NASA.24
Before
this
project,
the
airplane cockpit was loaded with independent in-
struments that required considerable pilot concen-
tration to integrate their outputs while ﬂying the
plane. This project, built on user experience and hu-
man factors studies with pilots, led to the conversion
to integrated digital instruments arranged to opti-
mize the pilot’s ability to safely ﬂy the plane.
Last, clinicians and health systems will need to
play a central role in postmarket monitoring and
evaluation, which is critical to continually optimize
technology as it is introduced into clinical practice.
An important attribute of AI clinical algorithms,
especially using generative AI, is that they are highly
dependent on context of use, therefore necessitating

recurrent assessment of their operating characteris-
tics. This is true of algorithms that are intended to
predict outcomes, motivate healthy behaviors, or
improve health outcomes. As with the initial studies
needed to market a DHT, if the tool is updated using
only data from adherent populations, it will lead to
biased algorithms that will likely increase disparities
and may not improve outcomes. The technology in-
dustry, in close collaboration with health systems and
clinicians, needs to lead postmarket monitoring to
allow DHTs to continue to improve in practice.
CONCLUSIONS
The FDA continues to attempt to stimulate a positive
environment for the development of DHTs for the
prevention and treatment of chronic conditions, such
as cardiometabolic disease. However, the FDA is one
part of the entire ecosystem that will need to collec-
tively step up to ensure that DHTs that lead to
improved clinical outcomes are developed, tested,
and integrated into the health care system in a
manner that enables them to serve as vital in-
struments to prevent and manage cardiometabolic
disease. We also believe strengthening the DHT evi-
dence base and improving clinical integration could
increase payor coverage and patient access. Payers
might consider guiding manufacturers by developing
and
sharing
minimum
evidentiary
standards
for
coverage consideration. These steps are essential for
DHTs to move beyond consumer-oriented applica-
tions to becoming instruments that substantively
contribute better health outcomes for the public.
