## Abstract
Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT have become widely applied in the field of medical research. In the process of conducting systematic reviews, similar tools can be used to expedite various steps, including defining clinical questions, performing the literature search, document screening, information extraction, and language refinement, thereby conserving resources and enhancing efficiency. However, when using LLMs, attention should be paid to transparent reporting, distinguishing between genuine and false content, and avoiding academic misconduct. In this viewpoint, we highlight the potential roles of LLMs in the creation of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, elucidating their advantages, limitations, and future research directions, aiming to provide insights and guidance for authors planning systematic reviews and meta-analyses.
