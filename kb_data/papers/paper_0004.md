## Abstract
The COVID-19 pandemic accelerated telemedicine adoption globally. This meta-analysis of 156 studies across 42 countries evaluates telemedicine effectiveness for various conditions during 2020-2023. Patient satisfaction rates averaged 86%, with no significant differences in clinical outcomes compared to in-person care for chronic disease management. Cost savings averaged 23% per consultation. However, disparities in access persisted, particularly in low-resource settings.

Introduction

The COVID-19 pandemic necessitated rapid healthcare delivery transformation, with telemedicine emerging as a critical tool for maintaining care continuity. This meta-analysis synthesizes global evidence on telemedicine effectiveness during the pandemic period...

Methods

We conducted a comprehensive search of multiple databases for studies evaluating telemedicine interventions during COVID-19 (March 2020 - March 2023). Random-effects meta-analysis was performed for clinical outcomes, patient satisfaction, and cost-effectiveness...

Results

From 4,567 articles screened, 156 studies met inclusion criteria, representing 2.3 million patients across 42 countries. Chronic disease management via telemedicine showed non-inferior outcomes for diabetes (HbA1c difference: -0.08%, 95% CI: -0.15 to -0.01), hypertension (systolic BP difference: -1.2 mmHg, 95% CI: -2.4 to 0.1), and mental health conditions...

Patient Experience

Patient satisfaction rates were high across regions (mean 86%, range 71-94%). Key satisfaction drivers included convenience (92%), reduced travel time (89%), and maintained care quality (78%). Dissatisfaction related to technical difficulties (31%) and lack of physical examination (28%)...

Conclusions

Telemedicine proved effective for maintaining healthcare delivery during COVID-19, with outcomes comparable to traditional care for many conditions. Post-pandemic integration should address equity concerns and optimize hybrid care models...
