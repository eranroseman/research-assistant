              Results
              Of 2325 potentially relevant titles (duplicates excluded), 10 (0.43%) randomized controlled trials were included in this review. Quality assessment revealed a high risk of bias for all randomized controlled trials except for 10% (1/10), with performance bias due to the lack of blinding being the major source of bias. There is evidence suggesting that digital health interventions containing game components can substantially improve motivation for physical activity (1/1, 100% of the studies dealing with PA motivation), exercise intensity (3/5, 60%), dietary behavior (4/4, 100%), health literacy (1/3, 33%), mental quality of life (2/2, 100%), glycated hemoglobin level (2/6, 33%), BMI (1/3, 33%), fasting plasma glucose level (1/2, 50%), waist circumference (1/1, 100%), and aerobic capacity (1/1, 100%).


              Conclusions
              Published studies indicated that digital health interventions containing game components might improve health behavior patterns, quality of life, and clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, the intervention types and outcomes studied were heterogeneous, and study quality was mostly low, which translates to ambiguous results. Future research should focus on sound methodology and reporting as well as on identifying game components that contribute to significant positive effects.

Abstract
Background: Games and game components have become a major trend in the realm of digital health research and practice as
they are assumed to foster behavior change and thereby improve patient-reported and clinical outcomes for patients with type 2
diabetes.
Objective: The aim of this systematic review was to summarize and evaluate the current evidence on the effectiveness of digital
health interventions containing game components on behavioral, patient-reported, and clinical outcomes for patients with type 2
diabetes.
Methods:
An electronic search was conducted in MEDLINE and PsycINFO in April 2020; updated in April 2022; and
supplemented by additional searches via Google Scholar, Web of Science (which was used for forward citation tracking), and
within the references of the included records. Articles were identified using predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. In total,
2 reviewers independently conducted title, abstract, and full-text screening and then individually performed a critical appraisal
of all the included studies using the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool version 2. A consensus was reached through discussion.
Results: Of 2325 potentially relevant titles (duplicates excluded), 10 (0.43%) randomized controlled trials were included in this
review. Quality assessment revealed a high risk of bias for all randomized controlled trials except for 10% (1/10), with performance
bias due to the lack of blinding being the major source of bias. There is evidence suggesting that digital health interventions
containing game components can substantially improve motivation for physical activity (1/1, 100% of the studies dealing with
PA motivation), exercise intensity (3/5, 60%), dietary behavior (4/4, 100%), health literacy (1/3, 33%), mental quality of life
(2/2, 100%), glycated hemoglobin level (2/6, 33%), BMI (1/3, 33%), fasting plasma glucose level (1/2, 50%), waist circumference
(1/1, 100%), and aerobic capacity (1/1, 100%).
Conclusions: Published studies indicated that digital health interventions containing game components might improve health
behavior patterns, quality of life, and clinical outcomes in patients with type 2 diabetes. However, the intervention types and
outcomes studied were heterogeneous, and study quality was mostly low, which translates to ambiguous results. Future research
should focus on sound methodology and reporting as well as on identifying game components that contribute to significant

Introduction
Background
According to the 2021 and most recent Diabetes Atlas provided
by the International Diabetes Federation, diabetes affects 537
million people worldwide, which equals a share of almost 7%
of the world’s total population [1]. Compared with the data
provided in the 2019 Atlas, this is an increase in diabetes
prevalence of almost 16% within 2 years [1]. The vast majority
of people diagnosed with diabetes (95%) live with type 2
diabetes [2,3].
Apart from genetic predispositions and a higher probability of
having a diabetes diagnosis at an older age, several risk factors
of type 2 diabetes are lifestyle-related, such as physical
inactivity; malnutrition; and, correspondingly, overweight and
obesity [4]. Therefore, several clinical practice guidelines on
the treatment of type 2 diabetes focus not only on
pharmacological interventions but also on a comprehensive
self-management regimen that includes theory-based behavior
change [4-7]. Measures for the latter warranted by the so-called
Diabetes Self-Management and Education (DSME) regimen
defined by the American Diabetes Association (ADA) include
education on symptoms, etiology of and coping with diabetes,
the adoption of a healthy (ie, high fiber- and fruit- and
vegetable-based) diet, and the uptake of regular physical activity
(PA) as a means to achieve weight loss [4,6]. Apart from the
education component, continuous monitoring of blood glucose
values, food intake, and frequency and intensity of PA is a
requirement of DSME [6].
The potential of digital health applications, such as telemedicine,
for supporting patients regarding DSME is well documented
for patients with a more recent diabetes diagnosis, especially
for applications that enable continuous glucose self-monitoring
or health care provider feedback on the values recorded [8].
Recently, interest has spiked in digital health applications
containing game components as they are expected to offer aid
in behavior change [9], which, for many patients, is a necessary
precondition for successful DSME [10]. Game components
such as scoring systems, trophies, and leaderboards have been
shown to be effective in increasing the motivation for uptake
of healthy behaviors in a number of chronic conditions [11] as
well as a measure of health promotion. However, the
methodological quality of the evidence is still moderate to low
[12]. Educational games often rely on storytelling elements such
as coherent narratives and episodes, which generate a so-called
transportation effect where players immerse themselves
completely in the narrative world, which loosens reluctance
toward behaviors perceived as laborious or unpleasant, such as
PA [13,14]. Exergames stimulate PA by challenging the players’
abilities and rewarding success [15].
A moderating role of the regulatory mode can be assumed in
the relationship between gaming and behavior change.
According to theory, either individuals can assess the situation
they are in and then develop the most adequate strategy to reach
a behavioral aim (assessment) or they can just initiate the
behavior for which they strive (locomotion). Locomotion is
associated with higher intrinsic motivation, whereas assessment
is associated with anticipating failure and, therefore,
procrastination [16].
In 2016, a meta-analysis including both types of game-based
interventions (educational games and exergames) for patients
with diabetes (type 1 and 2) showed no effect on blood glucose
values (glycated hemoglobin [HbA1c]) but showed an effect on
quality of life, balance, and muscle strength [17]. Theng et al
[18] found that videogames were useful tools for diabetes
education independent of diabetes type. However, the analyses
are outdated (both searches were conducted in 2014) given the
substantial increase in the availability of gamified health
interventions, as evidenced by a recent overview of gamified
interventions used in the context of diabetes [19], half of which
were launched after 2016. The median survival time of reviews
is 5.5 years before they are outdated [20]. In addition, patient
populations and the measures taken to deal with type 1 and type
2 diabetes differ greatly [7], and so do the effective components
of digital health applications [8]. Therefore, targeted game-based
interventions are necessary as well. Furthermore, given the
complex requirements of DSME, focusing the analysis solely
on clinical outcomes and neglecting behavioral outcomes as
well
as
patient-reported
outcomes
(PROs),
as
did
Martos-Cabrera et al [21] and Kaihara et al [22], is limited in
perspective.
Objectives
Therefore, the questions to be answered were as follows: (1)
Do digital game-based interventions have an effect on the health
behavior of patients with type 2 diabetes? and (2) Do digital
game-based interventions have an effect on clinical outcomes
and PROs in patients with type 2 diabetes?
Methods
The protocol for this systematic review was published
beforehand in PROSPERO (CRD42020209706) and followed
during the conduct of the review. Reporting of the results
adhered to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for
Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) statement [23].
Study Inclusion and Exclusion
The inclusion and exclusion criteria were defined according to
the population, intervention, control, outcome, and study design
scheme (Textboxes 1 and 2). For this purpose, digital health
interventions containing game components were defined as the
intervention group, whereas usual care or the use of digital
health interventions without a game component were defined
as the control group.

Database Search
An electronic database search was conducted in MEDLINE (via
PubMed) and PsycINFO to cover both medical and
psychological research. The initial search was conducted in
April 2020 and updated in April 2022 with no restrictions on
start time. The search string (Multimedia Appendix 1) included
terms covering type 2 diabetes (population), including Medical
Subject Heading terms and synonyms for game and gaming
(intervention) as well as game components, and was piloted in
previous research [24]. Population and intervention terms were
linked with the operator AND. No restrictions were imposed on
the outcome category of the search string to avoid accidentally
excluding relevant effects of gamified interventions.
Additional searches were conducted within the references of
the included studies (backward citation tracking) as well as on
Google Scholar and Web of Science, where publications citing
the included studies were checked (forward citation tracking)
in July 2022.
Screening and Data Extraction
The screening of relevant records was a 2-step process. First, 2
independent reviewers screened the titles and abstracts of all
records found by the database and hand searches. If deemed
relevant by at least one reviewer, the full text was assessed for

eligibility by both reviewers as well. The reference manager
EndNote (Clarivate Analytics) was used for both screening and
duplicate removal.
Data were extracted according to the population, intervention,
control, outcome, and study design scheme, aiming at allowing
for a comparison of the effects of different gamified intervention
types on the aforementioned outcome domains. In addition, the
following information was extracted from each study: (1)
bibliographic information, (2) population characteristics, (3)
the allocation of the study participants to the intervention and
control group or control groups, (4) treatment or interventions
applied to the control group (as a means to account for plausible
confounding factors), (5) inclusion and exclusion criteria of
each applicable study (as a means to account for plausible
confounding factors), and (6) outcome measures (to inform
quality assessment).
The data extraction sheet was piloted by 2 researchers on 2 of
the included studies, which were randomly selected, and
subsequently slightly adjusted by including the category
“outcome measures.” Data extraction was performed using a
Microsoft Excel (Microsoft Corp) spreadsheet.
For a visual representation, HbA1c values at baseline and after
intervention completion were extracted in percentage or
mmol/mol depending on the data available in the included
studies, along with the SD. Δ HbA1c was computed, and
statistical significance was extracted from the included studies.
The threshold for statistically significant effects was set at
P<.05. No assumptions were made if information was missing;
this was labeled as “not reported” instead. All study results were
tabulated. Apart from the tabulation and visualization of HbA1c
results, the presentation of the results is narrative.
Quality Assessment
The randomized controlled trials (RCTs) found were assessed
for study quality by applying the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool
version 2 (RoB 2) [25], whereas cohort studies, if included,
were assessed using the corresponding Critical Appraisal Skills
Programme (CASP) cohort study checklist [26]. Case-control
studies were assessed using the corresponding checklist also
provided by the CASP [27]. The RoB 2 covers bias within an
outcome resulting from the randomization process (selection
bias); blinding of participants, assessors, and analysts; deviations
from intervention delivery (performance bias); changes in
participants’ adherence to the intervention (attrition bias);
modalities of outcome measurement; or selective reporting
(reporting bias). RoB 2 assessment was performed for each
relevant study outcome according to our inclusion criteria.
According to the RoB 2 manual, the overall risk of bias within
a study was deemed high if 1 study outcome had a high risk of
bias. Both records by Höchsmann et al [28,29] were treated as
1 study with several outcomes. CASP checklists for
nonrandomized studies cover the same categories except for
randomization and blinding while also putting an emphasis on
practical implications of the study results. In contrast to the RoB
2, CASP checklists were applied to the entire study instead of
to selected outcomes. The RoB 2 deems studies to be at a low
risk of bias when a low risk of bias is detected for all relevant
domains. Some concerns regarding the risk of bias within an
outcome can be assumed when some concerns are raised for at
least one domain. A high risk of bias can be assumed when
multiple domains raise some concerns or a high risk of bias is
detected for at least one domain [25]. With the CASP, overall
risk of bias is assessed by answering the following question:
“Do you believe the results?”
Quality assessment was performed for the effect of both
assignment to the intervention (ie, the intention-to-treat effect)
and adherence to the intervention (ie, the per-protocol effect).
All steps of the review—screening of titles and abstracts and
full texts, data extraction, and quality assessment—were
performed by at least 2 researchers independently (LO, LH, or
PT in the first search period and LH and TH in the second search
period) to minimize bias. Differences in inclusion, extraction,
and quality assessment were resolved through discussion with
a third person not involved in the screening process (SD).
Diversions From the Protocol
Contrary to the protocol registered with PROSPERO, research
question 2 was adapted so that it clearly addressed PROs.
Furthermore, we refrained from performing a search in key
journals as these were all listed in MEDLINE.
Results
Results of the Search Process
Both database searches (2020 and 2022) taken together yielded
2325 results. A total of 7 additional potentially relevant
publications were identified via additional searches, but
excluded after full text assessment. In total, 2087 publications
remained after duplicates were removed, 2034 (97.5%) of which
were removed after title and abstract screening. The full texts
of the remaining 53 publications were assessed for eligibility.
This process led to the exclusion of 25% (13/53) of the studies
as they addressed a population outside this review’s scope, such
as patients with type 1 or prediabetes [30-42]. Another 40%
(21/53) of the studies were excluded as the interventions studied
did not have a game component [43-63]. A total of 15% (8/53)
of the studies were excluded as they used 1-armed designs or
did not study any of the prespecified outcomes but solely patient
experiences, such as satisfaction with the application [64-71].
A complete list of the excluded studies with reasons for
exclusion can be found in Multimedia Appendix 2 [30-71].
Finally, 10 studies were included in the qualitative data analysis
[28,29,72-80]. Höchsmann et al [28,29] reported results from
the same study in 2 records. The process of study selection is
depicted in Figure 1.

Descriptive Statistics of the Populations Studied
All the included studies (10/10, 100%) were RCTs. However,
Kempf and Martin [78] and Brinkmann et al [72] applied a
crossover design in which participants in the control group
received the intervention later during the study period. The
study samples ranged from 8 participants [72] to 465 participants
[76]. The lowest mean age was 44 (SD 7.9) years [79] and the
highest mean age was 68 (SD 5.8) years [73]. Brinkmann et al
[72] only reported the age span of the study participants, which
was 67 to 75 years. Overall, 533 female participants and 1061
male participants were included. The intervention duration
ranged from 30 minutes (exergame) [72] to 36 weeks
(self-management app with quiz component) [74]. In total, 30%
(3/10) of the RCTs performed follow-up analyses after the
intervention period, with follow-up times ranging from 7 days
[72] to 48 weeks [77]. A complete overview of the population
characteristics of the included RCTs can be found in Table 1.

Results of the Quality Assessment
Applying the RoB 2, a high risk of bias was detected in 90%
(9/10) of the included RCTs [28,73-80]. A total of 10% (1/10)
of the studies had a low risk of bias [72]. For 40% (4/10) of the
RCTs, multiple reasons for a high risk of bias were detected
[73,74,79,80], whereas for 30% (3/10) of the studies, only 1
reason was found [75,77,78]. The allocation sequence was
random in all but 10% (1/10) of the cases [79]. Major sources
of bias were the blinding of study participants and personnel to
the allocation to either the intervention or the control group
[73,74,76,77,79,80] and, to a smaller degree, inadequate (ie,
nonreliable or nonvalidated) measures for outcome assessment
[28,73-75,79,80], both of which translate to detection bias. Most
of the included RCTs (7/10, 70%) conducted per-protocol
analyses [28,29,72,73,75,77,78,80], whereas another study did

not specify the type of analysis [79]. As such, the effect estimate
was potentially biased by dropouts in all but 20% (2/10) [74,76]
of the included RCTs (attrition bias). Glasgow et al [74] and
Kerfoot et al [76] performed an intention-to-treat analysis,
whereas the remaining authors all performed per-protocol
analyses except for Koohmareh et al [79], for whom the type
of analysis could not be discerned. Bias because of selective
reporting was detected by comparing the outcomes described
in the Methods sections and those reported in the Results
sections [75,76]. The results of the quality assessment can be
found in Figure 2.

Game Types and Components Analyzed in the
Included RCTs
Of the 10 included RCTs, 4 (40%) focused on an exergame
[28,29,72,75,78], one (25%) of which reported first behavioral
and then clinical results of the same exergame intervention
studied with the same population [28,29]. A total of 20% (2/10)
of the studies reported on the effects of game components within
digital self-management applications for diabetes [73,80]. In
40% (4/10) of the RCTs, the authors analyzed quiz games with
DSME content [74,76,77,79]. The digital intervention studied
by Brinkmann et al [72] combined an exergame with a game
for cognitive problem-solving.
Within the exergames, virtual reality components such as virtual
race tracks were used [72,75,78]. Scoring systems awarding
trophies to winners or when individualized scores were achieved
were
used
in
60%
(6/10)
of
the
interventions
[28,29,73,74,76,79,80]. Storytelling features were part of 20%
(2/10) of the interventions studied [28,79], and 10% (1/10) of
the interventions applied a team-based approach to the game
[78].
Among the 4 RCTs in which the authors reported on the matter
[72,75,78,79], intervention intensity varied between 30 minutes
once (equal to intervention duration) [72], 15 minutes per day
for 6 weeks [79], 30 minutes per day for 12 weeks [78] and 45
minutes twice a week for 4 weeks [75].
A complete overview of the intervention types and game
components studied in the included RCTs can be found in Table
2.

Effects of Gamified Health Interventions on Health
Behavior
Exercise intensity and adherence were studied in 50% (5/10)
of the included studies [28,29,73-75,78]. A total of 40% (4/10)
of the studies reported on nutritional behavior [73,74,79,80],
and 20% (2/10) of the studies reported on medication adherence
[73,74].
Positive effects on behavioral PA outcomes were reported in
several of the included RCTs (4/10, 40%). A total of 50% (2/4)
of the exergames studied led to an increased intensity of PA
(measured as step count, caloric expenditure, and self-report)
in the study participants [28,29,78], and so did the quiz
component nested within the DSME website studied by Glasgow
et al [74]. However, the latter was only effective when the
website was supplemented with follow-up calls by study staff
as a supportive measure in handling the website and group
meetings with other study participants [74]. Only Höchsmann
et al [28] reported on PA adherence and found no substantial
effect of their exergame on PA adherence, where PA exercises
were nested within a coherent narrative. However, the
intervention statistically significantly increased intrinsic
motivation for PA (P<.001), whereas intrinsic motivation
decreased in the control group (1-time lifestyle counseling and
structured exercise plan) during the study period. Between-group
effects were significant. The authors also found a significant
positive relationship between time spent doing the in-game
exercises and PA motivation (P=.01) [28].
Dugas et al [73] found no overall intervention effect of any of
the intervention arms studied on adherence as a whole
(quantified using an in-app rating system; Table 3), but they
found a statistically significant interaction effect (in regression
analysis) of time spent using the self-management app with
game elements and assessment (P=.01). They also found a
statistically significant interaction effect of time and locomotion
on weekly exercise adherence (P<.05) [73].
In 40% (4/10) of the RCTs, the authors found significant positive
effects on nutrition behavior. Glasgow et al [74] reported a
significant decrease in fat intake in the intervention group
compared with that in the control group (P value for intergroup
differences=.006). Koohmareh et al [79] found that participants
using their educational game on glycemic index and calorie
intake paid significantly more attention to the glycemic levels
and calorie count of their food (P value for intergroup
differences=.001). Maharaj et al [80] showed that participants
using the mySugr app with the reward system could significantly
reduce their high-fat food consumption, whereas no significant
changes were found in the control group using a
self-management app without a game component (P value for
intergroup differences=.052). Interaction effects of time and
assessment as well as of time and locomotion were found by
Dugas et al [73] for nutrition adherence (quantified using an
in-app rating system) as well. The authors also found a
significant positive effect of locomotion on nutritional adherence
(P<.05) but none of assessment (P value not reported) [73].
Glasgow et al [74] found no significant effect of the intervention
on medication adherence or on eating habits other than fat intake
(P value for intergroup differences=.006). Dugas et al [73] found
an interaction effect of time spent using the intervention and
assessment on medication adherence (P=.04).
A total of 40% (2/5) of the exergames studied had no effect on
PA intensity [75,78]. Overall, positive effects of digital health
interventions with game components could be found on
motivation for and intensity of PA as well as on eating habits.

Effects of Gamified Health Interventions on PROs
In the included RCTs, data were provided on health literacy in
general [74,79,80], quality of life [75,78], diabetes-related
impairment [76,78], and subjective well-being [78].
Concerning health literacy, Koohmareh et al [79] found a
significant positive effect of their educational game on
knowledge concerning a diet adequate for patients with diabetes
(measured on a self-developed scale; P=.001). Maharaj et al
[80] found no significant median differences in illness beliefs
(measured using the Brief Illness Perception Questionnaire)
between the gamified mySugr and the self-management app
without any game components (P value for intergroup
differences=.05). Glasgow et al [74] used health literacy as a
moderating variable in a multivariate analysis of covariance to
measure the effects of their self-management website with quiz
elements but found no interaction effects (P value not reported).
In the domain of quality of life, Grewal et al [75] found a
significant improvement in mental well-being because of the
virtual balance training they studied (P value for intergroup
differences=.04) but no effect of said intervention on physical
well-being (P value for intergroup differences=.64; both
measured using the Short Form 12 Health Survey). The same
effect was demonstrated by Kempf and Martin [78], who studied
Wii Fit Plus games, using both the Short Form 12 Health Survey
and a German depression scale. Subjective well-being, measured
using the 5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index
scale, improved significantly in the study by Kempf and Martin
[78] as well (P value for intergroup differences=.004).
Grewal et al [75] and Kempf and Martin [78] studied the effects
of gamified interventions on diabetes-related impairment both
using the Problem Areas in Diabetes Scale. Although the latter
found a positive effect of the Wii Fit Plus games (P value for
intergroup differences=.03) [78], the former found no effect of
virtual balance training (P value not reported) [75]. In terms of
impairment, Grewal et al [75] found no effect of the virtual
balance training on fear of falling (P value for intergroup
differences=.31).
Overall, sparse positive effects of digital health interventions
with game components could be found on health literacy and
diabetes-related impairment, whereas substantial evidence was
found for the improvement of subjective mental well-being.
Effects of Gamified Health Interventions on Clinical
Outcomes
The clinical outcome studied most often in the included RCTs
was HbA1c [29,73,74,76-78]. Furthermore, 30% (3/10) of the
included studies analyzed changes in BMI [74,77,78], whereas
Höchsmann et al [28], Glasgow et al [74], and Kempf and
Martin [78] also analyzed lipid outcomes and blood pressure
values. Fasting plasma glucose (FPG) was studied twice [78,79],
and so was the heart rate of the participants [28,72]. Brinkmann
et al [72] studied cognitive parameters in conjunction with
lactate values, and Grewal et al [75] analyzed postural stability.
The effects of the gamified interventions on HbA1c levels studied
in 60% (6/10) of the RCTs are depicted in Figure 3, where
asterisks mark significant changes in HbA1c. Only Kerfoot et
al [76] (P value for intergroup differences=.048) and Kempf
and Martin [78] (P value for intergroup differences<.001) found
significant positive effects of a mobile, team-based DSME quiz
and Wii Fit Plus games, respectively, on HbA1c levels in terms
of a reduction in the intervention group and significant
between-group effects. Dugas et al [73] found a significant
effect of time spent using the self-management app with an
award system on HbA1c levels in a regression analysis (P<.01),
as well as an interaction effect of total adherence score (additive
score of exercise, nutrition, and medication adherence; P<.01).

Kempf and Martin [78] also found significant positive effects
of the intervention on BMI
(P
value for intergroup
differences=.008); however, Glasgow et al [74] (P value for
intergroup differences=.20) and Turnin et al [77] (P value for
intergroup differences=.08), also studying DSME software with
quiz components, did not. Significant effects on FPG after using
the same software were also reported by Kempf and Martin [78]
(P value for intergroup differences=.008) but not by Koohmareh
et al [79] (P value for intergroup differences=.63), who studied
the same intervention type. Significant effects were not found
on lipid outcomes and blood pressure values [29,74,78] or on
cognitive outcomes and lactate values [72]. Grewal et al [75]
found their exergame, including a virtual obstacle course, to
have a positive effect on postural stability when compared with
usual care (P value for intergroup differences=.009).
Turnin et al [77] found a significant reduction in waist
circumference in the intervention group when compared with
the control group both before and after adjusting for confounding
factors such as baseline HbA1c levels, age, sex, or obesity (P
value for intergroup differences=.04). The authors also reported
an increased effect on waist circumference in those with a higher
frequency of use (P=.008).
No significant effects were found on heart rate [29,72], blood
pressure (systolic or diastolic) [29,78], or lipid values (ie, on
total cholesterol, triglycerides, low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol, or high-density lipoprotein cholesterol) [29,78] in
any of the RCTs that reported on these values.
Brinkmann et al [72] studied the vascular endothelial growth
factor as an indicator of diabetes retinopathy but found no effect
of the Wii Fit exergame they studied (P value not reported).
Furthermore, they found no effect of the intervention on
insulin-like growth factor–1 as a proxy for poorly adjusted
diabetes (P value not reported).
Brinkmann et al [72] found improved lactate values in the
intervention group (P=.04) but not in the control group (P value
not reported), which used a stationary bicycle, thus indicating
higher fitness levels owing to the exergame. Improved fitness
because of an exergame was also demonstrated by Höchsmann
et al [29] using aerobic capacity as an indicator (P<.001).
Grewal et al [75] found improved postural stability to be an
effect of the virtual balance training they studied (P=.009).
As Brinkmann et al [72] aimed to also improve cognitive
functioning of the study participants by adding cognitive
challenges to the exergame, they studied the brain-derived
neurotrophic factor as an indicator of learning and memory
capacity and found no significant effect of the intervention (P
value not reported).
Overall, sparse positive effects of digital health interventions
with game components could be found on clinical outcomes,
with fitness-related outcomes improving the most.
A complete overview of the effects found in the included RCTs
can be found in Table 3. If not stated otherwise, differences in
outcomes are reported between the intervention and control
group(s) before and after the study in Table 3.
Discussion
Principal Findings
Despite heterogeneity in the effects of the gamified applications
studied in this review on behavioral, clinical, and
patient-reported outcomes, certain patterns emerged. Exergames
had the tendency to improve fitness-related and, to a smaller

extent, clinical values (as shown in 4/10, 40% of the RCTs
[73,76-78]), whereas educational games affected disease-related
knowledge and especially nutrition behavior (as shown in 4/10,
40% of the RCTs [73,74,79,80]). In addition, exergames had a
potential to improve outcomes related to self-reported well-being
such as quality of life and diabetes-related impairment (as shown
in 2/10, 20% of the RCTs [75,78]).
Comparison With Prior Work
The results confirm those of a meta-analysis by DeSmet et al
[82], who showed significant positive effects of serious games
on health behavior independent of any diagnosis and its
theory-based determinants and significant but much smaller
effects on various clinical outcomes. As for nutrition behavior,
which improved according to 40% (4/10) of the RCTs included
in this review solely because of self-management applications
with quiz elements, Ledoux et al [83] found similar effects of
a serious game for young patients with type 1 diabetes.
Somewhat surprisingly, self-efficacy was not among the
outcomes studied in the included RCTs despite existing evidence
that both exergames and serious games can increase the feeling
of being able to actively affect one’s health outcomes [65,84].
A precondition derived from behavior change theories is the
option for goal setting by the intervention participants
themselves as opposed to behavioral goals predefined by the
intervention developers [85]. This precondition was met by all
the gamified interventions studied in this review that used a
reward or scoring system as these game components allow for
the autonomous setting of target values that the users aim to
achieve and, thus, generate intrinsic motivation [12].
A coherent narrative as an instrument of storytelling was used
in only 20% (2/10) of the included interventions; however, it
aided
in
producing
positive
effects
on
behavioral,
knowledge-related [28,79], and clinical outcomes [29]. As such,
the results confirm observations made for narrative health
communication messages when delivered in a digital manner
[86].
Physical fitness because of an increase in PA owing to
interventions with game components is an especially promising
result as PA is one of the primary target behaviors of diabetes
self-management. The same is true for dietary behavior [6]. As
such, these results underline once more the potential of digital
interventions for DSME, acknowledged also by the ADA and
the European Association for the Study of Diabetes in a joint
statement [87].
The relatively high mean age of the study participants is
surprising insofar as the traditional target group for digital health
applications of all sorts is usually younger people [88].
Christensen et al [17], in sensitivity analyses, also found a
positive effect of game-based interventions only for people aged
<18 years. Especially regarding exergaming, the positive effects
for older people because of high engagement have already been
proven elsewhere [89]. Given the fact that most of the gamified
interventions studied in this review (7/10, 70%) were designed
for mobile devices, the high penetration of such devices in all
age groups might play an important role in overcoming the
digital health divide because of age [90]. Therefore, the results
need to be considered in light of demographic changes and a
rise in the demand for health care, especially for chronic diseases
[91].
With intervention duration varying widely (Table 2), statements
on its relevance have to be made with caution. However, the
results show that effects on clinical outcomes can be achieved
via digital health interventions with game components after at
least 12 months [76,78], which corresponds to the concept of
DSME as a continuous, long-term intervention [4,6]. However,
even 36 weeks of intervention duration did not guarantee
significant effects on BMI and HbA1c [74], hinting at a washout
in intervention fidelity common in digital health applications
[92].
The fact that generally positive effects of digital health
interventions of any kind are biased because of low overall study
quality also mirrors findings of recent evidence syntheses
[22,93]. The methodological issues concerning the quality of
obtainable evidence raised in the joint statement by the ADA
and the European Association for the Study of Diabetes [87]
persist in this review even though all the included studies (10/10,
100%) were RCTs or had adaptive RCT designs. The issue of
blinding of study participants and personnel to the allocation is
common in digital health trials as the fact that one did not
receive a gamified health application is easily uncovered [8].
Therefore, the study conducted by Maharaj et al [80] is a
positive example of comparing 2 digital health applications
whereby one is augmented with game components. The issue
of missing outcome data because of dropouts, well known to
researchers in multiple fields, is also common in digital health
research [94] and is linked to the issue of intervention fidelity.
The reasons as to why trial participants may lose interest in the
use of digital health applications can be numerous [92].
Therefore, participatory design is an important precondition for
gamified applications as well [95]. Nonvalidated outcome
measures, another major source of bias in the included RCTs,
point to the need to develop core outcome sets for digital health
applications with or without game components.
Strengths and Limitations
Robust and reproducible systematic review methods were used
to identify the best available evidence, and the results were
reported according to the PRISMA checklist (Multimedia
Appendix 3 [23]). Owing to the fact that all steps taken in this
review were performed by 2 researchers independently and
checked by a third researcher, it is highly unlikely that relevant
records were overlooked or incorrectly discarded as irrelevant.
The same is true for information in the included records relevant
to the quality assessment.
The focus on research published in German or English is a
limitation. Owing to the diverse intervention types (with
intervention durations varying widely) and outcomes studied
in the rather large number of included RCTs (compared, eg,
with the meta-analysis by Christensen et al [17]), a meta-analysis
especially of clinical outcomes was not deemed feasible. Rather,
the broad realm of outcomes studied allows for a holistic
overview of the potential effects of digital health interventions
with game components.

Some of the included RCTs (3/10, 30%) had a considerable loss
to follow-up, which would have required intention-to-treat
analyses. However, most studies (7/10, 70%) conducted
per-protocol analyses instead. Furthermore, the reasons for
dropout were not always reported.
Little to no follow-up time after the intervention period limits
the comparability of the gamified interventions studied in the
included RCTs with other digital or analog behavior change
interventions that have demonstrated sustainable effects over
time [96]. However, according to both theory and evidence,
sustainable and long-lasting behavior change over a time span
of at least 6 months is necessary to achieve improved health
outcomes and still not easily achieved [85]. Owing to limited
reporting of intervention intensity, no discernible patterns
regarding effectiveness could be found. Moreover, effective
components of gamified health interventions regarding both
clinical outcomes and behavior change have not been identified
yet [97].
Conclusions
This systematic review provided a thorough analysis of the
effectiveness of digital health interventions with game
components for the self-management of type 2 diabetes. The
included RCTs analyzing exergames showed positive effects
on fitness-related outcomes and, albeit only in 1 case, also on
HbA1c. Educational games improved dietary habits and
subjective mental health and well-being. However, the evidence
base was ambiguous and further limited because of the
considerable risk of bias in the study designs of most of the
included RCTs (9/10, 90%). Nevertheless, the results imply that
digital health interventions with game components can help
improve PA, dietary habits, and well-being. Therefore, these
applications, when developed based on theory and evaluated
rigorously, can help achieve the behavioral goals mentioned in
several guidelines for DSME. Given the mostly low quality of
the included RCTs, the presented evidence allows for nothing
more than the suggestion of digital health interventions with
game components as a supplement to traditional DSME, which
corresponds to the statement by Fleming et al [87]. The main
results of this review are summarized in Textbox 3.
Textbox 3. Main results of the review.
•
The variety of game components used in digital health interventions for type 2 diabetes ranges from quiz components over storytelling elements
to full-scale exergames.
•
Digital health interventions containing game components might improve the health behavior patterns, quality of life, and clinical outcomes of
patients with type 2 diabetes.
•
The methodological quality was low in most of the included randomized controlled trials.
Further research should compare digital health interventions
that contain game components with those that do not rather than
comparing the former with usual care and, as such, risking bias
because of high dropout rates. Furthermore, longer follow-up
assessments are crucial to detect whether the effects of gamified
interventions are sustainable. Adaptive study designs such as
microrandomization, where individuals are randomized to
several intervention components or treatments for the study
duration [98], could be used to determine which game
components have an effect on which outcome domain
(behavioral, PROs, or clinical). Larger sample sizes would allow
for more detailed subgroup analyses [99] to determine which
user groups, in addition to those defined by age, profit the most
from digital health interventions containing game components.
Finally, but importantly, a comparison of the effects of digital
health interventions with game components for patients with
type 1 and 2 diabetes is bound to provide further insights.
