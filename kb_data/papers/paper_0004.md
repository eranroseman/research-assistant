## Abstract
Background
              Digital health interventions (DHIs) have rapidly evolved and significantly revolutionized the health care system. The quadruple aims of health care (improving population health, enhancing consumer experience, enhancing health care provider [HCP] experience, and decreasing health costs) serve as a strategic guiding framework for DHIs. It is unknown how DHIs can impact the burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as measured by the quadruple aims.


              Objective
              This study aimed to systematically review the effects of DHIs on improving the burden of T2DM, as measured by the quadruple aims.


              Methods
              PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched for studies published from January 2014 to March 2024. Primary outcomes were the development of T2DM, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) change, and blood glucose change (dysglycemia changes). Secondary outcomes were consumer experience, HCP experience, and health care costs. Outcomes were mapped to the quadruple aims. DHIs were categorized using the World Health Organization’s DHI classification. For each study, DHI categories were assessed for their effects on each outcome, categorizing the effects as positive, negative, or neutral. The overall effects of each DHI category were determined by synthesizing all reported positive, neutral, or negative effects regardless of the number of studies supporting each effect. The Cochrane risk-of-bias version 2 (RoB 2) tool for randomized trials was used to assess the quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), while the ROBINS-I (risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of interventions) tool was applied for nonrandomized studies.


              Results
              In total, 53 papers were included. For the T2DM development outcome, the effects of DHIs were positive in 1 (1.9%) study and neutral in 9 (17%) studies, and there were insufficient data to assess in 4 (7.5%) studies. For the dysglycemia outcome, the effects were positive in 23 (43.4%) studies and neutral in 24 (45.3%) studies, and there were insufficient data in 6 (11.3%) studies. There were mixed effects on consumer experience (n=13, 24.5%) and a lack of studies reporting HCP experience (n=1, 1.9%) and health care costs (n=3, 5.7%). All studies that reported positive population health outcomes used a minimum of 2 distinct categories of DHIs. Among these successful studies, the one that reported delaying the development of T2DM and 16 (69.6%) of those reporting improvements in dysglycemia involved HCP interaction. Targeted communication with persons (TCP), personal health tracking (PHT), and telemedicine (TM) showed some evidence as a potentially useful tool for T2DM prevention and dysglycemia.


              Conclusions
              The effects of DHIs on T2DM prevention, as measured by the quadruple aims, have not been comprehensively assessed, with proven benefits for population health, mixed results for consumer experience, and insufficient studies on HCP experience and health care costs. To maximize their effectiveness in preventing T2DM and managing dysglycemia, DHIs should be used in combination and strategically integrated with in-person or remote HCP interaction.

Abstract
Background: Digital health interventions (DHIs) have rapidly evolved and significantly revolutionized the health care system.
The quadruple aims of health care (improving population health, enhancing consumer experience, enhancing health care provider
[HCP] experience, and decreasing health costs) serve as a strategic guiding framework for DHIs. It is unknown how DHIs can
impact the burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as measured by the quadruple aims.
Objective: This study aimed to systematically review the effects of DHIs on improving the burden of T2DM, as measured by

2024. Primary outcomes were the development of T2DM, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) change, and blood glucose change (dysglycemia
changes). Secondary outcomes were consumer experience, HCP experience, and health care costs. Outcomes were mapped to
the quadruple aims. DHIs were categorized using the World Health Organization’s DHI classification. For each study, DHI
categories were assessed for their effects on each outcome, categorizing the effects as positive, negative, or neutral. The overall
effects of each DHI category were determined by synthesizing all reported positive, neutral, or negative effects regardless of the

Introduction
Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a growing health problem
worldwide that affects all income levels and puts a heavy burden
on health care systems [1]. The increased prevalence of T2DM
is largely due to changes in diet, rising obesity rates, and
decreased physical activity [2]. Therefore, improving lifestyle
can potentially help prevent T2DM [1]. Diabetes prevention
programs (DPPs) and other lifestyle modifications strategies
have been applied worldwide, demonstrating that such changes
can effectively reduce the risk of developing T2DM [2-6].
Digital health interventions (DHIs), the application of digital
technologies in health care [7], have transformed how health
care is provided and experienced, leading to great health system
efficiencies and clinical benefits [7-9]. Given the diverse
communities involved in DHI (ie, technologists, researchers,
clinicians, consumers, and government stakeholders), there is
a need to establish a common language among these groups [7].
To address this need, the World Health Organization (WHO)
developed a DHI classification system to provide a shared
framework for naming, grouping, and evaluating DHIs.
According to this classification, each DHI is categorized into
groups based on primary users: persons, health care providers
(HCPs), health system managers, and data services [7].
DHIs have been extensively applied in chronic disease
management, showing clinical outcome improvements, better
management, and cost savings [10-15]. During the past 10 years,
DHIs are being increasingly applied in T2DM prevention, such
as text messaging, web-based systems, telemedicine (TM),
mobile health, software, wearables, and artificial intelligence
(AI) [16,17]. A systematic review by Van Rhoon et al [18] in
2020 demonstrated that DHIs significantly reduce weight,
enhance dysglycemia, and decrease T2DM incidence. According
to the systematic review by Nguyen et al [19] in 2024, DHIs
show further enhanced efficacy in preventing T2DM,
highlighting the success of computer-based and mobile health
in weight reduction, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) improvement,
and T2DM incidence reduction.
The quadruple aims of health care are the overarching goals
focusing on improving population health, enhancing consumer
experience, improving HCP experience, and decreasing health
costs [20]. The quadruple aims have been regarded as a strategic
compass in guiding DHIs in different contexts, such as chronic
disease prevention [21], diagnosis and treatment [22,23], health
care delivery [24], planning or decision-making [25], and
managing unique health care challenges, such as the COVID-19
pandemic [26].
The impacts of DHIs on improving the burden of T2DM, as
measured by the quadruple aims, still remain largely unknown.
Our aim was to systematically review the current literature to
examine the effects of DHIs on reducing the burden of T2DM,
as measured by the quadruple aims.
Methods
Study Design
This systematic review was conducted and reported following
PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews
and Meta-Analyses) guidelines of 2020 [27]. Details of the
PRISMA 2020 checklist are shown in Multimedia Appendix 1
[27]. The protocol of our systematic review was prospectively
registered at PROSPERO (International Prospective Register
of Systematic Reviews; registration number CRD42024512690).
Minor changes were made to the registration information: the
title was updated, the quadruple aims were added to the
objectives, and WHO’s DHI classification was included in the
data synthesis.
Ethical Considerations
Our study was a systematic review that used nonidentifiable,
secondary data from published studies. According to institutional
policies, no ethics review was required.
Search Strategy and Selection Criteria
The PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science databases
were searched with keywords in both Medical Subject Headings
and title/abstract formats: “digital health interventions,” “type
2 diabetes,” and “prevention.” The review included only studies
conducted in the past 10 years, from January 2014 to March
2024 (due to the emerging nature of the digital transformation
in health care). Building, testing, and finalizing the search
approach were performed by the research team, in consultation
with 2 research librarians from the University of Queensland
(Multimedia Appendix 2).
Inclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Table 1. The
intervention of interest was defined as the use of DHIs in support
of the prevention of T2DM in individuals with monitored blood
glucose or HbA1c. Given our focus on assessing the effects of
DHIs on preventing or delaying the onset of T2DM, and
considering that the diagnostic criteria for T2DM include HbA1c,
blood glucose, and clinical criteria, our primary outcomes were
the development of T2DM, HbA1c change, or blood glucose

change (dysglycemia changes). Secondary outcomes were
consumer experience, HCP experience, and health care costs.
Quantitative and qualitative data were included in our review.
Studies were excluded if individuals or populations had known
diabetes (T2DM, type 1 diabetes, or gestational diabetes, as
described by authors of specific studies) or outcomes that did
not report the development of T2DM, HbA1c change, or blood
glucose change.

Study Selection Process
Five reviewers participated in the selection and data extraction
processes (authors TD, WW, QO, and LW as primary reviewers
and author CS as a senior reviewer). All papers retrieved from
the database were collected and imported to EndNote version
20 (Clarivate) before being uploaded to Covidence version 2.
Titles and abstracts of identified studies were screened twice
(by TD, WW, QO, and LW) for potential eligibility using the
inclusion and exclusion criteria. Full texts that met the inclusion
criteria were retrieved and independently evaluated for their
eligibility by the reviewers. Duplicates identified either
automatically by Covidence or manually were excluded.
Reasons for excluding full-text papers were reported. Any
disagreements were solved via discussion and consensus.
A data extraction form was developed by the research team and
uploaded to Covidence (Multimedia Appendix 3). Data from
the selected papers were extracted and then checked (TD and
QO). Any discordance was resolved via discussion and
consensus of the reviewers.
Statistical Analysis
Primary and secondary outcomes were mapped to the quadruple
aims, which included improving population health, enhancing
consumer experience, enhancing HCP experience, and reducing
health costs. The population health aspect was measured by the

development of T2DM and dysglycemia changes (changes in
HbA1c or blood glucose).
Using WHO’s DHI classification (2023 version) [7], DHIs were
classified into different categories, such as targeted
communication with persons (TCP) for targeted individuals,
untargeted communication with persons for undefined groups,
person-to-person communication (PPC) in networks or forums,
personal health tracking (PHT) for self-monitoring, on-demand
communication with persons (DCP) for accessing health
information, person-centered health records (PHR), HCP
decision support (DS), and TM [7]. Details of the classification
are shown in Multimedia Appendix 4.
For each study, DHI categories were assessed for their effects
on each outcome, categorizing the effects as positive, negative,
or neutral:
•
Quantitative data: Effects were reported as “positive” if
there was a statistically significant improvement in
outcomes, “negative” if outcomes statistically worsened,
“neutral” if there was no statistically significant impact,
and “not available” if data were insufficient for evaluation.
•
Qualitative data (consumer experience and HCP experience
outcomes): Effects were reported as “positive” if there was
only positive feedback, “negative” if there was only
negative feedback, “mixed” if there was both positive and
negative feedback, “neutral” if there was no positive and
negative feedback, and “not available” if data were
insufficient for evaluation.
The overall effects of each DHI category were determined by
synthesizing all reported positive, neutral, or negative effects
regardless of the number of studies supporting each effect.
A meta-analysis was not performed because of the numerous
heterogeneous study designs with different interventions or
outcomes.
Risk-of-Bias Assessment
The Cochrane risk-of-bias version 2 tool (RoB 2) for randomized
trials was used to assess the quality of RCTs [32], while the
ROBINS-I (risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of
interventions) tool was applied for nonrandomized studies [33]
by TD, QO, and LJ. Any disagreements were solved via
discussion and consensus.
Results
Characteristics of Included Studies
In total, 3373 citations were retrieved from the database search,
of which 53 (1.6%) met the inclusion criteria, encompassing a
total of 34,488 participants. The number of papers at each stage
and the reasons for exclusion are detailed in Figure 1.

Figure 1. PRISMA flow diagram for study selection. PRISMA: Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses.
The characteristics of the included studies are shown in
Multimedia Appendix 5 [5,10,16,34-83]. Most studies were
conducted in health care settings (n=35, 66%) and in
high-income countries (n=49, 92.5%) [84]. RCTs were the most
common research design (n=31, 58.5%). All studies had a
duration of at least 3 months. The DHI duration fluctuated from
1 to 48 months. DHIs were mostly applied in combination with
HCP interactions (n=43, 81.1%).
Risk of Bias
The nonrandomized studies showed a disproportionately high
number of moderate and serious risks of bias (n=17, 77.3%),
predominantly due to not accurately recording and analyzing
confounders. In the RCTs, the risk of bias in population health
outcomes ranged from low to high, while the risks of bias in
HbA1c and blood glucose change outcomes exhibited some
similarities, with approximately 12 of 22 (54.5%) and 10 of 23
(43.5%) studies, respectively, presenting either some concerns
or high risks. However, a few studies (n=7, 77.8%) had a high
risk of bias or some concerns in the T2DM development
outcome. This was mainly due to discrepancies observed in the
measurement of the T2DM development outcome between
groups and bias resulting from missing outcome data. There
were no high risks of bias in consumer experience and health
care cost outcomes, with the majority having low risks (n=37,
70%, and n=35, 66.7%, respectively). The HCP experience
outcome was not assessed in RCTs. There were 24 (45.3%)
studies with a low risk of bias in all outcomes and 10 (41.7%)
studies with both a low risk of bias and an intervention duration
of at least 1 year. Details are shown in Multimedia Appendix
6 [5,10,16,34-83].
Study Outcomes
Five outcomes were reported: consumer experience (n=13,
24.5%), health care costs (n=3, 5.7%), HCP experience (n=1,
1.9%), development of T2DM (n=14, 26.4%), and dysglycemia
changes (n=52, 98.1%). Many studies reported multiple
outcomes.

Study Interventions
In total, 15 DHIs were investigated. The prevalence of each
DHI is visualized in Figure 2 [5,10,16,34-44,46-83,94].
Using WHO’s DHI classification, 7 DHI categories were
identified: TCP, PPC, PHT, DCP, PHR, HCP DS, and TM.
For the T2DM development outcome, the effects of DHIs were
positive in 1 (7.1%) study and neutral in 9 (64.3%) studies, and
there were insufficient data to assess in 4 (28.6%) studies. For
the dysglycemia outcome, the effects were positive in 23
(43.4%) studies and neutral in 24 (45.3%) studies, and there
were insufficient data in 6 (11.3%) studies. Among the 10
(18.9%) studies with a low risk of bias in all outcomes and an
intervention duration of at least 1 year, none assessed the
development of T2DM; the effects of DHIs on dysglycemia
were positive in 7 (70%) studies and neutral in 2 (20%) studies,
and there were insufficient data in 1 (10%) study.
The effects of DHIs in all studies on consumer experience were
mixed, with most being positive (n=7, 53.8%). The effects of
DHIs on costs, assessed in 2 (3.8%) studies, were found to be
negative. The only study reporting HCP experience indicated
a positive effect.
Table 2 highlights the effect of each DHI category on each
outcome. The effects of DHI categories and subcategories on
the outcomes in each study are illustrated in Multimedia
Appendix 7 [5,10,16,34-83].

Targeted Communication With Persons
All included studies (N=53, 100%) applied TCP, including
transmitting targeted health information or targeted alerts and
reminders to patients. Of the 10 (18.9%) studies reviewing the
effects of TCP on T2DM prevention, 9 (90%) were neutral, and
1 (10%) was positive. Of the 47 (88.7%) studies assessing
dysglycemia changes, 24 (51.1%) reported neutral effects, and
23 (48.9%) posted positive effects. For example, Arora et al
[34] proved after the intervention that there is a significant
reduction in predicted HbA1c (P<.001).
The effects of TCP on consumer experience was mixed, on HCP
experience was positive, and on health care cost was neutral
(n=1, 33.3%) or negative (n=2, 66.7%).
Person-to-Person Communication
Of 16 (30.2%) studies, 2 (12.5%) studies reviewing the effects
of PPC on T2DM prevention were by Fitzpatrick et al [35] and
McKenzie et al [36]. Results showed a neutral effect, with no
significant difference in the T2DM diagnosis compared to the
control group.
Of the 15 (93.8%) PPC studies assessing dysglycemia changes,
10 (66.7%) posted positive effects and 5 (33.3%) showed no
discernible effect. For example, Castro Sweet et al [10] used
PPC, TCP, and PHT in their DHIs; after the interventions, the
change in the mean HbA1c of participants reduced by 0.1%
(P=.001).
A PPC study (6.3%) by Katula et al [37] reported consumer
experience, with negative feedback of consumers.
A single study (6.3%), which was by Limaye et al [38], reported
the effects of PPC on health care costs. The incremental cost of
the DHI was GBP 35.8 (USD 47.5) per participant compared
to GBP 23.3 (USD 30.9) per participant in the control group
[38].
No study assessed the effect of PPC on HCP experience.
Personal Health Tracking
In 37 (69.8%) studies, PHT allowed individuals to self-monitor
their health or diagnostic data (n=28, 75.7%) or actively
capture/store health data to the digital platform (n=15, 40.5%).
Of the 5 (13.5%) studies on PHT reporting its effects on
preventing T2DM, 1 (20%) study [39] posted a positive effect,
with 4 (80%) other studies [35,36,40,41] reporting a neutral
effect on T2DM development.
Of the 37 (69.8%) studies, 34 (91.9%) assessed the effectiveness
of PHT in dysglycemia changes, with both positive (61.8%)
and neutral (38.2%) effects. Karvela et al [42] indicated that
the effect of PHT on improving HbA1c was not significantly
different compared to the control group (P=.31).
Of the 10 (27%) studies assessing the effects of PHT on
consumer experience, the results varied; 4 (40%) studies showed
a positive effect, 3 (30%) showed a negative effect, 2 (20%)
were inconclusive or neutral, and 1 (10%) showed mixed effects.
For example, Peacock et al [43] showed that participants using
wearables/trackers feel empowered in their choice of appropriate
foods (P=.04).
No studies reported HCP experience or health care costs.

On-Demand Communication With Persons
Of the 13 (24.5%) studies on DCP, 11 (84.6%) consisted of
seeking supporting information and 3 (15.4%) simulated
human-like conversations.
In addition, 2 (15.4%) studies [40,44] reported prevention
effectiveness of DCP, and both had a neutral effect.
Of the 12 studies (92.3%) assessing the effects of dysglycemia,
9 (75%) reported positive population health outcomes, such as
significant HbA1c reduction compared to the control group in
Kim et al [45] using virtual reality (VR) technology and Everett
et al [46] using AI interventions (P<.05). Furthermore, 3 (25%)
studies [40,44,47] showed the effect was neutral.
Of the 3 (23.1%) studies reporting the effectiveness of DCP on
consumer experience, Cha et al [48] and Potzel et al [44]
reported better experience outcomes for patients in the DHI
groups, while Block et al [5] showed no effect.
Limaye et al [38] reported the effects of DCP on health care
costs, with negative results. No studies reported the effects of
on-demand communication on HCP experience.
Person-Centered Health Records and Health Care
Provider Decision Support
One study applied PHR and HCP DS in their DHIs. Mann et al
[49] reported no change in HbA1c and blood glucose levels after
the intervention. Effects on T2DM prevention, consumer
experience, HCP experience, and health care costs were not
included in the study.
Telemedicine
TM included remote consultations (n=25, 47.2%) and remote
health monitoring (n=7, 13.2%).
Of the 5 (20%) studies reporting the effects of TM on T2DM
development, only 1 (20%) study by Sakane et al [39] indicated
that TM is effective. The other 4 (80%) studies [35,40,44,50]
did not show any significant differences compared to the control
group.
Of the 20 (80%) studies assessing changes in the glycemia status
of participants, 11 (55%) showed that TM improves HbA1c or
blood glucose significantly and 9 (45%) reported neutral effects.
For example, Muralidharan et al [51] and Holmes et al [52]
concluded that TM, in addition to TCP, does not have a
significant effect on delaying T2DM.
The effects of TM on consumer experience were varied, with
5 (71.4%) studies [39,44,48,53,54] reporting positive effects,
1 (14.2%) study [5] with no discernible effect, and 1 (14.2%)
study [55] with mixed effects. For example, participants from
Block et al [5] reported both positive and negative feedback.
Only 1 (14.2%) study assessed HCP experience in TM
interventions, with HCP participants leaving positive feedback
for TM, according to Savas et al [54].
Discussion
Principal Findings
This is the first systematic review to evaluate the effects of DHIs
on the quadruple aims in T2DM prevention. Our findings
enhance other recent studies, such as Nguyen et al [19], by
offering a more comprehensive insight into the outcomes that
are measured (and not measured), and the effects of DHIs on
each outcome, in alignment with the quadruple aims of health
care. This contributes to an evidence-based foundation for the
future successful customization and implementation of DHIs
for T2DM prevention. This is also the first systematic review
of T2DM prevention using WHO’s DHI classification, which
significantly aids in a mutually comprehensible language for
various communities involved in digital health for T2DM
prevention, such as technologists, researchers, clinicians, and
consumers.
Our review highlights several important findings. First, there
is emerging evidence supporting the effectiveness of DHIs in
preventing T2DM; however, the evidence remains limited.
Although only 1 study [39] reported positive effects, 9 studies
indicated neutral effects and no studies reported negative effects.
This is consistent with the findings by Nguyen et al [19]. Despite
this, most of these neutral studies still demonstrated clinical
improvements
in
T2DM
development,
though
these
improvements did not reach statistical significance. The
evidence is clearer on dysglycemia, where the effects were
positive in nearly half of the studies and neutral in the other
half. Further research will need to conclusively determine the
effectiveness of DHIs in preventing T2DM.
Second, the duration of DHI may play an important role in the
effects on the population health outcome. All studies successful
in improving dysglycemia had a DHI duration of at least 3
months, while the study successful in T2DM prevention had a
duration of 12 months [39]. Among the 10 studies with a low
risk of bias in all outcomes and an intervention duration of at
least 1 year, a high percentage of studies (70%) demonstrated
positive effects of DHIs on dysglycemia. Comparable results
about dysglycemia were reported by Van Rhoon et al [18] and
Donevant et al [85]. This can be because habit formation usually
takes 2-3 months [86], and significant HbA1c changes require
at least 3 months [87]. However, recent evidence from DPPs
that have proven to be successful shows that long intervention
durations are required for delaying T2DM [88], with the
National Health Service recommending at least 9 months and
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggesting 12
months. For effective T2DM prevention, a minimum DHI
duration of 9-12 months may be ideal. Future research should
validate these findings.
Third, there was no evidence that DHIs are effective in
preventing T2DM without HCP interaction, and most studies
(69.6%) successful in improving dysglycemia involved HCP
interaction (75% remote, 12.5% in person, and 12.5% both).
Comparable results were reported in the review by Grock et al
[89], which highlighted the importance of social interaction for
successful diabetes prevention interventions. The meta-analysis
by Schippers et al [90] reported that mobile apps with personal

interaction tools (messages, calls, email, or in-person meetings)
are more effective for weight loss than automated interaction.
This underscores the critical role of HCP interaction in
preventing T2DM, while also revealing the promising potential
of replacing in-person HCP interactions with remote interactions
for effective DHIs for T2DM prevention.
Next, all studies that reported positive population health
outcomes used a minimum of 2 distinct categories of DHIs.
These findings share similarities with the systematic review by
Van Rhoon et al [18], which suggested that interventions with
a larger number of passive and interactive digital features are
more effective. In our review, TCP, which involves transmitting
health information or health alerts and reminders to patients,
was adopted in all included studies, demonstrating its
widespread use and simplicity. TCP was used in combination
with other DHI categories, such as PHT, TM, PCP, or DCP.
PHT showed evidence as a potentially useful tool for T2DM
prevention and dysglycemia improvement in our review.
Similarly, many studies showed that PHT successfully increases
physical activity and decreases a sedentary lifestyle [91-93].
The effect of PHT on consumer experience was mixed.
Automatic data capture in wearables and medical devices
received more positive feedback than manual data capture,
which had only neutral or negative effects. This is likely because
data capture is more aligned with manual tasks, whereas
wearables and medical devices are designed for automatic data
collection. This result aligns with the study by Kim et al [94]
on self-tracking via a web-based platform. Participants using
devices with automatic data entry engaged with the platform 4
times longer than those who manually entered data [94]. This
evidence strongly suggests that PHT, particularly automated
tracking devices, could play a pivotal role in the prevention
strategies for T2DM.
Our review suggests that TM may be effective in preventing
T2DM and managing dysglycemia. This aligns with the review
by Nguyen et al [19]. TM consists of remote consultations
through calls and messages, and remote health monitoring. This
monitoring can be achieved either automatically or manually
via PHT tools, such as wearables, medical devices, or web-based
apps. Consequently, there is a significant correlation between
TM and PHT. Our review also shows evidence that the
combination of TM, PHT, and TCP is effective in T2DM
prevention. This suggests that such DHIs should not only be
embraced but also be integrated with other DHIs in T2DM
prevention.
Although PPC or DCP did not prove effective in preventing
T2DM, they showed evidence of improving dysglycemia. PPC
may be beneficial in glycemic control for diabetes management
[95,96].
There is evidence that using DCP (look-up tools, human-like
conversations) is helpful in diabetes prevention and
management. In our review, AI used with wearables showed
positive effects on glycemic status [46,56]. Similarly, evidence
indicates that using AI technology in diabetes management is
effective when combined with wearable technologies [97].
Advanced algorithms and data from everyday participants’
activities allowed AI to provide lifestyle recommendations,
which were real time, personalized, and contextual for each
participant, contributing to delivering patient-centered care [98].
VR was used in 1 study, providing an immersive experience
that increased participant engagement and enjoyment [99]. This
highlights an advantage of VR technology. Further studies are
needed to explore the potential of PPC, AI, and VR in T2DM
prevention.
Health records and HCP DS were the least common in our
review, with only 1 included study showing neutral effects.
These DHIs target HCPs rather than consumers. Since
preventing T2DM requires participants to modify lifestyles for
a long period, DHIs that motivate and engage consumers may
be more beneficial than DHIs targeting HCPs alone. Further
studies should explore combining these DHIs with
consumer-targeted interventions.
Finally, there were insufficient studies assessing HCP experience
(1 study) and health care costs (3 studies). For other topics,
there were several studies focusing on the effects of DHIs on
HCP experience. Lampickienė et al [100] concluded that HCPs
mostly report positive experiences with digital consultations,
which have advantages for HCPs and patients. Studies that
reported health care costs of DHIs were sparse; all 3 studies in
our review indicated no positive cost outcomes in DHIs.
According to a systematic review of DHIs by Gentili et al [101],
there is convincing evidence of the cost-effectiveness of DHI
in health care. They indicated that several types of DHIs, such
as videoconferencing systems, messaging, calls, mobile apps,
and web-based platforms, help reduce health care costs.
Although the findings in our review were different, the small
number of studies suggests that it may still be feasible to
implement DHIs that are cost-effective in T2DM prevention.
Further studies implementing DHIs should assess not only
population health outcomes and consumer experiences but also
HCP experiences and health care costs.
Limitations
There are some limitations of our review. The diagnosis criteria
for T2DM varied slightly across studies. This is because of
different guidelines, resources, and clinical considerations.
Although our study reflected a real-world scenario, the variation
in diagnosis criteria could potentially lead to data
inconsistencies, because different diagnosis criteria may classify
the same participant differently.
The inclusion criteria of our study permitted a wide range of
variability in aspects, such as study design, study population,
DHIs, and duration. DHIs are intended for real-life
implementation, and the condition of RCTs is unlikely to match
those routine settings, while before-and-after studies or cohort
studies can provide valuable insights into special populations,
such as patients with chronic liver disease [57] or renal
transplant [58], groups that are often difficult to enroll in RCTs.
This diversity, while inclusive, posed challenges in drawing
direct comparisons and made it unfeasible to conduct a
meta-analysis or certainty-of-evidence assessment.
The intervention duration fluctuated between 1 month and 48
months. Chronic diseases, such as T2DM, develop over a long
period [102]. Short-term studies may not allow for the

comprehensive effects of DHIs to show a clear impact on disease
progression. More studies with longer durations are needed.
Our study did not summarize the intensity and frequency of the
DHI used in each included study. To provide a more
comprehensive understanding of the effects of DHIs, further
reviews and studies should examine the intensity and frequency
of DHIs, rather than solely focusing on their duration.
Finally, our inclusion criteria included papers in English only.
This may have potentially excluded some relevant studies.
Conclusion
The findings from this systematic review demonstrate that the
effects of DHIs on the quadruple aims in T2DM prevention
have proven benefits for population health, mixed results for
consumer experience, and insufficient studies on HCP
experience and health care costs. Further studies should
prioritize improving consumer experience, while also addressing
HCP experience and health care costs.
Although evidence supporting the effectiveness of DHIs in
reducing the burden of T2DM remains limited, it is clear DHIs
are effective in improving dysglycemia. To maximize their
effectiveness in preventing T2DM and managing dysglycemia,
DHIs should be strategically integrated with in-person or remote
HCP interaction. The incorporation of health information
transmission, alerts, and reminders for targeted individuals,
along with TM and PHT strategies, is paramount. Peer group
support, look-up tools, AI, and VR hold promising potential for
future exploration in this field. We anticipate the advancement
in these technologies will significantly influence the prevention
of T2DM in the future.
