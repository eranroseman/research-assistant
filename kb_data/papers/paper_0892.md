## Abstract
Background
              Continued use of mHealth apps can achieve better effects in health management. Gamification is an important factor in promoting users’ intention to continue using mHealth apps. Past research has rarely explored the factors underlying the continued use of mobile health (mHealth) apps and gamification’s impact mechanism or path on continued use.
            
            
              Objective
              This study aimed to explore the factors influencing mHealth app users’ intention to continue using mHealth apps and the impact mechanism and path of users’ feelings induced by gamification on continued mHealth app use.
            
            
              Methods
              First, based on the expectation confirmation model of information system continuance, we built a theoretical model for continued use of mHealth apps based on users’ feelings toward gamification. We used self-determination theory to analyze gamification’s impact on user perceptions and set the resulting feelings (competence, autonomy, and relatedness) as constructs in the model. Second, we used the survey method to validate the research model, and we used partial least squares to analyze the data.
            
            
              Results
              A total of 2988 responses were collected from mHealth app users, and 307 responses were included in the structural equation model after passing the acceptance criteria. The intrinsic motivation for using mHealth apps is significantly affected by autonomy (β=.312; P<.001), competence (β=.346; P<.001), and relatedness (β=.165; P=.004) induced by gamification. The intrinsic motivation for using mHealth apps has a significant impact on satisfaction (β=.311, P<.001) and continuance intention (β=.142; P=.045); furthermore, satisfaction impacts continuance intention significantly (β=.415; P<.001). Confirmation has a significant impact on perceived usefulness (β=.859; P<.001) and satisfaction (β=.391; P<.001), and perceived usefulness has a significant impact on satisfaction (β=.269; P<.001) and continuance intention (β=.273; P=.001). The mediating effect analysis showed that in the impact path of the intrinsic motivation for using the mHealth apps on continuance intention, satisfaction plays a partial mediating role (β=.129; P<.001), with a variance accounted for of 0.466.
            
            
              Conclusions
              This study explored the impact path of users’ feelings induced by gamification on the intention of continued mHealth app use. We confirmed that perceived usefulness, confirmation, and satisfaction in the classical continued use theory for nonmedical information systems positively affect continuance intention. We also found that the path and mechanism of users' feelings regarding autonomy, competence, and relatedness generated during interactions with different gamification elements promote the continued use of mHealth apps.
