## Abstract
Sleep behaviour is an important contributing factor in healthy human ageing and cognitive function. Previous studies have linked sleep deficiency with cognitive decline in older adults. However, there is need for more prospective investigations that focus on specific domains of cognitive function. The present study analysed cross-sectional and prospective associations between self-reported sleep and cognitive function in the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study. Weekday and weekend sleep duration and habitual sleep quality were obtained via questionnaire data. Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone was conducted to assess overall cognitive function, as well as episodic memory and executive function. We found significant trend for both long weekday and weekend sleep (>8 hr) and lower episodic memory scores in the overall sample. Sex-specific cross-sectional analysis demonstrated men with longer weekend sleep duration have lower overall cognitive function scores, and a negative association between weekend sleep and episodic memory scores. Women demonstrated a positive association between weekend sleep duration and executive function scores. There was no prospective significance for overall or sex-specific analysis. Our present results suggest that sleep duration may contribute to cognitive function, and future studies should include objective sleep measurements and focus on the potential cognitive benefits of improving sleep to further elucidate this association.
