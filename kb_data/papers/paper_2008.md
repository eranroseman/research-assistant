## Abstract
The majority of behavior change and persuasive technologies are exclusively addressed to modify a specific behavior. However, the focus on behavior may cloud the “existential aspects” of the process of change. To explore the lived and meaning-laden experience of behavior change, we interviewed 23 individuals who have used behavior change technology in their everyday life. The study findings highlight that behavior change is tied to meanings that point to existential matters, relates to a nexus of life circumstances, and unfolds over long periods of time. By contrast, the technology used by the participants appears mostly to focus on the present target behavior, ignoring its links to the participants’ life “context” and “time,” also providing scarce help for sense-making. Based on these findings, we surface a preliminary “existential model of behavior change,” identify several barriers that may prevent the modification of behavior and propose some design suggestions to overcome them.
