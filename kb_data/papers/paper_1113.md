## Abstract
Objective
The objective of this pilot study was to examine the feasibility of a remote physical activity monitoring program, quantify baseline activity levels, and examine predictors of activity among rurally residing adults with Parkinson disease (PD) or stroke.
Design
Thirty-day observational study. Participants completed standardized assessments, connected a wearable device, and synced daily step counts via a remote monitoring platform.
Setting
Community-based remote monitoring.
Participants
Rurally residing adults with PD or stroke enrolled in the Veterans Health Administration.
Intervention
N/A.
Main Outcome Measures
Feasibility was evaluated using recruitment data (response rates), study completion (completed assessments and connected the wearable device), and device adherence (days recording â‰¥100 steps). Daily step counts were examined descriptively. Predictors of daily steps were explored across the full sample, then by diagnosis, using linear mixed-effects regression analyses.
Results
Forty participants (n=20 PD; n=20 stroke) were included in the analysis with a mean (SD) age of 72.9 (7.6) years. Participants resided 252.6 (105.6) miles from the coordinating site. Recruitment response rates were 11% (PD) and 6% (stroke). Study completion rates were 71% (PD) and 80% (stroke). Device adherence rates were 97.0% (PD) and 95.2% (stroke). Participants with PD achieved a median [interquartile range] of 2618 [3896] steps per day and participants with stroke achieved 4832 [7383] steps. Age was the only significant predictor of daily steps for the full sample (-265 steps, 95% confidence interval [-407, -123]) and by diagnosis (PD, -175 steps, [-335, -15]; stroke, -357 steps [-603, -112]).
Conclusions
A remote physical activity monitoring program for rurally residing individuals with PD or stroke was feasible. This study establishes a model for a scalable physical activity program for rural, older populations with neurologic conditions from a central coordinating site.
