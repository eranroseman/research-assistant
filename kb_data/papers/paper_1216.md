## Abstract
Background Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the leading cause of death globally, accounting for almost 18 million deaths annually. People with CVDs have a five times greater chance of suﬀering a recurrent cardiovascular event than people without known CVDs. Although drug interventions have been shown to be cost-eﬀective in reducing the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events, adherence to medication remains suboptimal. As a scalable and cost-eﬀective approach, mobile phone text messaging presents an opportunity to convey health information, deliver electronic reminders, and encourage behaviour change. However, it is uncertain whether text messaging can improve medication adherence and clinical outcomes. This is an update of a Cochrane review published in 2017.
