## Abstract
Background: Cuffless blood pressure measurement technologies have attracted significant attention for their potential to transform cardiovascular monitoring. Methods: This updated narrative review thoroughly examines the challenges, opportunities, and limitations associated with the implementation of cuffless blood pressure monitoring systems. Results: Diverse technologies, including photoplethysmography, tonometry, and ECG analysis, enable cuffless blood pressure measurement and are integrated into devices like smartphones and smartwatches. Signal processing emerges as a critical aspect, dictating the accuracy and reliability of readings. Despite its potential, the integration of cuffless technologies into clinical practice faces obstacles, including the need to address concerns related to accuracy, calibration, and standardization across diverse devices and patient populations. The development of robust algorithms to mitigate artifacts and environmental disturbances is essential for extracting clear physiological signals. Based on extensive research, this review emphasizes the necessity for standardized protocols, validation studies, and regulatory frameworks to ensure the reliability and safety of cuffless blood pressure monitoring devices and their implementation in mainstream medical practice. Interdisciplinary collaborations between engineers, clinicians, and regulatory bodies are crucial to address technical, clinical, and regulatory complexities during implementation. In conclusion, while cuffless blood pressure monitoring holds immense potential to transform cardiovascular care. The resolution of existing challenges and the establishment of rigorous standards are imperative for its seamless incorporation into routine clinical practice. Conclusion: The emergence of these new technologies shifts the paradigm of cardiovascular health management, presenting a new possibility for non-invasive continuous and dynamic monitoring. The concept of cuffless blood pressure measurement is viable and more finely tuned devices are expected to enter the market, which could redefine our understanding of blood pressure and hypertension. This review explores cuffless blood pressure technologies and their impact on clinical practice, highlighting innovative devices that offer non-invasive, continuous and non-continuous monitoring without a cuff. Signal processing is essential for ensuring accurate readings, as it filters out unwanted artifacts and environmental disturbances which could make the reading inaccurate. While these advancements show great potential for transforming cardiovascular care, there are still several challenges to overcome, including the need for standardized protocols and validation studies to ensure their reliability and safety in clinical settings. Collaborative efforts between engineers, clinicians, and regulatory bodies are needed to address the technical and regulatory complexities surrounding the implementation of these technologies. These cuffless blood pressure measurement devices have the potential to reshape how we understand and manage blood pressure and hypertension.
