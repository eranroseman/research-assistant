## Abstract
Abstract                Background                Mechanical life made us witness the growing increase of chronic diseases despite the prominent scientific developments in the field of health, treatment and control. The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of educational intervention based on Health Belief Model (HBM) using mobile applications (Telegram messenger) on doing exercise among the health care workers of Ilam university of medical sciences in 2017.                              Methods                In this interventional study, 114 people working in Ilam University of medical sciences participated in two groups of intervention and control (employed at two different cities) after providing the informed consent form. HBM-ISCS questionnaire was used to collect the required data and its reliability was approved using Cronbach’s alpha. Descriptive statistics, chi square, t test, repeated measures ANOVA (RMANOVA) and structural equation model (SEM) were used.                              Results                Half of the participants were men, 58.77% of them were undergraduate. The mean and SD of their age was 37.61 ± 4.88 years. Based on the results of the repeated measures analysis of variance test (before and after the intervention) in the intervention group, there were significant difference in all of the HBM constructs (perceived barriers was excepted), daily and weekly exercises, blood biochemical markers of the participants (P > 0.05). The above changes were not significant in the control group (P ≥ 0.05).                              Conclusion                Exercise is closely related to the beliefs of people, so implementing educational interventions based on Telegram messenger with emphasis on health beliefs and using HBM can lead to have exercise. Therefore, this application can be a suitable tool to deliver trainings, especially when holding in-person classes is difficult.
