## Abstract
Conversational voice interfaces have the potential to reduce some challenges of digital food journaling by leveraging availability in multiple devices, allowing for multi-tasking through hands-free interactions, and conversationally construct food logs. Traditionally, journaling has been supported mainly through database searches, barcode scanning, photo-taking, open-ended text description, and voice memos. To explore how technology can expand these journaling options to support conversational journaling, we have been preparing a co-design study to elicit peopleâ€™s desired conversational interactions and understand how those align with their personal eating goals and vary by situations or constraints.
