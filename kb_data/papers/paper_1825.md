## Abstract
The research community on the study and design of systems for personal informatics has grown over the past decade. To take stock of what the topics the ﬁeld has studied and methods the ﬁeld has used, we map and label 523 publications from ACM’s library, IEEE Xplore, and PubMed. We surface that the literature has focused on studying and designing for health and wellness domains, an emphasis on understanding and overcoming barriers to data collection and reﬂection, and progressively fewer contributions involving artifacts being made. Our mapping review suggests directions future research could explore, such as identifying and resolving barriers to tracking stages beyond collection and reﬂection, engaging more with domain experts, and further discussing the privacy and ethical concerns around tracked data. CCS Concepts: • Human-centered Computing → Human computer interaction (HCI); Ubiquitous and mobile computing theory, concepts, and paradigms.
