## Abstract
BACKGROUND Regular physical activity is crucial for healthy aging, but older adults are the least active age group. This study explored the feasibility, acceptability, and efficacy of a multilevel mHealth intervention for increasing physical activity of older adults living in a retirement community. METHODS Participants included 54 older adults (mean age = 81.2y, 77.8% female, 98.1% white) living in a retirement community. Participants received a Fitbit Zip and access to a multilevel mHealth physical activity intervention (MapTrek Residential) for 8weeks. Physical activity (in steps per day) and intervention compliance (days worn) were measured objectively with the Fitbit for 12weeks (8-wk intervention plus 4-wk follow-up). Psychosocial outcomes (social support, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations) were assessed at baseline and 8weeks. Acceptability outcomes were assessed with an open-ended process evaluation survey and focus groups. Descriptive statistics and linear mixed models were used to examine intervention effects. RESULTS Participants increased daily steps from 5438 steps per day at baseline (95% CI, 4620 to 6256) to 6201 steps per day (95% CI, 5359 to 7042) at week 8 (P < .0001) but this was not maintained at 12weeks (P = .92). CONCLUSIONS Our multilevel mHealth physical activity intervention was effective for increasing physical activity older adults over 8weeks. Additional research focused on maintaining physical activity gains with this approach is warranted.
