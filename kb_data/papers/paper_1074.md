## Abstract
OBJECTIVE
              To use combined glycemic (HbA1c) and BMI z-score (BMIZ) trajectories spanning the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic to identify high-risk subgroups of adolescents with diabetes.
            
            
              RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS
              Retrospective cohort of adolescents 10–19 years old with type 1 and type 2 diabetes with one or more visits at a large pediatric hospital from January 2018 through February 2020 (prepandemic) and April 2020 through August 2021 (pandemic). Group-based trajectory models were used to identify latent classes of combined BMIZ and HbA1c trajectories. Multinomial logistic regression was used to evaluate predictors of class membership, including Area Deprivation Index (ADI) (socioeconomic status proxy).
            
            
              RESULTS
              The cohort included 1,322 youth with type 1 diabetes (93% White and 7% Black) and 59 with type 2 diabetes (53% Black and 47% White). For type 1 diabetes, six trajectory classes emerged. Black youth were more likely to be in the class with worsening glycemic control and concurrent BMIZ decrease at pandemic onset (relative risk ratio [RRR] vs. White: 3.0 [95% CI 1.3–6.8]) or in the class with progressively worsening glycemic control and obesity (RRR 3.0 [95% CI 1.3–6.8]), while those from the most deprived neighborhoods (RRR ADI tertile 3 vs. 1: 1.9 [95% CI 1.2–2.9]) were more likely to be in the class with stable obesity and glycemic control. For type 2 diabetes, three distinct trajectories emerged, two of which experienced worsening glycemic control with concurrent BMIZ decline at pandemic onset.
            
            
              CONCLUSIONS
              Race and neighborhood deprivation were independently associated with distinct glycemic and BMIZ trajectory classes in youth with diabetes, highlighting persistent and widening disparities associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.
