## Abstract
Out-of-office blood pressure measurement is an essential part of diagnosing and managing hypertension. In the era of advanced digital health information technology, the approach to achieving this is shifting from traditional methods (ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring) to wearable devices and technology. Wearable blood pressure monitors allow frequent blood pressure measurements (ideally continuous beat-by-beat monitoring of blood pressure) with minimal stress on the patient. It is expected that wearable devices will dramatically change the quality of detection and management of hypertension by increasing the number of measurements in different situations, allowing accurate detection of phenotypes that have a negative impact on cardiovascular prognosis, such as masked hypertension and abnormal blood pressure variability. Frequent blood pressure measurements and the addition of new features such as monitoring of environmental conditions allows interpretation of blood pressure data in the context of daily stressors and different situations. This new digital approach to hypertension contributes to anticipation medicine, which refers to strategies designed to identify increasing risk and predict the onset of cardiovascular events based on a series of data collected over time, allowing proactive interventions to reduce risk. To achieve this, further research and validation is required to develop wearable blood pressure monitoring devices that provide the same accuracy as current approaches and can effectively contribute to personalized medicine.
