## Abstract
Abstract
            Endothelial dysfunction is a characteristic of systemic arterial hypertension (SAH) and an early marker of atherosclerosis. Aerobic exercise training (AT) improves endothelial function. However, the effects of resistance training (RT) and combined training (CT) on endothelial function remain controversial in individuals with SAH. We determined the effects of AT, RT, and CT on endothelial function and systolic (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in individuals with prehypertension or hypertension. Forty-two participants (54 ± 11 y, resting SBP/DBP 137 ± 9/86 ± 6 mmHg) were randomly allocated into AT (n = 14, 40 min of cycling, 50–75% heart rate reserve), RT (n = 14, 6 resistance exercises, 4 × 12 repetitions, 60% maximum strength) and CT (n = 14, 2 × 12 repetitions of RT + 20 min of AT). All participants performed a 40-minute exercise session twice a week for 8 weeks. Endothelial function was evaluated by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Blood pressure was evaluated through ambulatory monitoring for 24 hours. After 8 weeks of exercise training, blood pressure was reduced in all 3 groups: −5.1 mmHg in SBP (95%CI –10.1, 0.0; p = 0.003) in AT; −4.0 mmHg in SBP (95%CI −7.8, −0.5; p = 0.027) in RT; and −3.2 mmHg in DBP (95%CI −7.9, 1.5; p = 0.001) in CT. All 3 exercise training modalities produced similar improvements in FMD: + 3.2% (95%CI 1.7, 4.6) (p < 0.001) in AT; + 4.0% (95%CI 2.1, 5.7) (p < 0.001) in RT; and +6.8% (95%CI 2.6, 11.1) (p = 0.006) in CT. In conclusion, different exercise training modalities were similarly effective in improving endothelial function but impacts on ambulatory blood pressure appear to be variable in individuals with prehypertension or hypertension.
