## Abstract
Abstract   Background  Medical offices are increasingly hiring clinical pharmacists to improve management of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Most offices employ only one pharmacist, while the volume of patients with complex medical and social issues creates a struggle for providers to meet demand. We have developed a remote telehealth service provided by clinical pharmacists to complement CVD services provided by on-site clinical pharmacists and aid sites without a clinical pharmacist. This cardiovascular risk service (CVRS) has been studied in two NIH-funded trials, however, we identified barriers to optimal intervention implementation. The purpose of this study is to examine how to implement the CVRS into medical offices and see if the intervention will be sustained.    Methods  This is a 5-year, pragmatic, cluster-randomized clinical trial in 13 primary care clinics across the US. We randomized clinics to receive CVRS or usual care and will enroll 300 patient subjects and 288 key stakeholder subjects. We have obtained access to the electronic medical records (EMRs) of all study clinics to recruit subjects and provide the pharmacist intervention. The intervention is staggered so that after 12months, the usual care sites will receive the intervention for 12months. Follow-up will be accomplished though medical record abstraction at baseline, 12months, 24months, and 36months.    Conclusions  This study will enroll subjects through 2021 and results available in 2024. This study will provide unique information on how the CVRS provided by remote clinical pharmacists can be effectively implemented in medical offices, many of which already employ on-site clinical pharmacists.
