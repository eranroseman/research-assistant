## Abstract
IntroductionUp to 40% of patients with breast cancer may not adhere to adjuvant endocrine therapy. Therapy-related adverse effects (AEs) are important contributors to nonadherence. We developed a bidirectional text-message application, BETA-Text, that simultaneously tracks adherence, records symptoms, and alerts the clinical team.Patients and MethodsWe piloted our intervention in 100 patients. The intervention consisted of text messages to which patients responded for 3 months: daily, evaluating adherence; weekly, evaluating medication-related AEs; and monthly, regarding barriers to adherence. Concerning responses prompted a telephone call from a clinic nurse. The primary objective was to assess patient acceptance of this intervention using self-reported surveys. To compare participants with the general population at our institution, we assessed 100 consecutively treated patients as historical controls using medical record review.ResultsWe approached 141 consecutive patients, 100 (71%) of whom agreed to p...
