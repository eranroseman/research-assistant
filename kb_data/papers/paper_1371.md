## Abstract
The rapidly evolving digital health landscape necessitates updates to existing self-care models in nursing. This viewpoint paper revisits and evaluates prevalent models, recognizing their comprehensive exploration of self-care concepts while also identifying a gap in the incorporation of personal informatics. It underscores the missing link of human-technology interplay, an essential aspect in understanding self-care practices within digital generations. The author delineates the role of personal health tracking in self-care and the achievement of desired health outcomes. Based on these insights, the author proposes a refined, digitized self-care model that incorporates mobile health (mHealth) technologies and self-tracking behaviors. The paper concludes by advocating the application of this model for future mHealth nursing interventions, providing a framework for facilitating patient self-care and improving health and well-being in the era of digital health.
