## Abstract
Background: Despite the use of health information technology (HIT) for controlling and managing lupus, its effectiveness has not been well studied. The objective of this study was to investigate the role of HIT in controlling and managing lupus.
Methods: We searched Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase, using "self-management", "self-care" and "Systemic Lupus Erythematosus" keywords. Two researchers selected relevant papers and extracted data using a data collection form. Disagreements were resolved in consultation with the third and fourth researchers. After extraction, the data were analyzed.
Results: Totally, 23 papers met the inclusion criteria. About 75% of the studies used web and telephone-based technologies. Most services provided with health technologies were ‘Training’ and ‘consulting’. The ‘lifestyle" and ‘Consultation and education’ axes were the most widely used HIT services to control and manage lupus. While, ‘Better management and control of the disease’, ‘Increasing knowledge and awareness of people about lupus’ and ‘Improving behaviors and attitudes toward self-management and self-care’ were also the most important outcomes. ‘Collectiing patient data and information’, ’Providing education and consultation services to patients’, ’Measuring patient-reported outcomes’, and ’Increasing patients’ knowledge and awareness of their disease’ were the most important advantages of various technologies. ’Slow internet speed’ and ’Challenges and problems related to appearance and usability’ and ’Patient concerns about privacy and misuse of their data’ were three disadvantages of technologies.
Conclusion: The findings showed that HIT can improve the management and control of lupus and facilitate self-efficacy, self-care, and self-management in patients. The axes and data elements identified in this study can be the basis for developing and implementing efficient HIT-based systems to improve, control, and manage lupus.
