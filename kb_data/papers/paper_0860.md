## Abstract
Background
              Conversational agents (CAs), also known as chatbots, are computer programs that simulate human conversations by using predetermined rule-based responses or artificial intelligence algorithms. They are increasingly used in health care, particularly via smartphones. There is, at present, no conceptual framework guiding the development of smartphone-based, rule-based CAs in health care. To fill this gap, we propose structured and tailored guidance for their design, development, evaluation, and implementation.
            
            
              Objective
              The aim of this study was to develop a conceptual framework for the design, evaluation, and implementation of smartphone-delivered, rule-based, goal-oriented, and text-based CAs for health care.
            
            
              Methods
              We followed the approach by Jabareen, which was based on the grounded theory method, to develop this conceptual framework. We performed 2 literature reviews focusing on health care CAs and conceptual frameworks for the development of mobile health interventions. We identified, named, categorized, integrated, and synthesized the information retrieved from the literature reviews to develop the conceptual framework. We then applied this framework by developing a CA and testing it in a feasibility study.
            
            
              Results
              The Designing, Developing, Evaluating, and Implementing a Smartphone-Delivered, Rule-Based Conversational Agent (DISCOVER) conceptual framework includes 8 iterative steps grouped into 3 stages, as follows: design, comprising defining the goal, creating an identity, assembling the team, and selecting the delivery interface; development, including developing the content and building the conversation flow; and the evaluation and implementation of the CA. They were complemented by 2 cross-cutting considerations—user-centered design and privacy and security—that were relevant at all stages. This conceptual framework was successfully applied in the development of a CA to support lifestyle changes and prevent type 2 diabetes.
            
            
              Conclusions
              Drawing on published evidence, the DISCOVER conceptual framework provides a step-by-step guide for developing rule-based, smartphone-delivered CAs. Further evaluation of this framework in diverse health care areas and settings and for a variety of users is needed to demonstrate its validity. Future research should aim to explore the use of CAs to deliver health care interventions, including behavior change and potential privacy and safety concerns.
