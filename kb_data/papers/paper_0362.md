## Abstract
Abstract
            
              Background
              Various questionnaires are used for evaluating satisfaction, usability, acceptance, and quality outcomes of mobile health (mHealth) services. Using the best one to meet the needs of an mHealth study is a challenge for researchers. Therefore, this study aimed to review and determine the frequently used questionnaires for evaluating the mentioned outcomes of mHealth services.
            
            
              Methods
              The PubMed database was searched for conducting this review in April 2021. Papers that used a referenced questionnaire to evaluate the satisfaction, usability, acceptance, or quality outcomes of mHealth were included. The first authorâ€™s name, year of publication, evaluation outcome, and evaluation questionnaire were extracted from relevant papers. Data were analyzed using descriptive statistics.
            
            
              Results
              In total, 247 papers were included in the study. Questionnaires were used for usability (40%), quality (34.5%), acceptance (8.5%), and satisfaction (4%) outcomes, respectively. System usability scale (36.5%), mobile application rating scale (35.5%), post study system usability questionnaire (6%), user mobile application rating scale (5%), technology acceptance model (4.5%), computer system usability questionnaire (2.5%), net promoter score (2%), health information technology usability evaluation scale (2%), the usefulness, satisfaction, and ease of use (1.5%), client satisfaction questionnaire (1.5%), unified theory of acceptance and use of technology (1.5%), questionnaire for user interaction satisfaction (1%), user experience questionnaire (1%), and after-scenario questionnaire (1%) were the most used questionnaires, respectively.
            
            
              Conclusion
              Despite the existence of special questionnaires for evaluating several outcomes of mHealth, general questionnaires with fewer items and higher reliability have been used more frequently. Researchers should pay more attention to questionnaires with a goal-based design.
