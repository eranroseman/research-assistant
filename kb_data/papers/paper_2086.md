## Abstract
This study aimed to determine whether daily physical activity in young and older adults with T2DM is associated with diabetes control. A prospective correlational study involving 206 young (≤65 years) and older (>65 years) adults was conducted. The International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to assess their daily physical activity levels. Patients’ mean HbA1c level was 7.8% (±1.4), and 95.9% of patients had unsatisfactory diabetes control. Performing more minutes per week of moderate-intensity daily physical activity was associated with a lower risk of glycemia in both young and older adults. Furthermore, moderate daily physical activity signiﬁcantly lowered the risk of glycemia. Health personnel must encourage patients to engage in moderate daily physical activities to improve diabetes control.
