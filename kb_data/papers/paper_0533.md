## Abstract
Abstract                      Background            Mobile health (mHealth) tools have gained prominence in global healthcare in recent years, with demonstrated impacts on managing service users' health. While many systematic reviews have assessed the effectiveness of mHealth on health outcomes, the role of health professions in promoting mHealth adoption and leading to improved outcomes is less clear. This systematic review of systematic reviews (SR of SRs) critically appraises and synthesises evidence to examine both the impact of mHealth interventions on service users' outcomes and the role of health professions in facilitating their adoption.                                Methods            Five electronic databases—EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, Medline, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library—were searched for systematic reviews published between 1 January 2015 and 8 June 2024. Reviews focused on the impact of mHealth interventions on service users' outcomes and the role of health professions in promoting adoption were included. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were conducted by four independent reviewers.                                Results            Fourteen systematic reviews, covering 393 primary studies, were included. mHealth interventions showed positive impacts on clinical outcomes, such as reductions in blood pressure, HbA1c, and cholesterol. Behavioural improvements were also reported, including better medication adherence and physical activity. Psychological benefits, such as reduced anxiety and enhanced patient satisfaction, were noted. The involvement of health professions significantly enhanced mHealth outcomes. However, challenges such as sustainability, accessibility, and usability remain.                                Discussion            This SR of SRs provides critical insights into the effectiveness of mHealth interventions on health outcomes and highlights the important role of health professions in promoting their adoption. While the findings are promising, concerns about training, sustainability, accessibility, and user acceptance need to be addressed to improve the broader adoption of mHealth interventions. Further research is recommended to address these challenges and enhance the long-term success of mHealth tools in healthcare.
