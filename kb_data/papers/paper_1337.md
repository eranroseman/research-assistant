## Abstract
AbstractWith recent medical advances in diagnosis and treatment, the increasing numbers of long-term survivors of breast cancer is considerable and has resulted in the expansion of scientific research to include examination of lifestyle modifications as means of prevention of recurrence, new breast cancer events, and mortality. The objective of this report is to review randomized controlled trials (RCTs) including diet and/or exercise interventions on breast cancer recurrence in women with a history of breast cancer as well as pertinent recent epidemiologic evidence. Implicated biologic mechanisms are discussed to elucidate the impact of diet and exercise on disease recurrence.
