## Abstract
Our objective was to evaluate the effect of a mobile health (mHealth) intervention on lifestyle adherence and anthropometric characteristics among individuals with uncontrolled hypertension. We performed a randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03005470) where all participants received lifestyle counseling at baseline and were randomly allocated to receive (1) an automatic oscillometric device to measure and register blood pressure (BP) via a mobile application, (2) personalized text messages to stimulate lifestyle changes, (3) both mHealth interventions, or (4) usual clinical treatment (UCT) without technology (control). The outcomes were achieved for at least four of ﬁve lifestyle goals (weight loss, not smoking, physical activity, moderate or stopping alcohol consumption, and improving diet quality) and improved anthropometric characteristics at six months. mHealth groups were pooled for the analysis. Among 231 randomized participants (187 in the mHealth group and 45 in the control group), the mean age was 55.4 ± 9.5 years, and 51.9% were men. At six months, achieving at least four of ﬁve lifestyle goals was 2.51 times more likely (95% CI: 1.26; 5.00, p = 0.009) to be achieved among participants receiving mHealth interventions. The between-group difference reached clinically relevant, but marginally signiﬁcant, reduction in body fat (−4.05 kg 95% CI: −8.14; 0.03, p = 0.052), segmental trunk fat (−1.69 kg 95% CI: −3.50; 0.12, p = 0.067), and WC (−4.36 cm 95% CI: −8.81; 0.082, p = 0.054), favoring the intervention group. In conclusion, a six-month lifestyle intervention supported by application-based BP monitoring and text messages signiﬁcantly improves adherence to lifestyle goals and is likely to reduce some anthropometric characteristics in comparison with the control without technology support.
