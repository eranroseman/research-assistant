## Abstract
Bone is inﬂuenced by physical activity (PA) throughout life, but childhood and adolescence provide a key opportunity to maximize peak bone mass. Thus, it is important to identify the relationship between PA practiced in childhood and young adulthood to design a promotion plan for bone health. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between diﬀerent impact-loading PAs (and their continuity throughout school periods from childhood to young adulthood) and bone stiﬀness index (SI). In this cross-sectional study, which was conducted on 145 university students aged 18–21 years, bone measurements were measured by quantitative ultrasonometry (QUS), and PA information was recalled using a self-administered questionnaire. Associations between the SI and the impact of PA performed during secondary school (p = 0.027), high school (p = 0.002), and university (p = 0.016) periods were observed. The continuity of PA over a longer period of time was related to a higher SI (p = 0.007). Those who practiced PA throughout all school periods had a higher SI than those who practiced during primary school only (p = 0.038) or through primary and secondary schools (p = 0.009). These results suggest that impact-loading PA practiced during diﬀerent school periods is related to higher values of the SI. Therefore, continuous PA from an early age may be an important contributing factor to achieving and maintaining adequate bone health.
