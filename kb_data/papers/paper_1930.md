## Abstract
Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an individually tailored intervention consisting of motivational counselling and text message reminders to reduce sedentary behaviour in comparison with usual lifestyle in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Methods RA patients (n=150) were randomised to the intervention or control group. Costs of the intervention and healthcare utilisation during a 22-month follow-up period were reported. Outcomes were objectively measured as 24 hours/7 days sitting time and self-reported Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and EQ-5D scores at baseline, and 16 weeks, 10 and 22 months after baseline. Cost-effectiveness was reported as incremental costeffectiveness ratios and statistical uncertainty presented as cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.
Results The intervention cost was estimated at €387 per participant. The mean incremental 22-month healthcare cost was €−1165 (95% bootstrap CI −5613 to 3283). An incremental 20%-point of the participants (CI 10.4% to 29.6%) reduced their daily sitting time more than 50 min and 36%-point reported better HAQ scores (change>0.22). The time-weighted health utilities (quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)) increased by 0.10 (CI 0.02 to 0.18) and 0.11 (CI 0.04 to 0.19) for EQ-5D index and EQ-VAS, respectively. The intervention dominated usual lifestyle by offering better outcomes and lower costs. With a threshold value of €30 000/QALY the intervention has a probability of 95% of being cost-effective.
Conclusion This protocolised cost-effectiveness analysis showed that an individually tailored intervention aimed at reducing sedentary behaviour in patients with RA is improving participants’ 22-month health status and reducing healthcare costs. These results suggest that the intervention should be implemented in routine rheumatology care. Trial registration number NCT01969604.Trial registration number
