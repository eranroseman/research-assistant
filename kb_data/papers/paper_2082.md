## Abstract
This perspective article explores the challenges and potential of using speech as a biomarker in clinical settings, particularly when constrained by the small clinical datasets typically available in such contexts. We contend that by integrating insights from speech science and clinical research, we can reduce sample complexity in clinical speech AI models with the potential to decrease timelines to translation. Most existing models are based on high-dimensional feature representations trained with limited sample sizes and often do not leverage insights from speech science and clinical research. This approach can lead to overfitting, where the models perform exceptionally well on training data but fail to generalize to new, unseen data. Additionally, without incorporating theoretical knowledge, these models may lack interpretability and robustness, making them challenging to troubleshoot or improve post-deployment. We propose a framework for organizing health conditions based on their impact on speech and promote the use of speech analytics in diverse clinical contexts beyond cross-sectional classification. For high-stakes clinical use cases, we advocate for a focus on explainable and individually-validated measures and stress the importance of rigorous validation frameworks and ethical considerations for responsible deployment. Bridging the gap between AI research and clinical speech research presents new opportunities for more efficient translation of speech-based AI tools and advancement of scientific discoveries in this interdisciplinary space, particularly if limited to small or retrospective datasets.
