## Abstract
AbstractDespite decades of research on teams, there are still gaps in our understanding of motivational dynamics within teams and the emergence of team‐level motivation. We advance a new team motivation model that invokes self‐determination theory (SDT), multilevel theory, emergence processes, and identity construction. Using the conceptualization of motivation offered by SDT, we define team motivation as a collective source of energy driving the direction, intensity, and persistence of team activities. By using SDT to develop the process‐based team motivation emergence model, we describe the role of human psychological needs that are involved in the emergence of this collective construct. An interpersonal feedback loop intertwined with a team process feedback loop predict how team members' individual motivations converge and then transform into team‐level motivation through a process of identity construction. Propositions for testing the model are advanced, as well as suggestions for methodological and analytical considerations.
