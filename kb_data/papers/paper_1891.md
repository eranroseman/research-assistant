## Abstract
Introduction Digital therapeutics have been approved as a treatment aid for various medical conditions and are increasingly prevalent. Despite numerous studies on the potential of digital therapeutic interventions in preventing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), there is a critical need for more high-quality, large-scale studies to validate their effectiveness. This need arises from the inconsistencies in results and variations in the quality of previous research.
