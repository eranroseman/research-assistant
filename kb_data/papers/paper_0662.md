## Abstract
Background
              Although gamification continues to be a popular approach to increase engagement, motivation, and adherence to behavioral interventions, empirical studies have rarely focused on this topic. There is a need to empirically evaluate gamification models to increase the understanding of how to integrate gamification into interventions.
            
            
              Objective
              The model of gamification principles for digital health interventions proposes a set of five independent yet interrelated gamification principles. This study aimed to examine the validity and reliability of this model to inform its use in Web- and mobile-based apps.
            
            
              Methods
              A total of 17 digital health interventions were selected from a curated website of mobile- and Web-based apps (PsyberGuide), which makes independent and unbiased ratings on various metrics. A total of 133 independent raters trained in gamification evaluation techniques were instructed to evaluate the apps and rate the degree to which gamification principles are present. Multiple ratings (n≥20) were collected for each of the five gamification principles within each app. Existing measures, including the PsyberGuide credibility score, mobile app rating scale (MARS), and the app store rating of each app were collected, and their relationship with the gamification principle scores was investigated.
            
            
              Results
              Apps varied widely in the degree of gamification implemented (ie, the mean gamification rating ranged from 0.17≤m≤4.65 out of 5). Inter-rater reliability of gamification scores for each app was acceptable (κ≥0.5). There was no significant correlation between any of the five gamification principles and the PsyberGuide credibility score (P≥.49 in all cases). Three gamification principles (supporting player archetypes, feedback, and visibility) were significantly correlated with the MARS score, whereas three principles (meaningful purpose, meaningful choice, and supporting player archetypes) were significantly correlated with the app store rating. One gamification principle was statistically significant with both the MARS and the app store rating (supporting player archetypes).
            
            
              Conclusions
              Overall, the results support the validity and potential utility of the model of gamification principles for digital health interventions. As expected, there was some overlap between several gamification principles and existing app measures (eg, MARS). However, the results indicate that the gamification principles are not redundant with existing measures and highlight the potential utility of a 5-factor gamification model structure in digital behavioral health interventions. These gamification principles may be used to improve user experience and enhance engagement with digital health programs.
