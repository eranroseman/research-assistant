## Abstract
COVID Watch is a remote patient monitoring program implemented during the pandemic to support home dwelling patients with COVID‑19. The program conferred a large survival advantage. We conducted semi‑structured interviews of 85 patients and clinicians using COVID Watch to understand how to design such programs even better. Patients and clinicians found COVID Watch to be comforting and beneficial, but both groups desired more clarity about the purpose and timing of enrollment and alternatives to text‑messages to adapt to patients’ preferences as these may have limited engagement and enrollment among marginalized patient populations. Because inclusiveness and equity are important elements of programmatic success, future programs will need flexible and multi‑channel human‑to‑human communi‑cation pathways for complex clinical interactions or for patients who do not desire tech‑first approaches.
