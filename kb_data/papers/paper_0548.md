## Abstract
Background            Digital health interventions have emerged as promising tools to promote health behavior change and improve health outcomes. However, a comprehensive synthesis of strategies contributing to these interventions is lacking.                                Objective            This study aims to (1) identify and categorize the strategies used in digital health interventions over the past 25 years; (2) explore the differences and changes in these strategies across time periods, countries, populations, delivery methods, and senders; and (3) serve as a valuable reference for future researchers and practitioners to improve the effectiveness of digital health interventions.                                Methods            This study followed a systematic review approach, complemented by close reading and text coding. A comprehensive search for published English academic papers from PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus was conducted. The search employed a combination of digital health and intervention-related terms, along with database-specific subject headings and filters. The time span covered 25 years, from January 1, 1999, to March 10, 2024. Sample papers were selected based on study design, intervention details, and strategies. The strategies were identified and categorized based on the principles of Behavior Change Techniques and Behavior Strategies.                                Results            A total of 885 papers involving 954,847 participants met the eligibility criteria. We identified 173 unique strategies used in digital health interventions, categorized into 19 themes. The 3 most frequently used strategies in the sample papers were “guide” (n=492, 55.6%), “monitor” (n=490, 55.4%), and “communication” (n=392, 44.3%). The number of strategies employed in each paper ranged from 1 to 32. Most interventions targeted clients (n=844, 95.4%) and were carried out in hospitals (n=268, 30.3%). High-income countries demonstrated a substantially higher number and diversity of identified strategies than low- and middle-income countries, and the number of studies targeting the public (n=647, 73.1%) far exceeded those focusing on vulnerable groups (n=238, 26.9%).                                Conclusions            Digital health interventions and strategies have undergone considerable development over the past 25 years. They have evolved from simple approaches to sophisticated, personalized techniques and are trending toward multifaceted interventions, leveraging advanced technologies for real-time monitoring and feedback. Future studies should focus on rigorous evaluations, long-term effectiveness, and tailored approaches for diverse populations, and more attention should be given to vulnerable groups.
