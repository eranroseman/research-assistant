## Abstract
Background
The majority of people in the United States do not achieve recommended levels of physical activity. Even small, daily increases can have health benefits. Wearable devices paired with social incentives increased daily steps in pilot studies but have not been tested for long-term effectiveness in community settings. This paper describes the study design and baseline participant characteristics of a trial testing these approaches to increase physical activity among families in the Philadelphia area.
Methods
The trial, called STEP Together, is a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation study. Participants enroll on family teams of 2–10 people, including at least one person 60 years old or older. Each participant receives a Fitbit device, establishes a baseline daily step count, and selects a daily step goal 1500 to 3000 steps greater than their baseline. Family teams are stratified based on family size and randomized to Control, Social Incentive Gamification, or Social Goals through Incentives to Charity. Participation is 18-months: a 12-month intervention and 6-month follow up.
Results
779 participants on 285 family teams were randomized. Recruitment was more difficult than anticipated due to the COVID-19 pandemic and higher-than expected numbers of participants who were already physically active and therefore ineligible. Changes to the eligibility criteria that did not impact the underlying intent or conceptual basis for the trial improved recruitment feasibility.
Conclusion
The results from this study will contribute to the growing body of evidence about scalable, effective strategies to motivate individuals and families to increase their daily physical activity. Clinical trial registration number: NCT04942535
