## Abstract
Background
              Social distancing and stay-at-home orders are critical interventions to slow down person-to-person transmission of COVID-19. While these societal changes help contain the pandemic, they also have unintended negative consequences, including anxiety and depression. We developed StayWell, a daily skills-based SMS text messaging program, to mitigate COVID-19–related depression and anxiety symptoms among people who speak English and Spanish in the United States.
            
            
              Objective
              This paper describes the changes in StayWell participants’ anxiety and depression levels after 60 days of exposure to skills-based SMS text messages.
            
            
              Methods
              We used self-administered, empirically supported web-based questionnaires to assess the demographic and clinical characteristics of StayWell participants. Anxiety and depression were measured using the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) scale and the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) scale at baseline and 60-day timepoints. We used 2-tailed paired t tests to detect changes in PHQ-8 and GAD-2 scores from baseline to follow-up measured 60 days later.
            
            
              Results
              The analytic sample includes 193 participants who completed both the baseline and 60-day exit questionnaires. At the 60-day time point, there were significant reductions in both PHQ-8 and GAD-2 scores from baseline. We found an average reduction of –1.72 (95% CI –2.35 to –1.09) in PHQ-8 scores and –0.48 (95% CI –0.71 to –0.25) in GAD-2 scores. These improvements translated to an 18.5% and 17.2% reduction in mean PHQ-8 and GAD-2 scores, respectively.
            
            
              Conclusions
              StayWell is an accessible, low-intensity population-level mental health intervention. Participation in StayWell focused on COVID-19 mental health coping skills and was related to improved depression and anxiety symptoms. In addition to improvements in outcomes, we found high levels of engagement during the 60-day intervention period. Text messaging interventions could serve as an important public health tool for disseminating strategies to manage mental health.
