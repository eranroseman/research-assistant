## Abstract
OBJECTIVE: 
          To use administrative claims data to evaluate the association of a remote blood pressure monitoring program with adverse postpartum clinical outcomes in patients with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy.
          METHODS: 
          This was a retrospective cohort study of Independence Blue Cross members with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy diagnosis across three obstetric hospitals from 2017 to 2021. Patients who were enrolled in twice-daily text-based blood pressure monitoring for 10 days postpartum were compared with two propensity-score matched cohorts of patients who met the program criteria: an asynchronous cohort (cohort A), consisting of patients at any of the three participating hospitals before remote monitoring program implementation, and a contemporaneous cohort (cohort C), consisting of patients at other hospitals during the same time period as clinical use of the program. Patients with less than 16 months of continuous insurance enrollment before delivery were excluded. Claims for adverse clinical outcomes after delivery discharge were evaluated. Health care service utilization and total medical costs were evaluated.
          RESULTS: 
          The 1,700 patients in remote blood pressure monitoring program were matched to 1,021 patients in cohort A and 1,276 in cohort C. Within the first 6 months after delivery, patients enrolled in remote monitoring were less likely to have the composite adverse outcome than those in cohort A (2.9% vs 4.7%; OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40–0.98). There was no statistically significant difference relative to cohort C (3.2% vs 4.5%; OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.47–1.07). The remote monitoring group had more cardiology visits and fewer postnatal emergency department (ED) visits and readmissions compared with both comparison cohorts. Reductions in ED visits and readmissions drove overall lower total medical costs for the program cohort.
          CONCLUSION: 
          Patients enrolled in a remote blood pressure monitoring program were less likely to experience an adverse outcome in the first 6 months after delivery. Reductions in ED visits and readmissions resulted in lower postpartum total medical costs compared with both control cohorts. Broad implementation of evidence-based remote monitoring programs may reduce postpartum adverse outcomes, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality in populations such as the one studied here.
