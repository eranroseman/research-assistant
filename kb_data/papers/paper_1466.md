## Abstract
There is limited evidence on key implementation outcomes for mHealth interventions that target maternal and newborn health. Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness of a mobile phone messaging-based message-framing intervention. A cross-sectional study was conducted, involving 397 mothers who participated in the mobile phone messaging-based intervention. Multivariate general linear modeling was carried out to identify factors that were associated with the acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness of the intervention. The statistical significance level was declared at a 95% confidence interval and p-value of <0.05. The mean scores of acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness were 27.9, 23.8, and 22.5, respectively. Acceptability was significantly affected by living in a rural area, being rich, receiving messages at night, self-efficacy, and engagement. Feasibility was affected by living in rural area, educational status, being a merchant, being rich, receiving messages at night, self-efficacy, engagement, and satisfaction. Meanwhile, appropriateness was influenced by living in a rural area, being a merchant, being a government employee, and satisfaction. The mobile phone messaging-based intervention was highly acceptable, feasible, and appropriate. Focusing on self-efficacy, engagement, satisfaction, the timing for sending messages, and sociodemographic factors would facilitate the implementation and utilization of mobile phone messaging-based interventions.
