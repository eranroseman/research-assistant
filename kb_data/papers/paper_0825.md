## Abstract
Abstract
            
              We propose an inferential framework for fixed effects in longitudinal functional models and introduce tests for the correlation structures induced by the longitudinal sampling procedure. The framework provides a natural extension of standard longitudinal correlation models for scalar observations to functional observations. Using simulation studies, we compare fixed effects estimation under correctly and incorrectly specified correlation structures and also test the longitudinal correlation structure. Finally, we apply the proposed methods to a longitudinal functional dataset on physical activity. The computer code for the proposed method is available at
