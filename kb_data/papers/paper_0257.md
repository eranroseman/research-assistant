## Abstract
Abstract
            
              Background
              Digital therapeutics (DTx) are therapeutic interventions driven by software and directly provided to patients, allowing them to manage their health with ease in any setting. A growing interest in DTx has spurred a discussion concerning their reimbursement pathways. However, DTx are still at a premature stage, with insufficient evidence on effectiveness, efficiency, and safety. Currently, although industries desire to quickly enter the market, especially by getting their products reimbursed by the National Health Insurance (NHI) fund, the NHI is cautious about DTx due to their uncertainties. Thus, public discussion and social consensus are crucial in deciding whether to reimburse DTx by the NHI fund.
            
            
              Objective
              This study examined multiple stakeholders’ awareness and attitudes toward DTx and perceptions of regulatory pathways for adopting DTx.
            
            
              Methods
              In-depth interviews were conducted with 11 stakeholders in South Korea (industry: n=4, health care: n=3, academia: n=2, and consumer: n=2) using semistructured guidelines. They were purposively sampled to identify individuals with expertise in DTx and NHI policies. The interviews were conducted either in person or via a videoconference for 45-70 minutes. Qualitative data were analyzed using directed content analysis, which uses interview guidelines as an analytical framework.
            
            
              Results
              Findings were divided into three categories: (1) awareness and attitude toward DTx, (2) perception of whether DTx are worth entering the market and being reimbursed by the NHI fund, and (3) perception of how to enter the market and how to reimburse DTx by the NHI fund if they are worth it. Although consumer stakeholders were not familiar with the basic concept of DTx, the other stakeholders understood it thoroughly. However, all participants showed positive attitudes and acceptance of DTx. Most of them responded that DTx are worth entering the market, but they could not reach an agreement on the pathways for DTx to enter the market. Although participants were in favor of the reimbursement of DTx in principle, they responded that a conservative approach is required due to insufficient clinical evidence for DTx.
            
            
              Conclusions
              We found that stakeholders in South Korea had positive attitudes toward DTx, perceived them as worth using, and agreed to allow them to enter the market. The main issue was not the problem of the technology itself but the difference in opinion as to the pathways for reimbursement. Therefore, this study concluded that the NHI fund, which is operated very conservatively, is insufficient to quickly adopt and implement DTx. Various reimbursement methods, including tax-based financing, raising innovation funds for new technologies, and pilot studies using the NHI fund, should be used to rapidly generate clinical evidence and reduce the uncertainties of DTx to secure a stable market.
