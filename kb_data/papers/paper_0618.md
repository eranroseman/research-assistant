## Abstract
Abstract
            In response to a pandemic, hospital leaders can use clinical informatics to aid clinical decision making, virtualizing medical care, coordinating communication, and defining workflow and compliance. Clinical informatics procedures need to be implemented nimbly, with governance measures in place to properly oversee and guide novel patient care pathways, diagnostic and treatment workflows, and provider education and communication. The authorsâ€™ experience recommends (1) creating flexible order sets that adapt to evolving guidelines that meet needs across specialties, (2) enhancing and supporting inherent telemedicine capability, (3) electronically enabling novel workflows quickly and suspending noncritical administrative or billing functions in the electronic health record, and (4) using communication platforms based on tiered urgency that do not compromise security and privacy.
