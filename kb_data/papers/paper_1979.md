## Abstract
Gait-stabilizing devices (GSDs) are effective at preventing falls, but people are often reluctant to use them until after experiencing a fall. Inexpensive, convenient, and effective methods for predicting which patients need GSDs could help improve adoption. The purpose of this study was to determine if a Wii Balance Board (WBB) can be used to determine whether or not patients use a GSD. We prospectively recruited participants ages 70-100, some who used GSDs and some who did not. Participants first answered questions from the Modified Vulnerable Elders Survey, and then completed a grip-strength test using a handgrip dynamometer. Finally, they were asked to complete a series of four 30-second balance tests on a WBB in random order: (1) eyes open, feet apart; (2) eyes open, feet together; (3) eyes closed, feet apart; and (4) eyes closed, feet together. The four-test series was repeated a second time in the same random order. The resulting data, represented as 25 features extracted from the questionnaires and the grip test, and data from the eight balance tests, were used to predict a subject's GSD use using generalized functional linear models based on the Bernoulli distribution. 268 participants were consented; 62 were missing data elements and were removed from analysis; 109 were not GSD users and 97 were GSD users. The use of velocity and acceleration information from the WBB improved upon predictions based solely on grip strength, demographic, and survey variables. The WBB is a convenient, inexpensive, and easy-to-use device that can be used to recommend whether or not patients should be using a GSD.
