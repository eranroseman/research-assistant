## Abstract
Abstract
            
              Purpose
              This integrative review presents a synthesis of the current qualitative research addressing the motivating factors, usability, and experiences of mobile health tracking applications (apps) across various chronic disease populations.
            
            
              Design
              Integrative review of the literature.
            
            
              Methods
              Databases used to conduct this integrative review included: PubMed Plus, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Google Scholar, Science Direct, and EBSCO megafile. The following search terms were used in all five databases: smartphone apps, apps, mHealth, eHealth, mobile health apps, health tracking apps, user‐centered apps, wireless technology, engagement, qualitative, and usability.
            
            
              Findings
              The initial literature review yielded 689 results. Once inclusion and exclusion criteria were employed, 11 studies met the criteria set forth for this review. The reviewed studies provided insight into users’ perceptions, experiences, and motivations to incorporate smartphone mobile health apps into their daily lives when living with chronic illnesses.
            
            
              Conclusions
              This review indicates the growing interest in user‐centered mobile health tracking apps, but with little understanding of motivating factors that foster sustained app use. Mobile health tracking apps targeted to users with chronic conditions need to have a high level of usability in order to motivate users to sustain engagement with their mobile health tracking app.
            
            
              Clinical Relevance
              User‐centered mobile health tracking app technology is being used with increasing frequency to potentially provide individualized support to chronic illness populations.
