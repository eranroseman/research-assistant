## Abstract
Abstract                      Introduction            The rapid integration of digital technologies in healthcare requires healthcare professionals to be digitally ready and capable. This systematic review aims to identify interventions that improve digital readiness and capability among health professionals and to understand the barriers and facilitators they encounter during this digital transformation.                                Methodology            A mixed-methods systematic review was conducted following the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) guidelines. We searched five databases CINAHL Plus, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, and Web of Science. The review used the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework to investigate factors influencing technology adoption. Studies were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, focusing on health professionals' digital capability in healthcare settings. Quality assessment was performed using the MMAT checklist, and data were analysed and synthesized to extract relevant themes and sub-themes.                                Results            Initially, 1140 studies were identified, with 21 meeting the inclusion criteria after screening. These studies, published between 2017 and 2023.The results were categorized into four main themes: Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Facilitating Conditions, and Social Influence, with two sub-themes. The studies indicated that technology positively impacts job performance, facilitating acceptance among healthcare professionals. Ease of use was crucial for technology acceptance, while complexity and multiple logins were significant barriers. The importance of sufficient training and organizational support was highlighted to enhance digital competency and address technical issues, with inadequate training and infrastructure being major barriers. Social influence, including motivation of healthcare workers and shared decision-making, played a significant role in technology acceptance.                                Conclusion            This review highlights critical factors influencing the digital readiness and capability of healthcare professionals. Interventions enhancing performance expectancy, addressing effort expectancy, improving facilitating conditions, and leveraging social influence are essential for successful digital health adoption. Future research should develop comprehensive frameworks to overcome barriers and promote digital health readiness. Integrating specialized training into educational programs is crucial for preparing healthcare professionals to navigate the evolving digital landscape.
