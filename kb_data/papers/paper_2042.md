## Abstract
Introduction 
          This study aimed to test the preliminary efficacy and acceptability of a physical activity intervention tailored to rural men.
          Methods 
          A nationwide sample of rural American men were recruited to participate in a theory-guided, 10-wk, remote physical activity intervention. The intervention was tailored to rural men’s preferences based on findings of a needs assessment study. Steps, muscle-strengthening behaviors, muscular endurance, and psychosocial outcomes were measured at baseline and post-intervention. Likert scales, open-ended survey questions, and focus groups were used to assess acceptability. Continuous data were analyzed using a t-test and Wilcoxon signed-ranked test, and dichotomous variables were analyzed using a McNemar test.
          Results 
          A total of 27 (39 consented, 27% attrition) mostly White, non-Hispanic rural men completed the intervention. On average, participants completed 8.0 ± 4.4 (out of the 11 provided) modules over the 10-wk intervention period, and 15 participants (56%) completed all 11 modules. The proportion of participants engaging in muscle strengthening behavior increased from 18.5% to 69.2% (P = 0.003). Push-up (P < 0.001), sit-up (P = 0.004), and squat (P < 0.001) tests significantly improved. Behavior regulation (Hedges’ g = 1.23, P < 0.05) and physical activity identity (Hedges’ g = 0.85, P < 0.05) increased from baseline to 10 wk. On average, all features were rated at least somewhat helpful.
          Conclusions 
          The intervention improved rural men’s muscle strengthening behaviors, muscular endurance, behavioral regulation, and physical activity identity, but not steps. Future studies can expand on this work by improving intervention features, such as greater accountability, and comparing the intervention against a control group.
