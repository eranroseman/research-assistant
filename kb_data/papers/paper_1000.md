## Abstract
AbstractDifferences in the access and use of digital health interventions are driven by culture, in addition to economic and physical factors. To avoid the systematic exclusion of traditionally underserved cultural groups, creating inclusive digital health interventions is essential. One way to achieve this is through cultural adaptations, defined as the systematic modification of an existing intervention that aligns with a target audience’s cultural norms, beliefs, and values. In theory, cultural adaptations can potentially increase the reach and engagement of digital health interventions. However, the evidence of whether and how that is achieved is limited. Justifying, planning, and implementing an adaptation comes with various challenges and takes time and money. This perspective provides a critical overview of the field’s current state and emphasizes the need for technology-specific frameworks that address when and how to culturally adapt digital health interventions.
