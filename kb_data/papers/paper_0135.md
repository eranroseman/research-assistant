## Abstract
Patient nonadherence to healthy lifestyle behaviors and medical treatments (like medication adherence) accounts for a significant portion of chronic disease burden. Despite the plethora of behavioral interventions to overcome key modifiable/nonmodifiable barriers and enable facilitators to adherence, short- and long-term adherence to healthy lifestyle behaviors and medical treatments is still poor. To optimize adherence, we aimed to provide a novel mobile health solution steeped in precision and personalized population health and a pantheoretical approach that increases the likelihood of adherence. We have described the stages of a pantheoretical approach utilizing tailoring, clustering/profiling, personalizing, and optimizing interventions/strategies to obtain adherence and highlight the minimal engineering needed to build such a solution.
