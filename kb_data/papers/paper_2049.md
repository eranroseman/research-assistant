## Abstract
Background: There has been a surge in academic and business interest in software as a medical device (SaMD). SaMD enables medical professionals to streamline existing medical practices and make innovative medical processes such as digital therapeutics a reality. Furthermore, SaMD is a billion-dollar market. However, SaMD is not clearly understood as a technological change and emerging industry.
Objective: This study aims to review the landscape of SaMD in response to increasing interest in SaMD within health systems and regulation. The objectives of the study are to (1) clarify the innovation process of SaMD, (2) identify the prevailing typology of such innovation, and (3) elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving the SaMD innovation process.
Methods: We collected product information on 581 US Food and Drug Administration–approved SaMDs from the OpenFDA website and 268 company profiles of the corresponding manufacturers from Crunchbase, Bloomberg, PichBook.com, and other company websites. In addition to assessing the metadata of SaMD, we used correspondence and business process analysis to assess the distribution of intended use and how SaMDs interact with other devices in the medical process.
Results: The current SaMD industry is highly concentrated in medical image processing and radiological analysis. Incumbents in the medical device industry currently lead the market and focus on incremental innovation, whereas new entrants, particularly startups, produce more disruptive innovation. We found that hardware medical device functions as a complementary asset for SaMD, whereas how SaMD interacts with the complementary asset differs according to its intended use. Based on these findings, we propose a regime map that illustrates the SaMD innovation process.
Conclusions: SaMD, as an industry, is nascent and dominated by incremental innovation. The innovation process of the present SaMD industry is shaped by data accessibility, which is key to building disruptive innovation.
