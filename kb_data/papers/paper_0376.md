## Abstract
Background:
              Persistent job-related stress can be harmful to physical and mental health and has a sizable financial burden on society. Face-to-face interventions are effective in reducing stress but have the disadvantage of high costs and time requirements. mHealth solutions may be an effective alternative to provide stress management interventions at work. Occupational health professionals need information on which mHealth apps are effective for employees to manage job-related stress. The aim of this review is to provide an overview of effective web- and app-based interventions for reduction of job-related stress and stress-related symptoms.
            
            
              Method:
              A literature review was conducted in the databases PubMed, PsycINFO, CINAHL Complete, and IEEEXplore.
            
            
              Findings:
              A total of 24 articles describing 19 products were found. All products showed effectiveness in trials in improving mental and/or physical health and reducing stress. Most products have a course-like structure with a duration from 1 to 8 weeks. The products use various methods such as psychoeducation and education on stress, cognitive restructuring, emotional regulation, problem-solving, goal setting, gratitude, breathing, or mindfulness techniques. Most products use more than one method and most mixed material such as text on web pages, text messages, videos, reading and audio material, and games.
            
            
              Conclusion/Application to Practice:
              Overall, effective mHealth products were identified for the intervention of acute and chronic stress. Occupational health practitioners can use these 19 evidence-based mHealth products when advising organizations on health promotion of employees to reduce stress symptoms and promote health and well-being.
