## Abstract
This review explores the transformative potential of just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) as a scalable solution for addressing health disparities in underserved populations. JITAIs, delivered via mobile health technologies, could provide personalized, context-aware interventions based on real-time data to address public health challenges such as addiction treatment, chronic disease management, and mental health support. JITAIs can dynamically adjust intervention strategies, enhancing accessibility and engagement for marginalized communities. We highlight the utility of JITAIs in reducing opportunity costs associated with traditional in-person health interventions. Examples from various health domains demonstrate the adaptability of JITAIs in tailoring interventions to meet diverse needs. The review also emphasizes the need for community involvement, robust evaluation frameworks, and ethical considerations in implementing JITAIs, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Sustainable funding models and technological innovations are necessary to ensure equitable access and effectively scale these interventions. By bridging the gap between research and practice, JITAIs could improve health outcomes and reduce disparities in vulnerable populations.
