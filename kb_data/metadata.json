      "abstract": "Abstract\n            \n              Although psychological treatments benefit youth with chronic pain, treatment is not accessible in most communities. Digital health interventions offer promise for expanding access and reach to this population. Using a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial design, we evaluated effectiveness and implementation of a digital health delivered psychological intervention for pediatric chronic pain. One hundred forty-three youth, aged 10 to 17 years, with chronic pain and a caregiver were recruited from 8 clinics in the United States. Active intervention included access to the Web-based Management of Adolescent Pain (WebMAP) Mobile app and the WebMAP parent web site to learn pain self-management skills. Effectiveness outcomes included pain intensity, disability, and patient global impression of change, while Reach, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance were implementation outcomes. Results showed that youth in both treatment conditions (WebMAP vs Usual Care) had similar changes over time in pain and disability. Youth in the WebMAP condition perceived greater improvement (patient global impression of change) at post-treatment and follow-up (d's = 0.54 and 0.44,\n              P\n              < 0.05) compared with youth receiving usual care. Use of the digital health intervention was modest and variable; approximately 30% of youth and parents completed treatment. Greater engagement (number of completed modules) was associated with significantly greater reductions in pain and disability from pre-treatment to follow-up (d's = −0.57 and −0.38,\n              P\n              < 0.05). Parents, youth, and providers found treatment acceptable; providers had positive attitudes and demonstrated referrals over a maintenance period. Further research is needed to understand how to enhance treatment engagement with digital health interventions and optimize implementation.",

Yet limited evidence exists to support these claims. We designed and implemented a comprehensive workplace wellness program for a large employer and randomly assigned program eligibility and financial incentives at the individual level for nearly 5,000 employees. We find strong patterns of selection: during the year prior to the intervention, program participants had lower medical expenditures and healthier behaviors than nonparticipants. The program persistently increased health screening rates, but we do not find significant causal effects of treatment on total medical expenditures, other health behaviors, employee productivity, or self-reported health status after more than two years. Our 95% confidence intervals rule out 84% of previous estimates on medical spending and absenteeism.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Young adults from racial and ethnic minority (REM) groups are at greater risk of disengaging from vital mental health services than their majority group peers. Emerging research suggests developmentally tailored interventions that enable personalized exploration of cultural and structural contexts; encourage trust in relationships with service providers; enhance hope for recovery; and increase self-efficacy to adhere to treatment can improve engagement among underserved REM young adults with mental health disorders.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              Just Do You is a brief young adult treatment engagement intervention. Although Just Do You showed evidence of efficacy with medium effect sizes in a previous clinical trial, not all participants benefited, and some of the proposed mediators were not changed. Grounded in the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST), we propose to improve the provision and effects of Just Do You by testing a set of new candidate intervention components that complement the original Just Do You program. This can potentially enhance its effects on engagement and mental health service use for REM young adults.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A total of 3 new candidate behavioral intervention components and their putative mediators were designed in collaboration with REM young adults and other key informants. The new candidate components and their mechanisms of action are (1) cultural identity (perceived cultural competency), (2) future self (hope), and (3) understanding environments (self-efficacy). A pilot optimization randomized controlled trial will be conducted in an outpatient mental health setting with REM participants aged 18-34 years (N=80). The candidate components will be tested in a 23-factorial design where all participants will receive Just Do You and be randomly assigned to one of 8 experimental conditions, each composed of a unique combination of candidate components. We will assess the new components’ acceptability and feasibility, and explore preliminary evidence of their effects on the primary outcome (engagement in mental health care) and mediators at a 3-month follow-up assessment.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The study began recruitment in December 2024 and is planned to continue through December 2026.

While digital interventions offer promise for managing these chronic conditions (such as via lifestyle modification), there is also emerging evidence suggesting that digital support may strengthen or complement existing health care relationships, particularly by improving patient perceptions of communication and connection with their health care providers.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aimed to examine the impact of an adaptive mobile health (mHealth) texting-based intervention on patient ratings of communication with their health care providers among individuals with diabetes and depressive symptoms.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              This study used data from the DIAMANTE (Diabetes and Mental Health Adaptive Notification Tracking and Evaluation) trial, a prospective, randomized controlled trial that varied SMS text messaging strategies to encourage physical activity to support both mental and physical health for patients with diabetes and depression. Patients were recruited from safety-net clinics in San Francisco and through social media during the COVID-19 pandemic, and were randomized into three trial arms: (1) personalized SMS text messaging about physical activity via an adaptive learning algorithm, (2) randomly selected SMS text messaging about physical activity, and (3) a control group that received no SMS text messages. As a secondary outcome, we examined pre-post changes in patient-reported health care communication, assessed via surveys with the validated Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (CAHPS) communication subscale. Bivariate comparisons examined changes in CAHPS scores, including age, gender, preferred language, race or ethnicity, nativity, marital status, and education. Our primary analysis used mixed-effects modeling within an intent-to-treat analysis to determine differences in CAHPS scores by trial arm.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              \n                A total of 195 patients participated in the DIAMANTE trial from 2020 to 2022. After excluding patients who had incomplete or missing baseline or exit surveys, 156 patients were included in this secondary analysis. Overall, there was a substantive but nonsignificant decrease in the average CAHPS score over the 6-month trial period (−2.6;\n                P\n                =.11), with similar trends across patient demographic subgroups. Upon evaluating health care communication across the three randomized controlled trial (RCT) arms, there were no significant differences in patient-provider communication.\n              \n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Digital health interventions are rapidly increasing in clinical practice and have the ability to reach historically underserved communities by overcoming barriers such as language, geography, and time constraints. However, RCTs have primarily focused on the clinical impact of these tools, rather than how the tools may impact patients’ perceptions of their relationships with providers. While our study found no significant changes in patient-provider communication by RCT arm, the temporal implications of the COVID-19 pandemic during the DIAMANTE study period remain unclear and should be further studied. This study is the first of its kind to examine the influence of an adaptive mHealth intervention on patient-reported health care communication, with insights that may be important as digitally-enabled chronic care management rapidly expands.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Digital health technologies (dHTs) offer a unique opportunity to address some of the major challenges facing health care systems worldwide. However, the implementation of dHTs raises some concerns, such as the limited understanding of their real impact on health systems and people’s well-being or the potential risks derived from their use. In this context, health technology assessment (HTA) is 1 of the main tools that health systems can use to appraise evidence and determine the value of a given dHT. Nevertheless, due to the nature of dHTs, experts highlight the need to reconsider the frameworks used in traditional HTA.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This scoping review (ScR) aimed to identify the methodological frameworks used worldwide for digital health technology assessment (dHTA); determine what domains are being considered; and generate, through a thematic analysis, a proposal for a methodological framework based on the most frequently described domains in the literature.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              The ScR was performed in accordance with the guidelines established in the PRISMA-ScR guidelines. We searched 7 databases for peer reviews and gray literature published between January 2011 and December 2021. The retrieved studies were screened using Rayyan in a single-blind manner by 2 independent authors, and data were extracted using ATLAS.ti software. The same software was used for thematic analysis.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The systematic search retrieved 3061 studies (n=2238, 73.1%, unique), of which 26 (0.8%) studies were included. From these, we identified 102 methodological frameworks designed for dHTA. These frameworks revealed great heterogeneity between them due to their different structures, approaches, and items to be considered in dHTA. In addition, we identified different wording used to refer to similar concepts. Through thematic analysis, we reduced this heterogeneity. In the first phase of the analysis, 176 provisional codes related to different assessment items emerged. In the second phase, these codes were clustered into 86 descriptive themes, which, in turn, were grouped in the third phase into 61 analytical themes and organized through a vertical hierarchy of 3 levels: level 1 formed by 13 domains, level 2 formed by 38 dimensions, and level 3 formed by 11 subdimensions. From these 61 analytical themes, we developed a proposal for a methodological framework for dHTA.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              There is a need to adapt the existing frameworks used for dHTA or create new ones to more comprehensively assess different kinds of dHTs. Through this ScR, we identified 26 studies including 102 methodological frameworks and tools for dHTA. The thematic analysis of those 26 studies led to the definition of 12 domains, 38 dimensions, and 11 subdimensions that should be considered in dHTA.",

      "abstract": "Digital therapeutics (DTx) are a promising way to provide safe, effective, accessible, sustainable, scalable, and equitable approaches to advance individual and population health. However, developing and deploying DTx is inherently complex in that DTx includes multiple interacting components, such as tools to support activities like medication adherence, health behavior goal-setting or self-monitoring, and algorithms that adapt the provision of these according to individual needs that may change over time. While myriad frameworks exist for different phases of DTx development, no single framework exists to guide evidence production for DTx across its full life cycle, from initial DTx development to long-term use. To fill this gap, we propose the DTx real-world evidence (RWE) framework as a pragmatic, iterative, milestone-driven approach for developing DTx. The DTx RWE framework is derived from the 4-phase development model used for behavioral interventions, but it includes key adaptations that are specific to the unique characteristics of DTx. To ensure the highest level of fidelity to the needs of users, the framework also incorporates real-world data (RWD) across the entire life cycle of DTx development and use. The DTx RWE framework is intended for any group interested in developing and deploying DTx in real-world contexts, including those in industry, health care, public health, and academia. Moreover, entities that fund research that supports the development of DTx and agencies that regulate DTx might find the DTx RWE framework useful as they endeavor to improve how DTxcan advance individual and population health.",

Thematic analyses of the retrieved data led to the synthesis of 4 themes: concerns about data privacy, confidentiality, and security; awareness; facilitators and enablers; and associated factors. Patients showed discordant and concordant perspectives regarding data privacy, security, and confidentiality, as well as suggesting approaches to improve the use of mHealth apps (facilitators), such as protection of personal data, ensuring that health status or medical conditions are not mentioned, brief training or education on data security, and assuring data confidentiality and privacy. Similarly, awareness of the subject matter differed across the studies, suggesting the need to improve patients’ awareness of data security and privacy. Older patients, those with a history of experiencing data breaches, and those belonging to the higher-income class were more likely to raise concerns about the data security and privacy of mHealth apps. These concerns were not frequent among patients with higher satisfaction levels and those who perceived the data type to be less sensitive.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Patients expressed diverse views on mHealth apps’ privacy, security, and confidentiality, with some of the issues raised affecting technology use.

      "abstract": "Background\n              Digital health technology (DHT) has the potential to revolutionize the health care industry by reducing costs and improving the quality of care in a sector that faces significant challenges. However, the health care industry is complex, involving numerous stakeholders, and subject to extensive regulation. Within the European Union, medical device regulations impose stringent requirements on various ventures. Concurrently, new reimbursement pathways are also being developed for DHTs. In this dynamic context, establishing a sustainable and innovative business model around DHTs is fundamental for their successful commercialization. However, there is a notable lack of structured understanding regarding the overarching business models within the digital health sector.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aims to address this gap and identify key elements and configurations of business models for DHTs in the European Union, thereby establishing a structured understanding of the archetypal business models in use.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              The study was conducted in 2 phases. First, a business model taxonomy for DHTs was developed based on a systematic literature review, the analysis of 169 European real-world business models, and qualitative evaluation through 13 expert interviews. Subsequently, a 2-step clustering analysis was conducted on the 169 DHT business models to identify distinct business model archetypes.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The developed taxonomy of DHT business models revealed 11 central dimensions organized into 4 meta-dimensions. Each dimension comprises 2 to 9 characteristics capturing relevant aspects of DHT business models. In addition, 6 archetypes of DHT business models were identified: administration and communication supporter (A1), insurer-to-consumer digital therapeutics and care (A2), diagnostic and treatment enabler (A3), professional monitoring platforms (A4), clinical research and solution accelerators (A5), and direct-to-consumer wellness and lifestyle (A6).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The findings highlight the critical elements constituting business models in the DHT domain, emphasizing the substantial impact of medical device regulations and revenue models, which often involve reimbursement from stakeholders such as health insurers. Three drivers contributing to DHT business model innovation were identified: direct targeting of patients and private individuals, use of artificial intelligence as an enabler, and development of DHT-specific reimbursement pathways. The study also uncovered surprising business model patterns, including shifts between regulated medical devices and unregulated research applications, as well as wellness and lifestyle solutions. This research enriches the understanding of business models in digital health, offering valuable insights for researchers and digital health entrepreneurs.",

The digital intervention aims to encourage people aged 40-55 years to look after their health in the short and medium terms by adopting small actions relating to 8 health determinants: nutrition, physical activity, smoking, alcohol, stress, cognitive health, sleep, and environmental health. In the long term, the intervention intends to prevent frailty and reduce the burden of multimorbidities in older age, particularly for lower socioeconomic groups.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aims to measure behavior changes among registered users of the future website. The protocol assesses the impact of the website based on users’ implementation of small actions relating to the 8 health determinants. Specifically, it intends to evaluate the website’s performance in terms of engaging a specific population, triggering behavior change, raising awareness about a multifactorial approach to health, and encouraging user interaction with the website’s resources.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              The methodology is based on clinical assessments developed alongside the website according to the functionalities offered to registered users in their personalized space. The assessment tool design draws on logic models for digital interventions, and their consistency for digital applications is verified. The target audience is clearly defined from the outset. The protocol sets out a 3-step assessment: upon registration, after 3 weeks of use, and after 10 weeks of use (end of assessment). Users are divided into 2 groups (socioeconomically disadvantaged users and others) to characterize differences and make corrections. The protocol uses a mixed assessment approach based on website traffic and user login data. Specific and identifiable behavior changes are documented by monitoring the same individuals from T0 to T2, using verbatim comments to classify them into profiles and conducting semistructured individual interviews with a sample of users.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The protocol creates a multidimensional assessment of digital intervention, showing that during a given timeline, interactions with users can reveal their capabilities, opportunities, and motivations to adopt healthy lifestyles. The protocol’s principles were integrated into the development of a personal account to assess users’ behavior changes. Given the delayed launch of the website, no recruitment or effects analysis of the protocol took place.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              As no multidimensional assessment protocol is currently available for digital behavior change interventions, our methods reveal that the different framework stages can strengthen the effect measurement, consolidate the choice of assumptions used within the logic model and steer the digital intervention toward action while reducing the burden of information.

      "abstract": "Introduction\n              Mental health conditions are highly prevalent among adolescents, affecting one in seven individuals and accounting for 15% of the global disease burden in this age group. The promotion of health behaviours including physical activity, nutrition, and sleep, and reduction of sedentary behaviour, has been shown to significantly improve symptoms of mental health conditions in adolescents. However, addressing this public health challenge at a population level requires scalable interventions, such as mobile health (mHealth) interventions. However, the effectiveness of mHealth interventions in achieving clinically meaningful mental health improvements for adolescents with emotional, behavioural, or eating disorders remains unclear. Therefore, this systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of mHealth behaviour change interventions aimed at improving physical activity (PA), sedentary behaviour (SB), nutrition, or sleep on outcomes related to emotional, behavioural, and eating disorders in adolescents.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A systematic review and meta-analysis were conducted in accordance with PRISMA guidelines (PROSPERO ID: CRD42024591285). Eight databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to September 2024. Eligible studies included participants in early (11–14 years), middle (15–17 years) and late (18–21 years) adolescence with clinical diagnosis or self-report of emotional, behavioural, or eating disorders, where interventions targeted physical activity, sedentary behaviour, nutrition, or sleep. The cochrane risk of bias 2.0 (ROB2) and cochrane grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation tool (GRADE) were applied. Pooled effect sizes were calculated as standardized mean differences (SMD) with 95% confidence intervals using random-effect models.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              \n                Nine RCTs involving 3,703 participants were analysed across emotional, behavioural, and eating disorders. The meta-analysis yielded a significant reduction in anxiety (6 Studies, 2086 participants, SMD [95% CI] = −0.19 [−0.37, −0.01],\n                I\n                2\n                 = 71%, with positive effects for sleep focussed interventions as well as multimodal interventions (PA, SB, diet, sleep) and eating disorders (3 studies, 732 participants, SMD [95% CI] = −0.23 [−0.44, −0.02],\n                I\n                2\n                 = 38%, with positive effects for diet and combined diet/PA interventions). In contrast, depressive (7 Studies, 1855 participants, SMD [95%CI] of −0.12 [−0.28, −0.04], I\n                2\n                59%) and behavioural disorders symptoms (2 studies, 560 participants, SMD [95%CI] = −0.71 [1.77, 0.36],\n                I\n                2\n                 = 95) showed no significant pooled effect. The cumulative evidence was weakened by high heterogeneity of trial design and low overall certainty of evidence as indicated by ROB2 and GRADE assessments. Across interventions, trials characterized by higher session frequency, greater intensity (e.g., more vigorous physical activity), longer duration, and hybrid delivery methods, including some face-to-face counselling were associated with larger effect sizes but reduced scalability.\n              \n            \n            \n              Discussion\n              These findings suggest that mHealth interventions incorporating health behavior modifications may effectively reduce anxiety and eating disorder symptoms in adolescents. However, modest and mixed effects on depression and behavioural disorders, together with a low number of included studies, considerable heterogeneity and low certainty of evidence, underscore the need for further high-quality RCTs to evaluate long-term efficacy. Combining mHealth interventions with standard clinical care may enhance symptom improvements in adolescents.\n            \n            \n              Systematic Review Registration\n              identifier (CRD42024591285).",

However, integrated evidence-based knowledge about the mechanisms of change in these interventions is unclear.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This systematic review aimed to evaluate studies on behavior change techniques (BCTs) and mechanisms of change in digital health interventions aimed at promoting health-enhancing behaviors in midlife women (aged 40-65 years).\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A systematic literature search of the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in the Cochrane Library was conducted. In total, 2 independent reviewers selected the studies for inclusion, extracted data, and completed BCT mapping of eligible studies. The mechanism of action and intervention functions of eligible studies were evaluated using the behavior change wheel framework. Reporting of psychological theory use within these interventions was explored using the Theory Coding Scheme. Mode of delivery, psychological theory, and BCTs were presented as descriptive statistics.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              In total, 13 interventions (including 1315 women) reviewed used 13 (SD 4.30, range 6-21) BCTs per intervention on average. The “Shaping knowledge” and “Repetition and substitution” behavior change categories were used most frequently, with 92% (12/13) of the interventions implementing at least one of the BCTs from these 2 categories. Only 13.98% (169/1209) of the 93 available BCTs were used, with “Instructions on behaviour” most frequently used (12/13, 92%). The behavior change wheel mapping suggests that half of the intervention content aimed to increase “Capability” (49/98, 50% of the intervention strategies), “Motivation” (41/98, 42%), and “Opportunity” (8/98, 8%). “Behavioural Regulation” was the most frequently used mechanism of action (15/98, 15%), followed by increasing “Knowledge” (13/98, 13%) and “Cognitive and Interpersonal skills” (10/98, 10%). A total of 78% (7/9) of the intervention functions were used in the studies to change behavior, primarily through “Enablement” (60/169, 35.5%), whereas no study used “Restriction” or “Modelling” functions. Although 69% (9/13) of the interventions mentioned a psychological theory or model, most (10/13, 77%) stated or suggested rather than demonstrated the use of a theoretical base, and none reported explicit links between all BCTs within the intervention and the targeted theoretical constructs. Technological components were primarily based on web-based (9/13, 69%) modes of delivery, followed by phone or SMS text message (8/13, 62%) and wearables (7/13, 54%).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The findings of this review indicate an overall weak use of theory, low levels of treatment fidelity, insignificant outcomes, and insufficient description of several interventions to support the assessment of how specific BCTs were activated. Thus, the identified limitations in the current literature provide an opportunity to improve the design of lifestyle health-enhancing interventions for women in midlife.\n            \n            \n              Trial Registration\n              PROSPERO CRD42021259246; https://tinyurl.com/4ph74a9u",

Participants were recruited from public and private sector organisations in India (men and women aged 35–55 years) and by the National Health Service (NHS) Health Checks programme in the UK (aged 40–74 years without pre-existing diabetes, cardiovascular disease or kidney disease). Allocation to the study groups was performed using a computergenerated sequence (1:1) in India and by stratified randomisation in permuted blocks in the UK. Investigators in both countries remained blinded throughout the study period. All participants received advice on a healthy lifestyle at baseline. The intervention group in addition received supportive text messages using mobile phone SMS messages 2–3 times per week. Participants were assessed at baseline and at 6, 12 and 24 months. The primary outcome was conversion to type 2 diabetes and secondary outcomes included anthropometry, biochemistry, dietary and physical activity changes, blood pressure and quality of life.\nResults At the 2 year follow-up (n = 2062; control: n = 1031; intervention: n = 1031), in the intention-to-treat population the HR for development of type 2 diabetes calculated using a discrete-time proportional hazards model was 0.89 (95% CI 0.74, 1.07; p = 0.22). There were no significant differences in the secondary outcomes.\nConclusions/interpretation This trial in two countries with varied ethnic and cultural backgrounds showed no significant reduction in the progression to diabetes in 2 years by lifestyle modification using SMS messaging. Trial registration The primary study was registered on www.ClinicalTrials.gov (India, NCT01570946; UK, NCT01795833).

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: Clinical trials are increasingly testing the effectiveness of paying patients’ financial incentives for achieving desired clinical outcomes. Some researchers and providers are concerned that patient financial incentives will harm the doctor–patient relationship. How patients feel about these approaches, and these trials, is largely unknown. This study examined patients’ perceptions of a compound behavioral and financial incentive intervention used in a large multicenter trial to lower low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), including their perceptions of benefits and challenges and the study’s effect on patients’ relationship with their primary care physicians (PCPs). STUDY DESIGN: Semi-structured telephone interviews with patients post intervention.\nMETHODS: PCPs from 3 primary care practices in the northeastern United States were randomized to 1 of 4 arms: physician financial incentives, patient financial incentives, shared incentives between physicians and patients, and a control arm. Within each arm, 10 high, 10 medium, and 10 low performers in LDL-C reduction were interviewed. Interviews targeted reasons for enrolling in the study, the specific intervention elements that helped them reach the goal (incentives, engagement, monitoring), challenges faced in reducing cholesterol, and the impact of study participation on their relationship with their PCP.\nRESULTS: Patients reported positive experiences with the study: 65% described personal changes to improve health and 61% reported increased awareness. Views about financial incentives varied: 71% clearly found them motivating and 36% claimed they made no difference. Patients noted that changing lifestyle (36%) and diet (65%) was difficult. Patients who substantially lowered their LDL-C revealed themes similar to those who did not.\nCONCLUSIONS: Overall, behavioral interventions with financial incentives appear to be socially acceptable to patients who participate in them. Both adherence monitoring and financial incentives were well received, with little effect on the physician-patient relationship.",

      "abstract": "Summary\n            Recent years have seen a surge of interest in stepped-wedge cluster randomized trials (SW-CRTs). SW-CRTs include several design variations and methodology is rapidly developing. Accordingly, a variety of power and sample size calculation software for SW-CRTs has been developed. However, each calculator may support only a selected set of design features and may not be appropriate for all scenarios. Currently, there is no resource to assist researchers in selecting the most appropriate calculator for planning their trials. In this paper, we review and classify 18 existing calculators that can be implemented in major platforms, such as R, SAS, Stata, Microsoft Excel, PASS and nQuery. After reviewing the main sample size considerations for SW-CRTs, we summarize the features supported by the available calculators, including the types of designs, outcomes, correlation structures and treatment effects; whether incomplete designs, cluster-size variation or secular trends are accommodated; and the analytical approach used. We then discuss in more detail four main calculators and identify their strengths and limitations. We illustrate how to use these four calculators to compute power for two real SW-CRTs with a continuous and binary outcome and compare the results. We show that the choice of calculator can make a substantial difference in the calculated power and explain these differences. Finally, we make recommendations for implementing sample size or power calculations using the available calculators. An R Shiny app is available for users to select the calculator that meets their requirements (https://douyang.shinyapps.io/swcrtcalculator/).",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n            It has long been recognized that sample size calculations for cluster randomized trials require consideration of the correlation between multiple observations within the same cluster. When measurements are taken at anything other than a single point in time, these correlations depend not only on the cluster but also on the time separation between measurements and additionally, on whether different participants (cross-sectional designs) or the same participants (cohort designs) are repeatedly measured. This is particularly relevant in trials with multiple periods of measurement, such as the cluster cross-over and stepped-wedge designs, but also to some degree in parallel designs. Several papers describing sample size methodology for these designs have been published, but this methodology might not be accessible to all researchers. In this article we provide a tutorial on sample size calculation for cluster randomized designs with particular emphasis on designs with multiple periods of measurement and provide a web-based tool, the Shiny CRT Calculator, to allow researchers to easily conduct these sample size calculations. We consider both cross-sectional and cohort designs and allow for a variety of assumed within-cluster correlation structures. We consider cluster heterogeneity in treatment effects (for designs where treatment is crossed with cluster), as well as individually randomized group-treatment trials with differential clustering between arms, for example designs where clustering arises from interventions being delivered in groups. The calculator will compute power or precision, as a function of cluster size or number of clusters, for a wide variety of designs and correlation structures. We illustrate the methodology and the flexibility of the Shiny CRT Calculator using a range of examples.",

      "abstract": "Advances in digital technologies have created unprecedented opportunities to deliver effective and scalable behavior change interventions. Many digital interventions include multiple components, namely several aspects of the intervention that can be differentiated for systematic investigation. Various types of experimental approaches have been developed in recent years to enable researchers to obtain the empirical evidence necessary for the development of effective multiple-component interventions. These include factorial designs, Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trials (SMARTs), and Micro-Randomized Trials (MRTs). An important challenge facing researchers concerns selecting the right type of design to match their scientific questions. Here, we propose MCMTC – a pragmatic framework that can be used to guide investigators interested in developing digital interventions in deciding which experimental approach to select. This framework includes five questions that investigators are encouraged to answer in the process of selecting the most suitable design: (1) Multiple-component intervention: Is the goal to develop an intervention that includes multiple components; (2) Component selection: Are there open scientific questions about the selection of specific components for inclusion in the intervention; (3) More than a single component: Are there open scientific questions about the inclusion of more than a single component in the intervention; (4) Timing: Are there open scientific questions about the timing of component delivery, that is when to deliver specific components; and (5) Change: Are the components in question designed to address conditions that change relatively slowly (e.g., over months or weeks) or rapidly (e.g., every day, hours, minutes). Throughout we use examples of tobacco cessation digital interventions to illustrate the process of selecting a design by answering these questions. For simplicity we focus exclusively on four experimental approaches—standard two- or multi-arm randomized trials, classic factorial designs, SMARTs, and MRTs—acknowledging that the array of possible experimental approaches for developing digital interventions is not limited to these designs.",

We show that increasing patient coinsurance tenfold would reduce prices by 16 percent.

The Statistical Update presents the latest data on a range of major clinical heart and circulatory disease conditions (including stroke, congenital heart disease, rhythm disorders, subclinical atherosclerosis, coronary heart disease, heart failure, valvular disease, venous disease, and peripheral artery disease) and the associated outcomes (including quality of care, procedures, and economic costs).\n            \n            \n              Methods:\n              The American Heart Association, through its Statistics Committee, continuously monitors and evaluates sources of data on heart disease and stroke in the United States to provide the most current information available in the annual Statistical Update. The 2021 Statistical Update is the product of a full year’s worth of effort by dedicated volunteer clinicians and scientists, committed government professionals, and American Heart Association staff members. This year’s edition includes data on the monitoring and benefits of cardiovascular health in the population, an enhanced focus on social determinants of health, adverse pregnancy outcomes, vascular contributions to brain health, the global burden of cardiovascular disease, and further evidence-based approaches to changing behaviors related to cardiovascular disease.\n            \n            \n              Results:\n              Each of the 27 chapters in the Statistical Update focuses on a different topic related to heart disease and stroke statistics.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions:\n              The Statistical Update represents a critical resource for the lay public, policy makers, media professionals, clinicians, health care administrators, researchers, health advocates, and others seeking the best available data on these factors and conditions.",

Accordingly, there is an urgent need to develop integration mechanisms among the various health information systems. The aim of this review was to investigate the interoperability requirements for heterogeneous health information systems and to summarize and present them.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              In accordance with the PRISMA guideline, a broad electronic search of all literature was conducted on the topic through six databases, including PubMed, Web of science, Scopus, MEDLINE, Cochrane Library and Embase to 25 July 2022.

The projects done in this field are mostly in the national scope and to achieve the electronic health record. HL7 FHIR, CDA, HIPAA and SNOMED-CT, SOA, RIM, XML, API, JAVA and SQL are among the most important requirements for implementing interoperability.

For this article we followed the most recent definition provided by FDA in 2020. Emerging solutions offers tremendous potential to positively transform the healthcare sector. Despite the growing number of applications, however, the evolution of methodologies to perform timely, cost-effective and robust evaluations have not kept pace. It remains an industry-wide challenge to provide credible evidence, therefore, hindering wider adoption. Conventional methodologies, such as clinical trials, have seldom been applied and more pragmatic approaches are needed. In response, several academic centers such as researchers from the Institute of Global Health Innovation at Imperial College London have initiated a digital health clinical simulation test bed to explore new approaches for evidence gathering relevant to solution type and maturity. The aim of this article is to: (1) Review current research approaches and discuss their limitations; (2) Discuss challenges faced by different stakeholders in undertaking evaluations; and (3) Call for new approaches to facilitate the safe and responsible growth of the digital health sector.",

Our central thesis is that eHealth interventions will be more effective if the clinical workflow is studied and taken into consideration for intervention implementation. This paper aims to provide an introductory tutorial on when and how to use a clinical workflow analysis to guide the implementation of eHealth interventions. The tutorial includes a step-by-step guide to conducting a clinical workflow analysis in planning for eHealth implementation. We began with a description of why a clinical workflow analysis is best completed before the implementation of eHealth interventions. Next, we described 4 steps needed to perform the clinical workflow analysis: the identification of discrete workflow components, workflow assessment, triangulation, and the stakeholder proposal of intervention implementation. Finally, we presented a case study of a clinical workflow analysis, which was conducted during patient visits of patients aged 11 or 12 years from 4 diverse pediatric or family medicine clinics to plan the implementation of a tablet-based app for adolescent vaccination. Investigators planning the implementation of new eHealth interventions in health care settings can use the presented steps to assess clinical workflow, thereby maximizing the match of their intervention with the clinical workflow. Conducting a prospective workflow study allows for evidence-based planning, identifying potential pitfalls, and increasing stakeholder buy-in and engagement. This tutorial should aid investigators in increasing the successful implementation of eHealth interventions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n            Feelings of well-being and happiness fluctuate over time and contexts. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) studies can capture fluctuations in momentary behavior, and experiences by assessing these multiple times per day. Traditionally, EMA was performed using pen and paper. Recently, due to technological advances EMA studies can be conducted more easily with smartphones, a device ubiquitous in our society. The goal of this review was to evaluate the literature on smartphone-based EMA in well-being research in healthy subjects. The systematic review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. Searching PubMed and Web of Science, we identified 53 studies using smartphone-based EMA of well-being. Studies were heterogeneous in designs, context, and measures. The average study duration was 12.8 days, with well-being assessed 2–12 times per day. Half of the studies included objective data (e.g. location). Only 47.2% reported compliance, indicating a mean of 71.6%. Well-being fluctuated daily and weekly, with higher well-being in evenings and weekends. These fluctuations disappeared when location and activity were accounted for. On average, being in nature and physical activity relates to higher well-being. Working relates to lower well-being, but workplace and company do influence well-being. The important advantages of using smartphones instead of other devices to collect EMAs are the easier data collection and flexible designs. Smartphone-based EMA reach far larger maximum sample sizes and more easily add objective data to their designs than palm-top/PDA studies. Smartphone-based EMA research is feasible to gain insight in well-being fluctuations and its determinants and offers the opportunity for parallel objective data collection. Most studies currently focus on group comparisons, while studies on individual differences in well-being patterns and fluctuations are lacking. We provide recommendations for future smartphone-based EMA research regarding measures, objective data and analyses.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              The circular economy reshapes the linear “take, make, and dispose” approach and evolves around minimizing waste and recapturing resources in a closed-loop system. The health sector accounts for 4.6% of global greenhouse gas emissions and has, over the decades, been built to rely on single-use devices and deal with high volumes of medical waste. With the increase in the adoption of digital health solutions in the health care industry, leading the industry into a new paradigm of how we provide health care, a focus must be put on the amount of waste that will follow. Digital health solutions will shape health care through the use of technology and lead to improved patient care, but they will also make medical waste more complex to deal with due to the e-waste component. Therefore, a transformation of the health care industry to a circular economy is a crucial cornerstone in decreasing the impact on the environment.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aims to address the lack of direction in the current literature on circular business models. It will consider micro, meso, and macro factors that would impact the operational validity of circular models using the digital health solutions ePaper label (medical packaging), smart wearable sensor (health monitoring devices), smart pill box (medication management), and endo-cutter (surgical equipment) as examples.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              The study will systematically perform a scoping review through a database and snowball search. We will analyze and classify the studies from a predetermined set of categories and then summarize them into an evidence map. Based on the review, the study will develop a 2D framework for businesses to follow or for future research to take a standpoint from.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Preliminarily, the review has analyzed 26 studies in total. The results are close to equally distributed among the micro (8/26, 31%), meso (10/26, 38%), and macro (8/26, 31%) levels. Circular economy studies emphasize several circular practices such as recycling (17/26, 65%), reusing (18/26, 69%), reducing (15/26, 58%), and remanufacturing (8/26, 31%). The value proposition in the examined business model is mostly dominated by stand-alone products (18/26, 69%) compared to product as a service (7/26, 27%), involving stakeholders such as health care professionals or hospitals (20/26, 77%), manufacturers (11/26, 42%), and consumers (9/26, 35%). All studies encompass societal (12/26, 46%), economic (23/26, 88%), and environmental (24/26, 92%) viewpoints.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The study argues that each digital health solution would have to be accessed individually to find the optimal business model to follow. This is due to their differing life cycles and complexity. The manufacturer will need a layered value proposition, implementing several business models dependent on their respective product portfolios. The need to incorporate several business models implies an ecosystem perspective that is relevant to consider.\n            \n            \n              International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID)\n              DERR1-10.2196/47874",

The authors have used a user-centered design–based approach to build an mHealth app for health professionals, tasked to deliver medical laboratory-related information on a daily basis.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              Our objective is to generate a simple and functional user-centered design process for mHealth apps for health professionals. This paper presents the key learnings from design activities.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A stratified random sample of doctors and nurses was recruited for the study. The design activities were planned in the following sequence: focus group discussion for situation analysis and information architecture, design activity 1 for wireframe designing, design activity 2 for wireframe testing, and user testing sessions 1 and 2.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The final design and functions of the app, information architecture, and interactive elements were largely influenced by the participatory design–based user-centered design activities. As a result of the design process, we could identify the mental models of processing requests for information and personal preferences based on the experience. These findings were directly or indirectly incorporated into the app design. \nFurthermore, finding alternative ways of working within time constraints and cultural barriers and the methods employed to manage the challenges of interdisciplinary discourse stood out among the lessons learned.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              We recommend a user-centered design process based on a participatory design approach in mHealth app design, enriched with focus group discussions where possible.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Different strategies encompassed within mHealth have shown themselves to be effective for maintaining good health or controlling certain diseases. However, there is usually a very high rate of abandonment of health apps. Therefore, it would seem obvious that there is a need for involving the end users (whether they are health professionals, patients, or both) in the design process from the early stages in order to enable their needs and characteristics to be identified. In this sense, it is common knowledge that focusing on the user permits the consideration of valuable details aimed at making the correct adjustment between the patient, the technology, and the organization of attention.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The goal of the research was to propose a methodology based on the review of previous successful user experiences in setting up health apps by using qualitative techniques (focus groups and discussion groups) that includes the participation of information technology and health professionals and the patients themselves.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              An integrative review was made of studies in which a qualitative methodology was employed mainly through focus and/or discussion groups for the design and development of health apps, consulting diverse databases (PubMed, Scopus, and Proquest) with the following search strategy: “mHealth AND apps AND focus group OR discussion group.” A total of 69 papers were included in the review.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A proposal structured in 4 sessions of variable duration was made in which information technology and health professionals and patients take part: composing, preparing, and organizing contents (session 1); testing structure and usability (session 2); does the app fit the needs of end users? (session 3); and last testing—keep on improving (session 4). Throughout the sessions, we propose studying aspects like previous user experiences in mHealth, barriers to the adoption of mHealth, interface contents, management and browsability, usability, perceived quality, security and privacy, capacity to self-manage disease with the app, ergonomics, and glanceability, etc. Specific tools that have proved useful in previous research for measuring these aspects are presented.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              These work sessions would be based on predominantly qualitative methodologies although, as they evolve, validated questionnaires permitting the assessment of the objectivity of certain technical aspects could be incorporated. With this proposal, a project centered on end users could be effected, responding to their needs. However, this requires validation that will be made via implementation in the development of health apps, with the subsequent measurement of results in terms of adherence and improvement in the clinical variables of the end users.",

Although these interventions are less established for individuals with serious mental illnesses, they demonstrate significant promise. A central consideration in traditional face-to-face therapies is the therapeutic alliance, whereas the nature of a digital therapeutic alliance and its relationship with outcomes requires further attention, particularly for individuals with serious mental illnesses.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This narrative review aims to encourage further consideration and critical evaluation of the therapeutic alliance in digital mental health, specifically for individuals with serious mental illnesses.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A narrative review was conducted by combining 3 main areas of the literature: the first examining the evidence for digital mental health interventions for serious mental illnesses, the second illuminating the nature and role of the therapeutic alliance in digital interventions, and the third surrounding practical considerations to enhance a digital therapeutic alliance.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Results indicated that a therapeutic alliance can be cultivated in digital interventions for those with serious mental illnesses, but that it may have unique, yet-to-be-confirmed characteristics in digital contexts. In addition, a therapeutic alliance appears to be less directly associated with outcomes in digital interventions than with those in face-to-face therapies. One possibility is that the digital therapeutic alliance is associated with increased engagement and adherence to digital interventions, through which it appears to influence outcomes. A number of design and implementation considerations may enhance the digital therapeutic alliance, including human support and technological features.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              More research is required to further understand the nature and specific role of a therapeutic alliance in digital interventions for serious mental illnesses, particularly in informing their design.

      "abstract": "AI has the potential to revolutionize mental health services by providing personalized support and improving accessibility. However, it is crucial to address ethical concerns to ensure responsible and beneficial outcomes for individuals. This systematic review examines the ethical considerations surrounding the implementation and impact of artificial intelligence (AI) interventions in the field of mental health and well-being. To ensure a comprehensive analysis, we employed a structured search strategy across top academic databases, including PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Scopus. The search scope encompassed articles published from 2014 to 2024, resulting in a review of 51 relevant articles. The review identifies 18 key ethical considerations, including 6 ethical considerations associated with using AI interventions in mental health and wellbeing (privacy and confidentiality, informed consent, bias and fairness, transparency and accountability, autonomy and human agency, and safety and efficacy); 5 ethical principles associated with the development and implementation of AI technologies in mental health settings to ensure responsible practice and positive outcomes (ethical framework, stakeholder engagement, ethical review, bias mitigation, and continuous evaluation and improvement); and 7 practices, guidelines, and recommendations for promoting the ethical use of AI in mental health interventions (adhere to ethical guidelines, ensure transparency, prioritize data privacy and security, mitigate bias and ensure fairness, involve stakeholders, conduct regular ethical reviews, and monitor and evaluate outcomes). This systematic review highlights the importance of ethical considerations in the responsible implementation and impact of AI interventions for mental health and well-being. By addressing privacy, bias, consent, transparency, human oversight, and continuous evaluation, we can ensure that AI interventions like chatbots and AI-enabled medical devices are developed and deployed in an ethically sound manner, respecting individual rights, promoting fairness, and maximizing benefits while minimizing potential harm.",

Forty-five adults were randomly assigned to receive tart cherry, blueberry, or a placebo, of which they drank 60 mL per day for 20 days. The primary outcome, which was systolic blood pressure, and secondary measures, including anthropometric, energy expenditure, substrate oxidation, hematological, diastolic blood pressure/resting heart rate, psychological wellbeing, and sleep efficacy, were measured before and after the intervention. There were no statistically significant differences (p > 0.05) for systolic blood pressure; however, total and LDL cholesterol were significantly improved with blueberry intake (pre: total cholesterol = 4.36 mmol/L and LDL cholesterol = 2.71 mmol/L; post: total cholesterol = 3.79 mmol/L and LDL cholesterol = 2.23 mmol/L) compared to placebo (pre: total cholesterol = 4.01 mmol/L and LDL cholesterol = 2.45 mmol/L; post: total cholesterol = 4.34 mmol/L and LDL cholesterol = 2.67 mmol/L). Furthermore, psychological wellbeing indices measured using the Beck Depression Inventory, State Trait Anxiety Inventory, and COOP WONCA improved statistically in the blueberry arm compared to placebo. Given the clear association between lipid concentrations and the risk of cardiovascular disease as well as the importance of psychological wellbeing to health-related quality of life, this investigation indicates that it could be an effective approach to assist in managing cardiometabolic disease.",

The current review aimed at examining the performance of wearable AI in detecting and predicting depression. The search sources in this systematic review were 8 electronic databases. Study selection, data extraction, and risk of bias assessment were carried out by two reviewers independently. The extracted results were synthesized narratively and statistically. Of the 1314 citations retrieved from the databases, 54 studies were included in this review. The pooled mean of the highest accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and root mean square error (RMSE) was 0.89, 0.87, 0.93, and 4.55, respectively. The pooled mean of lowest accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and RMSE was 0.70, 0.61, 0.73, and 3.76, respectively. Subgroup analyses revealed that there is a statistically significant difference in the highest accuracy, lowest accuracy, highest sensitivity, highest specificity, and lowest specificity between algorithms, and there is a statistically significant difference in the lowest sensitivity and lowest specificity between wearable devices. Wearable AI is a promising tool for depression detection and prediction although it is in its infancy and not ready for use in clinical practice. Until further research improve its performance, wearable AI should be used in conjunction with other methods for diagnosing and predicting depression. Further studies are needed to examine the performance of wearable AI based on a combination of wearable device data and neuroimaging data and to distinguish patients with depression from those with other diseases.",

The Digital Therapeutics for Opioids and Other SUD (DIGITS) Trial tests strategies for implementing reSET® and reSET-O®, which are prescription digital therapeutics for SUD and opioid use disorder, respectively, that include the community reinforcement approach, contingency management, and fluency training to reinforce concept mastery. This purpose of this trial is to test whether two implementation strategies improve implementation success (Aim 1) and achieve better population-level cost effectiveness (Aim 2) over a standard implementation approach.\n            \n            \n              Methods/Design\n              The DIGITS Trial is a hybrid type III cluster-randomized trial. It examines outcomes of implementation strategies, rather than studying clinical outcomes of a digital therapeutic. It includes 22 primary care clinics from a healthcare system in Washington State and patients with unhealthy substance use who visit clinics during an active implementation period (up to one year). Primary care clinics implemented reSET and reSET-O using a multifaceted implementation strategy previously used by clinical leaders to roll-out smartphone apps (“standard implementation” including discrete strategies such as clinician training, electronic health record tools). Clinics were randomized as 21 sites in a 2x2 factorial design to receive up to two added implementation strategies: (1) practice facilitation, and/or (2) health coaching. Outcome data are derived from electronic health records and logs of digital therapeutic usage. Aim 1’s primary outcomes include reach of the digital therapeutics to patients and fidelity of patients’ use of the digital therapeutics to clinical recommendations. Substance use and engagement in SUD care are additional outcomes. In Aim 2, population-level cost effectiveness analysis will inform the economic benefit of the implementation strategies compared to standard implementation. Implementation is monitored using formative evaluation, and sustainment will be studied for up to one year using qualitative and quantitative research methods.\n            \n            \n              Discussion\n              \n                The DIGITS Trial uses an experimental design to test whether implementation strategies increase and improve the delivery of digital therapeutics for SUDs when embedded in a large healthcare system. It will provide data on the potential benefits and cost-effectiveness of alternative implementation strategies.\n                ClinicalTrials.gov\n                Identifier: NCT05160233 (Submitted 12/3/2021).\n                https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05160233",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Participating in an adequate amount of physical activity to acquire health benefits is challenging for people with spinal cord injury (SCI) due to personal and logistic barriers. Barriers in the built and social environments may include lack of transportation, lack of accessible facilities or programs, and lack of training among fitness personnel. Low self-efficacy, lack of self-regulation skills, and improper outcome expectations are examples of personal barriers. Current approaches to investigating physical activity programs in people with SCI have been limited to traditional “one-size-fits-all” design, which has yielded low adherence rates, high dropout rates, and participants not maintaining physical activity levels at follow-up.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The primary aim of this study is to test the feasibility of a tele-exercise program that applies an adaptive intervention design for 30 adults with SCI, targeting increases in adherence to the exercise program and physical activity participation.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              The Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial for Home-based Exercise and Lifestyle Tele-Health (SMART-HEALTH) is a 12-week, home-based, movement-to-music (M2M) program. The goal of a SMART-designed study is to develop an adaptive intervention that modifies support provisions based on response levels. In SMART-HEALTH, 2 groups of participants will undergo 3-week and 6-week asynchronous M2M interventions in the first phase. Participants who did not achieve the desired adherence rate (≥95% of video watch minutes) will be rerandomized into M2M Live (switch) or individualized behavioral coaching (augmented with the asynchronous M2M program). The study will primarily assess rates of recruitment or enrollment, adherence and retention, timing to identify nonresponders, and scientific outcomes (eg, physical activity and exercise self-efficacy). The study will qualitatively evaluate the acceptability of the study using semistructured interviews among participants who complete the 12-week intervention.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Recruitment procedures started in June 2022. All data are expected to be collected by September 2023. Full trial results are expected to be published by March 2024. Secondary analyses of data will be subsequently published. Results will include exercise adherence rates; changes in self-reported physical activity levels and blood pressure; and changes in secondary conditions including pain, sleep, and fatigue. Thematic analysis of semistructured interviews will include results on participant enjoyment and acceptability of SMART-HEALTH and inform modifications for future delivery of the program.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This study will strengthen our understanding of the potential benefits of the tele-exercise intervention for people with SCI and build upon adaptive intervention design and its delivery strategies that aim to increase adoption and sustainable exercise behavior. This pilot trial will inform future SMART-designed studies and provide new and innovative strategies for investigating intervention effects on physical activity behavior in the SCI population.\n            \n            \n              Trial Registration\n              ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04726891; https://classic.clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04726891\n            \n            \n              International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID)\n              DERR1-10.2196/47665",

      "abstract": "The stepped wedge cluster randomized design has received increasing attention in pragmatic clinical trials and implementation science research. The key feature of the design is the unidirectional crossover of clusters from the control to intervention conditions on a staggered schedule, which induces confounding of the intervention effect by time. The stepped wedge design first appeared in the Gambia hepatitis study in the 1980s. However, the statistical model used for the design and analysis was not formally introduced until 2007 in an article by Hussey and Hughes. Since then, a variety of mixed-effects model extensions have been proposed for the design and analysis of these trials. In this article, we explore these extensions under a unified perspective. We provide a general model representation and regard various model extensions as alternative ways to characterize the secular trend, intervention effect, as well as sources of heterogeneity. We review the key model ingredients and clarify their implications for the design and analysis. The article serves as an entry point to the evolving statistical literatures on stepped wedge designs.",

      "abstract": "The use and development of mobile interventions are experiencing rapid growth. In “just‐in‐time” mobile interventions, treatments are provided via a mobile device, and they are intended to help an individual make healthy decisions ‘in the moment,’ and thus have a proximal, near future impact. Currently, the development of mobile interventions is proceeding at a much faster pace than that of associated data science methods. A first step toward developing data‐based methods is to provide an experimental design for testing the proximal effects of these just‐in‐time treatments. In this paper, we propose a ‘micro‐randomized’ trial design for this purpose. In a micro‐randomized trial, treatments are sequentially randomized throughout the conduct of the study, with the result that each participant may be randomized at the 100s or 1000s of occasions at which a treatment might be provided. Further, we develop a test statistic for assessing the proximal effect of a treatment as well as an associated sample size calculator. We conduct simulation evaluations of the sample size calculator in various settings. Rules of thumb that might be used in designing a micro‐randomized trial are discussed. This work is motivated by our collaboration on the HeartSteps mobile application designed to increase physical activity. Copyright © 2015 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

However, they have inflated type-one error when used with a small number of clusters, which is common for stepped wedge cluster randomised trials. We present a large simulation study of binary outcomes comparing bias-corrected standard errors from Fay and Graubard; Mancl and DeRouen; Kauermann and Carroll; Morel, Bokossa, and Neerchal; and Mackinnon and White with an independent and exchangeable working correlation matrix. We constructed 95% confidence intervals using a t-distribution with degrees of freedom including clusters minus parameters (DF\n              C-P\n              ), cluster periods minus parameters, and estimators from Fay and Graubard (DF\n              FG\n              ), and Pan and Wall. Fay and Graubard and an approximation to Kauermann and Carroll (with simpler matrix inversion) were unbiased in a wide range of scenarios with an independent working correlation matrix and more than 12 clusters. They gave confidence intervals with close to 95% coverage with DF\n              FG\n              with 12 or more clusters, and DF\n              C-P\n              with 18 or more clusters.

      "abstract": "Background: Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a leading chronic cardiac disease associated with an increased risk of stroke, cardiac complications, and general mortality. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions, including wearable devices and apps, can aid in the detection, screening, and management of AF to improve patient outcomes. The inclusion of approaches that consider user experiences and behavior in the design of health care interventions can increase the usability of mHealth interventions, and hence, hopefully, yield an increase in positive outcomes in the lives of users.\nObjective: This study aims to show how research has considered user experiences and behavioral approaches in designing mHealth interventions for AF detection, screening, and management; the phases of designing complex interventions from the UK Medical Research Council (MRC) were referenced: namely, identification, development, feasibility, evaluation, and implementation.\nMethods: Studies published until September 7, 2022, that examined user experiences and behavioral approaches associated with mHealth interventions in the context of AF were extracted from multiple databases. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were used.\nResults: A total of 2219 records were extracted, with only 55 records reporting on usability, user experiences, or behavioral approaches more widely for designing mHealth interventions in the context of AF. When mapping the studies onto the phases of the UK MRC’s guidance for developing and evaluating complex interventions, the following was found: in the identification phase, there were significant differences between the needs of patients and health care workers. In the development phase, user perspectives guided the iterative development of apps, interfaces, and intervention protocols in 4 studies. Most studies (43/55, 78%) assessed the usability of interventions in the feasibility phase as an outcome, although the data collection tools were not designed together with users and stakeholders. Studies that examined the evaluation and implementation phase entailed reporting on challenges in user participation, acceptance, and workflows that could not be captured by studies in the previous phases. To realize the envisaged human behavior intended through treatment, review results highlight the scant inclusion of behavior change approaches for mHealth interventions across multiple levels of sociotechnical health care systems. While interventions at the level of the individual (micro) and the level of communities (meso) were found in the studies reviewed, no studies were found intervening at societal levels (macro). Studies also failed to consider the temporal variation of user goals and feedback in the design of long-term behavioral interventions.\nConclusions: In this systematic review, we proposed 2 contributions: first, mapping studies to different phases of the MRC framework for developing and evaluating complex interventions, and second, mapping behavioral approaches to different levels of health care systems. Finally, we discuss the wider implications of our results in guiding future mHealth research.",

      "abstract": "As the COVID‐19 pandemic has largely increased the utilization of telehealth, mobile mental health technologies – such as smartphone apps, vir­tual reality, chatbots, and social media – have also gained attention. These digital health technologies offer the potential of accessible and scalable interventions that can augment traditional care. In this paper, we provide a comprehensive update on the overall field of digital psychiatry, covering three areas. First, we outline the relevance of recent technological advances to mental health research and care, by detailing how smartphones, social media, artificial intelligence and virtual reality present new opportunities for “digital phenotyping” and remote intervention. Second, we review the current evidence for the use of these new technological approaches across different mental health contexts, covering their emerging efficacy in self‐management of psychological well‐being and early intervention, along with more nascent research supporting their use in clinical management of long‐term psychiatric conditions – including major depression; anxiety, bipolar and psychotic disorders; and eating and substance use disorders – as well as in child and adolescent mental health care. Third, we discuss the most pressing challenges and opportunities towards real‐world implementation, using the Integrated Promoting Action on Research Implementation in Health Services (i‐PARIHS) framework to explain how the innovations themselves, the recipients of these innovations, and the context surrounding innovations all must be considered to facilitate their adoption and use in mental health care systems. We conclude that the new technological capabilities of smartphones, artificial intelligence, social media and virtual reality are already changing mental health care in unforeseen and exciting ways, each accompanied by an early but promising evidence base. We point out that further efforts towards strengthening implementation are needed, and detail the key issues at the patient, provider and policy levels which must now be addressed for digital health technologies to truly improve mental health research and treatment in the future.",

Weight loss can reduce mortality and improve most of the detrimental health consequences of obesity.\n            \n            \n              Design and Methods:\n              This paper was developed from two presentations to the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which has responsibility for reviewing and approving drugs to treat obesity.\n            \n            \n              Results:\n              A weight loss of 5% or more is sufficient to significantly reduce health risks in individuals with impaired glucose tolerance, hypertension, or nonalcoholic fatty liver disease. Slightly more weight loss (16% on average, achieved by surgery) reduces mortality. The goal of medicating for obesity is to help more patients achieve more weight loss. A barrier to drug approval has been the concern that weight loss medications might be used by individuals with little or no health risks, thus mandating a low side effect profile for approval of any drug. This limits the options for patients who have obesity‐related health problems that could improve with weight loss. Recently the FDA signaled interest in identifying health benefits in higher risk patients that might justify medications with higher risk; however, the potential impact on a large segment of the population has led the FDA to consider requiring a cardiovascular outcome trial for all obesity medications, either prior to or after approval.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion:\n              This review argues that drugs are needed for obesity because they enhance behaviorally induced weight loss and that new medications for obesity are needed in the approval process.",

This research extends the scope of previous systematic reviews by including 2 subgroup analyses based on nonmobile interventions that accompanied smartphone use and human-based versus passive behavioral interventions.\nObjective: The primary objective of this study is to systematically review and perform a meta-analysis of studies that evaluated the effectiveness of smartphone apps on weight loss in the context of other interventions combined with app use. The secondary objective is to measure the impact of different mobile app features on weight loss and mobile app adherence.\nMethods: We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of relevant studies after an extensive search of the PubMed, MEDLINE, and EBSCO databases from inception to January 31, 2022. Gray literature, such as abstracts and conference proceedings, was included. Working independently, 2 investigators extracted the data from the articles, resolving disagreements by consensus. All randomized controlled trials that used smartphone apps in at least 1 arm for weight loss were included. The weight loss outcome was the change in weight from baseline to the 3- and 6-month periods for each arm. Net change estimates were pooled across the studies using random-effects models to compare the intervention group with the control group. The risk of bias was assessed independently by 2 authors using the Cochrane Collaboration tool for assessing the risk of bias in randomized trials.\nResults: Overall, 34 studies were included that evaluated the use of a smartphone app in at least 1 arm. Compared with controls, the use of a smartphone app–based intervention showed a significant weight loss of –1.99 kg (95% CI –2.19 to –1.79 kg; I2=81%) at 3 months and –2.80 kg (95% CI –3.03 to –2.56 kg; I2=91%) at 6 months. In the subgroup analysis, based on the various intervention components that were added to the mobile app, the combination of the mobile app, tracker, and behavioral interventions showed a statistically significant weight loss of –2.09 kg (95% CI –2.32 to –1.86 kg; I2=91%) and –3.77 kg (95% CI –4.05 to –3.49 kg; I2=90%) at 3 and 6 months, respectively. When a behavioral intervention was present, only the combination of the mobile app with intensive behavior coaching or feedback by a human coach showed a statistically significant weight loss of –2.03 kg (95% CI –2.80 to –1.26 kg; I2=83%) and –2.63 kg (95% CI –2.97 to –2.29 kg; I2=91%) at 3 and 6 months, respectively. Neither the type nor the number of mobile app features was associated with weight loss.\nConclusions: Smartphone apps have a role in weight loss management. Nevertheless, the human-based behavioral component remained key to higher weight loss results.",

      "abstract": "Type 2 diabetic patients benefit significantly if the disease is well controlled through behavioral changes, namely adopting a healthy lifestyle. Currently, there is some evidence that technological strategies can help patient selfmanagement. However, few studies have specifically targeted individuals who solely engage in automatic and personalized self-management practices. This study aims to synthesize the literature regarding personalized feedback recommendation systems to promote behavior change without health professionals’ direct intervention for the management of type 2 diabetes and to verify if the use of these systems improves health-related outcomes. A systematic review was performed from inception to April 13, 2021, based on a search conducted in six databases. According to the defined search expression, studies addressing type 2 diabetic patients and recommendation systems were included. In total, 2186 papers were initially identified, but only 22 met the specific inclusion criteria after screening. Discrepancies in the selection of studies were discussed in consensus meetings. To assess the quality of the articles, two tools were employed according to the types of articles retrieved. Selected papers were summarized regarding specific characteristics such as clinical and technological outcomes. Studies incorporating a recommendation system into their technological solution showed a positive effect on the evaluated outcomes, except for those with longer duration, where the effect was not statistically significant. Although most studies did not report the type of system used, expert systems (rule-based) were found to be the most prevalent among those that did. As behaviors are often difficult to change quickly, it is recommended that future studies extend their follow-up timeframe. Nevertheless, the data obtained suggest that technological solutions incorporating a recommendation system show potential to improve health-related outcomes and demonstrated good usability.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n            Nonprofit organizations (NPOs) and social enterprises are increasingly under pressure to justify their use of resources and report their impact on society. Frameworks that monetize social value such as social return on investment (SROI) have emerged as a response. The existing literature highlights many benefits and technical challenges of SROI, but largely ignores strategic and organizational learning aspects. This paper explores the use of SROI in an NPO conducting cultural heritage preservation. By analyzing the challenges managers face in agreeing on a reliable (“correct”) computation of SROI and in assessing the validity and relevance (“appropriateness”) of SROI, we seek to understand the challenges and boundaries of SROI. Challenges with a reliable computation of SROI are identifying stakeholders, the choice of proxies, the time horizons, and deadweight factors. Challenges with an appropriate SROI calculation are comparability, subjectivity, legitimacy, and resource utility. We argue that SROI calculations might not be reliable or appropriate in organizations with fuzzy purposes, broad value creation goals, broad target groups, very individual or subjective proxies, strongly lagged outcomes, complex or unobservable causality, and with lack of legitimacy among stakeholders. Organizations should not trustingly adopt SROI without being aware of these limitations.",

      "abstract": "The complexity associated with how interventions result—or fail to result—in outcomes and how context matters is increasingly recognised. Logic models provide an important tool for handling complexity, with contrasting uses in programme evaluation and evidence synthesis. To reconcile these, we developed an approach that combines the strengths of both traditions, propose a taxonomy of logic models, and provide guidance on how to choose between approaches and types of logic models in systematic reviews and health technology assessments (HTA).\n            The taxonomy distinguishes 3 approaches (a priori, staged, and iterative) and 2 types (systems‐based and process‐orientated) of logic models. An a priori logic model is specified at the start of the systematic review/HTA and remains unchanged. With a staged logic model, the reviewer prespecifies several points, at which major data inputs require a subsequent version. An iterative logic model is continuously modified throughout the systematic review/HTA process. System‐based logic models describe the system, in which the interaction between participants, intervention, and context takes place; process‐orientated models display the causal pathways leading from the intervention to multiple outcomes.\n            The proposed taxonomy of logic models offers an improved understanding of the advantages and limitations of logic models across the spectrum from a priori to fully iterative approaches. Choice of logic model should be informed by scope of evidence synthesis, presence/absence of clearly defined population, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) elements, and feasibility considerations. Applications across distinct interventions and methodological approaches will deliver good practice case studies and offer further insights on the choice and implementation of logic modelling approaches.",

The purpose of this paper is to provide an update of the 2017 Society of Behavioral Medicine PA Special Interest Group article that outlined future directions in sedentary time reduction interventions, technology-based PA interventions, and the dissemination and implementation of PA interventions. Since the prior review, there has been significant progress on effective interventions for reducing sedentary time. However, there has been less progress for improving the specificity of sedentary time guidelines. There has been a dramatic increase in the number of studies examining PA mHealth interventions and support for mHealth intervention has generally been positive, though sustaining engagement in mHealth interventions remains a challenge. Promising newer technologies that have been explored more extensively since the prior review including artificial intelligence (AI). Knowledge of how to implement and scale-up effective PA interventions has also increased. Several current trends in PA intervention research that continue to advance the field include examining the moderating effect of the built environment on the effectiveness of behavioral interventions, cultural tailoring of interventions, Just in Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs), and exercise snacks (vigorous intensity PA sessions that are less than one minute). Overall, there has been significant progress in the PA intervention field but significant work remains for creating effective interventions that can be readily implemented into real world settings.",

Direct mapping using linear regression, mixture beta regression and adjusted limited dependent variable mixture models (ALDVMMs) and response mapping using seemingly unrelated ordered probit models were performed. The KDQOL-36 subscale scores, i.e., physical component summary (PCS), mental component summary (MCS), three disease-specific subscales or their average, i.e., kidney disease component summary (KDCS), and age and sex were included as the explanatory variables. Predictive performance was assessed by mean absolute error (MAE) and root mean square error (RMSE) using 10-fold cross-validation.\n              \n            \n            \n              Results\n              Mixture models outperformed linear regression and response mapping. When mapping to EQ-5D-3L, the ALDVMM model was the best-performing one for France, Germany and Spain while beta regression was best for Italy. When mapping to EQ-5D-5L, the ALDVMM model also demonstrated the best predictive performance. Generally, models using KDQOL-36 subscale scores showed better fit than using the KDCS.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This study adds to the growing literature suggesting the better performance of the mixture models in modelling EQ-5D and produces algorithms to map the KDQOL-36 onto EQ-5D-3L (for France, Germany, Italy, and Spain) and EQ-5D-5L (for Singapore).",

      "abstract": "Background: Approximately 20% of women suffer from postpartum depression (PPD). Due to barriers such as limited access to care, half of the women with PPD do not receive treatment. Therefore, it is critical to identify effective and scalable interventions. Traditional mindfulness programs have been effective in reducing depressive symptoms, however access remains a barrier. A self-paced mobile health (mHealth) mindfulness program may fit the lifestyle of busy mothers who are unable to attend in-person classes. However, little is known regarding the feasibility or efficacy of mHealth mindfulness interventions in postpartum women with depressive symptoms.\nObjective: This study aims to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of an mHealth mindfulness intervention for postpartum women with moderate to moderately severe depressive symptoms.\nMethods: We conducted a single-arm feasibility trial of an mHealth mindfulness intervention within Kaiser Permanente Northern California (KPNC), a large integrated health care system. Participants were identified through clinician referral and electronic health records via KPNC's universal perinatal depression screening program and recruited by the study team. Inclusion criteria included the following: English-speaking, up to 6 months postpartum with a Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) score of 10 to 19, and no regular mindfulness/meditation practice. Participants were asked to use a mindfulness app, Headspace, 10 to 20 min/day for 6 weeks. Baseline and postintervention surveys captured data on patient-reported outcomes (depression and stress symptoms, sleep quality, and mindfulness). Semistructured interviews captured acceptability. Retention and adherence were used to assess feasibility.\nResults: Of the 115 women who were contacted and met the eligibility criteria or declined participation before eligibility assessment, 27 (23%) were enrolled. In addition, 70% (19/27) completed the study. The mean age of participants was 31 years (SD 5.2), 30% (8/27) were non-Hispanic White, and, on average, participants were 12.3 weeks postpartum (SD 5.7). Of the women who completed the study, 100% (19/19) used the Headspace app at least once, and nearly half (9/19, 47%) used the app on ≥50% of the days during the 6-week intervention period. Of the 16 participants who completed the postintervention interview, 69% (11/16) reported that they were very or extremely satisfied with the app. Interviews indicated that women appreciated the variety of meditations and felt that the program led to reduced anxiety and improved sleep. Significant improvements in pre- and postintervention scores were observed for depressive symptoms (PHQ-8: −3.8, P=.004), perceived stress (10-item Perceived Stress Scale: −6.0, P=.005), and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index: −2.1, P=.02, indicating less sleep disturbance). Improvements in mindfulness were also significant (Five Facet Mindfulness Questionnaire-Short Form: 10.9, P=.01).\nConclusions: An mHealth mindfulness intervention for postpartum women with moderate to moderately severe depressive symptoms is feasible and acceptable. An efficacy trial is warranted.",

      "abstract": "Background: The global prevalence of diabetes has been increasing over the past 30 years, leading to a rise in complications; diabetes is the leading cause of amputations, blindness, and kidney failure in developed countries. Diabetes self-management is challenging due to the complex lifestyle changes required. Social support from family and friends plays a crucial role in overcoming barriers to healthy behavior choices. Integrating Internet and communication technologies with social support interventions has the potential to improve diabetes self-management.\nMethods: A scoping review was conducted by searching PubMed, Ovid, Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library databases for studies combining diabetes, Internet and communication technologies, and social support interventions. Inclusion criteria focused on adult patients with diabetes and primarily Internet and communication technologies-based strategies to initiate and enhance social support. Data abstraction included study population, design, outcomes, social support domains emphasized, support relationship intervention strategy, and Internet and communication technologies modality.\nResults: The review identified 39 articles and 33 unique studies representing 27 unique interventions utilizing peer web forums, interactive voice recordings, messaging-based interventions (including Short Message Service and instant messaging), and email as Internet and communication technologies modalities. Various outcomes were reported, including improvements in perception of social support, psychosocial wellbeing, behavior changes, and clinical outcomes. Existing support relationships may be more effective in promoting behavior change and clinical outcomes compared to developing new relationships. Studies that explicitly measured patients’ perception of support consistently showed improvements in psycho-social, behavioral, and clinical outcomes.\nConclusions: This scoping review highlights the pivotal role of social support in diabetes selfmanagement. By integrating Internet and communication technologies into interventions, diverse modalities such as web forums and text messaging have shown promise in enhancing patients’ perception of support and improving psychosocial well-being, behavior changes, and clinical outcomes. The emphasis on leveraging existing support relationships, rather than establishing new ones, underscores the effectiveness of personalized, patient-centered approaches. These findings provide essential insights for healthcare strategies, emphasizing the need to harness technology and existing social networks to empower individuals in managing diabetes effectively.",

      "abstract": "Background: People with chronic diseases can benefit from wearable devices in managing their health and encouraging healthy lifestyle habits. Wearables such as activity trackers or blood glucose monitoring devices can lead to positive health impacts, including improved physical activity adherence or better management of type 2 diabetes. Few literature reviews have focused on the intersection of various chronic diseases, the wearable devices used, and the outcomes evaluated in intervention studies, particularly in the context of primary health care.\nObjective: This study aims to identify and describe (1) the chronic diseases represented in intervention studies, (2) the types or combinations of wearables used, and (3) the health or health care outcomes assessed and measured.\nMethods: We conducted a scoping review following the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines, searching the MEDLINE and Web of Science databases for studies published between 2012 and 2022. Pairs of reviewers independently screened titles and abstracts, applied the selection criteria, and performed full-text screening. We included interventions using wearables that automatically collected and transmitted data to adult populations with at least one chronic disease. We excluded studies with participants with only a predisposition to develop a chronic disease, hospitalized patients, patients with acute diseases, patients with active cancer, and cancer survivors. We included randomized controlled trials and cohort, pretest-posttest, observational, mixed methods, and qualitative studies.\nResults: After the removal of 1987 duplicates, we screened 4540 titles and abstracts. Of the remaining 304 articles after exclusions, we excluded 215 (70.7%) full texts and included 89 (29.3%). Of these 89 texts, 10 (11%) were related to the same interventions as those in the included studies, resulting in 79 studies being included. We structured the results according to chronic disease clusters: (1) diabetes, (2) heart failure, (3) other cardiovascular conditions, (4) hypertension, (5) multimorbidity and other combinations of chronic conditions, (6) chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, (7) chronic pain, (8) musculoskeletal conditions, and (9) asthma. Diabetes was the most frequent health condition (18/79, 23% of the studies), and wearable activity trackers were the most used (42/79, 53% of the studies). In the 79 included studies, 74 clinical, 73 behavioral, 36 patient technology experience, 28 health care system, and 25 holistic or biopsychosocial outcomes were reported.\nConclusions: This scoping review provides an overview of the wearable devices used in chronic disease self-management intervention studies, revealing disparities in both the range of chronic diseases studied and the variety of wearable devices used.",

      "abstract": "Those suffering with serious mental illness (SMI), such as psychotic disorders, experience life expectancy 15 years shorter than the general population. Cardiovascular disease is the biggest cause of death in those with psychotic disease and many risk factors may be limited by healthy lifestyle choices. Text messaging interventions represent mobile health (mHealth), a nascent way to deliver physical health care to those suffering with a psychotic disorder. This paper aims to review the literature on the feasibility of text messaging to support the delivery of physical health care in those with a psychotic disorder. A thorough electronic database literature review of Medline via Ovid, Embase, APA Psycinfo, Scopus, Cochrane and Web of Science was conducted. Articles were included if text messaging was used as an intervention targeting the physical health of patients with psychotic disorders. A final sample of 11 articles satisfied the eligibility criteria, of which, 3 were ongoing randomised controlled trials. Of the 8 completed trials, all demonstrated the promising feasibility of text messaging, assessed via quotes, conversation samples, response rates, questionnaires or directly based on physical results. 36% of studies analysed those with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder, 55% with SMI and 9% with schizophrenia and psychotic disorders, mood disorders or anxiety disorders. Text messaging was used as motivation or reminders (91%), service delivery (27%) or social support (27%) with studies targeting multiple themes simultaneously. This review highlights compelling evidence for the feasibility of text messaging for improvement of physical health in those suffering with psychotic disorders.",

Given the increased uptake of technology in recent years, eHealth interventions may be a convenient and accessible method for supportive care. Within this context, we conducted a systematic review to describe and quantify the use of eHealth for breast cancer supportive care. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases for primary research studies published from 2016 to 2021 (present) that assessed the effects of eHealth interventions on adult patients with breast cancer. We explored the effects of the interventions on patient symptoms, lifestyle, satisfaction, and barriers, as well as factors related to feasibility and implementation. The risk of bias of each study was also assessed. Findings were presented according to stage of cancer care. We identified 43 relevant studies capturing n = 6,285 patients (30 randomized controlled trials and 13 non-randomized interventional studies); 5 evaluated patients who were newly diagnosed, 16 evaluated patients undergoing active treatment, and 22 evaluated patients in post-treatment follow-up. A total of 19 studies used mobile apps, 18 used online patient portals, 5 used text messaging, and 1 used both a patient portal and text messaging. We found that patients were broadly satisfied with the eHealth interventions; however, findings were less consistent for symptom and lifestyle-related outcomes. Eight studies were judged as high risk of bias. There was substantial between-study heterogeneity, which made it challenging to discern consistent trends. Overall, future research should continue to explore the use of eHealth for breast cancer supportive care, with a focus on improving patient symptoms.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Digital technology has influenced many aspects of modern living, including health care. In the context of elective surgeries, there is a strong association between preoperative physical and psychological preparedness, and improved postoperative outcomes. Health behavior changes made in the pre- and postoperative periods can be fundamental in determining the outcomes and success of elective surgeries. Understanding the potential unmet needs of patients undergoing elective surgery is central to motivating health behavior change. Integrating digital and mobile health technologies within the elective surgical pathway could be a strategy to remotely deliver this support to patients.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This meta-ethnographic systematic review explores digital interventions supporting patients undergoing elective surgery with health behavior changes, specifically physical activity, weight loss, dietary intake, and psychological support.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A literature search was conducted in October 2019 across 6 electronic databases (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews [PROSPERO]: CRD42020157813). Qualitative studies were included if they evaluated the use of digital technologies supporting behavior change in adult patients undergoing elective surgery during the pre- or postoperative period. Study quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool. A meta-ethnographic approach was used to synthesize existing qualitative data, using the 7 phases of meta-ethnography by Noblit and Hare. Using this approach, along with reciprocal translation, enabled the development of 4 themes from the data.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 18 studies were included covering bariatric (n=2, 11%), cancer (n=13, 72%), and orthopedic (n=3, 17%) surgeries. The 4 overarching themes appear to be key in understanding and determining the effectiveness of digital and mobile interventions to support surgical patients. To successfully motivate health behavior change, technologies should provide motivation and support, enable patient engagement, facilitate peer networking, and meet individualized patient needs. Self-regulatory features such as goal setting heightened patient motivation. The personalization of difficulty levels in virtual reality–based rehabilitation was positively received. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy reduced depression and distress in patients undergoing cancer surgery. Peer networking provided emotional support beyond that of patient-provider relationships, improving quality of life and care satisfaction. Patients expressed the desire for digital interventions to be individually tailored according to their physical and psychological needs, before and after surgery.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              These findings have the potential to influence the future design of patient-centered digital and mobile health technologies and demonstrate a multipurpose role for digital technologies in the elective surgical pathway by motivating health behavior change and offering psychological support. Through the synthesis of patient suggestions, we highlight areas for digital technology optimization and emphasize the importance of content tailored to suit individual patients and surgical procedures. There is a significant rationale for involving patients in the cocreation of digital health technologies to enhance engagement, better support behavior change, and improve surgical outcomes.",

However, the design and development process of these apps are rarely presented.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              We present the design and development of a smartphone-based lifestyle app integrating a wearable device for hypertension management.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We used an intervention mapping approach for the development of theory- and evidence-based intervention in hypertension management. This consisted of six fundamental steps: needs assessment, matrices, theoretical methods and practical strategies, program design, adoption and implementation plan, and evaluation plan. To design the contents of the intervention, we performed a literature review to determine the preferences of people with hypertension (Step 1) and necessary objectives toward the promotion of self-management behaviors (Step 2). Based on these findings, we implemented theoretical and practical strategies in consultation with stakeholders and researchers (Steps 3), which was used to identify the functionality and develop an mHealth app (Step 4). The adoption (Step 5) and evaluation (Step 6) of the mHealth app will be conducted in a future study.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Through the needs analysis, we identified that people with hypertension preferred having education, medication or treatment adherence, lifestyle modification, alcohol and smoking cessation and blood pressure monitoring support. We utilized MoSCoW analysis to consider four key elements, i.e., education, medication or treatment adherence, lifestyle modification and blood pressure support based on past experiences, and its potential benefits in hypertension management. Theoretical models such as (i) the information, motivation, and behavior skills model, and (ii) the patient health engagement model was implemented in the intervention development to ensure positive engagement and health behavior. Our app provides health education to people with hypertension related to their condition, while utilizing wearable devices to promote lifestyle modification and blood pressure management. The app also contains a clinician portal with rules and medication lists titrated by the clinician to ensure treatment adherence, with regular push notifications to prompt behavioral change. In addition, the app data can be reviewed by patients and clinicians as needed.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This is the first study describing the design and development of an app that integrates a wearable blood pressure device and provides lifestyle support and hypertension management. Our theory-driven intervention for hypertension management is founded on the critical needs of people with hypertension to ensure treatment adherence and supports medication review and titration by clinicians. The intervention will be clinically evaluated in future studies to determine its effectiveness and usability.",

We performed a random-effects meta-analysis to pool the effects of digital versus nondigital interventions on body composition, blood pressure, blood glucose, and lipid concentrations. We also conducted subgroup analyses based on intervention duration, risk of bias, and intervention types. We reported outcomes as mean differences with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We assessed the quality of the included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool.\nResults: We included 34 randomized controlled trials with 17 389 participants. The meta-analysis found no significant differences between digital and nondigital behavioral interventions for 11 cardiovascular risk factors. However, subgroup analyses showed that digital dietary interventions significantly reduced body weight (MD = −0.66, 95% CI [−1.26, −0.06]), body mass index—BMI (MD = −0.25, 95% CI [−0.43, −0.07]), and fasting blood glucose (MD = −0.31, 95% CI [−0.57, −0.05]) compared to nondigital interventions. Digital physical activity interventions lowered total cholesterol (MD = −3.55, 95% CI [−4.63, −2.46]) compared to nondigital interventions. Combined digital interventions (dietary, physical activity, and smoking cessation) significantly decreased BMI (MD = −0.20, 95% CI [−0.36, −0.04]) compared to nondigital interventions. No significant differences were found by risk of bias or intervention duration.\nConclusions: Digital behavioral interventions are as effective as nondigital interventions in reducing cardiovascular risk factors, making both essential components of cardiovascular disease prevention and management.",

      "abstract": "Background: Mobile health (mHealth) prompts (e.g., text messaging, push notifications) are a commonly used technique within behaviour change interventions to prompt or cue a specific behaviour. Such prompts are being increasingly integrated into diabetes prevention programs (DPPs). While mHealth prompts provide a convenient and cost-effective way to reinforce behaviour change, no reviews to date have examined mHealth prompt use within DPPs. This scoping review aims to: (I) understand how mHealth prompts are being used within behaviour change interventions for individuals at risk for developing type 2 diabetes (T2D); and (II) provide recommendations for future mHealth prompt research, design, and application.\nMethods: The scoping review methodology outlined by Arksey and O’Malley were followed. Medline, CINAHL, PsycInfo, Web of Science, and SportDiscus were searched. The search strategy combined keywords relating to T2D risk and mHealth prompts in conjunction with database-controlled vocabulary when available (e.g., MeSH for Medline).\nResults: Of the 4,325 publications screened, 44 publications (based on 33 studies) met the inclusion criteria and were included for data extraction. Text messaging was the most widely used mHealth prompt (73%) followed by push notifications (21%). Only 30% of studies discussed the theoretical basis for prompt content and time of day messages were sent, and only 27% provided justification for prompt timing and frequency. Fourteen studies assessed participant satisfaction with mHealth prompts of which only two reported dissatisfaction due to either prompting frequency (hourly) or message content (solely focused on weight). Nine studies assessed behavioural outcomes including weight loss, physical activity, and diabetes incidence, and found mixed effects overall.\nConclusions: While mHealth prompts were well-received by participants, there are mixed effects on the influence of mHealth prompts on behavioural outcomes and diabetes incidence. More thorough reporting of prompt content development and delivery is needed, and more experimental research is needed to identify optimal content, delivery characteristics, and impact on behavioural and clinical outcomes.",

To assess the quality of evidence, the Conﬁdence In Network Meta-Analysis (CINeMA) approach, grounded in the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation framework, was employed. A Bayesian network meta-analysis was conducted to synthesize the comparative effectiveness of treatment modalities based on GWG outcomes.\nResults: The analysis incorporated 60 randomized controlled trials, encompassing 16,615 participants. Modes of intervention administration were classiﬁed as remote (R: eHealth [e] and mHealth [m]), in-person (I), and a combination of both (IþR). The interventions comprised 5 categories: education (E), physical activity (PA), dietary (D), behavior modiﬁcation (B), and combinations thereof. The quality of the evidence, as evaluated by CINeMA, ranged from very low to high. Compared to the control group, the I-D intervention (mean difference [MD]: 1.27; 95% conﬁdence interval [CI]: 2.23, 0.32), I-PADB (MD: 0.60, 95% CI: 1.19, 0.00), and I-B (MD: 0.34, 95% CI: 0.57, 0.10) interventions showed signiﬁcant efﬁcacy in reducing GWG.\nConclusions: Preliminary ﬁndings suggest that the I-D intervention is the most efﬁcacious in managing GWG among pregnant women who are overweight or obese, followed by I-PADB and I-BþR-B(m) treatments. These conclusions are drawn from evidence of limited quality and directness, including insufﬁcient data on PA components used in the interventions. Owing to the absence of robust, direct evidence delineating signiﬁcant differences among various GWG management strategies, it is tentatively proposed that the I-D intervention is likely the most effective approach.",

Digital health interventions (DHIs) that promote self-management, adherence to guideline-directed therapy, and cardiovascular risk reduction may improve health outcomes in this population. The “Corrie” DHI consists of a smartphone application, smartwatch, and wireless blood pressure monitor to support medication tracking, education, vital signs monitoring, and care coordination. We aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of this DHI plus standard of care in reducing 30-day readmissions among AMI patients in comparison to standard of care alone.\n            \n            \n              Methods:\n              A Markov model was used to explore cost-effectiveness from the hospital perspective. The time horizon of the analysis was 1 year, with 30-day cycles, using inflation-adjusted cost data with no discount rate. Currencies were quantified in US dollars, and effectiveness was measured in quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs). The results were interpreted as an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio at a threshold of $100,000 per QALY. Univariate sensitivity and multivariate probabilistic sensitivity analyses tested model uncertainty.\n            \n            \n              Results:\n              The DHI reduced costs and increased QALYs on average, dominating standard of care in 99.7% of simulations in the probabilistic analysis. Based on the assumption that the DHI costs $2750 per patient, use of the DHI leads to a cost-savings of $7274 per patient compared with standard of care alone.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions:\n              Our results demonstrate that this DHI is cost-saving through the reduction of risk for all-cause readmission following AMI. DHIs that promote improved adherence with guideline-based health care can reduce hospital readmissions and associated costs.",

      "abstract": "Background: The maintenance of a healthy lifestyle significantly influences pregnancy outcomes. Certain pregnant women are more at risk of engaging in unhealthy behaviors due to factors such as having a low socioeconomic position and low social capital. eHealth interventions tailored to pregnant women affected by these vulnerability factors can provide support and motivation for healthier choices. However, there is still a lack of insight into how interventions for this target group are best designed, used, and implemented and how vulnerable pregnant women are best reached.\nObjective: This review aimed to identify the strategies used in the design, reach, use, and implementation phases of eHealth lifestyle interventions for vulnerable pregnant women; assess whether these strategies acted as facilitators; and identify barriers that were encountered.\nMethods: We conducted a search on MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Google Scholar for studies that described an eHealth intervention for vulnerable pregnant women focusing on at least one lifestyle component (diet, physical activity, alcohol consumption, smoking, stress, or sleep) and provided information on the design, reach, use, or implementation of the intervention.\nResults: The literature search identified 3904 records, of which 29 (0.74%) met our inclusion criteria. These 29 articles described 20 eHealth lifestyle interventions, which were primarily delivered through apps and frequently targeted multiple lifestyle components simultaneously. Barriers identified in the design and use phases included financial aspects (eg, budgetary constraints) and technological challenges for the target group (eg, limited internet connectivity). In addition, barriers were encountered in reaching vulnerable pregnant women, including a lack of interest and time constraints among eligible participants and limited support from health care providers. Facilitators identified in the design and use phases included collaborating with the target group and other stakeholders (eg, health care providers), leveraging existing eHealth platforms for modifications or extensions, and adhering to clinical and best practice guidelines and behavior change frameworks. Furthermore, tailoring (eg, matching the content of the intervention to the target groups’ norms and values) and the use of incentives (eg, payments for abstaining from unhealthy behavior) were identified as potential facilitators to eHealth use. Facilitators in the interventions’ reach and implementation phases included stakeholder collaboration and a low workload for the intervention deliverers involved in these phases.\nConclusions: This scoping review offers a comprehensive overview of strategies used in different phases of eHealth lifestyle interventions for vulnerable pregnant women, highlighting specific barriers and facilitators. Limited reporting on the impact of the strategies used and barriers encountered hinders a complete identification of facilitators and barriers. Nevertheless, this review",

      "abstract": "Background: Self-monitoring of behavior can support lifestyle modifications; however, we do not know whether such interventions are effective in supporting positive changes in hypertension-related health behaviors and thus in reducing blood pressure in patients treated for hypertension.\nObjective: This systematic literature review evaluates the extent to which smartphone app–based self-monitoring of health behavior supports reductions in blood pressure and changes in hypertension-related behaviors. It also explores the behavioral components that might explain intervention effectiveness.\nMethods: A systematic search of 7 databases was conducted in August 2021. Article screening, study and intervention coding, and data extraction were completed independently by reviewers. The search strategy was developed using keywords from previous reviews and relevant literature. Trials involving adults, published after the year 2000, and in the English language were considered for inclusion. The random-effects meta-analysis method was used to account for the distribution of the effect across the studies.\nResults: We identified 4638 articles, of which 227 were included for full-text screening. A total of 15 randomized controlled trials were included in the review. In total, 7415 patients with hypertension were included in the meta-analysis. The results indicate that app-based behavioral self-monitoring interventions had a small but significant effect in reducing systolic blood pressure (SBP), on average, by 1.64 mmHg (95% CI 2.73-0.55, n=7301; odds ratio [OR] 1.60, 95% CI 0.74-3.42, n=114) and in improving changes in medication adherence behavior (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.78, 95% CI 0.22-1.34) compared to usual care or minimal intervention. The review found the intervention had a small effect on supporting improvements in healthy diet by changing habits related to high sodium food (SMD –0.44, 95% CI –0.79 to –0.08) and a trend, although insignificant, toward supporting smoking cessation, low alcohol consumption, and better physical activity behaviors. A subgroup analysis found that behavioral self-monitoring interventions combined with tailored advice resulted in higher and significant changes in both SBP and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in comparison to those not providing tailored advice (SBP: –2.92 mmHg, 95% CI –3.94 to –1.90, n=3102 vs –0.72 mmHg, 95% CI –1.67 to 0.23, n=4199, χ2=9.65, P=.002; DBP: –2.05 mmHg, 95% CI –3.10 to –1.01, n=968 vs 1.54 mmHg, 95% CI –0.53 to 3.61, n=400, χ2=9.19, P=.002).\nConclusions: Self-monitoring of hypertension-related behaviors via smartphone apps combined with tailored advice has a modest but potentially clinically significant effect on blood pressure reduction. Future studies could use rigorous methods to explore its effects on supporting changes in both blood pressure and hypertension-related health behaviors to inform recommendations for policy making and service provision.",

These burgeoning technologies can and will profoundly alter the way lifestyle, health, wellness, and chronic diseases are managed in the future. For those pursuing the potential of such digital technologies in the creation of a compelling and effective connected healthcare experience, a number of new concepts have surfaced. We have taken these concepts (many of which originate in engineering) and extended them so they can be incorporated into managing health risk and health conditions via a blended digital health experience. For example, the advent of mobile technology for health has given rise to concepts, such as ecological momentary assessment and ecological momentary intervention that assess the person’s (digital twin) status and delivers interventions as needed, when needed—perhaps even preemptively. For such concepts to be fully realized, the experience design of mobile health (mHealth) program(s) (aka connected care) should and now can actually guide end users through a series of self-experiments directed by data-driven feedback from a version of their digital twin. As treatment development and testing move toward the precision of individual differences inherent in every person and every treatment response (or non-response), group data and more recent big data approaches for generating new knowledge offer limited help to end users (including practitioners) for helping individuals evaluate their own digital twin–generated data and change over time under different conditions. This is the renaissance of N-of-1 or individual science. N-of-1 evaluation creates the opportunity to evaluate each individual uniquely. The rigor and logic of N-of-1 designs have been well articulated and expanded upon for over a half century. For the clinician, this revitalized form of scientiﬁc and behavioral interaction evaluation can help validate or reject the impact a given treatment has for a given patient with increased efﬁciency and accuracy. Further, N-of-1 can incorporate biological (genomic), behavioral, psychological, and digital health data such that users themselves can begin to evaluate the relationships of their own treatment response patterns and the contingencies that impact them. Thus, emerges the self-scientist.",

      "abstract": "Background:\n              Sedentary behavior (SB) negatively impact health and is highly prevalent in the population. Digital behavior change interventions (DBCIs) have been developed to modify behaviors such as SB by technologies. However, it is unknown which behavior change techniques (BCTs) are most frequently employed in SB as well as the effect associated with DBCIs in this field. The aim of this systematic review was: (a) to evaluate the BCT most frequently employed in digital health including all technologies available and interventions aimed at increasing physical activity (PA), reducing sedentary time, and improving adherence to exercise in the clinical population, and (b) to review the effect associated with DBCIs in this field.\n            \n            \n              Methods:\n              The database used was Medline, as well as Scopus, Scielo, and Google Scholar. For the search strategy, we considered versions of behavior/behavioral, mHealth/eHealth/telemedicine/serious game/gamification. The terms related to PA and SB were included, the criteria for inclusion were randomized clinical trials (RCTs), adults, intervention based on digital media, and outcome variable lifestyle modification; a last 5 years filter was included. Michie's Taxonomy was used to identify BCTs. The study was registered under the number PROSPERO CRD42019138681.\n            \n            \n              Results:\n              Eighteen RCTs were included in the present systematic review, 5 of them healthy adults, and 13 of them with some illness. Studies included 2298 sedentary individuals who were followed up for 5 weeks−3 years. The most used BCTs were goal setting, problem solving, review outcomes/goals, feedback on behavior and outcomes of behavior, self-monitoring of behavior, social support, information about health consequences, and behavior practice/rehearsal. The effect associated with DBCIs showed improvements, among several related to PA and physiologic self-reported and anthropometric outcomes.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion:\n              The BCTs most used in digital health to change outcomes related to SB were goals and planning, feedback and monitoring, social support, natural consequences, repetition, and substitution. Besides these findings, DBCIs are influenced by several factors like the type of intervention, patients' preferences and values, or the number of BCTs employed. More research is needed to determine with precision which DBCIs or BCTs are the most effective to reduce SB in the clinical population.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Innovative health promotion strategies are crucial for enhancing global quality of life and curbing premature deaths. Digital health promotion is particularly impactful for young individuals often using internet-connected devices. Collaborative methodologies in digital intervention research offer insights into supporting youth during key life stages, such as adolescence. This review sought to examine the literature on digital health interventions for youth co-designed via participatory frameworks.\nMethods: Following the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual and an adapted Arksey & O’Malley’s 6-stage framework, this review utilised the PRISMA-ScR checklist for structured reporting. Peer-reviewed research where young individuals (15–35 years) contributed to digital health intervention design was analysed. Systematic synthesis adhered to Braun & Clarke’s Thematic Analysis Guidelines, mapping data to research queries and thematic framework.\nResults: Eighteen articles were systematically synthesised, revealing seven main themes: digital tool, inquiry ﬁeld, report aim, participatory activities, intervention attributes and behavioural change support. Seventeen distinctive digital health interventions were assessed, mostly within risk mitigation and mental health domains. Predominantly, interventions were web-based, with mental wellness websites emerging as the prevalent tool. User experience testing stood out as the primary reported outcome.\nConclusion: Several innovative digital health interventions targeting youth have been identiﬁed. Platforms including social media, specialised apps, websites and video games are instrumental for health advice and clinical support dissemination, overcoming access and cost barriers. Participatory techniques are integral for the efﬁcacy of digital health resources, encompassing youth aspirations and anticipations. Continued efforts will enrich comprehension of optimal practices in digital health promotion and intervention formulation.",

      "abstract": "Digital therapeutics (DTx) represent an innovative approach to healthcare, leveraging software applications (apps) delivered through digital devices to treat medical conditions. This review focuses on three DTx apps approved in Japan, targeting nicotine dependence, hypertension, and insomnia. CureApp SC, the DTx system for nicotine dependence, comprises a patient smartphone app, an Internet of Things device for exhaled carbon monoxide measurement, and a Web-based physician app. A clinical trial demonstrated signiﬁcantly higher rates of continuous abstinence in the intervention group than in the controls (63.9 % vs. 50.5 %, p = 0.001) at 24 weeks, with effects persisting through 52 weeks. For hypertension management, CureApp HT focuses on lifestyle modiﬁcations with daily home blood pressure monitoring. The HERB-DH1 trial showed a signiﬁcant reduction in 24-h systolic blood pressure (between-group difference, −2.4 mmHg; p = 0.024) and morning home blood pressure (between-group difference, −4.3 mmHg; p < 0.001) in the intervention group compared with those in the controls. This hypertension DTx app also exhibits potential lifetime cost-effectiveness. Regarding insomnia management, SUSMED MedCBT-i supports physician-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia. In a randomized controlled trial, Athens Insomnia Scale scores signiﬁcantly improved in the intervention group compared with those in the controls (between-group difference, −3.4 point; p < 0.001) at 8 weeks. These DTx apps represent a signiﬁcant advancement in managing chronic conditions, offering scalable and accessible methods for delivering evidence-based interventions. They also address the challenges in implementing lifestyle modiﬁcations and behavioral therapies in traditional healthcare settings. As DTx become more integrated into routine clinical practice, ongoing research is crucial to evaluate their long-term efﬁcacy, safety, and cost-effectiveness. The success of these initial DTx apps in Japan paves the way for more comprehensive digital health solutions, potentially improving individual patient outcomes and contributing to larger-scale public health improvements in managing chronic conditions.",

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses with randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published in English from June 2016 to November 2022 were retrieved to identify recent advancements. Obesity outcomes included body weight, body mass index (BMI), BMI z-score, and fat percentage, among others. The 28 located reviews included: four studies on diet therapy; five on physical activity (exercise training); one on sedentary activities; 18 on multicomponent behavior-change lifestyle interventions, including three that incorporated gaming; three with eHealth, mobile health (mHealth), or telehealth, with one in each category; and two on motivational interviewing. Behavior-change lifestyle interventions to reduce obesity in children and adolescents were associated with moderate effects, with low-quality evidence for diet therapy and high-quality evidence for exercise training, both for weight or BMI reduction. Long-term intensive multicomponent behavioral interventions with parental involvement demonstrated better effects.",

Here, we show that eHealth lifestyle change interventions delivered through smartphones (mHealth) can facilitate significant weight loss, making mHealth an attractive adjunct to clinical obesity care. However, evidence is currently limited to short-term effects, and is also lacking with regards to effectiveness based on socioeconomic status and ethnic group. This raises concerns around the potential and inadvertent widening of obesity prevalence disparities between groups as mHealth lifestyle change interventions are increasingly used in obesity care.

However, the active components of these interventions which aim to change behaviours are unclear. Aims: To identify behaviour change techniques used in smartphone app interventions for improving physical activity and sedentary behaviour in people with cardiovascular disease. Secondly, to investigate the association of the identified techniques on improving these behaviours. Methods: Six databases (Medline, CINAHL Plus, Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, Sports Discus, EMBASE) were searched from 2007 to October 2020. Eligible studies used a smartphone app intervention for people with cardiovascular disease and reported a physical activity and/or sedentary behaviour outcome. The behaviour change techniques used within the apps for physical activity and/or sedentary behaviour were coded using the Behaviour Change Technique Taxonomy (v1). The association of behaviour change techniques on physical activity outcomes were explored through meta-regression. Results: Forty behaviour change techniques were identified across the 19 included app-based interventions. Only two studies reported the behaviour change techniques used to target sedentary behaviour change. The most frequently used techniques for sedentary behaviour and physical activity were habit reversal and self-monitoring of behaviour respectively. In univariable analyses, action planning (β =0.42, 90%CrI 0.07–0.78) and graded tasks (β =0.33, 90%CrI -0.04-0.67) each had medium positive associations with increasing physical activity. Participants in interventions that used either self-monitoring outcome(s) of behaviour (i.e. outcomes other than physical activity) (β = − 0.47, 90%CrI -0.79--0.16), biofeedback (β = − 0.47, 90%CrI -0.81--0.15) and information about health consequences (β = − 0.42, 90%CrI -0.74--0.07) as behaviour change techniques, appeared to do less physical activity. In the multivariable model, these predictors were not clearly removed from zero.",

Integrating Digital Health Interventions (DHIs) with traditional audiological management has proven beneficial for hearing loss and tinnitus management. Although it is established that DHI engagement is important for the real-world effectiveness of DHIs, there is a lack of systematic evidence aiming to understand engagement with DHIs in audiology.\nPurpose: This systematic review identified factors associated with hearing healthcare DHI engagement to inform future DHI development and research in audiology.\nMethods: Adhering to Synthesis without Meta-Analysis guidelines, we conducted a mixed-methods systematic review using a convergent integrated approach. A comprehensive search across seven databases until December 16, 2023, identified 62 studies meeting inclusion criteria. Data extraction involved modifying the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) extraction form and deductive coding using the Perski et al. (2017) framework to identify factors related to engagement.\nResults: The review revealed a diverse range of factors associated with DHI engagement in the audiology literature.\nConclusion: Analysis within the Perski et al. (2017) framework highlighted the importance of user-related constructs, such as enhancing DHI accessibility, empowering users, and aligning DHIs with user needs and lifestyles in facilitating engagement. Due to the limited number of studies focusing on engagement as the primary outcome, we based our inferences on secondary outcomes and discussions from the available literature. While this review consolidates existing knowledge on engagement, it underscored the imperative for more in-depth investigations into engagement with hearing healthcare DHIs.",

      "abstract": "Background: Globally, 81% of youth do not meet the physical activity (PA) guidelines. Youth of families with a low socioeconomic position are less likely to meet the recommended PA guidelines. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions are preferred by youth over traditional in-person approaches and are in line with their media preferences. Despite the promise of mHealth interventions in promoting PA, a common challenge is to engage users in the long term or effectively. Earlier reviews highlighted the association of different design features (eg, notifications and rewards) with engagement among adults. However, little is known about which design features are important for increasing engagement among youth.\nObjective: To inform the design process of future mHealth tools, it is important to investigate the design features that can yield effective user engagement. This systematic review aimed to identify which design features are associated with engagement in mHealth PA interventions among youth who were aged between 4 and 18 years.\nMethods: A systematic search was conducted in EBSCOhost (MEDLINE, APA PsycINFO, and Psychology & Behavioral Sciences Collection) and Scopus. Qualitative and quantitative studies were included if they documented design features associated with engagement. Design features and related behavior change techniques and engagement measures were extracted. Study quality was assessed according to the Mixed Method Assessment Tool, and one-third of all screening and data extraction were double coded by a second reviewer.\nResults: Studies (n=21) showed that various features were associated with engagement, such as a clear interface, rewards, multiplayer game mode, social interaction, variety of challenges with personalized difficulty level, self-monitoring, and variety of customization options among others, including self-set goals, personalized feedback, progress, and a narrative. In contrast, various features need to be carefully considered while designing mHealth PA interventions, such as sounds, competition, instructions, notifications, virtual maps, or self-monitoring, facilitated by manual input. In addition, technical functionality can be considered as a prerequisite for engagement. Research addressing youth from low socioeconomic position families is very limited with regard to engagement in mHealth apps.\nConclusions: Mismatches between different design features in terms of target group, study design, and content translation from behavior change techniques to design features are highlighted and set up in a design guideline and future research agenda.

Digital health is now widely utilized for hypertension management, and numerous studies have assessed its effectiveness.\nObjective: The review aims to analyse the effectiveness of digital health (i.e., mobile health (mHealth), telehealth, and the combination of mHealth & telehealth) on hypertensive patients, concerning three key areas: clinical outcomes, medication adherence, and adherence to lifestyle changes, as compared to standard care.\nMethods: The review followed the PRISMA framework. Eight electronic databases were scanned for randomized control trials focusing on the effects of mHealth or telehealth on hypertensive patients, published between 2010 and 2023. All processes were conducted by the first two authors independently. A meta-analysis was conducted for quantitative data, while a narrative synthesis was conducted for qualitative data.\nResults: In total, 74 studies involving 92 686 participants were identified. The meta-analysis favoured the interventions, revealing a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure for mHealth, telehealth and mHealth & telehealth groups. Nevertheless, medication adherence showed improvement only in the mHealth group, while blood pressure control showed improvement in both mHealth and mHealth & telehealth groups, and BMI showed improvement only in the mHealth group. Evidence for adherence to physical activity and DASH diet/salt intake remained inconclusive.\nConclusion: In general, mHealth and telehealth have demonstrated their merits in improving the clinical outcomes of hypertensive patients.",

      "abstract": "Smartphone apps might represent an opportunity to promote adherence to the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet). This study aimed to evaluate the quality of commercially available apps for the MedDiet and the presence of behavioural change techniques (BCTs) used by these apps. A systematic search was conducted on the Apple App and Google Play stores in November 2021. Apps were included if they provided information on the MedDiet or if their objective was to promote a healthy lifestyle through adherence to the MedDiet. Eligible apps were independently evaluated by two reviewers with regard to their quality (engagement, functionality, aesthetics and information quality) using the 5-point Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS; with higher scores indicating higher quality), and the presence of BCTs using an established 26-item BCT taxonomy. Of the 55 analysed apps, 52 (94.5%) were free, 50 (90.9%) provided recipe ideas, 29 (52.7%) provided meal plans, and 22 (40%) provided information on the health beneﬁts of the MedDiet. The overall quality mean MARS score was 2.84 (standard deviation (SD) = 0.42), with functionality being the highest scored MARS domain (mean = 3.58, SD = 0.44) and engagement the lowest (mean = 2.29, SD = 0.61). The average number of BCTs in the analysed apps was 2.3 (SD = 1.4; range: 0–6 per app). The number of BCTs was positively correlated with app information quality (rrho = 0.269, p = 0.047), overall MARS score (rrho = 0.267, p = 0.049), app subjective quality (rrho = 0.326, p = 0.015) and app-speciﬁc quality (rrho = 0.351, p = 0.009). These ﬁndings suggest that currently available apps might provide information on the MedDiet, but the incorporation of more BCTs is warranted to maximise the potential for behaviour change towards the MedDiet.",

      "abstract": "Background: Side effects of breast cancer treatment may persist long into survivorship, reducing quality of life (QOL) in patients with breast cancer and survivors. There is growing evidence for the use of digital health technologies, such as mobile apps, to support self-management, decrease symptom burden, and improve QOL in patients with cancer. However, an updated overview of the effects of mobile apps on QOL and well-being in patients with breast cancer and survivors is needed.\nObjective: The aim of this review was to provide an overview of breast cancer–specific, mobile app–driven lifestyle or behavioral interventions in patient care through to survivorship and their impact on QOL and mental well-being.\nMethods: A systematic search of PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science was conducted to identify relevant studies. The inclusion criteria were limited to original studies involving a trial of a mobile app–driven lifestyle or behavioral intervention for patients with breast cancer or survivors and using QOL or well-being measures. The results of the studies that met the inclusion criterion were then synthesized in text and table format. The quality of the evidence was assessed with the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool.\nResults: A total of 17 studies with the number of participants ranging from 23 to 356 met the inclusion criterion. Of the 17 reviewed studies, 7 (41%) delivered an app-only intervention, and 10 (59%) combined an app with additional supporting materials, such as SMS text messaging, telecoaching, wearables, or printed materials. Among the 17 reviewed studies, 6 (35%) focused on aiding patients with breast cancer during the active treatment phase (excluding ongoing hormone therapy), whereas the remaining 11 (65%) focused on survivorship. The majority of the studies (14/17, 82%) observed some positive effects on QOL or well-being measures.\nConclusions: The results of the review indicate that mobile apps are a promising avenue for improving QOL and well-being in breast cancer care. Positive effects were observed in patients undergoing active treatment in all reviewed studies, but effects were less clear after chemotherapy and in long-term survivors. Although lifestyle and behavioral digital interventions are still being developed, and further research should still be pursued, the available data suggest that current mobile health apps aid patients with breast cancer and survivors.",

      "abstract": "Cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors, morbidity, and mortality among people of African descent (PAD) appear to be higher than in the general population. While it has been found that lifestyle changes can prevent around 90% of CVDs, implementing an effective lifestyle programme is expensive and time-consuming. It has been demonstrated that Internet-based interventions (IbIs) can effectively and inexpensively encourage lifestyle modiﬁcations to prevent and manage chronic diseases. Although a number of studies have examined the effectiveness of IbIs in the general population, no comprehensive study of the usefulness and acceptability of IbIs among PAD has been conducted. This is the knowledge gap that this study aimed to address. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science to identify eligible studies published from inception to February 2022. Thirteen articles met our criteria for inclusion. Our textual narrative synthesis produced inconsistent results; nonetheless, high acceptability of IbIs and a considerable improvement in clinical and behavioural outcomes associated with CVDs were reported in several trials. The ﬁndings of this review are constrained by clinical, methodological and statistical variability among the studies. To have a good grasp on the effect of IbIs on behaviour change in PAD at risk of CVDs, large-scale longitudinal studies with long-term follow-up are required.",

      "abstract": "Background: Studies have shown the effectiveness and user acceptance of mobile health (mHealth) technologies in managing patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However, incorporating mHealth technology into the standard care of patients with CKD still faces many challenges. To our knowledge, there are no reviews on mHealth interventions and their assessments concerning the management of patients undergoing dialysis.\nObjective: This study provided a scoping review on existing apps and interventions of mHealth technologies in adult patients undergoing chronic dialysis and identified the gaps in patient outcome assessment of mHealth technologies in the literature.\nMethods: We systematically searched PubMed (MEDLINE), Scopus, and the Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature databases, as well as gray literature sources. Two keywords, “mHealth” and “dialysis,” were combined to address the main concepts of the objectives. Inclusion criteria were as follows: (1) mHealth interventions, which are on a smartphone, tablet, or web-based portals that are accessible through mobile devices; and (2) adult patients (age ≥18 years) on chronic dialysis. Only English papers published from January 2008 to October 2018 were included. Studies with mHealth apps for other chronic conditions, based on e-consultation or videoconferencing, non-English publications, and review papers were excluded.\nResults: Of the 1054 papers identified, 22 met the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Most studies (n=20) were randomized controlled trials and cohort studies. These studies were carried out in 7 countries. The main purposes of these mHealth interventions were as follows: nutrition or dietary self-monitoring (n=7), remote biometric monitoring (n=7), web-based portal (n=4), self-monitoring of in-session dialysis-specific information (n=3), and self-monitoring of lifestyle or behavioral change (n=1). The outcomes of the 22 included studies were organized into five categories: (1) patient satisfaction and acceptance, (2) clinical effectiveness, (3) economic assessment, (4) health-related quality of life, and (5) impact on lifestyle or behavioral change. The mHealth interventions showed neutral to positive results in chronic dialysis patient management, reporting no to significant improvement of dialysis-specific measurements and some components of the overall quality of life assessment. Evaluation of these mHealth interventions consistently demonstrated evidence in patients’ satisfaction, high level of user acceptance, and reduced use of health resources and cost savings to health care services. However, there is a lack of studies evaluating safety, organizational, sociocultural, ethical, and legal aspects of mHealth technologies. Furthermore, a comprehensive cost-effectiveness and cost-benefit analysis of adopting mHealth technologies was not found in the literature.\nConclusions: The gaps identified in this study will inform the creation of health policies and organizational support for mHealth implementation in patients undergoing dialysis. The findings of this review will inform the development of a comprehensive service model that utilizes mHealth technologies for home monitoring and self-management of patients undergoing chronic dialysis.",

      "abstract": "Health behavior interventions are effective for many modifiable lifestyle behaviors. In some cases, remotely-delivered behavioral interventions, particularly those that include some form of contact with a clinician and strong behavioral strategies, have been shown to be as effective as traditional in-person interventions; they are also more flexible, disseminable, and cost-effective. With ubiquitous increases in mobile phone use, opportunities for remote delivery of health interventions (mHealth) have grown exponentially, particularly in the use of behavioral smartphone applications. Despite research suggesting that mHealth interventions can be effective at initiating and maintaining behavior changes, many mHealth interventions are not theoretically-based, and evidence-based behavioral strategies are not often adapted into the mobile format. Thus, there is a need for clear summaries of behavioral change theories and examples of theoretically driven behavioral strategies to unify and improve the field of mHealth. The authors review the existing literature on theories of behavior change, intervention, and systems for evaluating theoretical content. Specifically, the authors briefly summarize both traditional and contemporary theories of behavior change, evidencebased behavioral strategies, and the methods for evaluating the degree to which they are included in existing mHealth behavioral interventions, with an emphasis on weight loss, dietary, and physical activity interventions. Authors also include examples of integration of theory into both research and clinical practice. This research highlights the importance of incorporation of theory into behavior change interventions. The authors suggest specific theoretical considerations for the development of mHealth interventions within collaborative, interdisciplinary environments, and recommend future research areas.",

Interventions that are easily scalable, such as lifestyle (including diet and physical activity) mobile health (mHealth) self-monitoring, may be highly valuable in the prevention and treatment of excess weight. Thus, the aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to estimate the following: (i) the eﬀect of behavioral weight management interventions using lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring on weight loss and (ii) the adherence to behavioral weight management interventions using lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring. MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Web of Science databases were systematically searched. The DerSimonian and Laird method was used to estimate the eﬀect of and adherence to behavioral weight management interventions using lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring on weight loss. Twenty studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, yielding a moderate decrease in weight and higher adherence to intervention of behavioral weight management interventions using lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring, which was greater than other interventions. Subgroup analyses showed that smartphones were the most eﬀective mHealth approach to achieve weight management and the eﬀect of behavioral weight management interventions using lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring was more pronounced when compared to usual care and in the short-term (less than six months). Furthermore, behavioral weight management interventions using lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring showed a higher adherence than: (i) recording on paper at any time and (ii) any other intervention at six and twelve months.",

Methods: We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published up to August 2021 that tested mobile health (mHealth) PA and/or dietary interventions among cancer survivors and reported on the feasibility, satisfaction, behavioral change, and/or quality of life (QOL) outcomes. Results: In total, 61 articles were identiﬁed on PubMed, and 23 of those met the inclusion criteria. The most common cancers were breast (n = 1000), prostate (n = 713), and colorectal (n = 650). Participants were predominantly White (median: 84%, interquartile range (IQR): 20%) and college-educated (58%). The interventions varied, but the most common combination of components (six studies) was a website/mobile app with an activity tracker and coaching. In terms of duration, 70% (n = 16) of the interventions lasted 12 weeks. The median total tracker wear was 87% of the study days (IQR: 6%) and the median text-message reply rate was 73% (IQR 4%). Most participants (median: 87%; IQR: 16%) were satisﬁed with at least one intervention component. Eleven out of 18 studies examining behavioral change reported signiﬁcant between-group differences and six out of 11 studies examining QoL reported signiﬁcant improvements. Conclusions: mHealth interventions are a promising approach to improving the PA and diets of cancer survivors. Research in racially/ethnically and socioeconomically diverse populations is needed.",

      "abstract": "Objective: This review aimed to examine how mobile health (mHealth) to support integrated people-centred health services has been implemented and evaluated in the World Health Organization (WHO) Western Pacific Region (WPR).\nMethods: Eight scientific databases were searched. Two independent reviewers screened the literature in title and abstract stages, followed by full-text appraisal, data extraction, and synthesis of eligible studies. Studies were extracted to capture details of the mhealth tools used, the service issues addressed, the study design, and the outcomes evaluated. We then mapped the included studies using the 20 sub-strategies of the WHO Framework on Integrated People-Centred Health Services (IPCHS); as well as with the RE-AIM (Reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation and maintenance) framework, to understand how studies implemented and evaluated interventions.\nResults: We identified 39 studies, predominantly from Australia (n = 16), China (n = 7), Malaysia (n = 4) and New Zealand (n = 4), and little from low income countries. The mHealth modalities included text messaging, voice and video communication, mobile applications and devices (point-of-care, GPS, and Bluetooth). Health issues addressed included: medication adherence, smoking cessation, cardiovascular disease, heart failure, asthma, diabetes, and lifestyle activities respectively. Almost all were community-based and focused on service issues; only half were disease-specific. mHealth facilitated integrated IPCHS by: enabling citizens and communities to bypass gatekeepers and directly access services; increasing affordability and accessibility of services; strengthening governance over the access, use, safety and quality of clinical care; enabling scheduling and navigation of services; transitioning patients and caregivers between care sectors; and enabling the evaluation of safety and quality outcomes for systemic improvement. Evaluations of mHealth interventions did not always report the underlying theories. They predominantly reported cognitive/behavioural changes rather than patient outcomes. The utility of mHealth to support and improve IPCHS was evident. However, IPCHS strategy 2 (participatory governance and accountability) was addressed least frequently. Implementation was evaluated in regard to reach (n = 30), effectiveness (n = 24); adoption (n = 5), implementation (n = 9), and maintenance (n = 1).\nConclusions: mHealth can transition disease-centred services towards people-centred services. Critical appraisal of studies highlighted methodological issues, raising doubts about validity. The limited evidence for large-scale implementation and international variation in reporting of mHealth practice, modalities used, and health domains addressed requires capacity building. Information-enhanced implementation and evaluation of IPCHS, particularly for participatory governance and accountability, is also important.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVES: The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic forced health systems to offer video and telephone visits as in-person visit alternatives. Although video visits offer some benefits compared with telephone visits, they require complex setup, which may disadvantage some patients due to the “digital divide.” Our objective was to determine patient and neighborhood characteristics associated with visit modality. STUDY DESIGN: This was a cross-sectional study across 1652 primary care and specialty care practices of adult patients at an integrated health system from April 23 to June 1, 2020.\nMETHODS: We used electronic health record and administrative data. Our primary outcome was visit modality (in-person, video, or telephone), which was captured using billing codes. We assessed predictors of using video vs telephone using multivariable logistic regression. We used hierarchical logistic regression to determine the contribution of patient-, physician-, and practice-level components of variance in the choice of video or telephone visits.\nRESULTS: We analyzed 231,596 visits by 162,102 patients. Sixty-five percent of the visits were virtual (31.7% telephone, 33.5% video). Patients who were older than 65 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0.41; 95% CI, 0.40-0.43), Black (AOR, 0.60; 95% CI, 0.57-0.63), Hispanic (AOR, 0.76; 95% CI, 0.73-0.80), Spanish-speaking (AOR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.52-0.61), and from areas with low broadband access (AOR, 0.93; 95% CI, 0.88-0.98) were less likely to use video visits. Practices (38%) and clinicians (26%) drove more of the variation in video visit use than patients (9%).\nCONCLUSIONS: Telemedicine access differences may compound disparities in chronic disease and COVID-19 outcomes. Institutions should monitor video visit use across demographics and equip patients, clinicians, and practices to promote telemedicine equity.",

Although digital health solutions are gaining traction in various chronic conditions, their cost-effectiveness in hyperthyroidism management requires deeper investigation.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a wearable or mobile-based thyroid function digital monitoring solution for hyperthyroidism management and to make a comparison with the existing standard approach within the South Korean health care context.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We developed a decision-analytic Markov microsimulation model to simulate the cost and effectiveness of digital monitoring in a cohort of 10,000 hypothetical hyperthyroidism patients aged 40 years. The analysis was conducted from the perspective of the health care system, with a 4.5% annual discount rate applied to costs and effectiveness and an inflation adjustment to 2022 values. Model inputs were sourced from clinical studies, publicly available datasets, and expert input, with outcomes measured in quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Cost-effectiveness was evaluated through incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and net monetary benefits (NMB), with additional deterministic and probabilistic sensitivity analyses performed to address input uncertainties.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Integrating digital monitoring yielded an additional 0.32 QALYs per patient at an incremental cost of US $3143, resulting in an ICER of US $9804.30 per QALY, significantly below the South Korean willingness-to-pay threshold of US $32,255/QALY. The digitally supported group exhibited improved rates of long-term remission (22.68%, 2268/10,000) and reduced postremission relapse (17.87%, 1787/10,000) compared to standard care (17.48%, 1748/10,000 and 26.37%, 2637/10,000, respectively). Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that digital intervention was the preferred cost-effective strategy in 64.4% (6440/10,000) of iterations. Subscription costs of the digital platform and the utility weight for thyroid-associated orbitopathy emerged as key factors affecting the ICER in sensitivity analyses.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The findings suggest that digital monitoring provides a cost-effective strategy for enhancing hyperthyroidism management, supporting sustained remission, and reducing relapse rates. As such, digital solutions could serve as a valuable adjunct to traditional care, with the cost-effectiveness analysis providing an economic basis for determining pricing and value-based reimbursement in health care systems.

      "abstract": "Background\n              Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is a safe, effective intervention for individuals with cardiovascular disease (CVD). However, a majority of eligible patients do not complete CR. Growing evidence suggests that home-based cardiac rehabilitation (HBCR) programs are comparable in effectiveness and safety with traditional center-based programs. More research is needed to explore different ways to deliver HBCR programs to patients with CVD.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              We aimed to assess the feasibility and impact of a digital HBCR program (RecoveryPlus.Health) that integrates both telehealth and mHealth modalities on functional exercise capacity, resting heart rate, and quality of life among adults with CVD.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              This 12-week prospective, single-arm remote clinical trial used a within-subject design. We recruited adults with CVD (aged ≥40 years) from the community with a CR-eligible diagnosis (stable angina pectoris, myocardial infarction, and heart failure) between May and August 2023. All enrolled patients referred to the RPH clinic in Roanoke, Texas, were included. The care team provided guideline-concordant CR services to study participants via two modalities: (1) a synchronous telehealth exercise training through videoconferencing; and (2) an asynchronous mobile health (mHealth) coaching app (RPH app). Baseline intake survey, electronic health record, and app log data were used to extract individual characteristics, care processes, and platform engagement data. Feasibility was measured by program completion rate and CR service use. Efficacy was measured by changes in the 6-minute walk test, resting heart rate, and quality of life (12-Item Short-Form Health Survey) before and after the 12-week program. Paired t tests were used to examine pre- and postintervention changes in the outcome variables.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              In total, 162 met the inclusion criteria and 75 (46.3%) consented and were enrolled (mean age 64, SD 10.30 years; male: n=37, 49%; White: n=46, 61%). Heart failure was the most common diagnosis (37/75, 49%). In total, 62/75 (83%) participants completed the 12-week study and used the telehealth modality with 9.63 (SD 3.33) sessions completed, and 59/75 (79%) used the mHealth modality with 10.97 (SD 11.70) sessions completed. Post intervention, 50/62 (81%) participants’ performance in the 6-minute walk test had improved, with an average improvement of 40 (SD 63.39) m (95% CI 25.6-57.1). The average 12-Item Short-Form Health Survey’s physical and mental summary scores improved by 2.7 (SD 6.47) points (95% CI 1.1-4.3) and 2.2 (SD 9.09) points (95% CI 0.1-4.5), respectively. There were no changes in resting heart rate and no exercise-related adverse events were reported.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The RecoveryPlus.Health digital HBCR program showed feasibility and efficacy in a group of nationally recruited patients with CVD. The findings add to the evidence that a telehealth and mHealth dual-modality HBCR program may be a promising approach to overcome some of the main barriers to improving CR access in the United States.\n            \n            \n              Trial Registration\n              ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05804500; https://clinicaltrials.gov/search?cond=NCT05804500",

      "abstract": "Background\n              This study aimed to analyze the rapidly evolving ecosystem of digital health applications (Digitale Gesundheitsanwendung; DiGAs) in Germany, spurred by the 2019 Digital Healthcare Act. With over 73 million people in Germany now having access to DiGAs, these prescribable digital health apps and web-based applications represent a substantial stride in health care modernization, supporting both patients and health care providers with digital solutions for disease management and care improvement.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              Through a data-driven approach, this research aimed to unpack the complexities of DiGA market dynamics, economic factors, and clinical evidence, offering insights into their impact over the past years.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              The analysis draws from a range of public data sources, including the DiGA directory, statutory health insurance reports, app store feedback, and clinical study results.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              As of July 1, 2024, there are 56 DiGAs listed by the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices (Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte), divided into 35 permanently and 21 preliminarily listed applications. Our findings reveal that a majority of DiGAs extend beyond the intended 1-year period to achieve permanent listing, reflecting the extensive effort required to demonstrate clinical efficacy. Economic analysis uncovered a dynamic pricing landscape, with initial prices ranging from approximately €200 to €700 (€1=US $1.07), averaging at a median of €514 for a 3-month DiGA prescription. Following negotiations or arbitration board decisions, prices typically see a 50% reduction, settling at a median of €221. Prescription data offer valuable insights into DiGA acceptance, with total prescriptions jumping from around 41,000 in the first period to 209,000 in the latest reporting period. The analysis of the top 15 DiGAs, representing 82% of the total prescriptions, shows that these best-performing apps receive from a minimum of 8 to a maximum of 77 daily prescriptions, with native apps and early market entrants achieving higher rates. Clinical evidence from all 35 permanently listed DiGAs indicates a uniform preference for randomized controlled trials to validate primary end points, with no noteworthy use of alternative study designs encouraged in the Digital Healthcare Act and related regulations. Moreover, all evaluated DiGAs focused on medical benefits, with health status improvement as a key end point, suggesting an underuse of patient-relevant structural and procedural improvement in demonstrating health care impact.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This study highlights the growth and challenges within the DiGA sector, suggesting areas for future research, such as the exploration of new study designs and the potential impact of patient-relevant structural and procedural improvements. For DiGA manufacturers, the strategic advantage of early market entry is emphasized. Overall, this paper underscores the evolving landscape of digital health, advocating for a nuanced understanding of digital health technology integration in Germany and beyond.",

Digital systems that monitor health remotely could be useful in reducing these visits by detecting worsening health conditions earlier. However, few studies have assessed the medico-economic impact of these systems, particularly for older people.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The objective of this study was to compare the clinical and economic impacts of an eHealth device in real life compared with the usual monitoring of older people living at home.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              This study was a comparative, retrospective, and controlled trial on data collected between May 31, 2021, and May 31, 2022, in one health care and home nursing center located in Brittany, France. Participants had to be aged >75 years, living at home, and receiving assistance from the home care service for at least 1 month. We implemented among the intervention group an eHealth system that produces an alert for a high risk of emergency department visits or hospitalizations. After each home visit, the home care aides completed a questionnaire on participants’ functional status using a smartphone app, and the information was processed in real time by a previously developed machine learning algorithm that identifies patients at risk of an emergency visit within 7 to 14 days. In the case of predicted risk, the eHealth system alerted a coordinating nurse who could then inform the family carer and the patient’s nurses or general practitioner.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 120 patients were included in the study, with 60 in the control group and 60 in the intervention group. Among the 726 visits from the intervention group that were not followed by an alert, only 4 (0.6%) resulted in hospitalizations (P<.001), confirming the relevance of the system’s alerts. Over the course of the study, 37 hospitalizations were recorded for 25 (20.8%) of the 120 patients. Additionally, of the 120 patients, 9 (7.5%) were admitted to a nursing home, and 7 (5.8%) died. Patients in the intervention group (56/60, 93%) remained at home significantly more often than those in the control group (48/60, 80%; P=.03).

      "abstract": "Background\n              There is evidence from meta-analyses and systematic reviews that digital mental health interventions for depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders tend to be cost-effective. However, no such evidence exists for guided digital mental health care in low and middle-income countries (LMICs) facing humanitarian crises, where the needs are highest. Step-by-Step (SbS), a digital mental health intervention for depression, anxiety, and stress-related disorders, proved to be effective for Lebanese citizens and war-affected Syrians residing in Lebanon. Assessing the cost-effectiveness of SbS is crucial because Lebanon’s overstretched health care system must prioritize cost-effective treatment options in the face of continuing humanitarian and economic crises.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aims to assess the cost-effectiveness of SbS in a randomized comparison with enhanced usual care (EUC).\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              The cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted alongside a pragmatic randomized controlled trial in 2 parallel groups comparing SbS (n=614) with EUC (n=635). The primary outcome was cost (in US $ for the reference year 2019) per treatment response of depressive symptoms, defined as >50% reduction of depressive symptoms measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ). The secondary outcome was cost per remission of depressive symptoms, defined as a PHQ score <5 at last follow-up (5 months post baseline). The evaluation was conducted first from the health care perspective then from the societal perspective.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Taking the health care perspective, SbS had an 80% probability to be regarded as cost-effective compared with EUC when there is a willingness to pay US $220 per additional treatment response or US $840 per additional remission. Taking the wider societal perspective, SbS had a >75% probability to be cost-saving while gaining response or remission.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              To our knowledge, this study is the first cost-effectiveness analysis based on a large randomized controlled trial (n=1249) of a guided digital mental health intervention in an LMIC. From the principal findings, 2 implications flowed, from the (1) health care perspective and (2) wider societal perspective. First, our findings suggest that SbS is associated with greater health benefits, albeit for higher costs than EUC. It is up to decision makers in health care to decide if they find the balance between additional health gains and additional health care costs acceptable. Second, as seen from the wider societal perspective, there is a substantial likelihood that SbS is not costing more than EUC but is associated with cost-savings as SBS participants become more productive, thus offsetting their health care costs. This finding may suggest to policy makers that it is in the interest of both population health and the wider Lebanese economy to implement SbS on a wide scale. In brief, SbS may offer a scalable, potentially cost-saving response to humanitarian emergencies in an LMIC.\n            \n            \n              Trial Registration\n              ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03720769; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03720769\n            \n            \n              International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID)\n              RR2-10.2196/21585",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n            Regulated mobile health applications are called digital health applications (“DiGA”) in Germany. To qualify for reimbursement by statutory health insurance companies, DiGA have to prove positive care effects in scientific studies. Since the empirical exploration of DiGA cost-effectiveness remains largely uncharted, this study pioneers the methodology of cohort-based state-transition Markov models to evaluate DiGA for depression. As health states, we define mild, moderate, severe depression, remission and death. Comparing a future scenario where 50% of patients receive supplementary DiGA access with the current standard of care reveals a gain of 0.02 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) per patient, which comes at additional direct costs of ~1536 EUR per patient over a five-year timeframe. Influencing factors determining DiGA cost-effectiveness are the DiGA cost structure and individual DiGA effectiveness. Under Germany’s existing cost structure, DiGA for depression are yet to demonstrate the ability to generate overall savings in healthcare expenditures.",

There are many available methods for evaluating the utility of a single surrogate marker including both parametric and nonparametric approaches. However, as the dimension of the surrogate marker increases, a completely nonparametric procedure becomes infeasible due to the curse of dimensionality. In this paper, we define a quantity to assess the value of multiple surrogate markers in a time‐to‐event outcome setting and propose a robust estimation approach for censored data. We focus on surrogate markers that are measured at some landmark time,\n              t\n              0\n              , which occurs earlier than the end of the study. Our approach is based on a dimension reduction procedure with an option to incorporate weights to guard against potential misspecification of the working model, resulting in three different proposed estimators, two of which can be shown to be double robust. We examine the finite sample performance of the estimators under various scenarios using a simulation study. We illustrate the estimation and inference procedures using data from the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) to examine multiple potential surrogate markers for diabetes.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              With advances in medical technologies, more children with chronic diseases are now living on into adulthood. The development of proficient self-management skills is essential for adolescents and young adults to transition from pediatric to adult health care services. An innovative way to improve the current care model and foster self-management skills could be through eHealth or mHealth (mobile health) interventions, in particular, when considering the rising ownership of digital technology by adolescents and young adults.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This systematic review aimed to evaluate the features, acceptability, usability, engagement, and intervention efficacy of eHealth and mHealth interventions that support self-management and health care transition in adolescents and young adults with chronic disease.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              This review followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) reporting guidelines (registration number CRD42023378355). We systematically searched the MEDLINE complete, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL complete, and ProQuest Health & Medical complete. We considered only articles published in or since 2019, as we aimed to extend the data collected by 2 previous systematic reviews.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 16,752 studies were screened. After removing duplicates, 14,507 studies were excluded based on the title and abstract. Ultimately, 22 studies were included. The interventions ranged from simple text messages to complex interventions involving web-based games and engagement of health care providers, which were summarized into 6 themes: medication monitoring and reminders, symptom tracking and monitoring, management goal setting, knowledge education and self-management skills training, incentives and reinforcement, and communication. Most adolescents and young adults felt the eHealth and mHealth interventions were feasible, as they were convenient, easy to use, and accessible in the context of helping manage their health. However, user engagement was variable and presented a gradual decline in youth engagement with these apps over time. Barriers that prevent user engagement are diverse, such as time-consuming video uploads, noncontinuous access to a phone, reading literacy levels, language, and false impressions. Moreover, adolescents and young adults had different preferred styles of message delivery and functions, especially the engaging elements, disease-specific information, and opportunities to communicate with peers, health care providers, and app teams.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              There remains limited data about the effectiveness of eHealth and mHealth interventions facilitating the self-management and health care transition of adolescents and young adults with chronic diseases. Based on the available evidence, they were receptive to and interested in receiving information and managing their health using mobile apps or websites. Considering adolescents and young adults had different preferred styles of message delivery and features, to improve user engagement and provide focused interventions, it would be better to involve them early in the design process to identify their specific needs, as well as collaborate with health care providers and app teams to obtain suggestions.",

Twelve interviews with subject matter experts were conducted and coded using an inductive approach to identify factors related to PPRL adoption.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              PPRL has a high level of linkage quality and accuracy. PPRL linkage quality was comparable to that of clear text linkage methods (requiring direct personally identifiable information [PII]) for linkage across various settings and research questions. Accuracy of PPRL depended on several components, such as PPRL technique, and the proportion of missingness and errors in underlying data. Strategies to increase adoption include increasing understanding of PPRL, improving data owner buy-in, establishing governance structure and oversight, and developing a public health implementation strategy for PPRL.\n            \n            \n              Discussion\n              PPRL protects privacy by eliminating the need to share PII for linkage, but the accuracy and linkage quality depend on factors including the choice of PPRL technique and specific PII used to create encrypted identifiers. Large-scale implementations of PPRL linking millions of observations—including PCORnet, National Institutes for Health N3C, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention COVID-19 project have demonstrated the scalability of PPRL for public health applications.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Applications of PPRL in public health have demonstrated their value for the public health community. Although gaps must be addressed before wide implementation, PPRL is a promising solution to data linkage challenges faced by the public health ecosystem.",

Unfortunately, they pose a risk of producing intervention-generated inequalities (IGI) by disproportionately benefiting more advantaged people. In this perspective paper, we discuss characteristics of health-related interventions known to produce IGI, explain why health informatics interventions are particularly vulnerable to this phenomenon, and describe safeguards that can be implemented to improve health equity. We provide examples in which health informatics interventions produced inequality because they were more accessible to, heavily used by, adhered to, or effective for those from socioeconomically advantaged groups. We provide a brief outline of precautions that intervention developers and implementers can take to guard against creating or worsening inequality through health informatics. We conclude by discussing evaluation approaches that will ensure that IGIs are recognized and studied.",

      "abstract": "There has been heightened interest in identifying critical windows of exposure for adverse health outcomes; that is, time points during which exposures have the greatest impact on a person's health. Multiple informant models implemented using generalized estimating equations (MIM GEEs) have been applied to address this research question because they enable statistical comparisons of differences in associations across exposure windows. As interest rises in using MIMs, the feasibility and appropriateness of their application under settings of correlated exposures and partially missing exposure measurements requires further examination. We evaluated the impact of correlation between exposure measurements and missing exposure data on the power and differences in association estimated by the MIM GEE and an inverse probability weighted extension to account for informatively missing exposures. We assessed these operating characteristics under a variety of correlation structures, sample sizes, and missing data mechanisms considering various exposure‐outcome scenarios. We showed that applying MIM GEEs maintains higher power when there is a single critical window of exposure and exposure measures are not highly correlated, but may result in low power and bias under other settings. We applied these methods to a study of pregnant women living with HIV to explore differences in association between trimester‐specific viral load and infant neurodevelopment.",

Mobile apps may have the potential, through a wide variety of features, to support and improve medication adherence.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The purpose of this systematic review was to evaluate the effectiveness of mobile apps in promoting medication adherence for patients managing chronic conditions.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              MEDLINE (Ovid), Embase (Ovid), and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials databases were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness of mobile app interventions in improving medication adherence in patients with chronic conditions. Study design and app features were qualitatively described. Meta-analyses were performed on studies, grouped by medication adherence measurement scale, on the mean differences in medication adherence scores between intervention and control groups, using random effects models. If baseline medication adherence data were available, a difference in differences meta-analysis with a random effects model was also conducted. Bias assessment was conducted using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              \n                This review included 14 RCTs published between 2014 and 2022, with sample sizes between 57 and 412 participants and the length of interventions ranging from 30 days to 12 months. A range of patient populations was evaluated, including those with Parkinson disease, coronary heart disease, psoriasis, and hypertension, with hypertension being the most common condition. All 14 studies reported that app interventions improved medication adherence, and 10 RCTs demonstrated statistically significant improvement in medication adherence. Three separate sets of meta-analyses, categorized by the medication adherence measurement scales, were conducted on the mean difference between medication adherence scores between the control and intervention groups: the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8; 0.57, 95% CI 0.33-0.80;\n                P\n                <.001,\n                I\n                2\n                =0%, τ\n                2\n                =0,\n                P\n                value for heterogeneity test=.94), 4-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-4; 0.15, 95% CI −0.12 to 0.42;\n                P\n                =.28,\n                I\n                2\n                =0%, τ\n                2\n                =0,\n                P\n                value for heterogeneity test=.54) and a percentage medication adherence scale (18.85, 95% CI 2.17-35.53;\n                P\n                =.03,\n                I\n                2\n                =63%, τ\n                2\n                =94.89,\n                P\n                value for heterogeneity test=.10). Additionally, with available baseline adherence scores, difference in differences meta-analyses were conducted for studies using the MMAS-8 scale (0.38, 95% CI 0.15-0.62;\n                P\n                =.001,\n                I\n                2\n                =0%, τ\n                2\n                =0,\n                P\n                value for heterogeneity test=.51) and for studies using the MMAS-4 scale (0.55, 95% CI 0.17 to 0.93;\n                P\n                =.005,\n                I\n                2\n                =33%, τ\n                2\n                =0.03,\n                P\n                value for heterogeneity test=.22).

Data on “making the case” for SRS is extracted from this research.\n            \n            \n              Findings\n              – It is argued that SROI has utility where it can demonstrate the contribution of sport, physical activity and recreation to health policy, adult social care, education, youth crime reduction, place shaping agendas and community engagement, for example. However, findings of the APSE research imply that although SROI offers use value in making a case for retaining services, this method of assessment may not be widely employed for a number of political and practical reasons.\n            \n            \n              Research limitations/implications\n              – The research is limited to a sample of 55 local authorities in England from which generalisations are made.\n            \n            \n              Practical implications\n              – In the context of the introduction of the Social Value Act in 2013, SROI offers use value in making a case for retaining or adapting discretionary services within emerging models of strategic commissioning.

      "abstract": "Background: Accessible, cost-effective, and scalable mental health interventions are limited, particularly in low- and middle-income countries, where disparities between mental health needs and services are greatest. Microinterventions (ie, brief, stand-alone, or digital approaches) aim to provide immediate reprieve and enhancements in mental health states and offer a novel and scalable framework for embedding evidence-based mental health promotion techniques into digital environments. Body image is a global public health issue that increases young peoples’ risk of developing more severe mental and physical health issues. Embedding body image microinterventions into digital environments is one avenue for providing young people with immediate and short-term reprieve and protection from the negative exposure effects associated with social media.\nObjective: This 2-armed, fully remote, and preregistered randomized controlled trial assessed the impact of a body image chatbot containing microinterventions on Brazilian adolescents’ state and trait body image and associated well-being outcomes.\nMethods: Geographically diverse Brazilian adolescents aged 13-18 years (901/1715, 52.54% girls) were randomized into the chatbot or an assessment-only control condition and completed web-based self-assessments at baseline, immediately after the intervention time frame, and at 1-week and 1-month follow-ups. The primary outcomes were mean change in state (at chatbot entry and at the completion of a microintervention technique) and trait body image (before and after the intervention), with the secondary outcomes being mean change in affect (state and trait) and body image self-efficacy between the assessment time points.\nResults: Most participants who entered the chatbot (258/327, 78.9%) completed ≥1 microintervention technique, with participants completing an average of 5 techniques over the 72-hour intervention period. Chatbot users experienced small significant improvements in primary (state: P<.001, Cohen d=0.30, 95% CI 0.25-0.34; and trait body image: P=.02, Cohen d range=0.10, 95% CI 0.01-0.18, to 0.26, 95% CI 0.13-0.32) and secondary outcomes across various time points (state: P<.001, Cohen d=0.28, 95% CI 0.22-0.33; trait positive affect: P=.02, Cohen d range=0.15, 95% CI 0.03-0.27, to 0.23, 95% CI 0.08-0.37; negative affect: P=.03, Cohen d range=−0.16, 95% CI −0.30 to −0.02, to −0.18, 95% CI −0.33 to −0.03; and self-efficacy: P=.02, Cohen d range=0.14, 95% CI 0.03-0.25, to 0.19, 95% CI 0.08-0.32) relative to the control condition. Intervention benefits were moderated by baseline levels of concerns but not by gender.\nConclusions: This is the first large-scale randomized controlled trial assessing a body image chatbot among Brazilian adolescents. Intervention attrition was high (531/858, 61.9%) and reflected the broader digital intervention literature; barriers to engagement",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Clinical governance of medical mobile apps is challenging, and there is currently no standard method for assessing the quality of such apps. In 2018, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) developed a framework for assessing the required level of evidence for digital health technologies (DHTs), as determined by their clinical function. The framework can potentially be used to assess mobile apps, which are a subset of DHTs. To be used reliably in this context, the framework must allow unambiguous classification of an app’s clinical function.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The objective of this study was to determine whether mobile health apps could be reliably classified using the NICE evidence standards framework for DHTs.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We manually extracted app titles, screenshots, and content descriptions for all apps listed on the National Health Service (NHS) Apps Library website on July 12, 2019; none of the apps were downloaded. Using this information, 2 mobile health (mHealth) researchers independently classified each app to one of the 4 functional tiers (ie, 1, 2, 3a, and 3b) described in the NICE digital technologies evaluation framework. Coders also answered contextual questions from the framework to identify whether apps were deemed to be higher risk. Agreement between coders was assessed using Cohen κ statistic.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              In total, we assessed 76 apps from the NHS Apps Library. There was classification agreement for 42 apps. Of these, 0 apps were unanimously classified into Tier 1; 24, into Tier 2; 15, into Tier 3a; and 3, into Tier 3b. There was disagreement between coders in 34/76 cases (45%); interrater agreement was poor (Cohen κ=0.32, 95% CI 0.16-0.47). Further investigation of disagreements highlighted 5 main explanatory themes: apps that did not correspond to any tier, apps that corresponded to multiple tiers, ambiguous tier descriptions, ambiguous app descriptions, and coder error.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The current iteration of the NICE evidence standards framework for DHTs did not allow mHealth researchers to consistently and unambiguously classify digital health mobile apps listed on the NHS app library according to their functional tier.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Effective treatment of hypertension requires careful self-management. With the ongoing development of mobile technologies and the scarcity of health care resources, mobile health (mHealth)–based self-management has become a useful treatment for hypertension, and its effectiveness has been assessed in many trials. However, there is a paucity of comprehensive summaries of the studies using both qualitative and quantitative methods.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This systematic review aimed to measure the effectiveness of mHealth in improving the self-management of hypertension for adults. The outcome measures were blood pressure (BP), BP control, medication adherence, self-management behavior, and costs.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A systematic search was conducted using 5 electronic databases. The snowballing method was used to scan the reference lists of relevant studies. Only peer-reviewed randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published between January 2010 and September 2019 were included. Data extraction and quality assessment were performed by 3 researchers independently, adhering to the validation guideline and checklist. Both a meta-analysis and a narrative synthesis were carried out.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 24 studies with 8933 participants were included. Of these, 23 studies reported the clinical outcome of BP, 12 of these provided systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP) data, and 16 articles focused on change in self-management behavior and medication adherence. All 24 studies were included in the narrative synthesis. According to the meta-analysis, a greater reduction in both SBP and DBP was observed in the mHealth intervention groups compared with control groups, −3.78 mm Hg (P<.001; 95% CI −4.67 to −2.89) and −1.57 mm Hg (P<.001; 95% CI −2.28 to −0.86), respectively. Subgroup analyses showed consistent reductions in SBP and DBP across different frequencies of reminders, interactive patterns, intervention functions, and study duration subgroups. A total of 16 studies reported better medication adherence and behavioral change in the intervention groups, while 8 showed no significant change. Six studies included an economic evaluation, which drew inconsistent conclusions. However, potentially long-term financial benefits were mentioned in all economic evaluations. All studies were assessed to be at high risk of bias.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This review found that mHealth self-management interventions were effective in BP control. The outcomes of this review showed improvements in self-management behavior and medication adherence. The most successful mHealth intervention combined the feature of tailored messages, interactive communication, and multifaceted functions. Further research with longer duration and cultural adaptation is necessary. With increasing disease burden from hypertension globally, mHealth offers a potentially effective method for self-management and control of BP. mHealth can be easily integrated into existing health care systems.\n            \n            \n              Trial Registration\n              PROSPERO CRD42019152062; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=152062",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Digital interventions are effective for health behavior change, as they enable the self-management of chronic, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). However, they often fail to facilitate the specific or current needs and preferences of the individual. A proposed alternative is a digital platform that hosts a suite of discrete, already existing digital health interventions. A platform architecture would allow users to explore a range of evidence-based solutions over time to optimize their self-management and health behavior change.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This review aims to identify digital platform-like interventions and examine their potential for supporting self-management of NCDs and health behavior change.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A literature search was conducted in January 2020 using EBSCOhost, PubMed, Scopus, and EMBASE. No digital platforms were identified, so criteria were broadened to include digital platform-like interventions. Eligible platform-like interventions offered a suite of discrete, evidence-based health behavior change features to optimize self-management of NCDs in an adult population and provided digitally supported guidance for the user toward the features best suited to their needs and preferences. Data collected on interventions were guided by the CONSORT-EHEALTH (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials of Electronic and Mobile Health Applications and Online Telehealth) checklist, including evaluation data on effectiveness and process outcomes. The quality of the included literature was assessed using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 7 studies were included for review. Targeted NCDs included cardiovascular diseases (CVD; n=3), diabetes (n=3), and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (n=1). The mean adherence (based on the number of follow-up responders) was 69% (SD 20%). Of the 7 studies, 4 with the highest adherence rates (80%) were also guided by behavior change theories and took an iterative, user-centered approach to development, optimizing intervention relevance. All 7 interventions presented algorithm-supported user guidance tools, including electronic decision support, smart features that interact with patterns of use, and behavior change stage-matching tools. Of the 7 studies, 6 assessed changes in behavior. Significant effects in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity were reported, but for no other specific health behaviors. However, positive behavior change was observed in studies that focused on comprehensive behavior change measures, such as self-care and self-management, each of which addresses several key lifestyle risk factors (eg, medication adherence). No significant difference was found for psychosocial outcomes (eg, quality of life). Significant changes in clinical outcomes were predominately related to disease-specific, multifaceted measures such as clinical disease control and cardiovascular risk score.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Iterative, user-centered development of digital platform structures could optimize user engagement with self-management support through existing, evidence-based digital interventions. Offering a palette of interventions with an appropriate degree of guidance has the potential to facilitate disease-specific health behavior change and effective self-management among a myriad of users, conditions, or stages of care.",

This paper considers the role of trial‐based economic evaluation in this era of explicit decision making. It is argued that any framework for economic analysis can only be judged insofar as it can inform two key decisions and be consistent with the objectives of a health care system subject to its resource constraints. The two decisions are, firstly, whether to adopt a health technology given existing evidence and, secondly, an assessment of whether more evidence is required to support this decision in the future. It is argued that a framework of economic analysis is needed which can estimate costs and effects, based on all the available evidence, relating to the full range of possible alternative interventions and clinical strategies, over an appropriate time horizon and for specific patient groups. It must also enable the accumulated evidence to be synthesised in an explicit and transparent way in order to fully represent the decision uncertainty. These requirements suggest that, in most circumstances, the use of a single RCT as a vehicle for economic analysis will be an inadequate and partial basis for decision making. It is argued that RCT evidence, with or without economic content, should be viewed as simply one of the sources of evidence, which must be placed in a broader framework of evidence synthesis and decision analysis.

Yet, major questions remain open, such as (1) what personalization is, (2) how prevalent it is in practice, and (3) what benefits it truly has.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We address this gap by performing a systematic literature review identifying all empirical studies on DMHIs targeting depressive symptoms in adults from 2015 to September 2022. The search in Pubmed, SCOPUS and Psycinfo led to the inclusion of 138 articles, describing 94 distinct DMHIs provided to an overall sample of approximately 24,300 individuals.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Our investigation results in the conceptualization of personalization as purposefully designed variation between individuals in an intervention's therapeutic elements or its structure. We propose to further differentiate personalization by what is personalized (i.e., intervention content, content order, level of guidance or communication) and the underlying mechanism [i.e., user choice, provider choice, decision rules, and machine-learning (ML) based approaches]. Applying this concept, we identified personalization in 66% of the interventions for depressive symptoms, with personalized intervention content (32% of interventions) and communication with the user (30%) being particularly popular. Personalization via decision rules (48%) and user choice (36%) were the most used mechanisms, while the utilization of ML was rare (3%). Two-thirds of personalized interventions only tailored one dimension of the intervention.\n            \n            \n              Discussion\n              We conclude that future interventions could provide even more personalized experiences and especially benefit from using ML models. Finally, empirical evidence for personalization was scarce and inconclusive, making further evidence for the benefits of personalization highly needed.\n            \n            \n              Systematic Review Registration\n              Identifier: CRD42022357408.",

Several studies have identified their effects on patients with coronary heart disease, although no studies have focused on all the approaches collectively. Methods: Randomized controlled trials have investigated lipid profiles, through systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and body mass index (BMI). Stata software was used for analysis, while Egger’s linear regression test and Begg’s funnel plot were also applied. Results: Technology-based home CR revealed significantly lower total cholesterol (TC) levels (standardized mean difference (SMD) = –0.19; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [–0.27, –0.11]); triglyceride (TG) levels (SMD = –0.26; 95% CI: [–0.35, 0.17]); low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels (SMD = –0.18; 95% CI: [ –0.25, –0.11]); SBP (SMD = –0.26; 95% CI: [–0.33, –0.19]); DBP (SMD = –0.24; 95% CI: [–0.32, –0.16]); BMI (SMD = –0.12; 95% CI: [–0.18, –0.05]), and improved high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (SMD = 0.22; 95% CI: [0.14, 0.31]). Conclusions: Technology-based home CR can be used to lower TC, TG, and LDL levels, alongside the BMI, SBP, and DBP indexes, while also raising HDL levels; thus, its use should be widely promoted.",

Digital therapeutics have entered the health care ecosystem so rapidly that substantial misunderstandings exist about how they are evaluated and regulated by the FDA. This review briefly explains the relevant regulatory history of software as medical devices (SaMDs) and reviews the current regulatory landscape in which prescription and non-prescription digital therapeutics are developed and approved for use. These are important issues because PDTs, and digital therapeutics in general, are an explosively growing field in medicine and offer many advantages over conventional face-to-face treatments for the behavioral dimensions of a wide range of conditions and disease states. By allowing access to evidence-based therapies remotely and privately, digital therapeutics can reduce existing disparities in care and improve health equity. But clinicians, payers, and other healthcare stakeholders must appreciate the rigor of the regulatory frameworks within which PDTs are approved for use.",

Population-based prevention strategies are those that focus on the whole population regardless of the level of risk, creating public health impact through policy implementation, campaigns, and other environmental strategies. We systematically searched seven electronic databases for studies published in English between 2008 and 2017. We grouped lifestyle interventions targeting high-risk individuals by delivery method and personnel type. We used the median incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), measured in cost per quality-adjusted life year (QALY) or cost saved to measure the CE of interventions. We used the $50,000/QALY threshold to determine whether an intervention was cost-effective or not. ICERs are reported in 2017 U.S. dollars.\n            \n            \n              RESULTS\n              Our review included 39 studies: 28 on interventions targeting high-risk individuals and 11 targeting whole populations. Both lifestyle and metformin interventions in high-risk individuals were cost-effective from a health care system or a societal perspective, with median ICERs of $12,510/QALY and $17,089/QALY, respectively, compared with no intervention. Among lifestyle interventions, those that followed a Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) curriculum had a median ICER of $6,212/QALY, while those that did not follow a DPP curriculum had a median ICER of $13,228/QALY. Compared with lifestyle interventions delivered one-on-one or by a health professional, those offered in a group setting or provided by a combination of health professionals and lay health workers had lower ICERs. Among population-based interventions, taxing sugar-sweetened beverages was cost-saving from both the health care system and governmental perspectives. Evaluations of other population-based interventions—including fruit and vegetable subsidies, community-based education programs, and modifications to the built environment—showed inconsistent results.\n            \n            \n              CONCLUSIONS\n              Most of the T2D prevention interventions included in our review were found to be either cost-effective or cost-saving. Our findings may help decision makers set priorities and allocate resources for T2D prevention in real-world settings.",

The use of CAs in health care settings is recent and rapidly increasing, which often translates to poor reporting of the CA development and evaluation processes and unreliable research findings. We developed and published a conceptual framework, designing, developing, evaluating, and implementing a smartphone-delivered, rule-based conversational agent (DISCOVER), consisting of 3 iterative stages of CA design, development, and evaluation and implementation, complemented by 2 cross-cutting themes (user-centered design and data privacy and security).\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aims to perform in-depth, semistructured interviews with multidisciplinary experts in health care CAs to share their views on the definition and classification of health care CAs and evaluate and validate the DISCOVER conceptual framework.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We conducted one-on-one semistructured interviews via Zoom (Zoom Video Communications) with 12 multidisciplinary CA experts using an interview guide based on our framework. The interviews were audio recorded, transcribed by the research team, and analyzed using thematic analysis.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Following participants’ input, we defined CAs as digital interfaces that use natural language to engage in a synchronous dialogue using ≥1 communication modality, such as text, voice, images, or video. CAs were classified by 13 categories: response generation method, input and output modalities, CA purpose, deployment platform, CA development modality, appearance, length of interaction, type of CA-user interaction, dialogue initiation, communication style, CA personality, human support, and type of health care intervention. Experts considered that the conceptual framework could be adapted for artificial intelligence–based CAs. However, despite recent advances in artificial intelligence, including large language models, the technology is not able to ensure safety and reliability in health care settings. Finally, aligned with participants’ feedback, we present an updated iteration of the conceptual framework for health care conversational agents (CHAT) with key considerations for CA design, development, and evaluation and implementation, complemented by 3 cross-cutting themes: ethics, user involvement, and data privacy and security.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              We present an expanded, validated CHAT and aim at guiding researchers from a variety of backgrounds and with different levels of expertise in the design, development, and evaluation and implementation of rule-based CAs in health care settings.",

Therefore, this study aimed at determining the effectiveness of mHealth interventions in medication adherence among patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), a leading cause of mortality globally. Relying on our inclusion criteria and the PRISMA recommendations, a literature search was carried out in the PubMed, Medline, and ProQuest databases for primary studies that investigated the impact of mHealth on medication adherence for cardiovascular disease (CVD) between 2000–2021. A total of 23 randomized controlled trials with 34,915 participants matched the selection criteria. The mHealth interventions used included text messages, mobile phone applications, and voice calls, which were used either as a single intervention or combined. Additionally, studies on enhancing drug adherence had contradictory findings: most of the studies elaborated positive results; however, six studies were unable to reveal any significant effect. Finally, a risk bias analysis revealed varying outcomes across all studies. This review, as a whole, supported the notion that mHealth interventions can be effective in improving adherence to CVD medication even though they could not improve adherence to all CVD medications when compared with controls. Further trials with more refined designs integrated with comprehensive interventions are needed to produce better health outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Introduction\n              Dynamic Bayesian networks improve the modeling of complex systems by incorporating continuous probabilistic relationships between covariates that change over time. This study aimed to analyze the complex causal links contributing to child undernutrition using dynamic Bayesian network modeling, examining both the best- and worst-case scenarios. The Young Cohort of the Ethiopian Young Lives dataset from 2002–2016 was used to analyze the complex relationships among various covariates influencing child undernutrition. We used a built-in Bayes server tool to identify potential features, followed by building the structure of the directed acyclic graph using a structural learning algorithm. The maximum posterior is determined using the relevance tree algorithm. The node with the highest values of mutual information and target entropy reduction, along with the lowest value of target entropy, was considered to have the strongest predictive power in the dataset.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              This study revealed that long-term participation in programs increased the likelihood of children being in a normal nutritional state. Key factors influencing the nutritional status of children under two years of age include the mother’s education level, her subjective well-being, and the household’s wealth quintile. Children with educated parents were more likely to have a healthy nutritional status. Additionally, the causal pathway of intervention programs → wealth quintile → child nutritional status consistently exceeded 90% in Waves 3, 4, and 5, indicating a strong relationship. Similarly, the relationship between intervention programs → food security → child nutritional status was nearly perfect at 99.99% in Waves 4 and 5, indicating a strong association. Finally, the study revealed that household participation in intervention programs significantly reduces undernutrition in best-case scenarios, while the absence of support poses a higher risk in worst-case conditions.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              The comprehensive intervention program strongly improved household wealth, food security, and maternal well-being, which in turn affected children’s nutritional status.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              The adoption of digital health care within health systems is determined by various factors, including pricing and reimbursement. The reimbursement landscape for digital health in Europe remains underresearched. Although various emergency reimbursement decisions were made during the COVID-19 pandemic to enable health care delivery through videoconferencing and asynchronous care (eg, digital apps), research so far has primarily focused on the policy innovations that facilitated this outside of Europe.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study examines the digital health reimbursement strategies in 8 European countries (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, Poland, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) and Israel.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We mapped available digital health reimbursement strategies using a scoping review and policy mapping framework. We reviewed the literature on the MEDLINE, Embase, Global Health, and Web of Science databases. Supplementary records were identified through Google Scholar and country experts.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Our search strategy yielded a total of 1559 records, of which 40 (2.57%) were ultimately included in this study. As of August 2023, digital health solutions are reimbursable to some extent in all studied countries except Poland, although the mechanism of reimbursement differs significantly across countries. At the time of writing, the pricing of digital health solutions was mostly determined through discussions between national or regional committees and the manufacturers of digital health solutions in the absence of value-based assessment mechanisms. Financing digital health solutions outside traditional reimbursement schemes was possible in all studied countries except Poland and typically occurs via health innovation or digital health–specific funding schemes. European countries have value-based pricing frameworks that range from nonexistent to embryonic.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Studied countries show divergent approaches to the reimbursement of digital health solutions. These differences may complicate the ability of patients to seek cross-country health care in another country, even if a digital health app is available in both countries. Furthermore, the fragmented environment will present challenges for developers of such solutions, as they look to expand their impact across countries and health systems. An increased emphasis on developing a clear conceptualization of digital health, as well as value-based pricing and reimbursement mechanisms, is needed for the sustainable integration of digital health. This study can therein serve as a basis for further, more detailed research as the field of digital health reimbursement evolves.",

However, as a phenomenon in the contemporary treatment and care of people with cancer, financial toxicity is not fully understood, with the discussion on mitigation mainly geared toward interventions at the health system level. Although important, health policy prescriptions take time before their intended results manifest, if they are implemented at all. They require corresponding strategies at the individual patient level. In this review, the authors discuss the nature of financial toxicity, defined as the objective financial burden and subjective financial distress of patients with cancer, as a result of treatments using innovative drugs and concomitant health services. They discuss coping with financial toxicity by patients and how maladaptive coping leads to poor health and nonhealth outcomes. They cover management strategies for oncologists, including having the difficult and urgent conversation about the cost and value of cancer treatment, availability of and access to resources, and assessment of financial toxicity as part of supportive care in the provision of comprehensive cancer care.\n              CA Cancer J Clin 2018;68:153‐165\n              . ©\n              2018 American Cancer Society\n              .",

We also incorporated studies from a previous CE review from the period 1985–2008. We classified the interventions based on their strength of evidence (strong, supportive, or uncertain) and levels of CE: cost-saving (more health benefit at a lower cost), very cost-effective (≤$25,000 per life year gained [LYG] or quality-adjusted life year [QALY]), cost-effective ($25,001–$50,000 per LYG or QALY), marginally cost-effective ($50,001–$100,000 per LYG or QALY), or not cost-effective (&gt;$100,000 per LYG or QALY). Costs were measured in 2017 U.S. dollars.\n            \n            \n              RESULTS\n              Seventy-three new studies met our inclusion criteria. These were combined with 49 studies from the previous review to yield 122 studies over the period 1985–2017. A large majority of the ADA-recommended interventions remain cost-effective. Specifically, we found strong evidence that the following ADA-recommended interventions are cost-saving or very cost-effective: In the cost-saving category are 1) ACE inhibitor (ACEI)/angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) therapy for intensive hypertension management compared with standard hypertension management, 2) ACEI/ARB therapy to prevent chronic kidney disease and/or end-stage renal disease in people with albuminuria compared with no ACEI/ARB therapy, 3) comprehensive foot care and patient education to prevent and treat foot ulcers among those at moderate/high risk of developing foot ulcers, 4) telemedicine for diabetic retinopathy screening compared with office screening, and 5) bariatric surgery compared with no surgery for individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity (BMI ≥30 kg/m2). In the very cost-effective category are 1) intensive glycemic management (targeting A1C &lt;7%) compared with conventional glycemic management (targeting an A1C level of 8–10%) for individuals with newly diagnosed T2D, 2) multicomponent interventions (involving behavior change/education and pharmacological therapy targeting hyperglycemia, hypertension, dyslipidemia, microalbuminuria, nephropathy/retinopathy, secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease with aspirin) compared with usual care, 3) statin therapy compared with no statin therapy for individuals with T2D and history of cardiovascular disease, 4) diabetes self-management education and support compared with usual care, 5) T2D screening every 3 years starting at age 45 years compared with no screening, 6) integrated, patient-centered care compared with usual care, 7) smoking cessation compared with no smoking cessation, 8) daily aspirin use as primary prevention for cardiovascular complications compared with usual care, 9) self-monitoring of blood glucose three times per day compared with once per day among those using insulin, 10) intensive glycemic management compared with conventional insulin therapy for T2D among adults aged ≥50 years, and 11) collaborative care for depression compared with usual care.\n            \n            \n              CONCLUSIONS\n              Complementing professional treatment recommendations, our systematic review provides an updated understanding of the potential value of interventions to manage diabetes and its complications and can assist clinicians and payers in prioritizing interventions and health care resources.",

Four of the cost-effectiveness studies were conducted by model-based analyses, and 3 were trial-based analyses. One study reported the additional cost per quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained, whereas 6 studies reported the additional cost per individual vaccinated (or return case). The vaccines targeted the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine, influenza vaccination, measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccine, and children immunization at different ages. The DHIs were delivered by television campaign, web-based decision aid, SMS text message, telephone, and computer-generated recall letters. The studies were classified as very good (n=5) and good (n=2) qualities. One study concluded that the DHI was cost-saving, and 6 studies concluded that the DHI was cost-effective.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This study is the first systematic review on cost-effectiveness analyses of DHIs to improve vaccination uptake. All included studies have good to very good quality on study assessment and reported the DHIs to be cost-saving or cost-effective in the improvement of vaccination uptake.",

Health resource use and associated medical costs are analyzed by age, sex, race/ethnicity, comorbid condition, and health service category. Data sources include national surveys (2015–2020 or most recent available), Medicare standard analytic files (2020), and administrative claims data from 2018 to 2021 for a large commercially insured population in the U.S.\n            \n            \n              RESULTS\n              The total estimated cost of diagnosed diabetes in the U.S. in 2022 is $412.9 billion, including $306.6 billion in direct medical costs and $106.3 billion in indirect costs attributable to diabetes. For cost categories analyzed, care for people diagnosed with diabetes accounts for 1 in 4 health care dollars in the U.S., 61% of which are attributable to diabetes. On average people with diabetes incur annual medical expenditures of $19,736, of which approximately $12,022 is attributable to diabetes. People diagnosed with diabetes, on average, have medical expenditures 2.6 times higher than what would be expected without diabetes. Glucose-lowering medications and diabetes supplies account for ∼17% of the total direct medical costs attributable to diabetes. Major contributors to indirect costs are reduced employment due to disability ($28.3 billion), presenteeism ($35.8 billion), and lost productivity due to 338,526 premature deaths ($32.4 billion).\n            \n            \n              CONCLUSIONS\n              The inflation-adjusted direct medical costs of diabetes are estimated to rise 7% from 2017 and 35% from 2012 calculations (stated in 2022 dollars). Following decades of steadily increasing prevalence of diabetes, the overall estimated prevalence in 2022 remains relatively stable in comparison to 2017. However, the absolute number of people with diabetes has grown and contributes to increased health care expenditures, particularly per capita spending on inpatient hospital stays and prescription medications. The enormous economic toll of diabetes continues to burden society through direct medical and indirect costs.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Digital therapeutics (DTx), a class of software-based clinical interventions, are promising new technologies that can potentially prevent, manage, or treat a spectrum of medical disorders and diseases as well as deliver unprecedented portability for patients and scalability for health care providers. Their adoption and implementation were accelerated by the need for remote care during the COVID-19 pandemic, and awareness about their utility has rapidly grown among providers, payers, and regulators. Despite this, relatively little is known about the capacity of DTx to provide economic value in care.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aimed to systematically review and summarize the published evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of clinical-grade mobile app–based DTx and explore the factors affecting such evaluations.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A systematic review of economic evaluations of clinical-grade mobile app–based DTx was conducted following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) 2020 guidelines. Major electronic databases, including PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Web of Science, were searched for eligible studies published from inception to October 28, 2022. Two independent reviewers evaluated the eligibility of all the retrieved articles for inclusion in the review. Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed for each included study.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 18 studies were included in this review. Of the 18 studies, 7 (39%) were nonrandomized study–based economic evaluations, 6 (33%) were model-based evaluations, and 5 (28%) were randomized clinical trial–based evaluations. The DTx intervention subject to assessment was found to be cost-effective in 12 (67%) studies, cost saving in 5 (28%) studies, and cost-effective in 1 (6%) study in only 1 of the 3 countries where it was being deployed in the final study. Qualitative deficiencies in methodology and substantial potential for bias, including risks of performance bias and selection bias in participant recruitment, were identified in several included studies.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This systematic review supports the thesis that DTx interventions offer potential economic benefits. However, DTx economic analyses conducted to date exhibit important methodological shortcomings that must be addressed in future evaluations to reduce the uncertainty surrounding the widespread adoption of DTx interventions.\n            \n            \n              Trial Registration\n              PROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews CRD42022358616; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?ID=CRD42022358616",

      "abstract": "Digital mental health interventions are routinely integrated into mental health services internationally and can contribute to reducing the global mental health treatment gap identified by the World Health Organization. Research teams designing and delivering evaluations frequently invest substantial effort in deliberating on ethical and legal challenges around digital mental health interventions. In this article, we reflect on our own research experience with digital mental health intervention design and evaluation to identify 8 of the most critical challenges that we or others have faced, and that have ethical or legal consequences. These include: (1) harm caused by online recruitment work; (2) monitoring of intervention safety; (3) exclusion of specific demographic or clinical groups; (4) inadequate robustness of effectiveness and cost-effectiveness findings; (5) adequately conceptualizing and supporting engagement and adherence; (6) structural barriers to implementation; (7) data protection and intellectual property; and (8) regulatory ambiguity relating to digital mental health interventions that are medical devices. As we describe these challenges, we have highlighted serious consequences that can or have occurred, such as substantial delays to studies if regulations around Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) are not fully understood, or if regulations change substantially during the study lifecycle. Collectively, the challenges we have identified highlight a substantial body of required knowledge and expertise, either within the team or through access to external experts. Ensuring access to knowledge requires careful planning and adequate financial resources (for example, paying public contributors to engage in debate on critical ethical issues or paying for legal opinions on regulatory issues). Access to such resources can be planned for on a per-study basis and enabled through funding proposals. However, organizations regularly engaged in the development and evaluation of digital mental health interventions should consider creating or supporting structures such as advisory groups that can retain necessary competencies, such as in medical device regulation.",

A total of 4 databases were systematically searched from 2012 to 2022, which included Web of Science, Scopus, ACM Digital Library, and PubMed. The inclusion criteria encompassed studies that used digital tools for physical activity, examined behavior change intervention techniques, and were written in English.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 41 identiﬁed research articles were included in this review.

Commonly used methods included automatic monitoring, descriptive feedback, general guidelines, self-set goals, time-based cues, and virtual rewards.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              A total of 32 commonly design strategies of habit formation techniques were summarized and mapped to the proposed conceptual framework, which was categorized into target-mediated (generalization and personalization) and technology-mediated interactions (explicitness and implicitness). Most of the existing studies use the explicit interaction, aligning with the personalized habit formation techniques in the design strategies of DBCIs. However, implicit interaction design strategies are lacking in the reviewed studies. The proposed conceptual framework and potential solutions can serve as guidelines for designing strategies aimed at habit formation within DBCIs.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Rapid advancements in eHealth and mobile health (mHealth) technologies have driven researchers to design and evaluate numerous technology-based interventions to promote smoking cessation. The evolving nature of cessation interventions emphasizes a strong need for knowledge synthesis.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to summarize recent evidence from randomized controlled trials regarding the effectiveness of eHealth-based smoking cessation interventions in promoting abstinence and assess nonabstinence outcome indicators, such as cigarette consumption and user satisfaction, via narrative synthesis.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We searched for studies published in English between 2017 and June 30, 2022, in 4 databases: PubMed (including MEDLINE), PsycINFO, Embase, and Cochrane Library. Two independent reviewers performed study screening, data extraction, and quality assessment based on the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations) framework. We pooled comparable studies based on the population, follow-up time, intervention, and control characteristics. Two researchers performed an independent meta-analysis on smoking abstinence using the Sidik-Jonkman random-effects model and log risk ratio (RR) as the effect measurement. For studies not included in the meta-analysis, the outcomes were narratively synthesized.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 464 studies were identified through an initial database search after removing duplicates. Following screening and full-text assessments, we deemed 39 studies (n=37,341 participants) eligible for this review. Of these, 28 studies were shortlisted for meta-analysis. According to the meta-analysis, SMS or app text messaging can significantly increase both short-term (3 months) abstinence (log RR=0.50, 95% CI 0.25-0.75; I2=0.72%) and long-term (6 months) abstinence (log RR=0.77, 95% CI 0.49-1.04; I2=8.65%), relative to minimal cessation support. The frequency of texting did not significantly influence treatment outcomes. mHealth apps may significantly increase abstinence in the short term (log RR=0.76, 95% CI 0.09-1.42; I2=88.02%) but not in the long term (log RR=0.15, 95% CI −0.18 to 0.48; I2=80.06%), in contrast to less intensive cessation support. In addition, personalized or interactive interventions showed a moderate increase in cessation for both the short term (log RR=0.62, 95% CI 0.30-0.94; I2=66.50%) and long term (log RR=0.28, 95% CI 0.04-0.53; I2=73.42%). In contrast, studies without any personalized or interactive features had no significant impact. Finally, the treatment effect was similar between trials that used biochemically verified or self-reported abstinence. Among studies reporting outcomes besides abstinence (n=20), a total of 11 studies reported significantly improved nonabstinence outcomes in cigarette consumption (3/14, 21%) or user satisfaction (8/19, 42%).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Our review of 39 randomized controlled trials found that recent eHealth interventions might promote smoking cessation, with mHealth being the dominant approach. Despite their success, the effectiveness of such interventions may diminish with time. The design of more personalized interventions could potentially benefit future studies.\n            \n            \n              Trial Registration\n              PROSPERO CRD42022347104; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=347104",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are widespread in many countries and their huge burden on the society has necessitated innovative approaches such as digital health interventions. However, no study has evaluated the findings of cost-effectiveness of these interventions.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aims to synthesize the cost-effectiveness of digital health interventions for people with MSDs.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Electronic databases including MEDLINE, AMED, CIHAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science, and Centre for Review and Dissemination were searched for cost-effectiveness of digital health published between inception and June 2022 following the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. References of all retrieved articles were checked for relevant studies. Quality appraisal of the included studies was performed using the Quality of Health Economic Studies (QHES) instrument. Results were presented using a narrative synthesis and random effects meta-analysis.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 10 studies from 6 countries met the inclusion criteria. Using the QHES instrument, we found that the mean score of the overall quality of the included studies was 82.5. Included studies were on nonspecific chronic low back pain (n=4), chronic pain (n=2), knee and hip osteoarthritis (n=3), and fibromyalgia (n=1). The economic perspectives adopted in the included studies were societal (n=4), societal and health care (n=3), and health care (n=3). Of the 10 included studies, 5 (50%) used quality-adjusted life-years as the outcome measures. Except 1 study, all the included studies reported that digital health interventions were cost-effective compared with the control group. In a random effects meta-analysis (n=2), the pooled disability and quality-adjusted life-years were –0.176 (95% CI –0.317 to –0.035; P=.01) and 3.855 (95% CI 2.023 to 5.687; P<.001), respectively. The meta-analysis (n=2) for the costs was in favor of the digital health intervention compared with control: US $417.52 (95% CI –522.01 to –313.03).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Studies indicate that digital health interventions are cost-effective for people with MSDs.

      "abstract": "Background\n              People with chronic diseases tend to experience more mental health issues than their peers without these health conditions. Mental health chatbots offer a potential source of mental health support for people with chronic diseases.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The aim of this study was to determine whether a mental health chatbot can improve mental health in people with chronic diseases. We focused on 2 chronic diseases in particular: arthritis and diabetes.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Individuals with arthritis or diabetes were recruited using various web-based methods. Participants were randomly assigned to 1 of 2 groups. Those in the treatment group used a mental health chatbot app (Wysa [Wysa Inc]) over a period of 4 weeks. Those in the control group received no intervention. Participants completed measures of depression (Patient Health Questionnaire–9), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale–7), and stress (Perceived Stress Scale–10) at baseline, with follow-up testing 2 and 4 weeks later. Participants in the treatment group completed feedback questions on their experiences with the app at the final assessment point.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 68 participants (n=47, 69% women; mean age 42.87, SD 11.27 years) were included in the analysis. Participants were divided evenly between the treatment and control groups. Those in the treatment group reported decreases in depression (P<.001) and anxiety (P<.001) severity over the study period. No such changes were found among participants in the control group. No changes in stress were reported by participants in either group. Participants with arthritis reported higher levels of depression (P=.004) and anxiety (P=.004) severity than participants with diabetes over the course of the study, as well as higher levels of stress (P=.01); otherwise, patterns of results were similar across these health conditions. In response to the feedback questions, participants in the treatment group said that they liked many of the functions and features of the app, the general design of the app, and the user experience. They also disliked some aspects of the app, with most of these reports focusing on the chatbot’s conversational abilities.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The results of this study suggest that mental health chatbots can be an effective source of mental health support for people with chronic diseases such as arthritis and diabetes.

      "abstract": "Abstract\n            \n              Background\n              Digital therapeutics (DTx) are therapeutic interventions driven by software and directly provided to patients, allowing them to manage their health with ease in any setting. A growing interest in DTx has spurred a discussion concerning their reimbursement pathways. However, DTx are still at a premature stage, with insufficient evidence on effectiveness, efficiency, and safety. Currently, although industries desire to quickly enter the market, especially by getting their products reimbursed by the National Health Insurance (NHI) fund, the NHI is cautious about DTx due to their uncertainties. Thus, public discussion and social consensus are crucial in deciding whether to reimburse DTx by the NHI fund.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study examined multiple stakeholders’ awareness and attitudes toward DTx and perceptions of regulatory pathways for adopting DTx.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              In-depth interviews were conducted with 11 stakeholders in South Korea (industry: n=4, health care: n=3, academia: n=2, and consumer: n=2) using semistructured guidelines. They were purposively sampled to identify individuals with expertise in DTx and NHI policies. The interviews were conducted either in person or via a videoconference for 45-70 minutes. Qualitative data were analyzed using directed content analysis, which uses interview guidelines as an analytical framework.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Findings were divided into three categories: (1) awareness and attitude toward DTx, (2) perception of whether DTx are worth entering the market and being reimbursed by the NHI fund, and (3) perception of how to enter the market and how to reimburse DTx by the NHI fund if they are worth it. Although consumer stakeholders were not familiar with the basic concept of DTx, the other stakeholders understood it thoroughly. However, all participants showed positive attitudes and acceptance of DTx. Most of them responded that DTx are worth entering the market, but they could not reach an agreement on the pathways for DTx to enter the market. Although participants were in favor of the reimbursement of DTx in principle, they responded that a conservative approach is required due to insufficient clinical evidence for DTx.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              We found that stakeholders in South Korea had positive attitudes toward DTx, perceived them as worth using, and agreed to allow them to enter the market. The main issue was not the problem of the technology itself but the difference in opinion as to the pathways for reimbursement. Therefore, this study concluded that the NHI fund, which is operated very conservatively, is insufficient to quickly adopt and implement DTx. Various reimbursement methods, including tax-based financing, raising innovation funds for new technologies, and pilot studies using the NHI fund, should be used to rapidly generate clinical evidence and reduce the uncertainties of DTx to secure a stable market.",

In addition, eHealth education is considered to improve family members’ support for patients with T2DM. However, there is little evidence from rigorously designed studies on the effectiveness of an intervention combining these approaches.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This randomized controlled trial (RCT) aimed to assess the effectiveness of an eHealth family-based health education intervention for patients with T2DM to improve their glucose control, risk perception, and self-care behaviors.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              This single-center, 2-parallel-group RCT was conducted between 2019 and 2020. Overall, 228 patients were recruited from Jiading District, Shanghai, and randomly divided into intervention and control groups. The intervention group received an eHealth family intervention based on community management via WeChat, whereas the control group received usual care. The primary outcome was the glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level of the patients with T2DM, and the secondary outcomes were self-management behavior (general and specific diet, exercise, blood sugar testing, foot care, and smoking), risk perception (risk knowledge, personal control, worry, optimism bias, and personal risk), and family support (supportive and nonsupportive behaviors).

The risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool, and the certainty of the evidence was assessed using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Of 14,078 hits, 130 randomized controlled trials were included. Compared with usual care or minimal intervention, digital health interventions increased objectively measured physical activity (end of intervention: standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.29, 95% CI 0.21-0.37; follow-up: SMD 0.17, 95% CI 0.04-0.31) and physical function (end of intervention: SMD 0.36, 95% CI 0.12-0.59; follow-up: SMD 0.29, 95% CI 0.01-0.57). The secondary outcomes also favored the digital health interventions for subjectively measured physical activity and physical function, depression, anxiety, and health-related quality of life at the end of the intervention but only subjectively measured physical activity at follow-up. The risk of nonserious adverse events, but not serious adverse events, was higher in the digital health interventions at the end of the intervention, but no difference was seen at follow-up.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Digital health interventions improved physical activity and physical function across various chronic conditions. Effects on depression, anxiety, and health-related quality of life were only observed at the end of the intervention. The risk of nonserious adverse events is present during the intervention, which should be addressed. Future studies should focus on better reporting, comparing the effects of different digital health solutions, and investigating how intervention effects are sustained beyond the end of the intervention.\n            \n            \n              Trial Registration\n              PROSPERO CRD42020189028; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=189028",

There has been widespread implementation and provision of eHealth interventions in the workplace as an inexpensive and anonymous way of addressing common mental disorders.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This updated review aimed to synthesize the literature on the efficacy of eHealth interventions for anxiety, depression, and stress outcomes in employee samples in organizational settings and evaluate whether their effectiveness has improved over time.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Systematic searches of relevant articles published from 2004 to July 2020 of eHealth intervention trials (app- or web-based) focusing on the mental health of employees were conducted. The quality and bias of all studies were assessed. We extracted means and SDs from publications by comparing the differences in effect sizes (Hedge g) in standardized mental health outcomes. We meta-analyzed these data using a random-effects model.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              We identified a tripling of the body of evidence, with 75 trials available for meta-analysis from a combined sample of 14,747 articles. eHealth interventions showed small positive effects for anxiety (Hedges g=0.26, 95% CI 0.13-0.39; P<.001), depression (Hedges g=0.26, 95% CI 0.19-0.34; P<.001), and stress (Hedges g=0.25, 95% CI 0.17-0.34; P<.001) in employees’ after intervention, with similar effects seen at the medium-term follow-up. However, there was evidence of no increase in the effectiveness of these interventions over the past decade.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This review and meta-analysis confirmed that eHealth interventions have a small positive impact on reducing mental health symptoms in employees. Disappointingly, we found no evidence that, despite the advances in technology and the enormous resources in time, research, and finance devoted to this area for over a decade, better interventions are being produced.

Synchronous and asynchronous communication, computerized therapy, and cognitive training appear to be effective but require further examination in understudied mental health conditions.

In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital health interventions provide a safer alternative to face-to-face treatment. However, further research on the applications of digital interventions in understudied mental health conditions is needed. Additionally, evidence is needed on the effectiveness and appropriateness of digital health tools for patients who are marginalized and may lack access to digital health interventions.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Digital therapeutic care apps provide a new effective and scalable approach for people with nonspecific low back pain (LBP). Digital therapeutic care apps are also driven by personalized decision-support interventions that support the user in self-managing LBP, and may induce prolonged behavior change to reduce the frequency and intensity of pain episodes. However, these therapeutic apps are associated with high attrition rates, and the initial prescription cost is higher than that of face-to-face physiotherapy. In Germany, digital therapeutic care apps are now being reimbursed by statutory health insurance; however, price targets and cost-driving factors for the formation of the reimbursement rate remain unexplored.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of a digital therapeutic care app compared to treatment as usual (TAU) in Germany. We further aimed to explore under which circumstances the reimbursement rate could be modified to consider value-based pricing.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We developed a state-transition Markov model based on a best-practice analysis of prior LBP-related decision-analytic models, and evaluated the cost utility of a digital therapeutic care app compared to TAU in Germany. Based on a 3-year time horizon, we simulated the incremental cost and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) for people with nonacute LBP from the societal perspective. In the deterministic sensitivity and scenario analyses, we focused on diverging attrition rates and app cost to assess our model’s robustness and conditions for changing the reimbursement rate. All costs are reported in Euro (€1=US $1.12).\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Our base case results indicated that the digital therapeutic care strategy led to an incremental cost of €121.59, but also generated 0.0221 additional QALYs compared to the TAU strategy, with an estimated incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of €5486 per QALY. The sensitivity analysis revealed that the reimbursement rate and the capability of  digital therapeutic care to prevent reoccurring LBP episodes have a significant impact on the ICER. At the same time, the other parameters remained unaffected and thus supported the robustness of our model. In the scenario analysis, the different model time horizons and attrition rates strongly influenced the economic outcome. Reducing the cost of the app to €99 per 3 months or decreasing the app’s attrition rate resulted in digital therapeutic care being significantly less costly with more generated QALYs, and is thus considered to be the dominant strategy over TAU.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The current reimbursement rate for a digital therapeutic care app in the statutory health insurance can be considered a cost-effective measure compared to TAU. The app’s attrition rate and effect on the patient’s prolonged behavior change essentially influence the settlement of an appropriate reimbursement rate. Future value-based pricing targets should focus on additional outcome parameters besides pain intensity and functional disability by including attrition rates and the app’s long-term effect on quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Digital health interventions are increasingly being designed to support health behaviors. Although digital health interventions informed by behavioral science theories, models, and frameworks (TMFs) are more likely to be effective than those designed without them, design teams often struggle to use these evidence-informed tools. Until now, little work has been done to clarify the ways in which behavioral science TMFs can add value to digital health design.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The aim of this study was to better understand how digital health design leaders select and use TMFs in design practice. The questions that were addressed included how do design leaders perceive the value of TMFs in digital health design, what considerations do design leaders make when selecting and applying TMFs, and what do design leaders think is needed in the future to advance the utility of TMFs in digital health design?\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              This study used a qualitative description design to understand the experiences and perspectives of digital health design leaders. The participants were identified through purposive and snowball sampling. Semistructured interviews were conducted via Zoom software. Interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed using Otter.ai software. Furthermore, 3 researchers coded a sample of interview transcripts and confirmed the coding strategy. One researcher completed the qualitative analysis using a codebook thematic analysis approach.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Design leaders had mixed opinions on the value of behavioral science TMFs in digital health design. Leaders suggested that TMFs added the most value when viewed as a starting point rather than the final destination for evidence-informed design. Specifically, these tools added value when they acted as a gateway drug to behavioral science, supported health behavior conceptualization, were balanced with expert knowledge and user-centered design principles, were complementary to existing design methods, and supported both individual- and systems-level thinking. Design leaders also felt that there was a considerable nuance in selecting the most value-adding TMFs. Considerations should be made regarding their source, appropriateness, complexity, accessibility, adaptability, evidence base, purpose, influence, audience, fit with team expertise, fit with team culture, and fit with external pressures. Design leaders suggested multiple opportunities to advance the use of TMFs. These included improving TMF reporting, design, and accessibility, as well as improving design teams' capacity to use TMFs appropriately in practice.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              When designing a digital health behavior change intervention, using TMFs can help design teams to systematically integrate behavioral insights. The future of digital health behavior change design demands an easier way for designers to integrate evidence-based TMFs into practice.",

Mobile health (mHealth) offers a promising means to provide patients with hypertension with easy access to health care services.

Participants selected via convenience sampling were randomly allocated into intervention and control groups. Intervention group participants were trained and asked to use an mHealth app named Blood Pressure Assistant for 6 months. They could use the app to record and upload vital signs, access educational materials, and receive self-management reminders and feedback from health care providers based on the analysis of the uploaded data. Control group participants received usual care. Blood pressure (BP) and 2 questionnaire surveys about hypertension knowledge and lifestyle behavior were used to assess all participants at baseline and 6 months. Data analysis was performed with SPSS software using 2-tailed t tests and a chi-square test.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              There were no significant differences in baseline characteristics and medication use between the 2 groups (all P>.05). After 6 months, although both groups show a significant pre-post improvement (P<.001 each), the BP control rate (ie, the proportion of patients with a systolic BP of <140 mm Hg and diastolic BP of <90 mm Hg) in the intervention group was better than that in the control group (100/111, 90.1% vs 75/115, 65.2%; P<.001). The mean systolic and diastolic BP were significantly reduced by 25.83 (SD 8.99) and 14.28 (SD 3.74) mm Hg in the intervention group (P<.001) and by 21.83 (SD 6.86) and 8.87 (SD 4.22) mm Hg in the control group (P<.001), respectively. The differences in systolic and diastolic BP between the 2 groups were significant (P<.001 and P=.01, respectively). Hypertension knowledge significantly improved only in the intervention group in both pre-post and intergroup comparisons (both P<.001). However, only intragroup improvement was observed for lifestyle behaviors in the intervention group (P<.001), including medication adherence (P<.001), healthy diet (P=.02), low salt intake (P<.001), and physical exercises (P=.02), and no significant difference was observed in the control group or on intergroup comparisons.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This research shows that the mHealth app–based intervention has the potential to improve patient health knowledge and support self-management among them toward a healthier lifestyle, including medication adherence, low-salt diets, and physical exercises, thereby achieving optimal BP control.

      "abstract": "Background\n              The National Health Service (NHS) Diabetes Prevention Program is a behavior change intervention for adults in England who are identified as being at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. The face-to-face service was launched in 2016, followed by a digital service (NHS Digital Diabetes Prevention Program [NHS-DDPP]) in 2019. A total of 4 service providers were commissioned to deliver the NHS-DDPP and were required to deliver the digital service in line with a program specification detailing the key intervention content. The fidelity of the behavior change content in the digital service (ie, the extent to which the program is delivered as intended) is currently unknown. Digital interventions may allow higher fidelity as staff do not have to be trained to deliver all intervention content. Assessing fidelity of the intervention design is particularly important to establish the planned behavior change content in the NHS-DDPP and the extent to which this adheres to the program specification. This is the first known independent assessment of design fidelity in a large-scale digital behavior change intervention.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aims to assess the fidelity of the behavior change content in each of the 4 NHS-DDPP providers’ intervention designs to the full program specification.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We conducted a document review of each provider’s NHS-DDPP intervention design, along with interviews with program developers employed by the 4 digital providers (n=6). Providers’ intervention design documents and interview transcripts were coded for behavior change techniques (BCTs; ie, the active ingredients of the intervention) using the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy version 1 and underpinning theory using the Theory Coding Scheme framework. The BCTs identified in each digital provider’s intervention design were compared with the 19 BCTs included in the program specification.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Of the 19 BCTs specified in the program specification, the 4 providers planned to deliver 16 (84%), 17 (89%), 16 (84%), and 16 (84%) BCTs, respectively. An additional 41 unspecified BCTs were included in at least one of the 4 digital providers’ intervention designs. By contrast, inconsistent use of the underpinning theory was apparent across providers, and none of the providers had produced a logic model to explain how their programs were expected to work. All providers linked some of their planned BCTs to theoretical constructs; however, justification for the inclusion of other BCTs was not described.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The fidelity of BCT content in the NHS-DDPP was higher than that previously documented for the face-to-face service. Thus, if service users engage with the NHS-DDPP, this should increase the effectiveness of the program. However, given that a clear theoretical underpinning supports the translation of BCTs in intervention designs to intervention delivery, the absence of a logic model describing the constructs to be targeted by specific BCTs is potentially problematic.",

People with hypertension who do not comply with recommended treatment strategies have a higher risk of heart attacks and strokes, leading to hospitalization and consequently greater health care costs. The smartphone, which is now ubiquitous, offers a convenient tool to aid in the treatment of hypertension through the use of apps targeting lifestyle management, and such app-based interventions have shown promising results. In particular, recent evidence has shown the feasibility, acceptability, and success of digital interventions in changing the behavior of people with chronic conditions.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The aim of this study was to systematically compile available evidence to determine the overall effect of smartphone apps on blood pressure control, medication adherence, and lifestyle changes for people with hypertension.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              This systematic review was conducted in accordance with the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) statement guidelines.

The analysis was restricted to participants who provided at least one follow-up assessment after baseline. As a result, 146 participants (45.2%) were included in the analysis—74 (50.7%) participants completed assessments at 3 months, 31 participants (21.2%) completed assessments at 6 months, and 21 participants (14.4%) completed assessments at 9 months. The program included structured lessons and tools (ie, exercises and practices) as well as one-on-one weekly video counseling sessions with a licensed therapist for 12 weeks and monthly check-in sessions for 1 year. The clinically validated Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-8) and Generalized Anxiety Disorder Scale (GAD-7) were used to assess depression and anxiety, respectively. Linear mixed-effects modeling was employed to examine changes in depression and anxiety over time.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              We observed a significant positive effect of program time on improvement in depression (β=–0.12, P<.001) and anxiety scores (β=–0.10, P<.001). At the end of the 12-week intervention, we observed an average reduction of 3.76 points (95% CI –4.76 to –2.76) in PHQ-8 scores. Further reductions in depression were seen at program month 6 (4.75-point reduction, 95% CI –6.61 to –2.88) and program month 9 (6.42-point reduction, 95% CI –8.66 to –6.55, P<.001). A similar pattern of improvement emerged for anxiety, with a 3.17-point reduction at the end of the 12-week intervention (95% CI –4.21 to –2.13). These improvements were maintained at program month 6 (4.87-point reduction, 95% CI –6.85 to –2.87) and program month 9 (5.19-point, 95% –6.85 to 4.81). In addition, greater program engagement during the first 12 weeks predicted a greater reduction in depression (β=–0.29, P<.001)\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The results suggest that digital interventions can support sustained and clinically meaningful improvements in depression and anxiety. Furthermore, it appears that strong initial digital mental health intervention engagement may facilitate this effect.

      "abstract": "Background\n              Worldwide, insomnia remains a highly prevalent public health problem. eHealth presents a novel opportunity to deliver effective, accessible, and affordable insomnia treatments on a population-wide scale. However, there is no quantitative integration of evidence regarding the effectiveness of eHealth-based psychosocial interventions on insomnia.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of eHealth-based psychosocial interventions for insomnia and investigate the influence of specific study characteristics and intervention features on these effects.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We searched PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials from database inception to February 16, 2021, for publications investigating eHealth-based psychosocial interventions targeting insomnia and updated the search of PubMed to December 6, 2021. We also screened gray literature for unpublished data. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials of eHealth-based psychosocial interventions targeting adults with insomnia. Random-effects meta-analysis models were used to assess primary and secondary outcomes. Primary outcomes were insomnia severity and sleep quality. Meta-analyses were performed by pooling the effects of eHealth-based psychosocial interventions on insomnia compared with inactive and in-person conditions. We performed subgroup analyses and metaregressions to explore specific factors that affected the effectiveness. Secondary outcomes included sleep diary parameters and mental health–related outcomes.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Of the 19,980 identified records, 37 randomized controlled trials (13,227 participants) were included. eHealth-based psychosocial interventions significantly reduced insomnia severity (Hedges g=−1.01, 95% CI −1.12 to −0.89; P<.001) and improved sleep quality (Hedges g=−0.58, 95% CI −0.75 to −0.41; P<.001) compared with inactive control conditions, with no evidence of publication bias. We found no significant difference compared with in-person treatment in alleviating insomnia severity (Hedges g=0.41, 95% CI −0.02 to 0.85; P=.06) and a significant advantage for in-person treatment in enhancing sleep quality (Hedges g=0.56, 95% CI 0.24-0.88; P<.001). eHealth-based psychosocial interventions had significantly larger effects (P=.01) on alleviating insomnia severity in clinical samples than in subclinical samples. eHealth-based psychosocial interventions that incorporated guidance from trained therapists had a significantly greater effect on insomnia severity (P=.05) and sleep quality (P=.02) than those with guidance from animated therapists or no guidance. Higher baseline insomnia severity and longer intervention duration were associated with a larger reduction in insomnia severity (P=.004). eHealth-based psychosocial interventions significantly improved each secondary outcome.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              eHealth interventions for insomnia are effective in improving sleep and mental health and can be considered a promising treatment for insomnia. Our findings support the wider dissemination of eHealth interventions and their further promotion in a stepped-care model. Offering blended care could improve treatment effectiveness. Future research needs to elucidate which specific intervention components are most important to achieve intervention effectiveness. Blended eHealth interventions may be tailored to benefit people with low socioeconomic status, limited access to health care, or lack of eHealth literacy.",

Many state governments and health care entities responded by increasing their capacity for telemedicine and disease tracking and creating mobile apps for dissemination of medical information. Our experiences with state-sponsored apps suggest that because many of these eHealth tools did not include community participation, they inadvertently contributed to widening digital health disparities. We propose that, as eHealth tools continue to expand as a form of health care, more attention needs to be given to their equitable distribution, accessibility, and usage. In this viewpoint collaboratively written by a minority-serving community-based organization and an eHealth academic research team, we present our experience participating in a community advisory board working on the dissemination of the COVID Alert NY mobile app to illustrate the importance of public participation in app development. We also provide practical recommendations on how to involve community representatives in the app development process. We propose that transparency and community involvement in the process of app development ultimately increases buy-in, trust, and usage of digital technology in communities where they are needed most.",

Digital therapeutics (DTx) refers to an emerging branch of medicine that delivers medical interventions directly to patients using evidence-based, clinically evaluated, technology-based software algorithms or apps to facilitate disease management, which may be an efficient tool to optimize adherence.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This paper aims to investigate the effect of mobile app–based self-management DTx on long-term use of secondary prevention medications in patients with CHD in China.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              This pilot study was a parallel-designed, open-labeled, single-center, randomized controlled trial. Hospitalized patients with CHD admitted to Peking University First Hospital between April 2016 and June 2017 were randomized before discharge on a 1:1 ratio. The intervention group received regular follow-up combined with DTx, which is a self-management mobile app already installed on an Android 5 (Mi Pad 1, Xiaomi Corporation) tablet. Structured data from the hospital informatics system were integrated automatically, and medication, lifestyle intervention plan, follow-up protocol, and patient education materials were also provided according to the diagnosis. Participants could use DTx for self-management at home. The control group was under conventional hospital–based follow-up care. Patients were followed up for 1 year, and the primary end point was the percentage of all guideline-recommended medications at 12 months. The secondary end points included the percentage adhered to standard secondary prevention medications at 6 months, the control rate of lipid profile, and blood pressure at 6 months and 1 year.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Among 300 randomized patients with CHD, 290 (96.7%) were included in the final analysis, including 49.3% (143/290) and 50.7% (147/290) of patients from the intervention and control groups, respectively. Baseline characteristics were similar between the 2 groups. There was a statistically significant improvement in the percentage of all guideline-recommended medications at 12 months in the intervention group compared with the control group (relative risk [RR] 1.34, 95% CI 1.12-1.61; P=.001), and there was no interaction with baseline characteristics. The intervention group had a significantly higher proportion of patients achieving blood pressure under control (systolic blood pressure <140 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg) and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol <1.8 mmol/L (RR 1.45, 95% CI 1.22-1.72; P<.001 and RR 1.40, 95% CI 1.11-1.75; P=.004, respectively) at 12 months. Furthermore, on logistic regression, the intervention group had a lower risk of withdrawing from guideline-recommended medications (odds ratio 0.46, 95% CI 0.27-0.78; P=.004).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Among patients with CHD, using a mobile app–based self-management DTx in addition to traditional care resulted in a significant improvement in guideline-recommended medication adherence at 12 months.

Increased investments in digital health today will yield unprecedented access to high-quality mental health care. Focusing on personal experiences and projects from our diverse authorship team, we share selected examples of digital health innovations while acknowledging that no single piece can discuss all the impressive global efforts past and present. Exploring the success of telehealth during the present crisis and how technologies like apps can soon play a larger role, we discuss the need for workforce training, high-quality evidence, and digital equity among other factors critical for bending the curve further.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Tobacco smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death and disease worldwide. Digital interventions delivered through smartphones offer a promising alternative to traditional methods, but little is known about their effectiveness.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              Our objective was to test the preliminary effectiveness of Quit Genius, a novel digital therapeutic intervention for smoking cessation.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A 2-arm, single-blinded, parallel-group randomized controlled trial design was used. Participants were recruited via referrals from primary care practices and social media advertisements in the United Kingdom. A total of 556 adult smokers (aged 18 years or older) smoking at least 5 cigarettes a day for the past year were recruited. Of these, 530 were included for the final analysis. Participants were randomized to one of 2 interventions. Treatment consisted of a digital therapeutic intervention for smoking cessation consisting of a smartphone app delivering cognitive behavioral therapy content, one-to-one coaching, craving tools, and tracking capabilities. The control intervention was very brief advice along the Ask, Advise, Act model. All participants were offered nicotine replacement therapy for 3 months. Participants in a random half of each arm were pseudorandomly assigned a carbon monoxide device for biochemical verification. Outcomes were self-reported via phone or online. The primary outcome was self-reported 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 4 weeks post quit date.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 556 participants were randomized (treatment: n=277; control: n=279). The intention-to-treat analysis included 530 participants (n=265 in each arm; 11 excluded for randomization before trial registration and 15 for protocol violations at baseline visit). By the quit date (an average of 16 days after randomization), 89.1% (236/265) of those in the treatment arm were still actively engaged. At the time of the primary outcome, 74.0% (196/265) of participants were still engaging with the app. At 4 weeks post quit date, 44.5% (118/265) of participants in the treatment arm had not smoked in the preceding 7 days compared with 28.7% (76/265) in the control group (risk ratio 1.55, 95% CI 1.23-1.96; P<.001; intention-to-treat, n=530). Self-reported 7-day abstinence agreed with carbon monoxide measurement (carbon monoxide <10 ppm) in 96% of cases (80/83) where carbon monoxide readings were available. No harmful effects of the intervention were observed.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The Quit Genius digital therapeutic intervention is a superior treatment in achieving smoking cessation 4 weeks post quit date compared with very brief advice.\n            \n            \n              Trial Registration\n              International Standard Randomized Controlled Trial Number (ISRCTN) 65853476; https://www.isrctn.com/ISRCTN65853476",

Participants were asked about their use of 11 different COVID-19 information sources as well as their most trusted source of information. The selection of COVID-related knowledge and belief questions was based on past empirical literature and salient concerns at the time of survey implementation.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The sample consisted of 11,242 participants. When combined, traditional media sources (television, radio, podcasts, or newspapers) were the largest sources of COVID-19 information (91.2%). Among those using mainstream media sources for COVID-19 information (n=7811, 69.5%), popular outlets included CNN (24.0%), Fox News (19.3%), and other local or national networks (35.2%). The largest individual information source was government websites (87.6%). They were also the most trusted source of information (43.3%), although the odds of trusting government websites were lower among males (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 0.58, 95% CI 0.53-0.63) and those aged 40-59 years and ≥60 years compared to those aged 18-39 years (AOR 0.83, 95% CI 0.74-0.92; AOR 0.62, 95% CI 0.54-0.71). Participants used an average of 6.1 sources (SD 2.3). Participants who were male, aged 40-59 years or ≥60 years; not working, unemployed, or retired; or Republican were likely to use fewer sources while those with children and higher educational attainment were likely to use more sources. Participants surveyed in April were markedly less likely to use (AOR 0.41, 95% CI 0.35-0.46) and trust (AOR 0.51, 95% CI 0.47-0.56) government sources. The association between information source and COVID-19 knowledge was mixed, while many COVID-19 beliefs were significantly predicted by information source; similar trends were observed with reliance on different types of mainstream media outlets.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              COVID-19 information source was significantly determined by participant sociodemographic characteristics and was also associated with both knowledge and beliefs about the pandemic. Study findings can help inform COVID-19 health communication campaigns and highlight the impact of using a variety of different and trusted information sources.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Digital health coaching is an increasingly common diabetes self-management support strategy for individuals with type 2 diabetes and has been linked to positive mental and physical health outcomes. However, the relationship between baseline risk and outcomes is yet to be evaluated in a real-world setting.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The purpose of this real-world study was to evaluate trends in digital health coaching outcomes by baseline hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) to better understand which populations may experience the greatest clinical and psychosocial benefit.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A retrospective cohort study design was used to evaluate program effect in a convenience sample of participants in a 12-week digital health coaching program administered by Pack Health. Participants were referred through their health care provider, payer, or employer. The program included patient-centered lifestyle counseling and psychosocial support delivered via telephone, text, and/or email. Self-reported HbA1c and weight were collected at baseline and completion. Physical and mental health were assessed using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) Global Health Short Form and the Diabetes Distress Scale-2. Changes in HbA1c, weight, BMI, and physical and mental health were analyzed within three participant cohorts stratified by baseline HbA1c level.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Participants with complete HbA1c data sets (n=226) were included in the analysis. The sample population was 71.7% (162/226) female, with 61.5% (139/226) identifying as white and 34.1% (77/226) as black. Most participants (184/226, 81.4%) reported a baseline HbA1c ≥7%, and 20.3% (46/226) were classified as high risk (HbA1c >9%). Across HbA1c cohorts, the mean baseline BMI was 35.83 (SD 7.79), and the moderate-risk cohort (7% ≤ HbA1c ≤ 9%) reported the highest mean value (36.6, SD 7.79). At 12 weeks, patients reported a significant decrease in HbAlc, and high-risk participants reduced their levels by the greatest margin (2.28 points; P<.001). Across cohorts, BMI improved by 0.82 (P<.001), with the moderate-risk cohort showing the greatest reduction (−0.88; P<.001). Overall, participants reported significant improvements for PROMIS scores, with the greatest change occurring in the high-risk cohort for whom physical health improved 3.84 points (P<.001) and mental health improved 3.3 points (P<.001). However, the lowest-risk cohort showed the greatest improvements in diabetes distress (−0.76; P=.005).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Acknowledging the limitations in this real-world study design, the results reported here suggest that adults with type 2 diabetes with a high baseline HbA1c or high BMI may benefit the most from patient-centered digital health coaching programs when compared to their lower risk counterparts. While all participants improved in physical and mental health categories, participants with high HbA1c experienced the greatest HbA1c reduction and individuals with the highest baseline BMI lost the most weight. These results may be used to inform referrals for patients who are more likely to benefit from digital health coaching.",

      "abstract": "Cybersecurity threats are estimated to cost the world US $6 trillion a year by 2021, and the number of attacks has increased five-fold after COVID-19. Although there is substantial literature on the threats technological vulnerabilities have on the health care industry, less research exists on how pandemics like COVID-19 are opportunistic for cybercriminals. This paper outlines why cyberattacks have been particularly problematic during COVID-19 and ways that health care industries can better protect patient data. The Office for Civil Rights has loosened enforcement of the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act, which, although useful in using new platforms like Zoom, has also loosened physical and technical safeguards to cyberattacks. This is especially problematic given that 90% of health care providers had already encountered data breaches. Companies must implement well-defined software upgrade procedures, should use secure networks like virtual local area networks, and conduct regular penetration tests of their systems. By understanding factors that make individuals, health care organizations, and employers more susceptible to cyberattacks, we can better prepare for the next pandemic.",

This has provided people with ongoing access to vital health services while minimizing their potential exposure to infection and allowing them to maintain social distancing. However, these solutions may have unintended consequences for health equity. Poverty, lack of access to digital health, poor engagement with digital health for some communities, and barriers to digital health literacy are some factors that can contribute to poor health outcomes. We present the Digital Health Equity Framework, which can be used to consider health equity factors. Along with person-centered care, digital health equity should be incorporated into health provider training and should be championed at the individual, institutional, and social levels. Important future directions will be to develop measurement-based approaches to digital health equity and to use these findings to further validate and refine this model.",

The secondary aim is to explore potential effect moderators.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We performed this study according to the Cochrane and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, SCOPUS, and PsycINFO in July 2020. Eligible studies included randomized controlled trials of mHealth interventions targeting PA as a primary outcome in adults. Eligible outcome measures were walking, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), total physical activity (TPA), and energy expenditure. Where reported, we extracted data for 3 time points (ie, end of intervention, follow-up ≤6 months, and follow-up >6 months). To explore effect moderators, we performed subgroup analyses by population, intervention design, and control group type. Results were summarized using random effects meta-analysis. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration tool.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Of the 2828 identified studies, 117 were included. These studies reported on 21,118 participants with a mean age of 52.03 (SD 14.14) years, of whom 58.99% (n=12,459) were female. mHealth interventions significantly increased PA across all the 4 outcome measures at the end of intervention (walking standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.46, 95% CI 0.36-0.55; P<.001; MVPA SMD 0.28, 95% CI 0.21-0.35; P<.001; TPA SMD 0.34, 95% CI 0.20-0.47; P<.001; energy expenditure SMD 0.44, 95% CI 0.13-0.75; P=.01). Only 33 studies reported short-term follow-up measurements, and 8 studies reported long-term follow-up measurements in addition to end-of-intervention results. In the short term, effects were sustained for walking (SMD 0.26, 95% CI 0.09-0.42; P=.002), MVPA (SMD 0.20, 95% CI 0.05-0.35; P=.008), and TPA (SMD 0.53, 95% CI 0.13-0.93; P=.009). In the long term, effects were also sustained for walking (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.10-0.39; P=.001) and MVPA (SMD 0.19, 95% CI 0.11-0.27; P<.001). We found the study population to be an effect moderator, with higher effect scores in sick and at-risk populations. PA was increased both in scalable and nonscalable mHealth intervention designs and regardless of the control group type. The risk of bias was rated high in 80.3% (94/117) of the studies. Heterogeneity was significant, resulting in low to very low quality of evidence.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              mHealth interventions can foster small to moderate increases in PA. The effects are maintained long term; however, the effect size decreases over time. The results encourage using mHealth interventions in at-risk and sick populations and support the use of scalable mHealth intervention designs to affordably reach large populations. However, given the low evidence quality, further methodologically rigorous studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term effects.",

Applying AI chatbots to lifestyle modification programs is one of the promising areas to develop cost-effective and feasible behavior interventions to promote physical activity and a healthy diet.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The purposes of this perspective paper are to present a brief literature review of chatbot use in promoting physical activity and a healthy diet, describe the AI chatbot behavior change model our research team developed based on extensive interdisciplinary research, and discuss ethical principles and considerations.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We conducted a preliminary search of studies reporting chatbots for improving physical activity and/or diet in four databases in July 2020. We summarized the characteristics of the chatbot studies and reviewed recent developments in human-AI communication research and innovations in natural language processing.

The proposed AI chatbot behavior change model consists of the following four components to provide such guidance: (1) designing chatbot characteristics and understanding user background; (2) building relational capacity; (3) building persuasive conversational capacity; and (4) evaluating mechanisms and outcomes. The rationale and evidence supporting the design and evaluation choices for this model are presented in this paper.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              As AI chatbots become increasingly integrated into various digital communications, our proposed theoretical framework is the first step to conceptualize the scope of utilization in health behavior change domains and to synthesize all possible dimensions of chatbot features to inform intervention design and evaluation.

      "abstract": "Background\n              A rising number of conversational agents or chatbots are equipped with artificial intelligence (AI) architecture. They are increasingly prevalent in health care applications such as those providing education and support to patients with chronic diseases, one of the leading causes of death in the 21st century. AI-based chatbots enable more effective and frequent interactions with such patients.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The goal of this systematic literature review is to review the characteristics, health care conditions, and AI architectures of AI-based conversational agents designed specifically for chronic diseases.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We conducted a systematic literature review using PubMed MEDLINE, EMBASE, PyscInfo, CINAHL, ACM Digital Library, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. We applied a predefined search strategy using the terms “conversational agent,” “healthcare,” “artificial intelligence,” and their synonyms. We updated the search results using Google alerts, and screened reference lists for other relevant articles. We included primary research studies that involved the prevention, treatment, or rehabilitation of chronic diseases, involved a conversational agent, and included any kind of AI architecture. Two independent reviewers conducted screening and data extraction, and Cohen kappa was used to measure interrater agreement.A narrative approach was applied for data synthesis.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The literature search found 2052 articles, out of which 10 papers met the inclusion criteria. The small number of identified studies together with the prevalence of quasi-experimental studies (n=7) and prevailing prototype nature of the chatbots (n=7) revealed the immaturity of the field. The reported chatbots addressed a broad variety of chronic diseases (n=6), showcasing a tendency to develop specialized conversational agents for individual chronic conditions. However, there lacks comparison of these chatbots within and between chronic diseases. In addition, the reported evaluation measures were not standardized, and the addressed health goals showed a large range. Together, these study characteristics complicated comparability and open room for future research. While natural language processing represented the most used AI technique (n=7) and the majority of conversational agents allowed for multimodal interaction (n=6), the identified studies demonstrated broad heterogeneity, lack of depth of reported AI techniques and systems, and inconsistent usage of taxonomy of the underlying AI software, further aggravating comparability and generalizability of study results.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The literature on AI-based conversational agents for chronic conditions is scarce and mostly consists of quasi-experimental studies with chatbots in prototype stage that use natural language processing and allow for multimodal user interaction. Future research could profit from evidence-based evaluation of the AI-based conversational agents and comparison thereof within and between different chronic health conditions. Besides increased comparability, the quality of chatbots developed for specific chronic conditions and their subsequent impact on the target patients could be enhanced by more structured development and standardized evaluation processes.",

We included studies involving people aged 18 years or over with one or more of the following chronic conditions: type 2 diabetes, congestive cardiac failure, coronary artery disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and hypertension. Patients were identified as having multi-morbidity if they had an index chronic condition plus one or more other chronic condition. To be included in this review, the telephone coaching had to involve two-way conversations by telephone or video phone between a patient and a provider. Behaviour change, goal setting and empowerment are essential features of coaching.\n\nResults.\nThe review found 1756 papers, which was reduced to 30 after screening and relevance checks. Most coaching services were planned, as opposed to reactive, and targeted patients with complex needs who had one or more chronic disease. Several studies reported improvements in health behaviour, self-efficacy, health status and satisfaction with the service. More than one-third of the papers targeted vulnerable people and telephone coaching was found to be effective for these people.\n\nConclusions.\nTelephone coaching for people with chronic conditions can improve health behaviour, self-efficacy and health status. This is especially true for vulnerable populations who had difficulty accessing health services. There is less evidence for improvements in quality of life and patient satisfaction with the service. The evidence for improvements in health service use was limited. This rapid scoping review found that telephone-based coaching can enhance the management of chronic disease, especially for vulnerable groups. Further work is needed to identify what models of telephone coaching are most effective according to patients’ level of risk and co-morbidity.\n\nWhat is known about the topic?\nWith the increasing prevalence of chronic diseases more demands are being made of limited health services and resources. Telephone health coaching for people with or at risk of chronic diseases is seen as a means of supporting people to manage their health and reducing the burden on the healthcare system.\n\nWhat does this paper add?\nTelephone coaching interventions were effective for vulnerable people with chronic disease(s). Often the vulnerable populations had worse control of their chronic condition at baseline and demonstrated the greatest improvement compared with those with better control at baseline. Planned (i.e. weekly or monthly telephone calls to support the patients with chronic disease) and unscripted telephone coaching interventions appear to be most effective for improving self-management skills in people from vulnerable groups: the planned telephone coaching services had the advantage of regular contact and helping people develop their skills over time, whereas the unscripted aspect allowed the coach to tailor support to the patient’s individual needs\n\nWhat are the implications for practitioners?\nTelephone coaching is an effective means of supporting people with chronic diseases to manage their own health. Further work is needed to embed telephone coaching within existing services. Good linkages with the patient’s general practitioner are important. This might be a regular report, updates via the patient e-health record, or provision for contact if a problem is identified or linking to the patient e-health record.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n            \n              Long wait times, limited resources, and a lack of local options mean that many people with severe obesity cannot access treatment. Face-to-face group-based interventions have been found effective and can treat multiple people simultaneously, but are limited by service capacity. Digital group interventions could reduce wait times, but research on their effectiveness is limited. This systematic review aimed to examine the literature about online group-based interventions for adults with severe obesity (BMI ≥ 35 kg/m\n              2\n              ). The review followed the PRISMA and PICOS frameworks. MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. Two authors independently screened articles. Data extraction, analysis, and quality assessment (using RoB2 and MMAT) was shared between two authors. A meta-analysis was conducted on eligible studies; other results were descriptively analysed. 20 papers reporting on 15 studies were included. Most studies reported some evidence of weight loss, but evidence of weight-related behaviour change was mixed. A meta-analysis on four studies indicated that online, group-based interventions had a statistically significant impact on weight loss (\n              p\n               = 0.001; 95% CI −0.69 to −0.17) with a small-to-moderate effect size, compared to waitlist or standard care conditions. Online interventions were considered more convenient but lack of familiarity with the group or counsellor, accessibility issues, and time constraints hindered engagement. Technical support, incentives, and interactive forums to improve group cohesion could mitigate these barriers. The findings suggested that online, group-based interventions are feasible and potentially beneficial, but barriers such as internet accessibility, digital literacy, and unfamiliarity with group members need to be mitigated. Key recommendations to improve experience and impact include providing instructions and run-throughs, building group cohesion, and providing session and additional content throughout the intervention. Future studies should focus on the influence of specific intervention characteristics and investigate the effect of these interventions compared to face-to-face interventions.

      "abstract": "Background\n              Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) are associated with the burden of premature deaths and huge medical costs globally. There is an increasing number of studies combining a multiple health behavior change (MHBC) intervention paradigm with eHealth approaches to jointly promote weight-related health behaviors among people with NCD; yet, a comprehensive summary of these studies is lacking.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This review aims to meta-analyze the effectiveness and systematically summarize the characteristics of the relevant intervention studies for improving the outcomes of physical activity, healthy diet, and weight among people with NCD.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Following PRISMA guidelines, 4 electronic databases (PsycINFO, PubMed, Scopus, SPORTDiscus) were systematically searched to identify eligible articles based on a series of inclusion and exclusion criteria. Article selection, quality assessment, and data extraction were independently performed by 2 authors. The standardized mean difference (SMD) was calculated to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions for 3 intervention outcomes (physical activity, healthy diet, and weight), and subsequent subgroup analyses were performed for gender, age, intervention duration, channel, and theory. Calculations were conducted, and figures were produced in SPSS 22 and Review Manager 5.3.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Of the 664 original hits generated by the systematic searches, 15 eligible studies with moderate to high quality were included. No potential publication bias was detected using statistical analyses. Studies varied in intervention channel, intensity, and content. The meta-analysis revealed that the eHealth MHBC interventions significantly promoted physical activity (SMD 0.85, 95% CI 0.23 to 1.47, P=.008) and healthy diet (SMD 0.78, 95% CI 0.13 to 1.43, P=.02), but did not contribute to a healthy weight status (SMD –0.13, 95% CI= –0.47 to 0.20, P=.43) among people with NCDs, compared to the control conditions. Results from subgroup analysis indicated that theory-based interventions achieved greater effect than nontheory-based interventions in promoting physical activity, and interventions with traditional approaches (SMS, telephone) were more effective than those with modern internet-based approaches in promoting healthy diet.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The results of this review indicates that eHealth MHBC interventions achieve preliminary success in promoting physical activity and healthy diet behaviors among people with NCD.

Studies were included if they were published between 2009 and June 2019; were written in English; reported on empirical research, regardless of study or publication type; reported on one or more theories in the context of eHealth implementation; and were published in a peer-reviewed journal. A total of 2 reviewers independently assessed the titles, abstracts, and full texts.

The review identified 36 theories used to explain implementation approaches in eHealth. The most commonly used approaches were the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (n=33) and the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) (n=32). These theories were primarily concerned with individual and interpersonal elements of eHealth acceptance. Less common were theories that reflect the various disorderly social processes and structural dimensions of implementation, such as the normalization process theory (n=17) and the structuration theory (n=6).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Theories currently informing the implementation of eHealth interventions predominantly focus on predicting or explaining end-user acceptance. Theoretical perspectives that capture the dense and intricate relationships and structures required to enact sustainable change are less well represented in the eHealth literature. Given the growing acknowledgment of the inherent complexity of eHealth implementation, future research should develop and test models that recognize and reflect the multidimensional, dynamic, and relational nature of this process.",

Additionally, 78% of articles indicated that the coaching occurs in the context of a consistent, ongoing relationship with a human coach who is trained in specific behavior change, communication, and motivational skills.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions:\n              Despite disparities in how health and wellness coaching have been operationalized previously, this systematic review observes an emerging consensus in what is referred to as health and wellness coaching; namely, a patient-centered process that is based upon behavior change theory and is delivered by health professionals with diverse backgrounds. The actual coaching process entails goal-setting determined by the patient, encourages self-discovery in addition to content education, and incorporates mechanisms for developing accountability in health behaviors. With a clear definition for health and wellness coaching, robust research can more accurately assess the effectiveness of the approach in bringing about changes in health behaviors, health outcomes and associated costs that are targeted to reduce the global burden of chronic disease.",

One core challenge for JITAI is the efficient and precise measurement of tailoring variables that are used to inform the timing of momentary intervention delivery. Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is often used for this purpose, even though EMA in its traditional form was not designed specifically to facilitate momentary interventions. In this article, we introduce just-in-time adaptive EMA (JITA-EMA) as a strategy to reduce participant response burden and decrease measurement error when EMA is used as a tailoring variable in JITAI. JITA-EMA builds on computerized adaptive testing methods developed for purposes of classification (computerized classification testing, CCT), and applies them to the classification of momentary states within individuals. The goal of JITA-EMA is to administer a small and informative selection of EMA questions needed to accurately classify an individual’s current state at each measurement occasion. After illustrating the basic components of JITA-EMA (adaptively choosing the initial and subsequent items to administer, adaptively stopping item administration, accommodating dynamically tailored classification cutoffs), we present two simulation studies that explored the performance of JITA-EMA, using the example of momentary fatigue states. Compared with conventional EMA item selection methods that administered a fixed set of questions at each moment, JITA-EMA yielded more accurate momentary classification with fewer questions administered. Our results suggest that JITA-EMA has the potential to enhance some approaches to mobile health interventions by facilitating efficient and precise identification of momentary states that may inform intervention tailoring.",

      "abstract": "Life expectancy in most countries has been increasing continually over the several few decades thanks to significant improvements in medicine, public health, as well as personal and environmental hygiene. However, increased life expectancy combined with falling birth rates are expected to engender a large aging demographic in the near future that would impose significant  burdens on the socio-economic structure of these countries. Therefore, it is essential to develop cost-effective, easy-to-use systems for the sake of elderly healthcare and well-being. Remote health monitoring, based on non-invasive and wearable sensors, actuators and modern communication and information technologies offers an efficient and cost-effective solution that allows the elderly to continue to live in their comfortable home environment instead of expensive healthcare facilities. These systems will also allow healthcare personnel to monitor important physiological signs of their patients in real time, assess health conditions and provide feedback from distant facilities. In this paper, we have presented and compared several low-cost and non-invasive health and activity monitoring systems that were reported in recent years. A survey on textile-based sensors that can potentially be used in wearable systems is also presented. Finally, compatibility of several communication technologies as well as future perspectives and research challenges in remote monitoring systems will be discussed.",

Enthusiasm about such applications is mounting in the field as well as industry. These developments promise to address insufficient mental healthcare system capacity and scale individual access to personalized treatments. However, clinical psychology is an uncommonly high stakes application domain for AI systems, as responsible and evidence-based therapy requires nuanced expertise. This paper provides a roadmap for the ambitious yet responsible application of clinical LLMs in psychotherapy. First, a technical overview of clinical LLMs is presented. Second, the stages of integration of LLMs into psychotherapy are discussed while highlighting parallels to the development of autonomous vehicle technology. Third, potential applications of LLMs in clinical care, training, and research are discussed, highlighting areas of risk given the complex nature of psychotherapy. Fourth, recommendations for the responsible development and evaluation of clinical LLMs are provided, which include centering clinical science, involving robust interdisciplinary collaboration, and attending to issues like assessment, risk detection, transparency, and bias. Lastly, a vision is outlined for how LLMs might enable a new generation of studies of evidence-based interventions at scale, and how these studies may challenge assumptions about psychotherapy.",

This study aimed to assess the long-term effectiveness of a web-based health behaviour change support system (HBCSS) utilizing persuasive systems design (PSD) and methods of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). We have previously demonstrated the two-year effectiveness of the HBCSS.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              \n                In total, 532 participants with overweight or obesity (BMI 27–35 kg m\n                −2\n                ) were split into three groups with different intensities of intervention: CBT-based group counselling, self-help guidance (SHG), and usual care. These groups were further divided into HBCSS and non-HBCSS groups. The HBCSS was a 52-week programme. The follow-up took five years in total.\n              \n            \n            \n              Results\n              \n                Mean weight change (%) (95% CI) from baseline among HBCSS and non-HBCSS users was 1.5 (−0.02 to 2.9),\n                p\n                 = 0.056 and 1.9 (0.3–3.3),\n                p\n                 = 0.005, respectively, at five years.

However, there were significant weight difference favouring HBCSS over the whole 5-year period. The decrease in the need for antihypertensives suggests that the significant weight loss by HBCSS at early years has a health-promoting legacy effect.",

Specifically, young adults in academia are affected by markedly worse mental health status than their peers or adults in other vocations. This situation predisposes to exacerbated disability-adjusted life-years.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We enroled 1,388 students at the baseline, 557 of whom completed follow-up after 6 months, incorporating their demographic information and self-report questionnaires on depressive, anxiety and obsessive–compulsive symptoms. We applied multiple regression modelling to determine associations – at baseline – between demographic factors and self-reported mental health measures and supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the risk of poorer mental health at follow-up, by leveraging the demographic and clinical information collected at baseline.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Approximately one out of five students reported severe depressive symptoms and/or suicidal ideation. An association of economic worry with depression was evidenced both at baseline (when high-frequency worry odds ratio = 3.11 [1.88–5.15]) and during follow-up. The random forest algorithm exhibited high accuracy in predicting the students who maintained well-being (balanced accuracy = 0.85) or absence of suicidal ideation but low accuracy for those whose symptoms worsened (balanced accuracy = 0.49). The most important features used for prediction were the cognitive and somatic symptoms of depression. However, while the negative predictive value of worsened symptoms after 6 months of enrolment was 0.89, the positive predictive value is basically null.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Students’ severe mental health problems reached worrying levels, and demographic factors were poor predictors of mental health outcomes. Further research including people with lived experience will be crucial to better assess students’ mental health needs and improve the predictive outcome for those most at risk of worsening symptoms.",

We conducted an economic evaluation of real-world healthcare-systems data from 27,540 patients receiving care for a mood or an anxiety disorder within the UK National Healthcare Service. Using Markov models built on discrete health states to compare the cost-effectiveness of different interventions, we show that the principal drivers of healthcare cost relate to waiting times and treatment effectiveness. We find that internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy has a ‘dominant’ incremental cost-effectiveness ratio relative to standard care, offering similar clinical effectiveness but with shorter treatment times. In most healthcare systems, the clinical effectiveness of mental healthcare remains unquantified, and long treatment times are common. The potential for these findings to inform mental healthcare policy is substantial, particularly around immediacy of access and the importance of outcomes-focused quality management.",

A cluster randomized, controlled trial was conducted across 19 afterschool sites over two 6-month cohorts to test its efficacy in increasing PA and decreasing sedentary behavior. In the treatment group, a custom virtual dog via a mixed reality kiosk helped children set PA goals while sharing progress with parents to receive feedback and support. Children in the control group set PA goals using a computer without support from the virtual dog or parents. 303 children had 8+ hours of PA data on at least one day of each of the 3 intervention time intervals. Conversion of sedentary time was primarily to light-intensity PA and was strongest for children with low baseline moderate-to-vigorous PA than children above 45 min of baseline moderate-to-vigorous PA. Findings suggest that the VFB ecosystem can promote sustainable PA in children and may be rapidly diffused for widespread public health impact.",

Lack of equitable access to diagnosis and treatment may be improved through new digital health technologies, especially AI/ML, but these may also exacerbate disparities, depending on how bias is addressed. We propose an expanded Total Product Lifecycle (TPLC) framework for healthcare AI/ML, describing the sources and impacts of undesirable bias in AI/ML systems in each phase, how these can be analyzed using appropriate metrics, and how they can be potentially mitigated. The goal of these “Considerations” is to educate stakeholders on how potential AI/ML bias may impact healthcare outcomes and how to identify and mitigate inequities; to initiate a discussion between stakeholders on these issues, in order to ensure health equity along the expanded AI/ML TPLC framework, and ultimately, better health outcomes for all.",

This review aimed to provide an overview of the cost-effectiveness of IMIs for mental disorders and symptoms. A systematic search was conducted for trial-based economic evaluations published before 10th May 2021. Electronic databases (including MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, PSYNDEX, and NHS Economic Evaluations Database) were searched for randomized controlled trials examining IMIs targeting mental disorders and symptoms and conducting a full health economic evaluation. Methodological quality and risk of bias were assessed. Cost-effectiveness was assumed at or below £30,000 per quality-adjusted life year gained. Of the 4044 studies, 36 economic evaluations were reviewed. Guided IMIs were likely to be cost-effective in depression and anxiety. The quality of most evaluations was good, albeit with some risks of bias. Heterogeneity across studies was high because of factors such as different costing methods, design, comparison groups, and outcomes used. IMIs for anxiety and depression have potential to be cost-effective. However, more research is needed into unguided (preventive) IMIs with active control conditions (e.g., treatment as usual) and longer time horizon across a wider range of disorders.\n            \n              Trial registration:\n              PROSPERO Registration No. CRD42018093808.",

However, the biomedical data inequality between different ethnic groups is set to generate new health care disparities through data-driven, algorithm-based biomedical research and clinical decisions. Using an extensive set of machine learning experiments on cancer omics data, we find that current prevalent schemes of multiethnic machine learning are prone to generating significant model performance disparities between ethnic groups. We show that these performance disparities are caused by data inequality and data distribution discrepancies between ethnic groups. We also find that transfer learning can improve machine learning model performance for data-disadvantaged ethnic groups, and thus provides an effective approach to reduce health care disparities arising from data inequality among ethnic groups.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n            Recent growth in digital technologies has enabled the recruitment and monitoring of large and diverse populations in remote health studies. However, the generalizability of inference drawn from remotely collected health data could be severely impacted by uneven participant engagement and attrition over the course of the study. We report findings on long-term participant retention and engagement patterns in a large multinational observational digital study for depression containing active (surveys) and passive sensor data collected via Android smartphones, and Fitbit devices from 614 participants for up to 2 years. Majority of participants (67.6%) continued to remain engaged in the study after 43 weeks. Unsupervised clustering of participants’ study apps and Fitbit usage data showed 3 distinct engagement subgroups for each data stream. We found: (i) the least engaged group had the highest depression severity (4 PHQ8 points higher) across all data streams; (ii) the least engaged group (completed 4 bi-weekly surveys) took significantly longer to respond to survey notifications (3.8 h more) and were 5 years younger compared to the most engaged group (completed 20 bi-weekly surveys); and (iii) a considerable proportion (44.6%) of the participants who stopped completing surveys after 8 weeks continued to share passive Fitbit data for significantly longer (average 42 weeks). Additionally, multivariate survival models showed participants’ age, ownership and brand of smartphones, and recruitment sites to be associated with retention in the study. Together these findings could inform the design of future digital health studies to enable equitable and balanced data collection from diverse populations.",

The need to re-invent, re-organize and transform healthcare and co-ordinate clinical services at a population level is urgent as countries that controlled initial outbreaks start to experience resurgences. A wide range of digital health solutions have been proposed, although the extent of successful real-world applications of these technologies is unclear. This study aims to review applications of artificial intelligence (AI), telehealth, and other relevant digital health solutions for public health responses in the healthcare operating environment amidst the COVID-19 pandemic. A systematic scoping review was performed to identify potentially relevant reports. Key findings include a large body of evidence for various clinical and operational applications of telehealth (40.1%,\n              n\n               = 99/247). Although a large quantity of reports investigated applications of artificial intelligence (AI) (44.9%,\n              n\n               = 111/247) and big data analytics (36.0%,\n              n\n               = 89/247), weaknesses in study design limit generalizability and translation, highlighting the need for more pragmatic real-world investigations. There were also few descriptions of applications for the internet of things (IoT) (2.0%,\n              n\n               = 5/247), digital platforms for communication (DC) (10.9%, 27/247), digital solutions for data management (DM) (1.6%,\n              n\n               = 4/247), and digital structural screening (DS) (8.9%,\n              n\n               = 22/247); representing gaps and opportunities for digital public health. Finally, the performance of digital health technology for operational applications related to population surveillance and points of entry have not been adequately evaluated.",

A systematic literature review was performed using multiple databases (PsycInfo, PubMed and MEDLINE). The inclusion criteria comprised randomised controlled trials of CBT for lifestyle changes in patients with obesity and/or type 2 diabetes. The quality of study reporting was assessed with the revised Cochrane Collaboration’s risk of bias tool. A meta-analysis was conducted on studies with appropriate outcomes. Nine randomised controlled trials, with a total sample size of 902 participants, met the inclusion criteria. The meta-analysis has shown a medium, significant effect size of CBT interventions for weight loss and weight maintenance, and a low, non-significant effect size of CBT interventions for reducing glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels. A separate, combined, meta-analysis for all nine calculated effect sizes has yielded a medium and significant overall effect size for the model. Our review of the studies about the effectiveness of CBT in implementing lifestyle changes has, in comparison to usual control groups, proven the efficacy of CBT interventions in implementing lifestyle changes, especially for weight loss and weight maintenance.",

A program designed to increase awareness of one’s present levels of well-being and suggest personalized health behaviors may reduce anxiety and improve mental well-being in students. The efficacy of a digital version of such a program, providing biofeedback and therapeutic content based on personalized well-being metrics, is reported here.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The aim of this study was to test the efficacy and sustained effects of using a mobile app (BioBase) and paired wearable device (BioBeam), compared with a waitlist control group, on anxiety and well-being in university students with elevated levels of anxiety and stress.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              The study employed a randomized, waitlist-controlled trial with assessments at baseline, 2 weeks, postintervention (4 weeks), and follow-up (6 weeks).

      "abstract": "Background\n              Type 2 diabetes affects 30 million Americans, representing a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Self-management support is an important component of chronic illness care and is a key pillar of the chronic care model. Face-to-face teaching and patient education materials suffer from being static or incompatible with mobile lifestyles. Digital apps provide a self-management support alternative that is convenient and scalable.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This pilot study tested the real-world deployment of a self-guided mobile app for diabetes education (Time2Focus app; MicroMass Communications Inc, Cary, NC), which utilizes evidence-based content and gamification to deliver an interactive learning experience.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Primary care providers were approached for permission to invite their patients to participate. Eligible patients were 18 to 89 years of age, had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes, hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) ≥8% and <12% in the past 3 months, an active online patient portal account (tied to the electronic health record), and access to an iOS or Android smartphone. Interested patients were emailed a baseline survey, and once this was completed, were sent instructions for downloading the Time2Focus app. After completing all 12 levels, participants were sent a follow-up survey. The primary outcome was the change in HbA1c. Secondary outcomes included medication adherence, self-care activities, self-reporting of physical activities, diabetes self-efficacy, illness perceptions, diabetes distress scale, and users’ engagement with and rating of the app.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Of 1355 potentially eligible patients screened, 201 were consented. Of these 201 patients, 101 (50.2%) did not download the app. Of the 100 participants (49.8%) who downloaded the app, 16 (16.0%) completed 0 levels, 26 (26.0%) completed 1 to 4 levels, 10 (10.0%) completed 5 to 11 levels, and 48 (48.0%) completed all 12 levels of the app and the follow-up survey. Those completing one or more levels had a mean pre/post-HbA1c change of –0.41% (compared to –0.32% among those who completed zero levels); however, the unadjusted two-tailed t test indicated no significant difference between the two groups (P=.73). Diabetes self-efficacy showed a large and significant increase during app usage for completers (mean change 1.28, P<.001, d=.83). Severity of illness perceptions showed a small but significant decrease during app usage for completers (mean change –0.51, P=.004, d=.43). Diabetes distress showed a small but significant decrease during app usage for completers (mean change –0.45, P=.006, d=.41). The net promoter score was 62.5, indicating that those who completed all levels of the app rated it highly and would recommend it to others.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Participants who engaged in all 12 levels of the Time2Focus mobile app showed an improvement in diabetes self-efficacy and a decrease in severity of illness perceptions. The decrease in HbA1c observed in app users relative to nonusers during this limited pilot study was not statistically significant. However, uptake and application of lessons learned from self-management support may be delayed. Further research is needed to address how to increase engagement through self-management support and to investigate if follow up over a longer period demonstrates a significant change in outcomes such as HbA1c.",

ECG12Net is an 82-layer convolutional neural network that estimates serum K+ concentration. Six clinicians—three emergency physicians and three cardiologists—participated in human-machine competition.

Moreover, in detecting hypokalemia and hyperkalemia, the sensitivities were 96.7% and 83.3%, respectively, and the specificities were 93.3% and 97.8%, respectively. In a test set including 13,222 ECGs, ECG12Net had a similar performance in terms of sensitivity for severe hypokalemia (95.6%) and severe hyperkalemia (84.5%), with a mean absolute error of 0.531.

      "abstract": "Researchers and practitioners of digital behavior change interventions (DBCI) use varying and, often, incongruent definitions of the term “engagement,” thus leading to a lack of precision in DBCI measurement and evaluation. The objective of this paper is to propose discrete definitions for various types of user engagement and to explain why precision in the measurement of these engagement types is integral to ensuring the intervention is effective for health behavior modulation. Additionally, this paper presents a framework and practical steps for how engagement can be measured in practice and used to inform DBCI design and evaluation. The key purpose of a DBCI is to influence change in a target health behavior of a user, which may ultimately improve a health outcome. Using available literature and practice-based knowledge of DBCI, the framework conceptualizes two primary categories of engagement that must be measured in DBCI. The categories are health behavior engagement, referred to as “Big E,” and DBCI engagement, referred to as “Little e.” DBCI engagement is further bifurcated into two subclasses: (1) user interactions with features of the intervention designed to encourage frequency of use (ie, simple login, games, and social interactions) and make the user experience appealing, and (2) user interactions with behavior change intervention components (ie, behavior change techniques), which influence determinants of health behavior and subsequently influence health behavior. Achievement of Big E in an intervention delivered via digital means is contingent upon Little e. If users do not interact with DBCI features and enjoy the user experience, exposure to behavior change intervention components will be limited and less likely to influence the behavioral determinants that lead to health behavior engagement (Big E). Big E is also dependent upon the quality and relevance of the behavior change intervention components within the solution. Therefore, the combination of user interactions and behavior change intervention components creates Little e, which is, in turn, designed to improve Big E. The proposed framework includes a model to support measurement of DBCI that describes categories of engagement and details how features of Little e produce Big E. This framework can be applied to DBCI to support various health behaviors and outcomes and can be utilized to identify gaps in intervention efficacy and effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Pervasive games aim to create more fun and engaging experiences by mixing elements from the real world into the game world. Because they intermingle with players’ lives and naturally promote more casual gameplay, they could be a powerful strategy to stimulate physical activity among older adults. However, to use these games more effectively, it is necessary to understand how design elements of the game affect player behavior.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The aim of this study was to evaluate how the presence of a specific design element, namely social interaction, would affect levels of physical activity.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Participants were recruited offline and randomly assigned to control and intervention groups in a single-blind design. Over 4 weeks, two variations of the same pervasive game were compared: with social interaction (intervention group) and with no social interaction (control group). In both versions, players had to walk to physical locations and collect virtual cards, but the social interaction version allowed people to collaborate to obtain more cards. Changes in the weekly step counts were used to evaluate the effect on each group, and the number of places visited was used as an indicator of play activity.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 20 participants were recruited (no social interaction group, n=10; social interaction group, n=10); 18 participants remained active until the end of the study (no social interaction group, n=9; social interaction group, n=9). Step counts during the first week were used as the baseline level of physical activity (no social interaction group: mean 46,697.2, SE 7905.4; social interaction group: mean 45,967.3, SE 8260.7). For the subsequent weeks, changes to individual baseline values (absolute/proportional) for the no social interaction group were as follows: 1583.3 (SE 3108.3)/4.6% (SE 7.2%) (week 2), 591.5 (SE 2414.5)/2.4% (SE 4.7%) (week 3), and −1041.8 (SE 1992.7)/0.6% (SE 4.4%) (week 4). For the social interaction group, changes to individual baseline values were as follows: 11520.0 (SE 3941.5)/28.0% (SE 8.7%) (week 2), 9567.3 (SE 2631.5)/23.0% (SE 5.1%) (week 3), and 7648.7 (SE 3900.9)/13.9% (SE 8.0%) (week 4). The result of the analysis of the group effect was significant (absolute change: η2=0.31, P=.04; proportional change: η2=0.30, P=.03). Correlations between both absolute and proportional change and the play activity were significant (absolute change: r=0.59, 95% CI 0.32 to 0.77; proportional change: r=0.39, 95% CI 0.08 to 0.64).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The presence of social interaction design elements in pervasive games appears to have a positive effect on levels of physical activity.\n            \n            \n              Trial Registration\n              Japan Medical Association Clinical Trial Registration Number JMA-IIA00314; https://tinyurl.com/y5nh6ylr (Archived by WebCite at http://www.webcitation.org/761a6MVAy)",

After a short overview of three dominant methods for calculating the SROI, a case examining the implementation of an SROI study at a nationally recognized Boston-based nonprofit operating workforce development programs is presented to illuminate the methodological dilemmas across the arc of an SROI study. The case analysis centers on four key decision points in the implementation of the SROI study: identification of stakeholders, development of a method for estimating social value creation, determination of the time horizons, and selection of the discount rates. Next, to highlight the challenges in making comparisons across organizations, the second source of data is presented—a set of Yale SOM MBA student assignments conducting an SROI on a written case study found in the literature on workforce development. The student project results showcase how even when conducting SROI assessments on the same focal organization, the SROI calculation can vary widely depending on the outcome of the four decision points delineated above. The paper consequently offers two levels of analysis. First, it provides a detailed methodological overview of the reigning approaches to conducting an SROI. Second, it provides an assessment of the challenges to using SROI as a performance metric at this stage of the field’s development. Implications for use of the SROI are discussed from both the perspective of funders and the perspective of nonprofit organizations.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n            The fourth industrial revolution has led to the development and application of health monitoring sensors that are characterized by digitalization and intelligence. These sensors have extensive applications in medical care, personal health management, elderly care, sports, and other fields, providing people with more convenient and real-time health services. However, these sensors face limitations such as noise and drift, difficulty in extracting useful information from large amounts of data, and lack of feedback or control signals. The development of artificial intelligence has provided powerful tools and algorithms for data processing and analysis, enabling intelligent health monitoring, and achieving high-precision predictions and decisions. By integrating the Internet of Things, artificial intelligence, and health monitoring sensors, it becomes possible to realize a closed-loop system with the functions of real-time monitoring, data collection, online analysis, diagnosis, and treatment recommendations. This review focuses on the development of healthcare artificial sensors enhanced by intelligent technologies from the aspects of materials, device structure, system integration, and application scenarios. Specifically, this review first introduces the great advances in wearable sensors for monitoring respiration rate, heart rate, pulse, sweat, and tears; implantable sensors for cardiovascular care, nerve signal acquisition, and neurotransmitter monitoring; soft wearable electronics for precise therapy. Then, the recent advances in volatile organic compound detection are highlighted. Next, the current developments of human-machine interfaces, AI-enhanced multimode sensors, and AI-enhanced self-sustainable systems are reviewed. Last, a perspective on future directions for further research development is also provided. In summary, the fusion of artificial intelligence and artificial sensors will provide more intelligent, convenient, and secure services for next-generation healthcare and biomedical applications.",

Digital solutions can potentially improve efficiency and quality of care, but these initiatives struggle with nonusage attrition. Machine learning methods have been proven to predict dropouts in other settings but lack implementation in health care.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aimed to gain insight into the causes of attrition for patients in an electronic health (eHealth) intervention for chronic lifestyle diseases and evaluate if attrition can be predicted and consequently prevented. We aimed to build predictive models that can identify patients in a digital lifestyle intervention at high risk of dropout by analyzing several predictor variables applied in different models and to further assess the possibilities and impact of implementing such models into an eHealth platform.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Data from 2684 patients using an eHealth platform were iteratively analyzed using logistic regression, decision trees, and random forest models.

Due to the interdisciplinary nature of this topic, knowledge and technologies from different research areas are required. Up to now, it is not clear how the knowledge from those fields is combined in actual applications. A comprehensive analysis that systematically maps and explores the use of knowledge within this emerging interdisciplinary field is required.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aims to provide an overview of the research area around the design and development of digital technologies for health behavior change and to explore trends and patterns.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A bibliometric analysis is used to provide an overview of the field, and a scoping review is presented to identify the trends and possible gaps. The study is based on the publications related to persuasive technologies and health behavior change in the last 18 years, as indexed by the Web of Science and Scopus (317 and 314 articles, respectively). In the first part, regional and time-based publishing trends; research fields and keyword co-occurrence networks; influential journals; and collaboration network between influential authors, countries, and institutions are examined. In the second part, the behavioral domains, technological means and theoretical foundations are investigated via a scoping review.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The literature reviewed shows a clear and emerging trend after 2001 in technology-based behavior change, which grew exponentially after the introduction of the smartphone around 2009. Authors from the United States, Europe, and Australia have the highest number of publications in the field. The three most active research areas are computer science, public and occupational health, and psychology. The keyword “mhealth” was the dominant term and predominantly used together with the term “physical activity” and “ehealth”. A total of three strong clusters of coauthors have been found. Nearly half of the total reported papers were published in three journals. The United States, the United Kingdom, and the Netherlands have the highest degree of author collaboration and a strong institutional network. Mobile phones were most often used as a technology platform, regardless of the targeted behavioral domain. Physical activity and healthy eating were the most frequently targeted behavioral domains. Most articles did not report about the behavior change techniques that were applied. Among the reported behavior change techniques, goal setting and self-management were the most frequently reported.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Closer cooperation and interaction between behavioral sciences and technological areas is needed, so that theoretical knowledge and new technological advancements are better connected in actual applications. Eventually, this could result in a larger societal impact, an increase of the effectiveness of digital technologies for health behavioral change, and more insight in the relationship between behavioral change strategies and persuasive technologies' effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n            \n              Background\n              Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is a collaborative research approach that engages academic researchers and community stakeholders as equal partners in all research steps to address community concerns and achieve health equity. The CBPR approach has been widely used in vaccination promotion programmes. However, the elements and steps of CBPR-based programmes varied among studies. The purpose of this scoping review was to synthesize the elements and steps, and establish an implementation framework to guide the utilisation of CBPR approaches in vaccination promotion.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              This scoping review was performed in accordance with Arksey and O’Malley’s five-stage framework. A systematic search was conducted on a set of electronic databases and grey literature sources. The retrieved articles were screened according to the criteria of CBPR and vaccination promotion, and data were extracted and recorded on a calibrated and predefined form in terms of study characteristics and CBPR components. Two authors worked independently to complete literature search, study selection, and data extraction. A narrative summary was used in categorising characteristics, and the contents of the included studies were summarised through qualitative analysis.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 8557 publications were initially screened, and 23 articles were finally included. According to the CBPR conceptual model, the elements in each CBPR component specifically for vaccination promotion included (1) the establishment of community–academic partnership (CAP)s, (2) community capacity building by partner training vaccination knowledge, research literacy, and service abilities and skills, (3) development and implementation of community-based intervention and (4) Outcome evaluation. A CAP was established between academic researchers or institutes and eight types of partners, including community service organisation–related non-government organisations (NGOs), health service institution–related NGOs, religious organisations, government agencies, educational institutions, media agencies, business agencies, and community representatives. The maintenance of CAP was achieved with four key strategies, namely, strengthening communication, forming management groups, sharing resources and information, and providing incentives. Twelve studies provided comprehensive insights into the strategies employed for intervention development, utilising either quantitative surveys, qualitative methods or a combination of both approaches. The contents of interventions included health service supports, health education activities, social marketing campaigns, community mobilisation, interactive discussions, vaccination reminders and incentives. As for outcome evaluation, vaccination rate and the effectiveness of interventions were assessed. A considerable increase was observed in 95.7% of the included studies (22/23), and the highest increase (92.9%) was attained after the intervention. An implementation framework was generated to summarise the elements and steps of CBPR approaches for vaccination promotion.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This review summarised current evidence and generated an implementation framework to elucidate the elements and steps in the development and application of CBPR approaches in vaccination promotion. CBPR approaches are recommended for future vaccination promotion programmes, involving community stakeholders and research professionals, to ensure equitable access to vaccinations across diverse populations.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Ongoing pain is one of the most common diseases and has major physical, psychological, social, and economic impacts. A mobile health intervention utilizing a fully automated text-based health care chatbot (TBHC) may offer an innovative way not only to deliver coping strategies and psychoeducation for pain management but also to build a working alliance between a participant and the TBHC.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The objectives of this study are twofold: (1) to describe the design and implementation to promote the chatbot painSELfMAnagement (SELMA), a 2-month smartphone-based cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) TBHC intervention for pain self-management in patients with ongoing or cyclic pain, and (2) to present findings from a pilot randomized controlled trial, in which effectiveness, influence of intention to change behavior, pain duration, working alliance, acceptance, and adherence were evaluated.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Participants were recruited online and in collaboration with pain experts, and were randomized to interact with SELMA for 8 weeks either every day or every other day concerning CBT-based pain management (n=59), or weekly concerning content not related to pain management (n=43). Pain-related impairment (primary outcome), general well-being, pain intensity, and the bond scale of working alliance were measured at baseline and postintervention. Intention to change behavior and pain duration were measured at baseline only, and acceptance postintervention was assessed via self-reporting instruments. Adherence was assessed via usage data.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              From May 2018 to August 2018, 311 adults downloaded the SELMA app, 102 of whom consented to participate and met the inclusion criteria. The average age of the women (88/102, 86.4%) and men (14/102, 13.6%) participating was 43.7 (SD 12.7) years. Baseline group comparison did not differ with respect to any demographic or clinical variable. The intervention group reported no significant change in pain-related impairment (P=.68) compared to the control group postintervention. The intention to change behavior was positively related to pain-related impairment (P=.01) and pain intensity (P=.01). Working alliance with the TBHC SELMA was comparable to that obtained in guided internet therapies with human coaches. Participants enjoyed using the app, perceiving it as useful and easy to use. Participants of the intervention group replied with an average answer ratio of 0.71 (SD 0.20) to 200 (SD 58.45) conversations initiated by SELMA. Participants’ comments revealed an appreciation of the empathic and responsible interaction with the TBHC SELMA. A main criticism was that there was no option to enter free text for the patients’ own comments.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              SELMA is feasible, as revealed mainly by positive feedback and valuable suggestions for future revisions. For example, the participants’ intention to change behavior or a more homogenous sample (eg, with a specific type of chronic pain) should be considered in further tailoring of SELMA.\n            \n            \n              Trial Registration\n              German Clinical Trials Register DRKS00017147; https://tinyurl.com/vx6n6sx, Swiss National Clinical Trial Portal: SNCTP000002712; https://www.kofam.ch/de/studienportal/suche/70582/studie/46326.",

      "abstract": "The rapid proliferation of health informatics and digital health innovations has revolutionized clinical and research practices. There is no doubt that these fields will continue to have accelerated growth and a substantial impact on population health. However, there are legitimate concerns about how these promising technological advances can lead to unintended consequences such as perpetuating health and health care disparities for underresourced populations. To mitigate this potential pitfall, it is imperative for the health informatics and digital health scientific communities to understand the challenges faced by disadvantaged groups, including racial and ethnic minorities, which hinder their achievement of ideal health. This paper presents illustrative exemplars as case studies of contextually tailored, sociotechnical mobile health interventions designed with community members to address health inequities using community-engaged research approaches. We strongly encourage researchers and innovators to integrate community engagement into the development of data-driven, modernized solutions for every sector of society to truly achieve health equity for all.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Theory of Change (ToC) has become an established approach to design and evaluate interventions. While ToC should—in line with the growing international focus on evidence-informed health decision-making–consider explicit approaches to incorporate evidence, there is limited guidance on how this should be done. This rapid review aims to identify and synthesize the available literature on how to systematically use research evidence when developing or adapting ToCs in the health sector.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A rapid review methodology using a systematic approach, was designed. Eight electronic databases were consulted to search for peer-reviewed and gray publications detailing tools, methods, and recommendations promoting the systematic integration of research evidence in ToCs. The included studies were compared, and the findings summarized qualitatively into themes to identify key principles, stages, and procedures, guiding the systematic integration of research evidence when developing or revising a ToC.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              This review included 18 studies. The main sources from which evidence was retrieved in the ToC development process were institutional data, literature searches, and stakeholder consultation. There was a variety of ways of finding and using evidence in ToC. Firstly, the review provided an overview of existing definitions of ToC, methods applied in ToC development and the related ToC stages. Secondly, a typology of 7 stages relevant for evidence integration into ToCs was developed, outlining the types of evidence and research methods the included studies applied for each of the proposed stages.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              This rapid review adds to the existing literature in two ways. First, it provides an up-to-date and comprehensive review of the existing methods for incorporating evidence into ToC development in the health sector. Second, it offers a new typology guiding any future endeavors of incorporating evidence into ToCs.",

      "abstract": "Mobile phone-based interventions have been proposed as a means for reducing the burden of disease associated with mental illness. While numerous randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses have investigated this possibility, evidence remains unclear. We conducted a systematic meta-review of meta-analyses examining mobile phone-based interventions tested in randomized controlled trials. We synthesized results from 14 meta-analyses representing 145 randomized controlled trials and 47,940 participants. We identified 34 effect sizes representing unique pairings of participants, intervention, comparisons, and outcome (PICO) and graded the strength of the evidence as using umbrella review methodology. We failed to find convincing evidence of efficacy (i.e.,\n              n\n              > 1000,\n              p\n              < 10\n              −6\n              ,\n              I\n              2\n              < 50%, absence of publication bias); publication bias was rarely assessed for the representative effect sizes. Eight effect sizes provided highly suggestive evidence (i.e.,\n              n\n              > 1000,\n              p\n              < 10\n              −6\n              ), including smartphone interventions outperforming inactive controls on measures of psychological symptoms and quality of life (\n              d\n              s = 0.32 to 0.47) and text message-based interventions outperforming non-specific controls and active controls for smoking cessation (\n              d\n              s = 0.31 and 0.19, respectively). The magnitude of effects and strength of evidence tended to diminish as comparison conditions became more rigorous (i.e., inactive to active, non-specific to specific). Four effect sizes provided suggestive evidence, 14 effect sizes provided weak evidence, and eight effect sizes were non-significant. Despite substantial heterogeneity, no moderators were identified. Adverse effects were not reported. Taken together, results support the potential of mobile phone-based interventions and highlight key directions to guide providers, policy makers, clinical trialists, and meta-analysts working in this area.",

Likewise, psychological conditions such as anxiety and depression can elevate the risk of developing chronic diseases. The objective of the study was to examine the prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depression in individuals with chronic diseases, as well as to identify the chronic disease with the highest prevalence among all chronic conditions and the factors associated with stress, anxiety, and depression.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              In our study, the prevalence rate of stress, anxiety, and depression in patients having chronic diseases was found to be 68.7%, 51.1%, and 58.8%, respectively. The chronic diseases which are included in this study are cardiovascular diseases, metabolic disorders, cancer, respiratory disorders, degenerative disorders, chronic kidney disease, and chronic liver disorders. Among these diseases, cardiovascular disease patients were found to have the highest prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depression. The psychosocial determinants that can trigger stress, anxiety, and depression were analyzed. The factors like age, marital status, primary caretakers of the patient, social isolation, length of hospital stay, social relationships, number of frequent visits to the hospital/month, and the lifestyle of the patient have a significant association with the levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. Factors like monthly income and educational status were also found to be statistically significant with the stress levels, and length of intensive care unit (ICU) stay was significantly associated with the levels of anxiety.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              In conclusion, this study found a high prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depression among patients with chronic disease(s). Among all the chronic diseases, cardiovascular disease patients were found to have the highest prevalence of stress, anxiety, and depression. In addition, our study also identified several psychosocial factors that contribute to the development of these mental health conditions which exacerbate the present chronic condition of the patient. These findings highlight the importance of considering the impact of chronic disease on mental health problems.",

      "abstract": "COVID-19 has tragically taken the lives of more than 6.5 million people globally, significantly challenging healthcare systems and service delivery, especially in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). This systematic review aims to: (1) evaluate the feasibility of telemedicine interventions for COVID-19 management; (2) assess the adoption of telemedicine interventions during the COVID-19 pandemic; (3) examine the cost-effectiveness of telemedicine implementation efforts and (4) analyze the sustainability of telemedicine interventions for COVID-19 disease management within LMIC service settings. We reviewed studies from selected public health and health science databases, focusing on those conducted in countries classified as low and middle-income by the World Bank, using telemedicine for confirmed COVID-19 cases, and adhering to Proctor’s framework for implementation outcomes. Of the 766 articles identified and 642 screened, only 3 met all inclusion criteria. These studies showed reduced reliance on antibiotics, prescription drugs, and emergency department referrals among telemedicine patients. Statistical parity was observed in the length of stay, diagnostic test ordering rates, and International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-10 diagnoses between telemedicine and in-person visits. Telemedicine interventions designed for post-COVID physical rehabilitation demonstrated safety, sustainability, and enhanced quality of life for patients without requiring specialized equipment, proving adaptable across contexts with appropriate technology. These interventions were also economically sustainable and cost-effective for healthcare systems as a whole. Proposed strategies to bridge implementation gaps include community-level assessments, strategic planning, multisectoral partnerships of local hospital administration and lawmakers, legal consultations, and healthcare informatics improvements. Increased investment in telemedicine research focusing on infectious disease management is crucial for the continued development and refinement of effective strategies tailored to resource-constrained regions.",

      "abstract": "An estimated 5.0 million children aged under 5 years died in 2020, with 82% of these deaths occurring in sub-Saharan Africa and southern Asia. Over one-third of Mumbai’s population has limited access to healthcare, and child health outcomes are particularly grave among the urban poor. We describe the implementation of a digital technology-based child health programme in Mumbai and evaluate its holistic impact. Using an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered mobile health platform, we developed a programme for community-based management of child health. Leveraging an existing workforce, community health workers (CHW), the programme was designed to strengthen triage and referral, improve access to healthcare in the community, and reduce dependence on hospitals. A Social Return on Investment (SROI) framework is used to evaluate holistic impact. The programme increased the proportion of illness episodes treated in the community from 4% to 76%, subsequently reducing hospitalisations and out-of-pocket expenditure on private healthcare providers. For the total investment of Indian Rupee (INR) 2,632,271, the social return was INR 34,435,827, delivering an SROI ratio of 13. The annual cost of the programme per child was INR 625. Upskilling an existing workforce such as CHWs, with the help of AI-driven decision- support tools, has the potential to extend capacity for critical health services into community settings. This study provides a blueprint for evaluating the holistic impact of health technologies using evidence-based tools like SROI. These findings have applicability across income settings, offering clear rationale for the promotion of technology-supported interventions that strengthen healthcare delivery.",

Whether mental health promotion and prevention interventions provide value for money in children, adolescents, adults, and older adults is unclear. The aim of the current study is to update 2 existing reviews of cost-effectiveness studies in this field in order to determine whether such interventions are cost-effective.\n            \n            \n              Methods and findings\n              Electronic databases (including MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and EconLit through EBSCO and Embase) were searched for published cost-effectiveness studies of prevention of mental disorders and promotion of mental health and well-being from 2008 to 2020. The quality of studies was assessed using the Quality of Health Economic Studies Instrument (QHES). The protocol was registered with PROSPERO (# CRD42019127778). The primary outcomes were incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) or return on investment (ROI) ratio across all studies.\n              A total of 65 studies met the inclusion criteria of a full economic evaluation, of which, 23 targeted children and adolescents, 35 targeted adults, while the remaining targeted older adults. A large number of studies focused on prevention of depression and/or anxiety disorders, followed by promotion of mental health and well-being and other mental disorders. Although there was high heterogeneity in terms of the design among included economic evaluations, most studies consistently found that interventions for mental health prevention and promotion were cost-effective or cost saving. The review found that targeted prevention was likely to be cost-effective compared to universal prevention. Screening plus psychological interventions (e.g., cognitive behavioural therapy [CBT]) at school were the most cost-effective interventions for prevention of mental disorders in children and adolescents, while parenting interventions and workplace interventions had good evidence in mental health promotion. There is inconclusive evidence for preventive interventions for mental disorders or mental health promotion in older adults. While studies were of general high quality, there was limited evidence available from low- and middle-income countries.\n              The review was limited to studies where mental health was the primary outcome and may have missed general health promoting strategies that could also prevent mental disorder or promote mental health. Some ROI studies might not be included given that these studies are commonly published in grey literature rather than in the academic literature.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Our review found a significant growth of economic evaluations in prevention of mental disorders or promotion of mental health and well-being over the last 10 years. Although several interventions for mental health prevention and promotion provide good value for money, the varied quality as well as methodologies used in economic evaluations limit the generalisability of conclusions about cost-effectiveness. However, the finding that the majority of studies especially in children, adolescents, and adults demonstrated good value for money is promising. Research on cost-effectiveness in low-middle income settings is required.\n            \n            \n              Trial registration\n              \n                PROSPERO registration number:\n                CRD42019127778\n                .",

      "abstract": "Mental health problems in the workplace are common and have a considerable impact on employee wellbeing and productivity. Mental ill-health costs employers between £33 billion and £42 billion a year. According to a 2020 HSE report, roughly 2,440 per 100,000 workers in the UK were affected by work-related stress, depression, or anxiety, resulting in an estimated 17.9 million working days lost. We performed a systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) to assess the effect of tailored digital health interventions provided in the workplace aiming to improve mental health, presenteeism and absenteeism of employees. We searched several databases for RCTs published from 2000 onwards. Data were extracted into a standardised data extraction form. The quality of the included studies was assessed using the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool. Due to the heterogeneity of outcome measures, narrative synthesis was used to summarise the findings. Seven RCTs (eight publications) were included that evaluated tailored digital interventions versus waiting list control or usual care to improve physical and mental health outcomes and work productivity. The results are promising to the advantage of tailored digital interventions regarding presenteeism, sleep, stress levels, and physical symptoms related to somatisation; but less for addressing depression, anxiety, and absenteeism. Even though tailored digital interventions did not reduce anxiety and depression in the general working population, they significantly reduced depression and anxiety in employees with higher levels of psychological distress. Tailored digital interventions seem more effective in employees with higher levels of distress, presenteeism or absenteeism than in the general working population. There was high heterogeneity in outcome measures, especially for work productivity; this should be a focus of attention in future studies.",

PRISM provides researchers a pragmatic and intuitive model to improve translation of research interventions into clinical and community practice. Since 2008, the use of PRISM increased across diverse topics, populations, and settings. This citation analysis and scoping systematic review aimed to assess the use of the PRISM framework and to make recommendations for future research.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A literature search was conducted using three databases (PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus) for the period of 2008 and September 2020. After exclusion, reverse citation searches and invitations to experts in the field were used to identify and obtain recommendations for additional articles not identified in the original search. Studies that integrated PRISM into their study design were selected for full abstraction. Unique research studies were abstracted for information on study characteristics (e.g., setting/population, design), PRISM contextual domains, and RE-AIM outcomes.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 180 articles were identified to include PRISM to some degree. Thirty-two articles representing 23 unique studies integrated PRISM within their study design. Study characteristics varied widely and included studies conducted in diverse contexts, but predominately in high-income countries and in clinical out-patient settings. With regards to use, 19 used PRISM for evaluation, 10 for planning/development, 10 for implementation, four for sustainment, and one for dissemination. There was substantial variation across studies in how and to what degree PRISM contextual domains and RE-AIM outcomes were operationalized and connected. Only two studies directly connected individual PRISM context domains with RE-AIM outcomes, and another four included RE-AIM outcomes without direct connection to PRISM domains.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This is the first systematic review of the use of PRISM in various contexts. While there were low levels of ‘integrated’ use of PRISM and few reports on linkage to RE-AIM outcomes, most studies included important context domains of implementation and sustainability infrastructure and external environment. Recommendations are provided for more consistent and comprehensive use of and reporting on PRISM to inform both research and practice on contextual factors in implementation.",

Journal articles were selected that had been published in English with a randomized controlled trial design using a usual care comparison group, and in which the primary intervention component was delivered by telehealth. Relevant outcome measures were glycaemic control and one or more of the following diabetes self-care areas: diet, physical activity, blood glucose self-monitoring (BGSM) or medication adherence. Interventions were excluded if they were primarily based on telemonitoring. The search retrieved 1027 articles, from which 49 were selected based on their title and abstract. Fourteen articles (reporting 1 3 studies) met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. Four studies reported significant improvements in glycaemic control. Five of eight studies on dietary adherence reported significant treatment effects, as did five of eight on physical activity, four of nine on blood glucose self-monitoring, and three of eight on medication adherence. Overall, behavioural telehealth interventions show promise in improving the diabetes self-care and glycaemic control of people with type 2 diabetes.",

There is a broad literature on program sustainability in public health, but it is fragmented and there is a lack of consensus on core constructs. The purpose of this paper is to present a new conceptual framework for program sustainability in public health.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              \n                This developmental study uses a comprehensive literature review, input from an expert panel, and the results of concept-mapping to identify the core domains of a conceptual framework for public health program capacity for sustainability. The concept-mapping process included three types of participants (scientists, funders, and practitioners) from several public health areas (\n                e\n                .\n                g\n                ., tobacco control, heart disease and stroke, physical activity and nutrition, and injury prevention).\n              \n            \n            \n              Results\n              The literature review identified 85 relevant studies focusing on program sustainability in public health. Most of the papers described empirical studies of prevention-oriented programs aimed at the community level. The concept-mapping process identified nine core domains that affect a program’s capacity for sustainability: Political Support, Funding Stability, Partnerships, Organizational Capacity, Program Evaluation, Program Adaptation, Communications, Public Health Impacts, and Strategic Planning. Concept-mapping participants further identified 93 items across these domains that have strong face validity—89% of the individual items composing the framework had specific support in the sustainability literature.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The sustainability framework presented here suggests that a number of selected factors may be related to a program’s ability to sustain its activities and benefits over time. These factors have been discussed in the literature, but this framework synthesizes and combines the factors and suggests how they may be interrelated with one another. The framework presents domains for public health decision makers to consider when developing and implementing prevention and intervention programs. The sustainability framework will be useful for public health decision makers, program managers, program evaluators, and dissemination and implementation researchers.",

Developing effective interventions necessitates a theoretical model that can identify barriers and enablers for healthy eating and physical activity among young adults to support weight management. This study empirically examines the utility of the COM-B model as a framework for intervention planning across two behavioural contexts: eating and physical activity.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A cross-sectional survey research design was employed to empirically test the COM-B model in the contexts of young adult’s eating and physical activity behaviours. Informed by the Theoretical Domains Framework, pre-validated measures appropriate for capturing the latency of the COM (Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation) constructs were sourced. Both surveys (eating and physical activity) were administered online to two independent samples of young adults aged 18–35 years. Models were specified and tested using structural equation modelling.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              \n                A total of 582 (mean age = 22.8 years; 80.3% female) and 455 (mean age = 24.9 years; 80.8% female) participants were included in the physical activity and eating analyses, respectively. The COM-B model explained 31% of variance in physical activity behaviour and 23% of variance in eating behaviour. In the physical activity model (\n                N\n                 = 582), capability and opportunity were found to be associated with behaviour through the mediating effect of motivation. In the eating model (\n                N\n                 = 455), capability was found to be associated with behaviour through the mediating effect of motivation.

Barriers and enablers underlying young adult’s physical activity and eating behaviours were identified that represent potential targets for future intervention design. Further research is needed to validate present study findings across different populations and settings.",

      "abstract": "We draw on genetics research to argue that complex psychological phenomena are most likely determined by a multitude of causes and that any individual cause is likely to have only a small effect. Building on this, we highlight the dangers of a publication culture that continues to demand large effects. First, it rewards inflated effects that are unlikely to be real and encourages practices likely to yield such effects. Second, it overlooks the small effects that are most likely to be real, hindering attempts to identify and understand the actual determinants of complex psychological phenomena. We then explain the theoretical and practical relevance of small effects, which can have substantial consequences, especially when considered at scale and over time. Finally, we suggest ways in which scholars can harness these insights to advance research and practices in psychology (i.e., leveraging the power of big data, machine learning, and crowdsourcing science; promoting rigorous preregistration, including prespecifying the smallest effect size of interest; contextualizing effects; changing cultural norms to reward accurate and meaningful effects rather than exaggerated and unreliable effects). Only once small effects are accepted as the norm, rather than the exception, can a reliable and reproducible cumulative psychological science be built.",

Using the best one to meet the needs of an mHealth study is a challenge for researchers. Therefore, this study aimed to review and determine the frequently used questionnaires for evaluating the mentioned outcomes of mHealth services.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              The PubMed database was searched for conducting this review in April 2021.

This is the first study to our knowledge to examine the cost-effectiveness of a commercial physical activity app (\n                Carrot Rewards\n                ) despite there being over 100,000 in the major app stores.\n              \n            \n            \n              Methods\n              \n                A cost-effectiveness analysis was performed to calculate the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of the app compared to a no-intervention reference scenario using a five-year time horizon. Primary data was collected between 2016 and 2017. Data synthesis, model creation, and statistical analyses were conducted between 2019 and 2020.

Subgroup analyses revealed that the app had lower ICERs for British Columbians, females, highly engaged users, and adults aged 35-64 yrs., and was dominant for older adults (65 + yrs). Deterministic sensitivity analyses revealed that the ICER was most influenced by the relative risk of diabetes.

      "abstract": "Objective\n              Smartphone apps (apps) are widely recognised as promising tools for improving access to mental healthcare. However, a key challenge is the development of digital interventions that are acceptable to end users. Co-production with providers and stakeholders is increasingly positioned as the gold standard for improving uptake, engagement, and healthcare outcomes. Nevertheless, clear guidance around the process of co-production is lacking. The objectives of this review were to: (i) present an overview of the methods and approaches to co-production when designing, producing, and evaluating digital mental health interventions; and (ii) explore the barriers and facilitators affecting co-production in this context.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A pre-registered (CRD42023414007) systematic review was completed in accordance with The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines. Five databases were searched. A co-produced bespoke quality appraisal tool was developed with an expert by experience to assess the quality of the co-production methods and approaches. A narrative synthesis was conducted.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Twenty-six studies across 24 digital mental health interventions met inclusion criteria. App interventions were rarely co-produced with end users throughout all stages of design, development, and evaluation. Co-producing digital mental health interventions added value by creating culturally sensitive and acceptable interventions. Reported challenges included resource issues exacerbated by the digital nature of the intervention, variability across stakeholder suggestions, and power imbalances between stakeholders and researchers.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Variation in approaches to co-producing digital mental health interventions is evident, with inconsistencies between stakeholder groups involved, stage of involvement, stakeholders’ roles and methods employed.",

However, the effectiveness of mHealth in developing countries remains unclear. Based on this fact, we conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the impact of mHealth on countries with different levels of economic development. To this end, we searched Pubmed, ResearchGate, Embase and Cochrane databases for articles published from January 2008 to June 2019. All of the studies included were randomized controlled trials. A meta-analysis was performed using the Stata software. A total of 51 articles (including 13 054 participants) were eligible for our systematic review and meta-analysis. We discovered that mHealth intervention did not only play a major role in improving clinical outcomes compared with conventional care, but also had a positive impact on countries with different levels of economic development. More importantly, our study also found that clinical outcomes could be ameliorated even further by combining mHealth with human intelligence rather than using mHealth intervention exclusively. According to our analytical results, mHealth intervention could be used as a treatment strategy to optimize the management of diabetes and hypertension in countries with different levels of economic development.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n            Health risk behaviors are leading contributors to morbidity, premature mortality associated with chronic diseases, and escalating health costs. However, traditional interventions to change health behaviors often have modest effects, and limited applicability and scale. To better support health improvement goals across the care continuum, new approaches incorporating various smart technologies are being utilized to create more individualized digital behavior change interventions (DBCIs). The purpose of this study is to identify context-aware DBCIs that provide individualized interventions to improve health. A systematic review of published literature (2013–2020) was conducted from multiple databases and manual searches. All included DBCIs were context-aware, automated digital health technologies, whereby user input, activity, or location influenced the intervention. Included studies addressed explicit health behaviors and reported data of behavior change outcomes. Data extracted from studies included study design, type of intervention, including its functions and technologies used, behavior change techniques, and target health behavior and outcomes data. Thirty-three articles were included, comprising mobile health (mHealth) applications, Internet of Things wearables/sensors, and internet-based web applications. The most frequently adopted behavior change techniques were in the groupings of feedback and monitoring, shaping knowledge, associations, and goals and planning. Technologies used to apply these in a context-aware, automated fashion included analytic and artificial intelligence (e.g., machine learning and symbolic reasoning) methods requiring various degrees of access to data. Studies demonstrated improvements in physical activity, dietary behaviors, medication adherence, and sun protection practices. Context-aware DBCIs effectively supported behavior change to improve users’ health behaviors.",

However, the efficacy of multi-component interventions involving a combination of these three components has not been established. The aims of this review were to systematically review and meta-analyze the evidence on multi-component (diet + aerobic exercise + resistance training) lifestyle interventions for type 2 diabetes prevention. Eight electronic databases (Medline, Embase, SportDiscus, Web of Science, CINAHL, Informit health collection, Cochrane library and Scopus) were searched up to June 2013. Eligible studies 1) recruited prediabetic adults or individuals at risk of type 2 diabetes; 2) conducted diet and exercise [including both physical activity/aerobic\n              and\n              resistance training] programs; and 3) reported weight and plasma glucose outcomes. In total, 23 articles from eight studies were eligible including five randomized controlled trials, one quasi-experimental, one two-group comparison and one single-group pre-post study. Four studies had a low risk of bias (score ≥ 6/10). Median intervention length was 12 months (range 4–48 months) with a follow-up of 18 months (range 6.5 - 48 months). The diet and exercise interventions varied slightly in terms of their specific prescriptions. Meta-analysis favored interventions over controls for weight loss (-3.79 kg [-6.13, -1.46; 95% CI], Z = 3.19, P = 0.001) and fasting plasma glucose (-0.13 mmol.L\n              -1\n              [-0.24, -0.02; 95% CI], Z = 2.42, P = 0.02). Diabetes incidence was only reported in two studies, with reductions of 58% and 56% versus control groups. In summary, multi-component lifestyle type 2 diabetes prevention interventions that include diet and both aerobic and resistance exercise training are modestly effective in inducing weight loss and improving impaired fasting glucose, glucose tolerance, dietary and exercise outcomes in at risk and prediabetic adult populations. These results support the current exercise guidelines for the inclusion of resistance training in type 2 diabetes prevention, however there remains a need for more rigorous studies, with long-term follow-up evaluating program efficacy, muscular fitness outcomes, diabetes incidence and risk reduction.",

Yet most health promotion research has addressed risk factors as categorically separate entities, and little is known about how to effectively promote multiple health behavior change (MHBC). This review summarizes the recent literature (January 2004 to December 2009) on randomized clinical trials evaluating MHBC interventions for primary prevention. Combining all the studies across all the reviews, fewer than 150 studies were identified. This is a fraction of the number of trials conducted on changing individual behavioral risks. Three primary behavioral clusters dominated: (1) the energy balance behaviors of physical activity and diet; (2) addictive behaviors like smoking and other drugs; and (3) disease-related behaviors, specifically cardiovascular disease (CVD) and cancer related. Findings were largely disappointing for studies of diet and physical activity, particularly with youth. Treating 2 addictions, including smoking, resulted in greater long-term sobriety from alcohol and illicit drugs. MHBC intervention effects were stronger and more consistent for cancer prevention than CVD prevention. MHBC interventions offer a new paradigm for broader, more comprehensive health promotion; however, the potential value in maximizing intervention impact is largely unmet.",

Bangladesh has one of the largest numbers of adults with diabetes in the South Asian region. This paper describes the planned economic evaluation of a three-arm cluster randomised control trial of mHealth and community mobilisation interventions to prevent and control T2DM and non-communicable diseases’ risk factors in rural Bangladesh (D-Magic trial).\n            \n            \n              Methods and analysis\n              The economic evaluation will be conducted as a within-trial analysis to evaluate the incremental costs and health outcomes of mHealth and community mobilisation interventions compared with the status quo. The analyses will be conducted from a societal perspective, assessing the economic impact for all parties affected by the interventions, including implementing agencies (programme costs), healthcare providers, and participants and their households. Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) will be calculated in terms of cost per case of intermediate hyperglycaemia and T2DM prevented and cost per case of diabetes prevented among individuals with intermediate hyperglycaemia at baseline and cost per mm Hg reduction in systolic blood pressure. In addition to ICERs, the economic evaluation will be presented as a cost–consequence analysis where the incremental costs and all statistically significant outcomes will be listed separately. Robustness of the results will be assessed through sensitivity analyses.

There was a widely shared belief that Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health (HITECH) had catalyzed the creation of a digital infrastructure, which was being used in innovative ways to improve quality of care and curtail costs. There were however major concerns about the poor usability of electronic health records (EHRs), their limited ability to support multi-disciplinary care, and major difficulties with health information exchange, which undermined efforts to deliver integrated patient-centered care. Proposed strategies for enhancing the benefits of HIT included federal stimulation of competition by mandating vendors to open-up their application program interfaces, incenting development of low-cost consumer informatics tools, and promoting Congressional review of the The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPPA) to optimize the balance between data privacy and reuse. Many underscored the need to “kick the legs from underneath the fee-for-service model” and replace it with a data-driven reimbursement system that rewards high quality care.\n            Conclusions The HITECH Act has stimulated unprecedented, multi-stakeholder interest in HIT. Early experiences indicate that the resulting digital infrastructure is being used to improve quality of care and curtail costs. Reform efforts are however severely limited by problems with usability, limited interoperability and the persistence of the fee-for-service paradigm—addressing these issues therefore needs to be the federal government’s main policy target.",

      "abstract": "Digital health interventions – interventions delivered over digital media to support the health of users – are becoming increasingly prevalent. Utilising an intervention development framework can increase the efficacy of digital interventions for health-related behaviours. This critical review aims to outline and review novel behaviour change frameworks that guide digital health intervention development. Our comprehensive search for preprints and publications used PubMed, PsycINFO, Scopus, Web of Science and the Open Science Framework repository. Articles were included if they: (1) were peer-reviewed; (2) proposed a behaviour change framework to guide digital health intervention development; (3) were written in English; (4) were published between 1/1/19 and 1/8/2021; and (5) were applicable to chronic diseases. Intervention development frameworks considered the user, intervention elements and theoretical foundations. However, the timing and policy of interventions are not consistently addressed across frameworks. Researchers should deeply consider the digital applicability of behaviour change frameworks to improve intervention success.",

A measure of treatment fidelity was previously developed and validated using these categories.\n            \n            \n              Results:\n              Strategies for assessment, monitoring, and enhancing treatment fidelity within each of the five treatment fidelity domains are discussed. The previously created measure of treatment fidelity is updated to include additional items on selecting providers, additional confounders, theory testing, and multicultural considerations.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions:\n              Implementation of a treatment fidelity plan may require extra staff time and costs. However, the economic and scientific costs of lack of attention to treatment fidelity are far greater than the costs of treatment fidelity implementation. Maintaining high levels of treatment fidelity with flexible adaptation according to setting, provider, and patient is the goal for public health trials.",

Just‐in‐time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) aim to deliver tailored support at moments of need or opportunity. We aimed to synthesize evidence on decision points, tailoring variables, intervention options, decision rules, study designs, user engagement and effectiveness of technology‐mediated JITAIs for reducing harmful substance use.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              \n                Systematic review of empirical studies of any design with a narrative synthesis.

JITAIs targeted alcohol (S = 7,\n                n\n                 = 120 520), tobacco (S = 4,\n                n\n                 = 187), cannabis (S = 2,\n                n\n                 = 97) and a combination of alcohol and illicit substance use (S = 1,\n                n\n                 = 63), and primarily relied on active measurement and static (i.e. time‐invariant) decision rules to deliver support tailored to micro‐scale changes in mood or urges. Two studies used data from prior participants and four drew upon theory to devise decision rules. Engagement with available JITAIs was moderate‐to‐high and evidence of effectiveness was mixed. Due to substantial heterogeneity in study designs and outcome variables assessed, no meta‐analysis was performed. Many studies reported insufficient detail on JITAI infrastructure, content, development costs and data security.\n              \n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Current implementations of just‐in‐time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) for reducing harmful substance use rely on active measurement and static decision rules to deliver support tailored to micro‐scale changes in mood or urges.

      "abstract": "This study investigated the features and usefulness of mobile app-based health promotion programs for the general population. A comprehensive bibliographic search of studies on health promotion programs using mobile apps in peer-reviewed journals published in English up to November 2017 was performed using the PubMed, Embase, and CINAHL databases. The inclusion criteria were (1) randomized control trial designs; (2) assessed mobile app-based interventions to promote adult health conditions; 12 studies were ultimately included. The most common topics were diet and physical activity (n = 8) and overall healthy lifestyle improvement (n = 4). The purpose of the apps included providing feedback on one’s health status (n = 9) and monitoring individual health status or behavior change (n = 9). Across all studies, health outcomes were shown to be better for mobile app users compared to non-users. Mobile app-based health interventions may be an effective strategy for improving health promotion behaviors in the general population without diseases. This study suggests that mobile app use is becoming commonplace for a variety of health-promoting behaviors in addition to physical activity and weight control. Future research should address the feasibility and effectiveness of using mobile apps for health promotion in developing countries.",

The researchers included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) that investigated the effectiveness of app-based interventions in health management among diabetic patients. Reviewers were paired and independently conducted the screening of studies, data extraction, and evaluation of study quality. The primary outcome of interest was the modification of hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c). The researchers utilized a random effects model to calculate the weighted mean differences (WMDs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) and used the I\n                2\n                statistic to assess study heterogeneity.

      "abstract": "Background\n              There is a growing recognition of the need to effectively assess the social value of public health interventions through a wider, comprehensive approach, capturing their social, economic and environmental benefits, outcomes and impacts. Social Return on Investment (SROI) is a methodological approach which incorporates all three aspects for evaluating interventions. Mental health problems are one of the leading causes of ill health and disability worldwide. This study aims to map existing evidence on the social value of mental health interventions that uses the SROI methodology.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A scoping evidence search was conducted on Medline, PubMed, Google Scholar and relevant gray literature, published in English between January 2000 and March 2021 to identify studies which capture the SROI of mental health interventions in high- and middle-income countries. Studies that reported mental health outcomes and an SROI ratio were included in this review. The quality of included studies was assessed using Krlev's 12-item quality assessment framework.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The search identified a total of 435 records; and 42 of them with varying quality met the study inclusion criteria. Most of the included studies (93%) were non-peer reviewed publicly available reports, predominantly conducted in the United Kingdom (88%); and majority (60%) of those studies were funded by charity/non-for-profit organizations. Out of 42 included studies, 22 were targeted toward individuals experiencing mental health problems and the remainder 20 were targeted to vulnerable groups or the general population to prevent, or reduce the risk of poor mental health. Eighty-one percent of included studies were graded as high quality studies based on Krlev's 12-item quality assessment framework. The reported SROI ratios of the included studies ranged from £0.79 to £28.00 for every pound invested.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              This scoping review is a first of its kind to focus on SROI of mental health interventions, finding a good number of SROI studies that show a positive return on investment of the identified interventions. This review illustrates that SROI could be a useful tool and source of evidence to help inform policy and funding decisions for investment in mental health and wellbeing, as it accounts for the wider social, economic and environmental benefits of public health interventions. More SROI research in the area of public health is needed to expand the evidence base and develop further the methodology.",

Health outcomes were expressed in terms of quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Costs were assessed from a health provider perspective (£2010/11 prices). Data to populate the model were derived from systematic literature reviews and the literature searches of economic evaluations that were conducted for national guidelines. Deterministic and probability sensitivity analyses explored the uncertainty in parameter estimates including short-term mental health gains associated with PA.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Compared with usual care, BA is more expensive, incurring additional costs of £806 809 but it is more effective leading to 466 QALYs gained in the total cohort, a QALY gain of 0.0047/person. The incremental cost per QALY of BA is £1730 (including mental health gains) and thus can be considered cost-effective at a threshold of £20 000/QALY. Most changes in assumptions resulted in the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) falling at or below £12 000/QALY gained. However, when short-term mental health gains were excluded the ICER was £27 000/QALY gained. The probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that, at a threshold of £20 000/QALY, there was a 99.9% chance that BA would be cost-effective.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              BA is a cost-effective way to improve PA among adults, provided short-term mental health gains are considered. Further research is required to provide more accurate evidence on factors contributing to the cost-effectiveness of BA.",

Social participation and physical activity are key in promoting well-being for older people. The Health Precinct is a community hub in North Wales that people with chronic conditions are referred to through social prescribing.

Social Return on Investment (SROI) analysis was used to evaluate the Health Precinct. Stakeholders included participants aged 55+, participants’ families, staff, the National Health Service and local government. Participants’ health and well-being data were collected upon referral and four months later using the EQ-5D-5L, Campaign to End Loneliness Scale and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. Family members completed questionnaires at four months. Baseline data were collected for 159 participants. Follow-up data were available for 66 participants and 38 family members. The value of inputs was £55,389 (attendance fees, staffing, equipment, overheads), and the value of resulting benefits was £281,010; leading to a base case SROI ratio of £5.07 of social value generated for every £1 invested. Sensitivity analysis yielded estimates of between 2.60:1 and 5.16:1.",

Implementation and scale-up of these interventions need to consider the value for money. This scoping review aimed to assess the volume of (i) systematic review evidence regarding economic evaluations of physical activity interventions, and (ii) of cost utility analysis (CUA) studies (trial- or model-based) of physical activity interventions for older people.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We searched five databases (January 2010 to February 2022) for systematic reviews of economic evaluations, and two databases (1976 to February 2022) for CUA studies of physical activity interventions for any population of people aged 60+ years.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              We found 12 potential reviews, two of which were eligible for inclusion. The remaining 10 reviews included eligible individual studies that were included in this review. All individual studies from the 12 reviews (n = 37) investigated the cost-effectiveness of structured exercise and most showed the intervention was more costly but more effective than no intervention. We identified 27 CUA studies: two investigated a physical activity promotion program and the remainder investigated structured exercise. Most interventions (86%) were more costly but more effective, and the remaining were cost-saving compared to no intervention.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              There is a scarcity of reviews investigating the value for money of physical activity interventions for older adults. Most studies investigated structured exercise. Physical activity interventions were generally more effective than no intervention but more costly. As such an intervention could be cost-effective and therefore worthy of wider implementation, but there is a need for more frequent economic evaluation in this field.",

A cross-sectional study was conducted among n = 609 adults (females = 76.4%; mean age = 30.26; SD age = 9.90). An assessment of the factorial structure of the Italian version was carried out using exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The four factors identified by Throuvala and colleagues were confirmed (i.e., attention impulsiveness, online vigilance, multitasking and emotion regulation). Reliability was assessed using Cronbach’s alpha coefficient (0.703–0.889). The scale’s scores showed significant linear correlations with validated instruments, including the Mobile Phone Problematic Use Scale (MPPUS)and the Cognitive Failures Questionnaire (CFQ). A multivariate analysis of variance showed significant differences in the means among participants belonging to different age groups (born before 1995 vs. born after 1996). In summary, the good psychometric properties observed led us to assume that this instrument can be applied and used in Italian studies to assess the cognitive dimension of distraction related to the use of smartphones.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Digital therapeutics (DTx) are software-driven interventions that provide personalized, evidence-based treatments for various medical conditions. China’s rapid technological adoption, large population, and supportive government policies position it as a potential global leader in DTx. However, challenges remain in clinical trial standardization, regulatory approval, product development, and reimbursement models. A comprehensive assessment of clinical evidence, commercialization trends, and regulatory frameworks is essential for understanding China’s evolving DTx ecosystem and its global implications.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study systematically reviews and analyzes the DTx landscape in China, focusing on clinical trials, commercial products, regulatory frameworks, and pricing and reimbursement models. The findings provide insights for countries aiming to develop, regulate, and integrate DTx solutions into health care systems.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              This comprehensive review integrates multiple methodological approaches to examine different aspects of the DTx ecosystem in China. We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate clinical trials, searching PubMed, Google Scholar, IEEE, Web of Science, and ScienceDirect until July 2024. Meta-analyses used random-effects models, reporting results as standardized mean differences (SMDs) and 95% CIs. For commercial products, a scoping review using the National Medical Products Administration database was performed. Regulatory policies were systematically identified through a manual review of official government sources, while pricing and reimbursement models were analyzed through a comprehensive assessment of public and private insurance policies, government initiatives, and commercial pathways.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              : A total of 96 clinical trials on DTx in China were identified, with cognitive disorders (n=21, 22%) and diabetes (n=20, 21%) being the most frequently studied, followed by cardiovascular diseases (n=8, 8%), sleeping disorders (n=6, 6%), and smoking cessation (n=6, 6%). Meta-analysis for diabetes DTx showed a trend toward improved hemoglobin A1c levels in digital intervention groups compared to controls (SMD −0.96, 95% CI −2.03 to 0.11) but did not reach statistical significance (I²=97%). Meta-analysis for cognitive disorder DTx showed significant improvement in global cognitive function in DTx-treated participants (SMD 0.65, 95% CI 0.37-0.94), despite notable heterogeneity (I²=71.7%). The commercial landscape analysis identified 97 active DTx solutions, primarily targeting cognitive impairment (38 companies), ophthalmic diseases (30 companies), and respiratory diseases (5 companies). The regulatory review highlighted China’s reliance on general medical device policies under the National Medical Products Administration rather than DTx-specific regulations, with emerging regional innovation policies supporting industry growth. Pricing analysis revealed diverse reimbursement models, including value-based pricing, private insurance partnerships, and government-facilitated programs.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              China has made substantial progress in DTx development but still faces challenges in clinical trial standardization, regulatory approval, and reimbursement. Key factors driving DTx adoption include targeted indications, standardized clinical trials, streamlined regulation, and diversified pricing models. China’s experience provides valuable lessons for other countries with emerging digital health ecosystems as they develop DTx research, regulations, and integration strategies.\n            \n            \n              Trial Registration\n              PROSPERO CRD42024615584; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPERO/view/CRD42024615584",

This viewpoint explores the innovative applications of digital therapeutics in the assessment, intervention, management, and monitoring of cognitive disorders while highlighting key challenges that impede their widespread integration into clinical practice. Drawing on the definition of cognitive digital therapeutics (CDTx) and the multistakeholder collaboration required for its development and implementation, this paper examines the role of digital technologies in cognitive health and explores challenges from multiple perspectives, including clinical practice, policy framework, user adoption, ethics and privacy, and data interoperability and system integration. In addition, this viewpoint offers strategic recommendations to address the challenges and future prospects of CDTx, emphasizing the importance of multistakeholder collaboration, prioritizing user-centered design, and leveraging emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence to enhance the scalability, sustainability, and future integration of CDTx.",

To date, health professionals’ views on the use of this technology have received limited attention in the literature.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The purpose of this study was to gain a better understanding of how health professionals view the use of conversational agents for health care.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Physicians, nurses, and regulated mental health professionals were recruited using various web-based methods. Participants were interviewed individually using the Zoom (Zoom Video Communications, Inc) videoconferencing platform. Interview questions focused on the potential benefits and risks of using conversational agents for health care, as well as the best way to integrate conversational agents into the health care system. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and uploaded to NVivo (version 12; QSR International, Inc) for thematic analysis.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 24 health professionals participated in the study (19 women, 5 men; mean age 42.75, SD 10.71 years). Participants said that the use of conversational agents for health care could have certain benefits, such as greater access to care for patients or clients and workload support for health professionals. They also discussed potential drawbacks, such as an added burden on health professionals (eg, program familiarization) and the limited capabilities of these programs. Participants said that conversational agents could be used for routine or basic tasks, such as screening and assessment, providing information and education, and supporting individuals between appointments. They also said that health professionals should have some oversight in terms of the development and implementation of these programs.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The results of this study provide insight into health professionals’ views on the use of conversational agents for health care, particularly in terms of the benefits and drawbacks of these programs and how they should be integrated into the health care system.

No conceptual model exists for examining the roles that social media can play with respect to population health.\n            We present a novel framework to guide the investigation and assessment of the effects of social media on public health: the SPHERE (Social media and Public Health Epidemic and REsponse) continuum. This model illustrates the functions of social media across the epidemic–response continuum, ranging across contagion, vector, surveillance, inoculant, disease control, and treatment.\n            We also describe attributes of the communications, diseases and pathogens, and hosts that influence whether certain functions dominate over others. Finally, we describe a comprehensive set of outcomes relevant to the evaluation of the effects of social media on the public’s health.",

The human capital approach was used to estimate productivity losses from morbidity and premature mortality due to cardiovascular conditions.\n            \n            \n              RESULTS:\n              One in 3 US adults received care for a cardiovascular risk factor or condition in 2020. Annual inflation-adjusted (2022 US dollars) health care costs of cardiovascular risk factors are projected to triple between 2020 and 2050, from $400 billion to $1344 billion. For cardiovascular conditions, annual health care costs are projected to almost quadruple, from $393 billion to $1490 billion, and productivity losses are projected to increase by 54%, from $234 billion to $361 billion. Stroke is projected to account for the largest absolute increase in costs. Large relative increases among the Asian American population (497%) and Hispanic American population (489%) reflect the projected increases in the size of these populations.\n            \n            \n              CONCLUSIONS:\n              The economic burden of cardiovascular risk factors and overt cardiovascular disease in the United States is projected to increase substantially in the coming decades. Development and deployment of cost-effective programs and policies to promote cardiovascular health are urgently needed to rein in costs and to equitably enhance population health.",

Mobile health (mHealth) applications can support patients in independently managing hypertension and maintaining better control over their blood pressure.\nObjective: This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of MaRiTensi mobile application in improving knowledge, motivation, self-efficacy, and self-care among patients with hypertension, as well as in lowering blood pressure.\nMethods: A two-arm randomized controlled trial with a single-blind evaluator was conducted among 108 patients with hypertension, recruited from a private hospital and two health centers in Yogyakarta, Indonesia. The 12-week study was implemented from October 2023 to April 2024. Participants were randomly assigned to the intervention group, which used the MaRiTensi app, or the control group, which received usual care. Primary outcomes—knowledge, self-care, self-efficacy, and motivation—were measured using a validated questionnaire, while the secondary outcome—blood pressure—was assessed through clinical measurement. Ninety-nine participants completed the study and were included in the analysis. Repeated measures ANOVA was used to evaluate within-group changes over time. Intergroup comparisons were analyzed using the chi-square test, independent t-test, or Mann–Whitney U test.\nResults: No significant baseline differences were found between the two groups (p >0.05). Significant improvements were observed in knowledge, self-care, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure in both groups (p <0.01). Self-efficacy significantly improved only in the intervention group (p <0.01). No significant changes in motivation were observed over time in either group (p >0.05). Significant between-group differences were found at the first evaluation for self-care (p = 0.005; d = 0.58), self-efficacy (p = 0.011; d = 0.52), motivation (p = 0.026; d = 0.44), systolic pressure (p = 0.039; d = 0.42), and diastolic pressure (p = 0.009; d = 0.54), and at the second evaluation for self-care (p = 0.024; d = 0.46).\nConclusions: MaRiTensi may effectively improve self-care, self-efficacy, and blood pressure control among patients with hypertension, although it showed limited impact on knowledge and motivation. The application shows promise as a nursing intervention, but further research is needed to assess its long-term effectiveness and sustainability.\nTrial Registry Number: NCT06049862 [ClinicalTrials.gov]",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), marked by dyspnea, cough, and sputum production, significantly impairs patients’ quality of life and functionality. Effective management strategies, particularly those empowering patients to manage their condition, are essential to reduce this burden and health care use. Digital health interventions—such as mobile apps for symptom tracking, wearable sensors for vital sign monitoring, and web-based pulmonary rehabilitation programs—can enhance self-efficacy and promote greater patient engagement. By improving self-management skills, these interventions also help alleviate pressure on health care systems.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This systematic review and meta-analysis assesses the clinical effectiveness of smartphone apps, wearable monitors, and web-delivered platforms in four COPD management areas: (1) quality of life (measured by the COPD Assessment Test [CAT] and St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire), (2) self-efficacy (assessed by the General Self-Efficacy Scale), (3) functional capacity (evaluated via the 6-minute walk test and Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale), and (4) health care use (indicated by hospital and emergency department visits).\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A systematic review was conducted using predefined search terms in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane, and Web of Science up to January 26, 2025, to identify randomized trials on digital health interventions for COPD. Two reviewers independently screened studies and extracted data. Outcomes included quality of life, self-efficacy, functional status, and health care use.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              This review included 17 studies with 2027 participants from 11 countries. Eleven trials involved health care professionals in digital platform use, and 12 reported adherence strategies. Digital tools for COPD primarily focused on telerehabilitation (eg, video-guided exercises) and self-management systems (eg, artificial intelligence–driven exacerbation alerts). The study participants were predominantly older adults. Meta-analysis results indicated that digital health interventions significantly improved quality of life at 3 months on the CAT (mean difference [MD] −1.65, 95% CI –3.17 to –0.14; P=.03); at 6 months on the CAT (MD −2.43, 95% CI −3.93 to −0.94; P=.001) and St George’s Respiratory Questionnaire (MD 3.25, 95% CI 0.69-5.81; P=.01); at 12 months on the CAT (MD −2.53, 95% CI −3.91 to −1.16; P<.001), EQ-5D (MD 0.04, 95% CI 0.01-0.07; P=.02), and EQ-5D visual analogue scale (MD 5.88, 95% CI 0.38-11.37; P=.04); the General Self-Efficacy Scale at 3 months (MD 1.65, 95% CI 0.62-2.69; P=.002) and 6 months (MD 1.94, 95% CI 0.83-3.05; P<.001); and the Modified Medical Research Council Dyspnea Scale at more than 3 months (MD −0.23, 95% CI −0.36 to −0.11; P=.003). However, no significant differences were observed in the 6-minute walk test, emergency department admissions, hospital admissions, emergency department admissions for COPD, or hospital admissions for COPD.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Our findings suggest that digital health interventions may benefit COPD patients, but their clinical effectiveness remains uncertain.

      "abstract": "Background\n              Digital mental health services are increasingly being provided by employers as health benefit programs that can improve access to and remove barriers to mental health care. Stratified care models, in particular, offer personalized care recommendations that can offer clinically effective interventions while conserving resources. Nonetheless, clinical evaluation is needed to understand their benefits for mental health and their use in a real-world setting.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aimed to examine the changes in clinical outcomes (ie, depressive and anxiety symptoms and well-being) and to evaluate the use of stratified blended care among members of an employer-sponsored digital mental health benefit.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              In a large prospective observational study, we examined the changes in depressive symptoms (9-item Patient Health Questionnaire), anxiety symptoms (7-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder scale), and well-being (5-item World Health Organization Well-Being Index) for 3 months in 509 participants (mean age 33.9, SD 8.7 years; women: n=312, 61.3%; men: n=175, 34.4%; nonbinary: n=22, 4.3%) who were newly enrolled and engaged in care with an employer-sponsored digital mental health platform (Modern Health Inc). We also investigated the extent to which participants followed the recommendations provided to them through a stratified blended care model.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Participants with elevated baseline symptoms of depression and anxiety exhibited significant symptom improvements, with a 37% score improvement in depression and a 29% score improvement in anxiety (P values <.001). Participants with baseline scores indicative of poorer well-being also improved over the study period (90% score improvement; P=.002). Furthermore, over half exhibited clinical improvement or recovery for depressive symptoms (n=122, 65.2%), anxiety symptoms (n=127, 59.1%), and low well-being (n=82, 64.6%). Among participants with mild or no baseline symptoms, we found high rates of maintenance for low depressive (n=297, 92.2%) and anxiety (n=255, 86.7%) symptoms and high well-being (n=344, 90.1%). In total, two-thirds of the participants (n=343, 67.4%) used their recommended care, 16.9% (n=86) intensified their care beyond their initial recommendation, and 15.7% (n=80) of participants underused care by not engaging with the highest level of care recommended to them.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Participants with elevated baseline depressive or anxiety symptoms improved their mental health significantly from baseline to follow-up, and most participants without symptoms or with mild symptoms at baseline maintained their mental health over time. In addition, engagement patterns indicate that the stratified blended care model was efficient in matching individuals with the most effective and least costly care while also allowing them to self-determine their care and use combinations of services that best fit their needs. Overall, the results of this study support the clinical effectiveness of the platform for improving and preserving mental health and support the utility and effectiveness of stratified blended care models to improve access to and use of digitally delivered mental health services.",

Given the negative impact of NCDs on employee performance and work productivity, there is a rising need for stakeholders to identify effective workplace solutions that can improve employee health outcomes. As the workplace becomes more dispersed post pandemic, digital behavioral coaching offers a scalable, personalized, and cost-effective method of managing chronic disease risk factors among employees.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aimed to retrospectively evaluate the impact of a digital behavioral coaching program on year-to-year changes in employee health status in a cohort of Indonesian employees.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              This retrospective real-world exploratory analysis of secondary health data followed 774 employees of an Indonesian company who completed company-sponsored health screenings between 2021 and 2022 and were given access to Naluri (Naluri Hidup Sdn Bhd), a holistic digital therapeutics platform offering digital behavioral health coaching and self-help tools. Participants were retrospectively classified as those who received active coaching (n=177), passive coaching (n=108), and no coaching (n=489). Linear mixed-effects models were used to evaluate the year-to-year changes in health outcomes across the 3 employee groups, with post hoc analyses evaluating within-group differences between the 2 time points and between-group differences at follow-up.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Significant time×group interaction effects were detected for body weight, BMI, hemoglobin A1c, low-density lipoprotein, total cholesterol, and systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Post hoc pairwise comparisons revealed significant improvements in hemoglobin A1c (mean difference [Mdiff]=–0.14, P=.008), high-density lipoprotein (Mdiff=+2.14, P<.001), and total cholesterol (Mdiff=–11.45, P<.001) for employees in the Active Coaching group between 2021 and 2022, with the other 2 groups reporting deteriorations in multiple health outcomes throughout the 2 time points. At follow-up, those who received active coaching between 2021 and 2022 reported significantly lower body weight (P<.001), BMI (P=.001), low-density lipoprotein (P=.045), and total cholesterol (P<.001) than the No Coaching group.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This study demonstrates real-world outcomes and implications supporting the use of workplace digital behavioral coaching in improving employee health status.

      "abstract": "Introduction\n              Digital Health Interventions (DHIs) have been identified as a solution to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDG3) for health promotion and prevention. However, DHIs face criticism for shallow and transactional engagement and retention challenges. Integrating DHIs with health coaching represents a promising solution that might address these issues by combining the scalable and accessible nature of DHIs with the meaningful and engaging nature of health coaching. This systematic review aims to synthesise existing peer-reviewed research on coach-facilitated DHIs to understand how digital health coaching is being used in DHIs and the impact it has on engagement and lifestyle outcomes.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Studies examining DHIs with a coaching component addressing lifestyle outcomes were included. A search of APA PsychINFO, Medline, Web of Science, and Scopus was performed from inception to February 2025. Three authors conducted the study selection, quality appraisal using the Mixed Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT), and data extraction. Data extraction captured study characteristics, coaching features, participant engagement, and lifestyle outcomes.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Thirty-five studies were identified and synthesised using a narrative synthesis approach. This review highlights three coaching modalities in DHIs: digital human coaching, Artificial Intelligence (AI) coaching, and hybrid (human-AI) coaching. All coaching modalities demonstrated feasibility and acceptability.\n            \n            \n              Discussion\n              While both human and AI coaching have shown a positive impact on both engagement and lifestyle outcomes, hybrid approaches need further refinement to harness AI's scalability and the depth of human coaching. However, the variability of engagement metrics and coaching protocols limited study comparability. Standardising how engagement and coaching delivery are measured and contextualised is crucial for advancing evidence-based digital health coaching.

      "abstract": "Objective\n              Peer support for people with dementia and carers is routinely advocated in national strategies and policy as a post-diagnostic intervention. However there is limited evidence to demonstrate the value these groups offer. This study looked at three dementia peer support groups in South London to evaluate what outcomes they produce and how much social value they create in relation to the cost of investment.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A Social Return on Investment (SROI) analysis was undertaken, which involves collecting data on the inputs, outputs and outcomes of an intervention, which are put into a formula, the end result being a SROI ratio showing how much social value is created per £1 of investment.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Findings showed the three groups created social value ranging from £1.17 to £5.18 for every pound (£) of investment, dependent on the design and structure of the group. Key outcomes for people with dementia were mental stimulation and a reduction in loneliness and isolation. Carers reported a reduction in stress and burden of care. Volunteers cited an increased knowledge of dementia.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This study has shown that peer groups for people with dementia produce a social value greater than the cost of investment which provides encouraging evidence for those looking to commission, invest, set up or evaluate peer support groups for people with dementia and carers. Beyond the SROI ratio, this study has shown these groups create beneficial outcomes not only for the group members but also more widely for their carers and the group volunteers.",

      "abstract": "Markov models are useful when a decision problem involves risk that is continuous over time, when the timing of events is important, and when important events may happen more than once. Representing such clinical settings with conventional decision trees is difficult and may require unrealistic simplifying assumptions. Markov models assume that a patient is always in one of a finite number of discrete health states, called Markov states. All events are represented as transitions from one state to another. A Markov model may be evaluated by matrix algebra, as a cohort simulation, or as a Monte Carlo simulation. A newer repre sentation of Markov models, the Markov-cycle tree, uses a tree representation of clinical events and may be evaluated either as a cohort simulation or as a Monte Carlo simulation. The ability of the Markov model to represent repetitive events and the time dependence of both probabilities and utilities allows for more accurate representation of clinical settings that involve these issues. Key words: Markov models; Markov-cycle decision tree; decision mak ing. (Med Decis Making 1993;13:322-338)",

However, research has either focused solely on clinical outcomes or demonstrated reductions in medical claims without accounting for the costs of behavioral health services, leaving the financial return on investment unknown.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              To determine whether a clinically effective employer-sponsored behavioral health benefit is associated with net medical cost savings.\n            \n            \n              Design, Setting, and Participants\n              This retrospective cohort study included participants eligible for an employer-sponsored behavioral health benefit between November 1, 2019, and May 31, 2023. Eligibility criteria included having a behavioral health diagnosis and, in the program group, attending at least 1 behavioral health appointment. Program users were matched to nonusers on medical risk scores, behavioral health diagnoses, date of diagnosis, age, sex, and employer.

Their mean (SD) age was 37 (13.2) years, and most participants (65.5%) were female. Costs decreased in the program group relative to the control group, with a net difference-in-differences of −$164 PMPM (95% CI, −$228 to −$100 PMPM), corresponding to savings of $1070 per participant in the first program year and a return on investment of 1.9 times the costs (ie, every $100 invested reduced medical claims costs by $190). Behavioral health costs in the program group increased relative to the control group but were more than offset by decreases in physical health care costs. Savings were larger for participants with higher medical risk.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions and Relevance\n              In this cohort study, every $100 invested in an employer-sponsored behavioral health program with fast access to psychotherapy and medication management was associated with a reduction in medical claims costs by $190. These findings suggest that expanding access to behavioral health care may be a financially viable cost-reduction strategy for health care buyers.",

Traditional health care often falls short in chronic disease management. This has led to the exploration of innovative solutions, such as mobile health (mHealth) technologies. mHealth, which leverages mobile and wireless technologies, has the potential to transform health care delivery by providing continuous, accessible, and personalized care. However, the effectiveness of mHealth, particularly when integrated with traditional health care interventions delivered by professionals, warrants comprehensive investigation. Understanding the combined impact of mHealth and professional-led interventions is critical to maximizing the potential of mHealth to improve patient outcomes and adherence.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aims to investigate the effectiveness of combining mHealth and health professional–led intervention for improving health-related outcomes in chronic diseases\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              This systematic review and meta-analysis focused on randomized controlled trials.

The interventions were a combination of mHealth and the use of a health care professional. The comparison groups consisted of participants receiving either general care and follow-up or those using mHealth devices without any health care professional involvement.

Meta-analysis was conducted for HbA1c, QoL, and physical activity. For HbA1c, short-term improvement was significant (standardized mean difference [SMD] –0.43; 95% CI –0.64 to –0.21; I2=69%) and medium term (SMD –0.49; 95% CI –0.49 to –0.09; I2=21%). However, in the long term, the improvement was not significant (SMD –0.23; 95% CI –0.49 to 0.03; I2=88%). For QoL, significant improvements were observed in the short term (SMD –0.23; 95% CI –0.42 to –0.05; I2=62%), and in the medium term (SMD –0.16; 95% CI –0.24 to –0.07; I2=0%). In the long term, however, the improvement was not significant (SMD –0.12; 95% CI –0.41 to 0.16; I2=71%). For physical activity, both subjective (questionnaire) and objective (number of steps) outcomes were analyzed. In the short term, subjective outcomes showed significant improvement (SMD 0.31; 95% CI 0.12-0.50; I2=0%), while objective outcomes did not (SMD 0.11; 95% CI –0.05 to 0.27; I2=0%). Medium- and long-term subjective outcomes showed no significant improvement. Meta-analysis for objective outcomes in the medium and long term was not possible due to insufficient studies.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This study confirmed short- and medium-term benefits of mHealth combined with professional interventions for HbA1c, QoL, and short-term physical activity, supporting effective chronic disease management.",

Unimpeded by geographical boundaries, smartphone-linked wearable sensors, point-of-need diagnostic devices, and medical-grade imaging, all built around real-time data streams and supported by automated clinical decision–support tools, will enable care and enhance our understanding of physiological variability. However, the path to mHealth incorporation into clinical care is fraught with challenges. We currently lack high-quality evidence that supports the adoption of many new technologies and have financial, regulatory, and security hurdles to overcome. Fortunately, sweeping efforts are under way to establish the true capabilities and value of the evolving mHealth field.",

      "abstract": "The rapid advances and adoption of smartphone technology presents a novel opportunity for delivering mental health interventions on a population scale. Despite multi‐sector investment along with wide‐scale advertising and availability to the general population, the evidence supporting the use of smartphone apps in the treatment of depression has not been empirically evaluated. Thus, we conducted the first meta‐analysis of smartphone apps for depressive symptoms. An electronic database search in May 2017 identified 18 eligible randomized controlled trials of 22 smartphone apps, with outcome data from 3,414 participants. Depressive symptoms were reduced significantly more from smartphone apps than control conditions (g=0.38, 95% CI: 0.24‐0.52, p<0.001), with no evidence of publication bias. Smartphone interventions had a moderate positive effect in comparison to inactive controls (g=0.56, 95% CI: 0.38‐0.74), but only a small effect in comparison to active control conditions (g=0.22, 95% CI: 0.10‐0.33). Effects from smartphone‐only interventions were greater than from interventions which incorporated other human/computerized aspects along the smartphone component, although the difference was not statistically significant. The studies of cognitive training apps had a significantly smaller effect size on depression outcomes (p=0.004) than those of apps focusing on mental health. The use of mood monitoring softwares, or interventions based on cognitive behavioral therapy, or apps incorporating aspects of mindfulness training, did not affect significantly study effect sizes. Overall, these results indicate that smartphone devices are a promising self‐management tool for depression. Future research should aim to distil which aspects of these technologies produce beneficial effects, and for which populations.",

We sought to advance understanding of the diversity of behavior change techniques in mHealth interventions, especially those that leverage advanced mobile technologies. Methods We conducted a systematic review of articles published between 2007 and 2017 in high-impact journals in medicine, medical informatics, and health psychology to identify randomized controlled trials in which the effectiveness of an mobile health intervention was tested. Search terms included a mix of general (e.g. mobile health), hardware (e.g. Android, iPhone), and format (e.g. SMS, application) terms. Results In a systematic review of 21 studies, we found the techniques of personalization, feedback and monitoring, and associations were most commonly used in mobile health interventions, but there remains considerable opportunity to leverage more sophisticated aspects of ubiquitous computing. We found that prompts and cues were the most common behavior change techniques used in effective trials, but there was notable overlap in behavior change techniques used in ineffective trials. Conclusions Our results identify techniques that are commonly used in mobile health interventions and highlight pathways to advance the science of mobile health.",

In this paper, we aim to review theories relevant to lifestyle behavior change from the broader psychology literature and then integrate these theories into a new theoretical framework called adaptive decision-making to address two specific problems. First, our framework represents lifestyle behaviors at two levels—one of individual daily decisions (action level) and one of larger behavioral episodes (reflection level)—to more closely match the temporal characteristics of lifestyle behaviors and their associated digital data. Second, the framework connects decision-making theories and learning theories to explain how behaviors and cognitive constructs dynamically influence each other, making it a suitable scaffold for building computational models. We map common digital intervention techniques onto the behavioral and cognitive processes in the framework and discuss possible contributions of the framework to both theory development and digital intervention design.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundDigital health interventions have significant potential to improve safety, efficacy, and quality of care, reducing waste in healthcare costs. Despite these premises, the evidence regarding cost and effectiveness of digital tools in health is scarce and limited.ObjectivesThe aim of this systematic review is to summarize the evidence on the cost-effectiveness of digital health interventions and to assess whether the studies meet the established quality criteria.MethodsWe queried PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science databases for articles in English published from January 1, 2016 to December 31, 2020 that performed economic evaluations of digital health technologies. The methodological rigorousness of studies was assessed with the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS). The review was conducted according to the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis (PRISMA) 2009 checklist.ResultsSearch identified 1,476 results, 552 of which were selected for abstract and 35 were included in this review. The studies were heterogeneous by country (mostly conducted in upper and upper-middle income countries), type of eHealth intervention, method of implementation, and reporting perspectives. The qualitative analysis identified the economic and effectiveness evaluation of six different types of interventions: (1) seventeen studies on new video-monitoring service systems; (2) five studies on text messaging interventions; (3) five studies on web platforms and digital health portals; (4) two studies on telephone support; (5) three studies on new mobile phone-based systems and applications; and (6) three studies on digital technologies and innovations.ConclusionFindings on cost-effectiveness of digital interventions showed a growing body of evidence and suggested a generally favorable effect in terms of costs and health outcomes. However, due to the heterogeneity across study methods, the comparison between interventions still remains difficult. Further research based on a standardized approach is needed in order to methodically analyze incremental cost-effectiveness ratios, costs, and health benefits.",

Studies were identified from MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase, CINAHL, and JMIR by using search terms related to mHealth, BD, and DT. Included studies had to clearly describe their mHealth design process and how behavior change theories, models, frameworks, or techniques were incorporated. Two independent reviewers screened the studies for inclusion and completed the data extraction. A descriptive analysis was conducted.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 75 papers met the inclusion criteria. All studies were published between 2012 and 2021. Studies integrated BD and DT in notable ways, which can be referred to as “Behavioral Design Thinking.” Five steps were followed in Behavioral Design Thinking: (1) empathize with users and their behavior change needs, (2) define user and behavior change requirements, (3) ideate user-centered features and behavior change content, (4) prototype a user-centered solution that supports behavior change, and (5) test the solution against users’ needs and for its behavior change potential. The key challenges experienced during mHealth design included meaningfully engaging patient and public partners in the design process, translating evidence-based behavior change techniques into actual mHealth features, and planning for how to integrate the mHealth intervention into existing clinical systems.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Best practices from BD and DT can be integrated throughout the mHealth design process to ensure that mHealth interventions are purposefully developed to effectively engage users. Although this scoping review clarified how insights from BD and DT can be integrated during mHealth design, future research is needed to identify the most effective design approaches.",

      "abstract": "Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have emerged as a promising approach for cardiovascular disease (CVD) prevention and management. The proliferation of smartphones and wearable devices enables convenient access to health monitoring tools, educational resources, and communication with healthcare providers. mHealth interventions encompass mobile apps, wearables, and telehealth services that empower users to monitor vital signs, adhere to medication, and adopt healthier lifestyles. Their effectiveness hinges on user engagement, leveraging behavioral science principles and gamification strategies. While mHealth offers advantages such as personalized support and increased reach, it faces challenges pertaining to data privacy, security concerns, and resistance from healthcare providers. Robust encryption and adherence to regulations like the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) are crucial for safeguarding sensitive health data. Integrating mHealth into clinical workflows can enhance healthcare delivery, but organizational adjustments are necessary. The future of mHealth is closely intertwined with artificial intelligence (AI), enabling remote monitoring, predictive algorithms, and data-driven insights. Tech giants are incorporating advanced health-tracking capabilities into their devices, paving the way for personalized wellness approaches. However, mHealth grapples with ethical dilemmas surrounding data ownership, privacy breaches, and inadvertent data capture. Despite its potential, mHealth necessitates a concerted effort to overcome obstacles and ensure ethical, secure, and practical implementation. Addressing technical challenges, fostering standardization, and promoting equitable access are pivotal for unlocking the transformative impact of mHealth on cardiovascular health and reducing the global burden of CVD.",

One method of managing this burden is the use of app-based interventions; however attrition, defined as lack of patient use of the intervention, is an issue for these interventions. While many apps have been developed, there is some evidence that they have significant issues with sustained use, with up to 98% of people only using the app for a short time before dropping out and/or dropping use down to the point where the app is no longer effective at helping to manage disease.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              Our objectives are to systematically appraise and perform a meta-analysis on dropout rates in apps for chronic disease and to qualitatively synthesize possible reasons for these dropout rates that could be addressed in future interventions.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online), PubMed, Cochrane CENTRAL (Central Register of Controlled Trials), and Embase were searched from 2003 to the present to look at mobile health (mHealth) and attrition or dropout. Studies, either randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or observational trials, looking at chronic disease with measures of dropout were included. Meta-analysis of attrition rates was conducted in Stata, version 15.1 (StataCorp LLC). Included studies were also qualitatively synthesized to examine reasons for dropout and avenues for future research.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Of 833 studies identified in the literature search, 17 were included in the review and meta-analysis. Out of 17 studies, 9 (53%) were RCTs and 8 (47%) were observational trials, with both types covering a range of chronic diseases. The pooled dropout rate was 43% (95% CI 29-57), with observational studies having a higher dropout rate (49%, 95% CI 27-70) than RCTs in more controlled scenarios, which only had a 40% dropout rate (95% CI 16-63). The studies were extremely varied, which is represented statistically in the high degree of heterogeneity (I2>99%). Qualitative synthesis revealed a range of reasons relating to attrition from app-based interventions, including social, demographic, and behavioral factors that could be addressed.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Dropout rates in mHealth interventions are high, but possible areas to minimize attrition exist.

      "abstract": "Background\n              Digital health interventions (DHIs) are a central focus of health care transformation efforts, yet their uptake in practice continues to fall short of their potential. In order to achieve their desired outcomes and impact, DHIs need to reach their target population and need to be used. Many factors can rapidly intersect between this dynamic of users and interventions. The application of theories, models, and frameworks (TMFs) can facilitate the systematic understanding and explanation of the complex interactions between users, practices, technology, and health system factors that underpin research questions. There remains a gap in our understanding of how TMFs have been applied to guide the evaluation of DHIs with real-world health system operations.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aims to map TMFs used in studies to guide the evaluation of DHIs. The objectives are to (1) describe the TMFs and the constructs they target, (2) identify how TMFs have been prospectively used (ie, their roles) in primary studies to evaluate DHIs, and (3) to reflect on the relevance and utility of our findings for knowledge users.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              This scoping review was conducted in partnership with knowledge users using an integrated knowledge translation approach. We included papers (eg, reports; empirical quantitative, qualitative, and mixed methods studies; conference proceedings; and dissertations) if primary insights resulting from the application of TMFs were presented. Any type of DHI was eligible. Papers published from 2000 and onward were mainly identified from the following databases: MEDLINE (Ovid), CINAHL Complete (EBSCOhost), PsycINFO (Ovid), EBM Reviews (Ovid), and Embase (Ovid).\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 156 studies published between 2000 and 2022 were included. A total of 68 distinct TMFs were identified across 85 individual studies. In more than half (85/156, 55%) of the included studies, 1 of following 6 prevailing TMFs were reported: Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (n=39); the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance Framework (n=17); the Technology of Acceptance Model (n=16); the Unified Theory on Acceptance and Use of Technology (n=12); the Diffusion of Innovation Theory (n=10); and Normalization Process Theory (n=9). The most common intended roles of the 6 TMFs were to inform data collection (n=86), to inform data analysis (n=69), and to identify key constructs that may serve as barriers and facilitators (n=52).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              As TMFs are most often reported to be applied to support data collection and analysis, researchers should consider more clearly synthesizing key insights as practical use cases to both increase the relevance and digestibility of their findings. There is also a need to adapt or develop guidelines for better reporting DHIs and the use of TMFs to guide evaluation. Hence, it would contribute to ensuring ongoing technology transformation efforts are evidence and theory informed rather than anecdotally driven.",

The availability of increasingly powerful mobile and sensing technologies underpins the use of JITAIs to support health behavior, as in such a setting an individual’s state can change rapidly, unexpectedly, and in his/her natural environment.                                                Purpose                  Despite the increasing use and appeal of JITAIs, a major gap exists between the growing technological capabilities for delivering JITAIs and research on the development and evaluation of these interventions. Many JITAIs have been developed with minimal use of empirical evidence, theory, or accepted treatment guidelines. Here, we take an essential first step towards bridging this gap.                                                Methods                  Building on health behavior theories and the extant literature on JITAIs, we clarify the scientific motivation for JITAIs, define their fundamental components, and highlight design principles related to these components. Examples of JITAIs from various domains of health behavior research are used for illustration.                                                Conclusions                  As we enter a new era of technological capacity for delivering JITAIs, it is critical that researchers develop sophisticated and nuanced health behavior theories capable of guiding the construction of such interventions. Particular attention has to be given to better understanding the implications of providing timely and ecologically sound support for intervention adherence and retention",

      "abstract": "Abstract                Background                While many digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) have been shown to be effective, such interventions also have been criticized for poor engagement and retention rates. However, several questions remain about how users engage with DMHIs, how to define engagement, and what factors might help improve DMHI engagement.                              Main abstract                In this narrative review, we show that although DMHIs are criticized for poor engagement, research suggests engagement rates are quite variable across studies and DMHIs. In some instances, engagement rates are high, even in real-world settings where there is evidence of a subset of users who could be considered ‘superusers’. We then review research on the barriers and facilitators to DMHI engagement, highlighting that qualitative research of users’ perceptions does not always align with quantitative research assessing relationships between these barriers/facilitators and actual engagement with DMHIs. We also introduce several potential issues in conceptualizations of DMHI engagement that may explain the mixed findings, including inconsistent definitions of engagement and assumptions about linear relationships between engagement and outcomes. Finally, we outline evidence suggesting that engagement with DMHIs is comparable to mobile application use broadly as well as engagement with more traditional forms of mental health care (i.e., pharmacological, psychotherapy).                              Conclusions                In order to increase the number of people who can benefit from DMHIs, additional research on engagement and retention is necessary. Importantly, we believe it is critical that this research move away from several existing misconceptions about DMHI engagement. We make three recommendations for research on DMHI engagement that we believe, if addressed, are likely to substantially improve the impact of DMHIs: (1) the need to adopt a clearly defined, common definition of engagement, (2) the importance of exploring patterns of optimal engagement rather than taking a ‘one size fits all’ approach, and (3) the importance of defining success within DMHIs based on outcomes rather than the frequency or duration of a user’s engagement with that DMHI.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundJust-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs) are interventions designed to deliver timely tailored support by adjusting to changes in users' internal states and external contexts. To accomplish this, JITAIs often apply complex analytic techniques, such as machine learning or Bayesian algorithms to real- or near-time data acquired from smartphones and other sensors. Given the idiosyncratic, dynamic, and context dependent nature of mental health symptoms, JITAIs hold promise for mental health. However, the development of JITAIs is still in the early stages and is complex due to the multifactorial nature of JITAIs. Considering this complexity, Nahum-Shani et al. developed a conceptual framework for developing and testing JITAIs for health-related problems. This review evaluates the current state of JITAIs in the field of mental health including their alignment with Nahum-Shani et al.'s framework.MethodsNine databases were systematically searched in August 2023. Protocol or empirical studies self-identifying their intervention as a “JITAI” targeting mental health were included in the qualitative synthesis if they were published in peer-reviewed journals and written in English.ResultsOf the 1,419 records initially screened, 9 papers reporting on 5 JITAIs were included (sample size range: 5 to an expected 264). Two JITAIs were for bulimia nervosa, one for depression, one for insomnia, and one for maternal prenatal stress. Although most core components of Nahum-Shani's et al.'s framework were incorporated in the JITAIs, essential elements (e.g., adaptivity and receptivity) within the core components were missing and the core components were only partly substantiated by empirical evidence (e.g., interventions were supported, but the decision rules and points were not). Complex analytical techniques such as data from passive monitoring of individuals' states and contexts were hardly used. Regarding the current state of studies, initial findings on usability, feasibility, and effectiveness appear positive.ConclusionsJITAIs for mental health are still in their early stages of development, with opportunities for improvement in both development and testing. For future development, it is recommended that developers utilize complex analytical techniques that can handle real-or near-time data such as machine learning, passive monitoring, and conduct further research into empirical-based decision rules and points for optimization in terms of enhanced effectiveness and user-engagement.",

We searched five databases CINAHL Plus, MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsychINFO, and Web of Science. The review used the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) framework to investigate factors influencing technology adoption. Studies were selected based on predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria, focusing on health professionals' digital capability in healthcare settings. Quality assessment was performed using the MMAT checklist, and data were analysed and synthesized to extract relevant themes and sub-themes.                                Results            Initially, 1140 studies were identified, with 21 meeting the inclusion criteria after screening. These studies, published between 2017 and 2023.The results were categorized into four main themes: Performance Expectancy, Effort Expectancy, Facilitating Conditions, and Social Influence, with two sub-themes. The studies indicated that technology positively impacts job performance, facilitating acceptance among healthcare professionals. Ease of use was crucial for technology acceptance, while complexity and multiple logins were significant barriers. The importance of sufficient training and organizational support was highlighted to enhance digital competency and address technical issues, with inadequate training and infrastructure being major barriers. Social influence, including motivation of healthcare workers and shared decision-making, played a significant role in technology acceptance.                                Conclusion            This review highlights critical factors influencing the digital readiness and capability of healthcare professionals. Interventions enhancing performance expectancy, addressing effort expectancy, improving facilitating conditions, and leveraging social influence are essential for successful digital health adoption. Future research should develop comprehensive frameworks to overcome barriers and promote digital health readiness. Integrating specialized training into educational programs is crucial for preparing healthcare professionals to navigate the evolving digital landscape.",

      "abstract": "In recent years, the number of digital health tools with the potential to significantly improve delivery of healthcare services has grown tremendously. However, the use of these tools in large, complex health systems remains comparatively limited. The adoption and implementation of digital health tools at an enterprise level is a challenge; few strategies exist to help tools cross the chasm from clinical validation to integration within the workflows of a large health system. Many previously proposed frameworks for digital health implementation are difficult to operationalize in these dynamic organizations. In this piece, we put forth nine dimensions along which clinically validated digital health tools should be examined by health systems prior to adoption, and propose strategies for selecting digital health tools and planning for implementation in this setting. By evaluating prospective tools along these dimensions, health systems can evaluate which existing digital health solutions are worthy of adoption, ensure they have sufficient resources for deployment and long-term use, and devise a strategic plan for implementation.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Approximately 1 in 3 adults live with multiple chronic diseases. Digital health is being harnessed to improve continuity of care and management of chronic diseases. However, meaningful uptake of digital health for chronic disease management remains low. It is unclear how these innovations have been implemented and evaluated.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This scoping review aims to identify how digital health innovations for chronic disease management have been implemented and evaluated: what implementation frameworks, methods, and strategies were used; how successful these strategies were; key barriers and enablers to implementation; and lessons learned and recommendations shared by study authors.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We used the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews. Five databases were searched for studies published between January 2015 and March 2023: PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and IEEE Xplore. We included primary studies of any study design with any type of digital health innovations for chronic diseases that benefit patients, caregivers, or health care professionals. We extracted study characteristics; type of digital health innovation; implementation frameworks, strategies, and outcome measures used; barriers and enablers to implementation; lessons learned; and recommendations reported by study authors. We used established taxonomies to synthesize extracted data. Extracted barriers and enablers were grouped into categories for reporting. Descriptive statistics were used to consolidate extracted data.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 252 studies were included, comprising mainly mobile health (107/252, 42.5%), eHealth (61/252, 24.2%), and telehealth (97/252, 38.5%), with some studies involving more than 1 innovation. Only 23 studies (23/252, 9.1%) reported using an implementation science theory, model, or framework; the most common were implementation theories, classic theories, and determinant frameworks, with 7 studies each. Of 252 studies, 144 (57.1%) used 2 to 5 implementation strategies. Frequently used strategies were “obtain and use patient or consumer feedback” (196/252, 77.8%); “audit and provide feedback” (106/252, 42.1%); and piloting before implementation or “stage implementation scale-up” (85/252, 33.7%). Commonly measured implementation outcomes were acceptability, feasibility, and adoption of the digital innovation. Of 252 studies, 247 studies (98%) did not measure service outcomes, while patient health outcomes were measured in 89 studies (35.3%). The main method used to assess outcomes was surveys (173/252, 68.7%), followed by interviews (95/252, 37.7%). Key barriers impacting implementation were data privacy concerns and patient preference for in-person consultations. Key enablers were training for health care workers and personalization of digital health features to patient needs.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This review generated a summary of how digital health in chronic disease management is currently implemented and evaluated and serves as a useful resource for clinicians, researchers, health system managers, and policy makers planning real-world implementation. Future studies should investigate whether using implementation science frameworks, including how well they are used, would yield better outcomes compared to not using them.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundChronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and cerebrovascular diseases, contribute to the most significant disease burden worldwide, negatively impacting patients and their family members. People with chronic diseases have common modifiable behavioral risk factors, including smoking, alcohol overconsumption, and unhealthy diets. Digital-based interventions for promoting and sustaining behavioral changes have flourished in recent years, although evidence of the cost-effectiveness of such interventions remains inconclusive.ObjectiveIn this study, we aimed to investigate the cost-effectiveness of digital health interventions for behavioral changes among people with chronic diseases.MethodsThis systematic review evaluated published studies focused on the economic evaluation of digital tools for behavioral change among adults with chronic diseases. We followed the Population, Intervention, Comparator, and Outcomes framework to retrieve relevant publications from 4 databases: PubMed, CINAHL, Scopus, and Web of Science. We used the Joanna Briggs Institute’s criteria for economic evaluation and randomized controlled trials to assess the risk of bias in the studies. Two researchers independently screened, assessed the quality, and extracted data from the studies selected for the review.ResultsIn total, 20 studies published between 2003 and 2021 fulfilled our inclusion criteria. All the studies were conducted in high-income countries. These studies used telephones, SMS text messaging, mobile health apps, and websites as digital tools for behavior change communication. Most digital tools for interventions focused on diet and nutrition (17/20, 85%) and physical activity (16/20, 80%), and a few focused on smoking and tobacco control (8/20, 40%), alcohol reduction (6/20, 30%), and reduction of salt intake (3/20, 15%). Most studies (17/20, 85%) used the health care payer perspective for economic analysis, and only 15% (3/20) used the societal perspective. Only 45% (9/20) of studies conducted a full economic evaluation. Most studies (7/20, 35%) based on full economic evaluation and 30% (6/20) of studies based on partial economic evaluation found digital health interventions to be cost-effective and cost-saving. Most studies had short follow-ups and failed to include proper indicators for economic evaluation, such as quality-adjusted life-years, disability-adjusted life-years, lack of discounting, and sensitivity analysis.ConclusionsDigital health interventions for behavioral change among people with chronic diseases are cost-effective in high-income settings and can therefore be scaled up. Similar evidence from low- and middle-income countries based on properly designed studies for cost-effectiveness evaluation is urgently required. A full economic evaluation is needed to provide robust evidence for the cost-effectiveness of digital health interventions and their potential for scaling up in a wider population. Future studies should follow the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommendations to take a societal perspective, apply discounting, address parameter uncertainty, and apply a lifelong time horizon.",

JITAIs can dynamically adjust intervention strategies, enhancing accessibility and engagement for marginalized communities. We highlight the utility of JITAIs in reducing opportunity costs associated with traditional in-person health interventions. Examples from various health domains demonstrate the adaptability of JITAIs in tailoring interventions to meet diverse needs. The review also emphasizes the need for community involvement, robust evaluation frameworks, and ethical considerations in implementing JITAIs, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Sustainable funding models and technological innovations are necessary to ensure equitable access and effectively scale these interventions. By bridging the gap between research and practice, JITAIs could improve health outcomes and reduce disparities in vulnerable populations.",

      "abstract": "Background: Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have long been considered the primary research study design capable of eliciting causal relationships between health interventions and consequent outcomes. However, with a prolonged duration from recruitment to publication, high-cost trial implementation, and a rigid trial protocol, RCTs are perceived as an impractical evaluation methodology for most mHealth apps. Objective: Given the recent development of alternative evaluation methodologies and tools to automate mHealth research, we sought to determine the breadth of these methods and the extent that they were being used in clinical trials. Methods: We conducted a review of the ClinicalTrials.gov registry to identify and examine current clinical trials involving mHealth apps and retrieved relevant trials registered between November 2014 and November 2015. Results: Of the 137 trials identified, 71 were found to meet inclusion criteria. The majority used a randomized controlled trial design (80%, 57/71). Study designs included 36 two-group pretest-posttest control group comparisons (51%, 36/71), 16 posttest-only control group comparisons (23%, 16/71), 7 one-group pretest-posttest designs (10%, 7/71), 2 one-shot case study designs (3%, 2/71), and 2 static-group comparisons (3%, 2/71). A total of 17 trials included a qualitative component to their methodology (24%, 17/71). Complete trial data collection required 20 months on average to complete (mean 21, SD 12). For trials with a total duration of 2 years or more (31%, 22/71), the average time from recruitment to complete data collection (mean 35 months, SD 10) was 2 years longer than the average time required to collect primary data (mean 11, SD 8). Trials had a moderate sample size of 112 participants. Two trials were conducted online (3%, 2/71) and 7 trials collected data continuously (10%, 7/68). Onsite study implementation was heavily favored (97%, 69/71). Trials with four data collection points had a longer study duration than trials with two data collection points: F4,56=3.2, P=.021, η2=0.18. Single-blinded trials had a longer data collection period compared to open trials: F2,58=3.8, P=.028, η2=0.12. Academic sponsorship was the most common form of trial funding (73%, 52/71). Trials with academic sponsorship had a longer study duration compared to industry sponsorship: F2,61=3.7, P=.030, η2=0.11. Combined, data collection frequency, study masking, sample size, and study sponsorship accounted for 32.6% of the variance in study duration: F4,55=6.6, P<.01, adjusted r2=.33. Only 7 trials had been completed at the time this retrospective review was conducted (10%, 7/71). Conclusions: mHealth evaluation methodology has not deviated from common methods, despite the need for more relevant and timely evaluations. There is a need for clinical evaluation to keep pace with the level of innovation of mHealth if it is to have meaningful impact in informing payers, providers, policy makers, and patients.

However, user engagement varies, with regard to a user’s uptake and sustained interactions with these interventions.ObjectiveThis systematic review aims to identify common barriers and facilitators that influence user engagement with DMHIs.MethodsA systematic search was conducted in the SCOPUS, PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library databases. Empirical studies that report qualitative and/or quantitative data were included.ResultsA total of 208 articles met the inclusion criteria. The included articles used a variety of methodologies, including interviews, surveys, focus groups, workshops, field studies, and analysis of user reviews. Factors extracted for coding were related to the end user, the program or content offered by the intervention, and the technology and implementation environment. Common barriers included severe mental health issues that hampered engagement, technical issues, and a lack of personalization. Common facilitators were social connectedness facilitated by the intervention, increased insight into health, and a feeling of being in control of one’s own health.ConclusionsAlthough previous research suggests that DMHIs can be useful in supporting mental health, contextual factors are important determinants of whether users actually engage with these interventions. The factors identified in this review can provide guidance when evaluating DMHIs to help explain and understand user engagement and can inform the design and development of new digital interventions.",

      "abstract": "AbstractDigital technologies change the healthcare environment, with several studies suggesting barriers and facilitators to using digital interventions by healthcare professionals (HPs). We consolidated the evidence from existing systematic reviews mentioning barriers and facilitators for the use of digital health technologies by HP. Electronic searches were performed in five databases (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Embase®, Epistemonikos, MEDLINE®, and Scopus) from inception to March 2023. We included reviews that reported barriers or facilitators factors to use technology solutions among HP. We performed data abstraction, methodological assessment, and certainty of the evidence appraisal by at least two authors. Overall, we included 108 reviews involving physicians, pharmacists, and nurses were included. High-quality evidence suggested that infrastructure and technical barriers (Relative Frequency Occurrence [RFO] 6.4% [95% CI 2.9–14.1]), psychological and personal issues (RFO 5.3% [95% CI 2.2–12.7]), and concerns of increasing working hours or workload (RFO 3.9% [95% CI 1.5–10.1]) were common concerns reported by HPs. Likewise, high-quality evidence supports that training/educational programs, multisector incentives, and the perception of technology effectiveness facilitate the adoption of digital technologies by HPs (RFO 3.8% [95% CI 1.8–7.9]). Our findings showed that infrastructure and technical issues, psychological barriers, and workload-related concerns are relevant barriers to comprehensively and holistically adopting digital health technologies by HPs. Conversely, deploying training, evaluating HP’s perception of usefulness and willingness to use, and multi-stakeholders incentives are vital enablers to enhance the HP adoption of digital interventions.",

      "abstract": "Gestational diabetes (GDM) is associated with a long-term risk of diabetes. We aimed to determine whether a text-messaging-based lifestyle support program would improve diabetes risk factors following GDM. Women with GDM were randomised following delivery to receive four text messages per week supporting a healthy lifestyle and parenting for 6 months, with feedback from an activity monitor (intervention), or to receive the activity monitor only (control). The primary outcome was a composite of weight, physical activity and dietary goals. There were 177 women randomised, with 88 intervention and 89 control participants. All the participants experienced COVID-19 lockdowns during the study. Six-month primary outcome data were obtained for 57 intervention participants and 56 controls. There were 7/57 (12%) intervention and 6/56 (11%) control participants who met the primary outcome (relative risk, 1.08; 95%CI, 0.63–1.85; p = 0.79). Two intervention participants met the dietary goals compared to none of the control participants (p = NS). The intervention participants were more likely to record >1000 steps/day (on 102 ± 59 vs. 81 ± 59 days, p = 0.03). When analysed monthly, this was not initially different but became significant 3–6 months post-partum. Interviews and surveys indicated that with the Intervention, healthier choices were made, but these were negatively impacted by COVID-19 restrictions. Participants found the messages motivational (74%) and the activity monitor useful (71%). In conclusion, no improvement in the diabetes risk factors occurred among the women receiving the text messaging intervention when affected by COVID-19 restrictions.",

      "abstract": "Digital health interventions have been shown to be clinically-effective for type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and hypertension prevention and treatment. This study synthesizes and compares the cost-effectiveness of text-messaging, smartphone application, and websites by searching CINAHL, Cochrane Central, Embase, Medline and PsycInfo for full economic or cost-minimisation studies of digital health interventions in adults with or at risk of T2DM and/or hypertension. Costs and health effects are synthesised narratively. Study quality appraisal using the Consensus on Health Economic Criteria (CHEC) list results in recommendations for future health economic evaluations of digital health interventions. Of 3056 records identified, 14 studies are included (7 studies applied text-messaging, 4 employed smartphone applications, and 5 used websites). Ten studies are cost-utility analyses: incremental cost-utility ratios (ICUR) vary from dominant to €75,233/quality-adjusted life year (QALY), with a median of €3840/QALY (interquartile range €16,179). One study finds no QALY difference. None of the three digital health intervention modes is associated with substantially better cost-effectiveness. Interventions are consistently cost-effective in populations with (pre)T2DM but not in populations with hypertension. Mean quality score is 63.0% (standard deviation 13.7%). Substandard application of time horizon, sensitivity analysis, and subgroup analysis next to transparency concerns (regarding competing alternatives, perspective, and costing) downgrades quality of evidence. In conclusion, smartphone application, text-messaging, and website-based interventions are cost-effective without substantial differences between the different delivery modes. Future health economic studies should increase transparency, conduct sufficient sensitivity analyses, and appraise the ICUR more critically in light of a reasoned willingness-to-pay threshold.",

Yet, there is con ceptual confusion among researchers and practitioners about the interrelationships of these theories and variables. This article attempts to show how these explanatory fac tors may be related, and in so doing, posits a revised explanatory model which incor porates self-efficacy into the Health Belief Model. Specifically, self-efficacy is pro posed as a separate independent variable along with the traditional health belief var iables of perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, and barriers. Incentive to behave (health motivation) is also a component of the model. Locus of control is not included explicitly because it is believed to be incorporated within other elements of the model. It is predicted that the new formulation will more fully account for health-related behavior than did earlier formulations, and will suggest more effective behavioral interventions than have hitherto been available to health educators.",

      "abstract": "Abstract                Background                Nationally, much of the focus on improving human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine uptake has been on effective strategies that physicians use to promote vaccination. However, in large, predominately rural states like Montana, nurses and medical assistants play critical roles in immunization services delivery, and their viewpoints are imperative in designing strategies to increase vaccination rates. We conducted a cross-sectional, descriptive study to determine nurses’ perceptions, experiences, and practices regarding human papillomavirus vaccination in a rural and medically underserved region of the United States.                              Methods                We designed, pilot-tested, and disseminated an online survey instrument to nurses and medical assistants working in clinics participating in the Vaccines for Children program in Montana. The online surveys were administered from November 2020 to March 2021. Survey questions focused on clinic vaccination practices, respondents’ perceptions of the HPV vaccine, perceived barriers to vaccine uptake, and general opinions on potential strategies to improve HPV vaccination rates.                              Results                We analyzed data from 227 respondents. Overall, 90% of nurses strongly agreed or agreed that the HPV vaccine is important and had confidence in the vaccine’s safety. More nurses reported experiencing greater parental vaccine refusal or delay for male patients regardless of age. About 53.7% of nurses reported that their clinics had reminder/recall systems to encourage parents to bring their children for vaccination. Nurses identified misinformation from social media, infrequent wellness visits, and vaccine safety concerns as barriers to HPV vaccine uptake.                              Conclusions                Study findings identified several promising initiatives to accelerate vaccination in primarily rural states like Montana, including promoting widespread adoption of reminder/recall systems, training nurses in evidence-based techniques to provide strong vaccine recommendations, and leveraging social media to disseminate consistent messages about the HPV vaccine recommendations for both sexes and its role in cancer prevention.",

Promoting healthier behaviors and targeting modifiable risk factors can significantly improve both life expectancy and quality of life. The widespread adoption of smartphones and wearable devices enables continuous, in-the-wild monitoring of daily habits, opening new opportunities for personalized, data-driven health interventions. This paper provides an overview of the advancements, challenges, and future directions in translating principles of lifestyle medicine and behavior change into AI-powered mobile health (mHealth) applications, with a focus on Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions. Considerations for the design of adaptive interventions that leverage wearable and contextual data to dynamically personalize behavioral change strategies in real time are discussed. Bayesian multi-armed bandits from reinforcement learning are exploited as a framework for tailoring interventions, with causal inference methods used to incorporate structural assumptions about the user’s behavior. Furthermore, strategies for evaluation at both individual and population levels are presented, with causal inference tools to further guide unbiased estimates. A running example of a simple real-world scenario aimed at increasing physical activity through digital interventions is used throughout the paper. With input from domain experts, the proposed approach is generalizable to a wide range of behavior change use cases.",

      "abstract": "Background            Conversational agents (CAs) are increasingly used in health care to deliver behavior change interventions. Their evaluation often includes categorizing the behavior change techniques (BCTs) using a classification system of which the BCT Taxonomy v1 (BCTTv1) is one of the most common. Previous studies have presented descriptive summaries of behavior change interventions delivered by CAs, but no in-depth study reporting the use of BCTs in these interventions has been published to date.                                Objective            This review aims to describe behavior change interventions delivered by CAs and to identify the BCTs and theories guiding their design.                                Methods            We searched PubMed, Embase, Cochrane’s Central Register of Controlled Trials, and the first 10 pages of Google and Google Scholar in April 2021. We included primary, experimental studies evaluating a behavior change intervention delivered by a CA. BCTs coding followed the BCTTv1. Two independent reviewers selected the studies and extracted the data. Descriptive analysis and frequent itemset mining to identify BCT clusters were performed.                                Results            We included 47 studies reporting on mental health (n=19, 40%), chronic disorders (n=14, 30%), and lifestyle change (n=14, 30%) interventions. There were 20/47 embodied CAs (43%) and 27/47 CAs (57%) represented a female character. Most CAs were rule based (34/47, 72%). Experimental interventions included 63 BCTs, (mean 9 BCTs; range 2-21 BCTs), while comparisons included 32 BCTs (mean 2 BCTs; range 2-17 BCTs). Most interventions included BCTs 4.1 “Instruction on how to perform a behavior” (34/47, 72%), 3.3 “Social support” (emotional; 27/47, 57%), and 1.2 “Problem solving” (24/47, 51%). A total of 12/47 studies (26%) were informed by a behavior change theory, mainly the Transtheoretical Model and the Social Cognitive Theory. Studies using the same behavior change theory included different BCTs.                                Conclusions            There is a need for the more explicit use of behavior change theories and improved reporting of BCTs in CA interventions to enhance the analysis of intervention effectiveness and improve the reproducibility of research.",

      "abstract": "Background\nLong-term illnesses affect a significant proportion of the population in developed and developing countries. Mobile phone messaging applications, such as Short Message Service (SMS) and Multimedia Message Service (MMS), may present convenient, cost-effective ways of supporting self-management and improving patients' self-efficacy skills through, for instance, medication reminders, therapy adjustments or supportive messages.\n\nObjectives\nTo assess the effects of mobile phone messaging applications designed to facilitate self-management of long-term illnesses, in terms of impact on health outcomes and patients' capacity to self-manage their condition. Secondary objectives include assessment of: user evaluation of the intervention; health service utilisation and costs; and possible risks and harms associated with the intervention.\n\nSearch methods\nWe searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL,The Cochrane Library 2009, Issue 2), MEDLINE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), EMBASE (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), PsycINFO (OvidSP) (January 1993 to June 2009), CINAHL (EbscoHOST) (January 1993 to June 2009), LILACS (January 1993 to June 2009) and African Health Anthology (January 1993 to June 2009).\n\nWe also reviewed grey literature (including trial registers) and reference lists of articles.\n\nSelection criteria\nWe included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-randomised controlled trials (QRCTs), controlled before-after (CBA) studies, or interrupted time series (ITS) studies with at least three time points before and after the intervention. We selected only studies where it was possible to assess the effects of mobile phone messaging independent of other technologies or interventions.\n\nData collection and analysis\nTwo review authors independently assessed all studies against the inclusion criteria, with any disagreements resolved by a third review author. Study design features, characteristics of target populations, interventions and controls, and results data were extracted by two review authors and confirmed by a third. Primary outcomes of interest were health outcomes as a result of the intervention and capacity to self-manage long-term conditions. We also considered patients' and providers' evaluation of the intervention, perceptions of safety, health service utilisation and costs, and potential harms or adverse effects. The included studies were heterogeneous in type of condition addressed, intervention characteristics and outcome measures. Therefore, a meta-analysis to derive an overall effect size for the main outcome categories was not considered justified and findings are presented narratively.\n\nMain results\nWe included four randomised controlled trials involving 182 participants.\n\nFor the primary outcome of health outcomes, including physiological measures, there is moderate quality evidence from two studies involving people with diabetes showing no statistical difference from text messaging interventions compared with usual care or email reminders for glycaemic control (HbA1c), the frequency of diabetic complications, or body weight. There is moderate quality evidence from one study of hypertensive patients that the mean blood pressure and the proportion of patients who achieved blood pressure control were not significantly different in the intervention and control groups, and that there was no statistically significant difference in mean body weight between the groups. There is moderate quality evidence from one study that asthma patients receiving a text messaging intervention experienced greater improvements on peak expiratory flow variability (mean difference (MD) -11.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) -19.56 to -2.68) and the pooled symptom score comprising four items (cough, night symptoms, sleep quality, and maximum tolerated activity) (MD -0.36, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.17) compared with the control group. However, the study found no significant differences between the groups in impact on forced vital capacity or forced expiratory flow in 1 second.\n\nFor the primary outcome of capacity to self-manage the condition, there is moderate quality evidence from one study that diabetes patients receiving the text messaging intervention demonstrated improved scores on measures of self-management capacity (Self-Efficacy for Diabetes score (MD 6.10, 95% CI 0.45 to 11.75), Diabetes Social Support Interview pooled score (MD 4.39, 95% CI 2.85 to 5.92)), but did not show improved knowledge of diabetes. There is moderate quality evidence from three studies of the effects on treatment compliance. One study showed an increase in hypertensive patients' rates of medication compliance in the intervention group (MD 8.90, 95% CI 0.18 to 17.62) compared with the control group, but in another study there was no statistically significant effect on rates of compliance with peak expiratory flow measurement in asthma patients. Text message prompts for diabetic patients initially also resulted in a higher number of blood glucose results sent back (46.0) than email prompts did (23.5).\n\nFor the secondary outcome of participants' evaluation of the intervention, there is very low quality evidence from two studies that patients receiving mobile phone messaging support reported perceived improvement in diabetes self-management, wanted to continue receiving messages, and preferred mobile phone messaging to email as a method to access a computerised reminder system.\n\nFor the secondary outcome of health service utilisation, there is very low quality evidence from two studies. Diabetes patients receiving text messaging support made a comparable number of clinic visits and calls to an emergency hotline as patients without the support. For asthma patients the total number of office visits was higher in the text messaging group, whereas the number of hospital admissions was higher for the control group.\n\nBecause of the small number of trials included, and the low overall number of participants, for any of the reviewed outcomes the quality of the evidence can at best be considered moderate.\n\nAuthors' conclusions\nWe found some, albeit very limited, indications that in certain cases mobile phone messaging interventions may provide benefit in supporting the self-management of long-term illnesses. However, there are significant information gaps regarding the long-term effects, acceptability, costs, and risks of such interventions. Given the enthusiasm with which so-called mHealth interventions are currently being implemented, further research into these issues is needed.",

While a growing number of technologies offer personal data to the user, little is known about how such tools can be harnessed for and by adolescents. Prior work has focused on implementations, in which youth experience is subordinated to the prescribed aims of adults. Few studies have engaged with the concerns and motives of the young people themselves. Co-design can be a powerful method for exploring beyond such limits, informing design that reflects the voices and values of the designed-for population. This paper presents a case study exploring the design of a personal informatics app (LifeMosaic) by a group of 14 to 16-year-olds. LifeMosaic lets users set any focus they personally care about and track it using colours and stickers. The design was shaped through youth concerns around privacy, social support, flexibility and self-expression as well as the desire to support mental wellbeing. This work illustrates new opportunities and understandings for personal informatics with youth: framing the data as mediating transindividual meaning making.",

This research aimed to develop and test a theory-linked taxonomy of generally applicable behavior change techniques (BCTs). Design: Twenty-six BCTs were defined. Two psychologists used a 5-page coding manual to independently judge the presence or absence of each technique in published intervention descriptions and in intervention manuals. Results: Three systematic reviews yielded 195 published descriptions. Across 78 reliability tests (i.e., 26 techniques applied to 3 reviews), the average kappa per technique was 0.79, with 93% of judgments being agreements. Interventions were found to vary widely in the range and type of techniques used, even when targeting the same behavior among similar participants. The average agreement for intervention manuals was 85%, and a comparison of BCTs identified in 13 manuals and 13 published articles describing the same interventions generated a technique correspondence rate of 74%, with most mismatches (73%) arising from identification of a technique in the manual but not in the article. Conclusions: These findings demonstrate the feasibility of developing standardized definitions of BCTs included in behavioral interventions and highlight problematic variability in the reporting of intervention content.

      "abstract": "Importance  Cardiovascular disease prevention, including lifestyle modification, is important but underutilized. Mobile health strategies could address this gap but lack evidence of therapeutic benefit.  Objective  To examine the effect of a lifestyle-focused semipersonalized support program delivered by mobile phone text message on cardiovascular risk factors.  Design and Setting  The Tobacco, Exercise and Diet Messages (TEXT ME) trial was a parallel-group, single-blind, randomized clinical trial that recruited 710 patients (mean age, 58 [SD, 9.2] years; 82% men; 53% current smokers) with proven coronary heart disease (prior myocardial infarction or proven angiographically) between September 2011 and November 2013 from a large tertiary hospital in Sydney, Australia.  Interventions  Patients in the intervention group (n=352) received 4 text messages per week for 6 months in addition to usual care. Text messages provided advice, motivational reminders, and support to change lifestyle behaviors. Patients in the control group (n=358) received usual care. Messages for each participant were selected from a bank of messages according to baseline characteristics (eg, smoking) and delivered via an automated computerized message management system. The program was not interactive.  Main Outcomes and Measures  The primary end point was low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) level at 6 months. Secondary end points included systolic blood pressure, body mass index (BMI), physical activity, and smoking status.  Results  At 6 months, levels of LDL-C were significantly lower in intervention participants (mean difference, −5 mg/dL [95% CI, −9 to 0]; P =.04). There were concurrent reductions in systolic blood pressure (−7.6 mm Hg [95% CI, −9.8 to −5.4]; P  P  P  P   Conclusions and Relevance  Among patients with coronary heart disease, the use of a lifestyle-focused text messaging service compared with usual care resulted in a modest improvement in LDL-C level and greater improvement in other cardiovascular disease risk factors. The duration of these effects and hence whether they result in improved clinical outcomes remain to be determined.  Trial Registration  anzctr.org.au Identifier:ACTRN12611000161921",

      "abstract": "People strive to obtain self-knowledge. A class of systems called personal informatics is appearing that help people collect and reflect on personal information. However, there is no comprehensive list of problems that users experience using these systems, and no guidance for making these systems more effective. To address this, we conducted surveys and interviews with people who collect and reflect on personal information. We derived a stage-based model of personal informatics systems composed of five stages (preparation, collection, integration, reflection, and action) and identified barriers in each of the stages. These stages have four essential properties: barriers cascade to later stages; they are iterative; they are user-driven and/or system-driven; and they are uni-faceted or multi-faceted. From these properties, we recommend that personal informatics systems should 1) be designed in a holistic manner across the stages; 2) allow iteration between stages; 3) apply an appropriate balance of automated technology and user control within each stage to facilitate the user experience; and 4) explore support for associating multiple facets of people’s lives to enrich the value of systems.",

      "abstract": "Background Mobile health (mHealth) is often reputed to be cost-effective or cost-saving. Despite optimism, the strength of the evidence supporting this assertion has been limited. In this systematic review the body of evidence related to economic evaluations of mHealth interventions is assessed and summarized.   Methods Seven electronic bibliographic databases, grey literature, and relevant references were searched. Eligibility criteria included original articles, comparison of costs and consequences of interventions (one categorized as a primary mHealth intervention or mHealth intervention as a component of other interventions), health and economic outcomes and published in English. Full economic evaluations were appraised using the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) checklist and The PRISMA guidelines were followed.   Results Searches identified 5902 results, of which 318 were examined at full text, and 39 were included in this review. The 39 studies spanned 19 countries, most of which were conducted in upper and upper-middle income countries (34, 87.2%). Primary mHealth interventions (35, 89.7%), behavior change communication type interventions (e.g., improve attendance rates, medication adherence) (27, 69.2%), and short messaging system (SMS) as the mHealth function (e.g., used to send reminders, information, provide support, conduct surveys or collect data) (22, 56.4%) were most frequent; the most frequent disease or condition focuses were outpatient clinic attendance, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. The average percent of CHEERS checklist items reported was 79.6% (range 47.62–100, STD 14.18) and the top quartile reported 91.3–100%. In 29 studies (74.3%), researchers reported that the mHealth intervention was cost-effective, economically beneficial, or cost saving at base case.   Conclusions Findings highlight a growing body of economic evidence for mHealth interventions. Although all studies included a comparison of intervention effectiveness of a health-related outcome and reported economic data, many did not report all recommended economic outcome items and were lacking in comprehensive analysis. The identified economic evaluations varied by disease or condition focus, economic outcome measurements, perspectives, and were distributed unevenly geographically, limiting formal meta-analysis. Further research is needed in low and low-middle income countries and to understand the impact of different mHealth types. Following established economic reporting guidelines will improve this body of research.",

      "abstract": "Background            There are numerous mobile health (mHealth) interventions for treatment adherence and self-management; yet, little is known about user engagement or interaction with these technologies.                                Objective            This systematic review aimed to answer the following questions: (1) How is user engagement defined and measured in studies of mHealth interventions to promote adherence to prescribed medical or health regimens or self-management among people living with a health condition? (2) To what degree are patients engaging with these mHealth interventions? (3) What is the association between user engagement with mHealth interventions and adherence or self-management outcomes? (4) How often is user engagement a research end point?                                Methods            Scientific database (Ovid MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and CINAHL) search results (2016-2021) were screened for inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were extracted in a standardized electronic form. No risk-of-bias assessment was conducted because this review aimed to characterize user engagement measurement rather than certainty in primary study results. The results were synthesized descriptively and thematically.                                Results            A total of 292 studies were included for data extraction. The median number of participants per study was 77 (IQR 34-164). Most of the mHealth interventions were evaluated in nonrandomized studies (157/292, 53.8%), involved people with diabetes (51/292, 17.5%), targeted medication adherence (98/292, 33.6%), and comprised apps (220/292, 75.3%). The principal findings were as follows: (1) >60 unique terms were used to define user engagement; “use” (102/292, 34.9%) and “engagement” (94/292, 32.2%) were the most common; (2) a total of 11 distinct user engagement measurement approaches were identified; the use of objective user log-in data from an app or web portal (160/292, 54.8%) was the most common; (3) although engagement was inconsistently evaluated, most of the studies (99/195, 50.8%) reported >1 level of engagement due to the use of multiple measurement methods or analyses, decreased engagement across time (76/99, 77%), and results and conclusions suggesting that higher engagement was associated with positive adherence or self-management (60/103, 58.3%); and (4) user engagement was a research end point in only 19.2% (56/292) of the studies.                                Conclusions            The results revealed major limitations in the literature reviewed, including significant variability in how user engagement is defined, a tendency to rely on user log-in data over other measurements, and critical gaps in how user engagement is evaluated (infrequently evaluated over time or in relation to adherence or self-management outcomes and rarely considered a research end point). Recommendations are outlined in response to our findings with the goal of improving research rigor in this area.

      "abstract": "This paper proposes an approach to assess digital health readiness in clinical settings to understand how prepared, experienced, and equipped individual people are to participate in digital health activities. Existing digital health literacy and telehealth prediction tools exist but do not assess technological aptitude for particular tasks or incorporate available electronic health record data to improve efficiency and efficacy. As such, we propose a multidomain digital health readiness assessment that incorporates a person’s stated goals and motivations for use of digital health, a focused digital health literacy assessment, passively collected data from the electronic health record, and a focused aptitude assessment for critical skills needed to achieve a person’s goals. This combination of elements should allow for easy integration into clinical workflows and make the assessment as actionable as possible for health care providers and in-clinic digital health navigators. Digital health readiness profiles could be used to match individuals with support interventions to promote the use of digital tools like telehealth, mobile apps, and remote monitoring, especially for those who are motivated but do not have adequate experience. Moreover, while effective and holistic digital health readiness assessments could contribute to increased use and greater equity in digital health engagement, they must also be designed with inclusivity in mind to avoid worsening known disparities in digital health care.",

In this work, we aim to gain insights from these “extreme users,” who have used existing technologies and built their own workarounds to overcome different barriers. We conducted a qualitative and quantitative analysis of 52 video recordings of Quantified Self Meetup talks to understand what they did, how they did it, and what they learned. We highlight several common pitfalls to self-tracking, including tracking too many things, not tracking triggers and context, and insufficient scientific rigor.

Ten processes of change have been identified for producing progress along with decisional balance, self-efficacy, and temptations. Basic research has generated a rule of thumb for at-risk populations: 40% in precontemplation, 40% in contemplation, and 20% in preparation. Across 12 health behaviors, consistent patterns have been found between the pros and cons of changing and the stages of change. Applied research has demonstrated dramatic improvements in recruitment, retention, and progress using stage-matched interventions and proactive recruitment procedures. The most promising outcomes to date have been found with computer-based individualized and interactive interventions. The most promising enhancement to the computer-based programs are personalized counselors. One of the most striking results to date for stag...",

      "abstract": "The 2019 German Digital Healthcare Act introduced the Digital Health Application program, known in German as ‘Digitale Gesundheitsanwendungen’ (DiGA). The program has established a pioneering model for integrating Digital Therapeutics (DTx) into a healthcare system with scalable and effective reimbursement strategies. To date, the continuous upward trend enabled by this framework has resulted in more than 374,000 DiGA prescriptions, increasingly cementing its role in the German healthcare system. This perspective provides a synthesis of the DiGA program’s evolution since its inception three years ago, highlighting trends regarding prescriptions and pricing as well as criticisms and identified shortcomings. It further discusses forthcoming legislative amendments, including the anticipated integration of higher-risk medical devices, which have the potential to significantly transform the program. Despite encountering challenges related to effectiveness, evidence requirements, and integration within the healthcare system, the DiGA program continues to evolve and serves as a seminal example for the integration of DTx, offering valuable insights for healthcare systems globally.",

      "abstract": "Abstract                Background                Many implementation efforts fail, even with highly developed plans for execution, because contextual factors can be powerful forces working against implementation in the real world. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) is one of the most commonly used determinant frameworks to assess these contextual factors; however, it has been over 10 years since publication and there is a need for updates. The purpose of this project was to elicit feedback from experienced CFIR users to inform updates to the framework.                              Methods                User feedback was obtained from two sources: (1) a literature review with a systematic search; and (2) a survey of authors who used the CFIR in a published study. Data were combined across both sources and reviewed to identify themes; a consensus approach was used to finalize all CFIR updates. The VA Ann Arbor Healthcare System IRB declared this study exempt from the requirements of 38 CFR 16 based on category 2.                              Results                The systematic search yielded 376 articles that contained the CFIR in the title and/or abstract and 334 unique authors with contact information; 59 articles included feedback on the CFIR. Forty percent (n = 134/334) of authors completed the survey. The CFIR received positive ratings on most framework sensibility items (e.g., applicability, usability), but respondents also provided recommendations for changes. Overall, updates to the CFIR include revisions to existing domains and constructs as well as the addition, removal, or relocation of constructs. These changes address important critiques of the CFIR, including better centering innovation recipients and adding determinants to equity in implementation.                              Conclusion                The updates in the CFIR reflect feedback from a growing community of CFIR users. Although there are many updates, constructs can be mapped back to the original CFIR to ensure longitudinal consistency. We  encourage users to continue critiquing the CFIR, facilitating the evolution of the framework as implementation science advances.",

While many systematic reviews have assessed the effectiveness of mHealth on health outcomes, the role of health professions in promoting mHealth adoption and leading to improved outcomes is less clear. This systematic review of systematic reviews (SR of SRs) critically appraises and synthesises evidence to examine both the impact of mHealth interventions on service users' outcomes and the role of health professions in facilitating their adoption.                                Methods            Five electronic databases—EMBASE, CINAHL Plus, Medline, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library—were searched for systematic reviews published between 1 January 2015 and 8 June 2024. Reviews focused on the impact of mHealth interventions on service users' outcomes and the role of health professions in promoting adoption were included. Screening, data extraction, and quality assessment were conducted by four independent reviewers.                                Results            Fourteen systematic reviews, covering 393 primary studies, were included. mHealth interventions showed positive impacts on clinical outcomes, such as reductions in blood pressure, HbA1c, and cholesterol. Behavioural improvements were also reported, including better medication adherence and physical activity. Psychological benefits, such as reduced anxiety and enhanced patient satisfaction, were noted. The involvement of health professions significantly enhanced mHealth outcomes. However, challenges such as sustainability, accessibility, and usability remain.                                Discussion            This SR of SRs provides critical insights into the effectiveness of mHealth interventions on health outcomes and highlights the important role of health professions in promoting their adoption. While the findings are promising, concerns about training, sustainability, accessibility, and user acceptance need to be addressed to improve the broader adoption of mHealth interventions. Further research is recommended to address these challenges and enhance the long-term success of mHealth tools in healthcare.

      "abstract": "Background: Mobile phone usage has been rapidly increasing worldwide. mHealth could efficiently deliver high-quality health care, but the evidence supporting its current effectiveness is still mixed. Objective: We performed a systematic review of systematic reviews to assess the impact or effectiveness of mobile health (mHealth) interventions in different health conditions and in the processes of health care service delivery. Methods: We used a common search strategy of five major scientific databases, restricting the search by publication date, language, and parameters in methodology and content. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) checklist. Results: The searches resulted in a total of 10,689 articles. Of these, 23 systematic reviews (371 studies; more than 79,665 patients) were included. Seventeen reviews included studies performed in low- and middle-income countries. The studies used diverse mHealth interventions, most frequently text messaging (short message service, SMS) applied to different purposes (reminder, alert, education, motivation, prevention). Ten reviews were rated as low quality (AMSTAR score 0-4), seven were rated as moderate quality (AMSTAR score 5-8), and six were categorized as high quality (AMSTAR score 9-11). A beneficial impact of mHealth was observed in chronic disease management, showing improvement in symptoms and peak flow variability in asthma patients, reducing hospitalizations and improving forced expiratory volume in 1 second; improving chronic pulmonary diseases symptoms; improving heart failure symptoms, reducing deaths and hospitalization; improving glycemic control in diabetes patients; improving blood pressure in hypertensive patients; and reducing weight in overweight and obese patients. Studies also showed a positive impact of SMS reminders in improving attendance rates, with a similar impact to phone call reminders at reduced cost, and improved adherence to tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus therapy in some scenarios, with evidence of decrease of viral load. Conclusions: Although mHealth is growing in popularity, the evidence for efficacy is still limited. In general, the methodological quality of the studies included in the systematic reviews is low. For some fields, its impact is not evident, the results are mixed, or no long-term studies exist. Exceptions include the moderate quality evidence of improvement in asthma patients, attendance rates, and increased smoking abstinence rates. Most studies were performed in high-income countries, implying that mHealth is still at an early stage of development in low-income countries.",

      "abstract": "Disease diagnosis and monitoring using conventional healthcare services is typically expensive and has limited accuracy. Wearable health technology based on flexible electronics has gained tremendous attention in recent years for monitoring patient health owing to attractive features, such as lower medical costs, quick access to patient health data, ability to operate and transmit data in harsh environments, storage at room temperature, non-invasive implementation, mass scaling, etc. This technology provides an opportunity for disease pre-diagnosis and immediate therapy. Wearable sensors have opened a new area of personalized health monitoring by accurately measuring physical states and biochemical signals. Despite the progress to date in the development of wearable sensors, there are still several limitations in the accuracy of the data collected, precise disease diagnosis, and early treatment. This necessitates advances in applied materials and structures and using artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled wearable sensors to extract target signals for accurate clinical decision-making and efficient medical care. In this paper, we review two significant aspects of smart wearable sensors. First, we offer an overview of the most recent progress in improving wearable sensor performance for physical, chemical, and biosensors, focusing on materials, structural configurations, and transduction mechanisms. Next, we review the use of AI technology in combination with wearable technology for big data processing, self-learning, power-efficiency, real-time data acquisition and processing, and personalized health for an intelligent sensing platform. Finally, we present the challenges and future opportunities associated with smart wearable sensors.",

      "abstract": "Background            The high demand for health care services and the growing capability of artificial intelligence have led to the development of conversational agents designed to support a variety of health-related activities, including behavior change, treatment support, health monitoring, training, triage, and screening support. Automation of these tasks could free clinicians to focus on more complex work and increase the accessibility to health care services for the public. An overarching assessment of the acceptability, usability, and effectiveness of these agents in health care is needed to collate the evidence so that future development can target areas for improvement and potential for sustainable adoption.                                Objective            This systematic review aims to assess the effectiveness and usability of conversational agents in health care and identify the elements that users like and dislike to inform future research and development of these agents.                                Methods            PubMed, Medline (Ovid), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica dataBASE), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Web of Science, and the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library were systematically searched for articles published since 2008 that evaluated unconstrained natural language processing conversational agents used in health care. EndNote (version X9, Clarivate Analytics) reference management software was used for initial screening, and full-text screening was conducted by 1 reviewer. Data were extracted, and the risk of bias was assessed by one reviewer and validated by another.                                Results            A total of 31 studies were selected and included a variety of conversational agents, including 14 chatbots (2 of which were voice chatbots), 6 embodied conversational agents (3 of which were interactive voice response calls, virtual patients, and speech recognition screening systems), 1 contextual question-answering agent, and 1 voice recognition triage system. Overall, the evidence reported was mostly positive or mixed. Usability and satisfaction performed well (27/30 and 26/31), and positive or mixed effectiveness was found in three-quarters of the studies (23/30). However, there were several limitations of the agents highlighted in specific qualitative feedback.                                Conclusions            The studies generally reported positive or mixed evidence for the effectiveness, usability, and satisfactoriness of the conversational agents investigated, but qualitative user perceptions were more mixed. The quality of many of the studies was limited, and improved study design and reporting are necessary to more accurately evaluate the usefulness of the agents in health care and identify key areas for improvement. Further research should also analyze the cost-effectiveness, privacy, and security of the agents.

      "abstract": "Background            Digital health interventions (DHIs) have shown promising results in enhancing the management of heart failure (HF). Although health care interventions are increasingly being delivered digitally, with growing evidence on the potential cost-effectiveness of adopting them, there has been little effort to collate and synthesize the findings.                                Objective            This study’s objective was to systematically review the economic evaluations that assess the adoption of DHIs in the management and treatment of HF.                                Methods            A systematic review was conducted using 3 electronic databases: PubMed, EBSCOhost, and Scopus. Articles reporting full economic evaluations of DHIs for patients with HF published up to July 2023 were eligible for inclusion. Study characteristics, design (both trial based and model based), input parameters, and main results were extracted from full-text articles. Data synthesis was conducted based on the technologies used for delivering DHIs in the management of patients with HF, and the findings were analyzed narratively. The PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines were followed for this systematic review. The reporting quality of the included studies was evaluated using the CHEERS (Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards) guidelines.                                Results            Overall, 27 economic evaluations were included in the review. The economic evaluations were based on models (13/27, 48%), trials (13/27, 48%), or a combination approach (1/27, 4%). The devices evaluated included noninvasive remote monitoring devices (eg, home telemonitoring using digital tablets or specific medical devices that enable transmission of physiological data), telephone support, mobile apps and wearables, remote monitoring follow-up in patients with implantable medical devices, and videoconferencing systems. Most of the studies (24/27, 89%) used cost-utility analysis. The majority of the studies (25/27, 93%) were conducted in high-income countries, particularly European countries (16/27, 59%) such as the United Kingdom and the Netherlands. Mobile apps and wearables, remote monitoring follow-up in patients with implantable medical devices, and videoconferencing systems yielded cost-effective results or even emerged as dominant strategies. However, conflicting results were observed, particularly in noninvasive remote monitoring devices and telephone support. In 15% (4/27) of the studies, these DHIs were found to be less costly and more effective than the comparators (ie, dominant), while 33% (9/27) reported them to be more costly but more effective with incremental cost-effectiveness ratios below the respective willingness-to-pay thresholds (ie, cost-effective). Furthermore, in 11% (3/27) of the studies, noninvasive remote monitoring devices and telephone support were either above the willingness-to-pay thresholds or more costly than, yet as effective as, the comparators (ie, not cost-effective). In terms of reporting quality, the studies were classified as good (20/27, 74%), moderate (6/27, 22%), or excellent (1/27, 4%).                                Conclusions            Despite the conflicting results, the main findings indicated that, overall, DHIs were more cost-effective than non-DHI alternatives.

      "abstract": "Abstract\n            The CONSORT 2010 (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement provides minimum guidelines for reporting randomised trials. Its widespread use has been instrumental in ensuring transparency when evaluating new interventions. More recently, there has been a growing recognition that interventions involving artificial intelligence (AI) need to undergo rigorous, prospective evaluation to demonstrate impact on health outcomes.\n            The CONSORT-AI extension is a new reporting guideline for clinical trials evaluating interventions with an AI component. It was developed in parallel with its companion statement for clinical trial protocols: SPIRIT-AI. Both guidelines were developed through a staged consensus process, involving a literature review and expert consultation to generate 29 candidate items, which were assessed by an international multi-stakeholder group in a two-stage Delphi survey (103 stakeholders), agreed on in a two-day consensus meeting (31 stakeholders) and refined through a checklist pilot (34 participants).\n            The CONSORT-AI extension includes 14 new items, which were considered sufficiently important for AI interventions, that they should be routinely reported in addition to the core CONSORT 2010 items. CONSORT-AI recommends that investigators provide clear descriptions of the AI intervention, including instructions and skills required for use, the setting in which the AI intervention is integrated, the handling of inputs and outputs of the AI intervention, the human-AI interaction and providing analysis of error cases.\n            CONSORT-AI will help promote transparency and completeness in reporting clinical trials for AI interventions. It will assist editors and peer-reviewers, as well as the general readership, to understand, interpret and critically appraise the quality of clinical trial design and risk of bias in the reported outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Background            With a growing focus on patient interaction with health management, mobile apps are increasingly used to deliver behavioral health interventions. The large variation in these mobile health apps—their target patient group, health behavior, and behavioral change strategies—has resulted in a large but incohesive body of literature.                                Objective            This systematic review aimed to assess the effectiveness of mobile apps in improving health behaviors and outcomes and to examine the inclusion and effectiveness of behavior change techniques (BCTs) in mobile health apps.                                Methods            PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, and Web of Science were systematically searched for articles published between 2014 and 2019 that evaluated mobile apps for health behavior change. Two authors independently screened and selected studies according to the eligibility criteria. Data were extracted and the risk of bias was assessed by one reviewer and validated by a second reviewer.                                Results            A total of 52 randomized controlled trials met the inclusion criteria and were included in the analysis—37 studies focused on physical activity, diet, or a combination of both, 11 on drug and alcohol use, and 4 on mental health. Participant perceptions were generally positive—only one app was rated as less helpful and satisfactory than the control—and the studies that measured engagement and usability found relatively high study completion rates (mean 83%; n=18, N=39) and ease-of-use ratings (3 significantly better than control, 9/15 rated >70%). However, there was little evidence of changed behavior or health outcomes.                                Conclusions            There was no strong evidence in support of the effectiveness of mobile apps in improving health behaviors or outcomes because few studies found significant differences between the app and control groups. Further research is needed to identify the BCTs that are most effective at promoting behavior change. Improved reporting is necessary to accurately evaluate the mobile health app effectiveness and risk of bias.",

We searched MEDLINE, Embase and PsycINFO using terms related to JITAIs, mHealth, behaviour change and intervention methodology. Narrative analysis assessed theoretical foundations, real‐time data capturing and processing methods, outcome evaluation and summarized JITAI efficacy. Quality of intervention reporting was assessed using the template for intervention description and replication (TIDieR) checklist.ResultsSixty‐two JITAIs across physical activity, sedentary behaviour, dietary behaviour, substance use, sexual behaviour, fluid intake, treatment adherence, social skills, gambling behaviour and self‐management skills were included. The majority (71%) aimed to evaluate feasibility, acceptability and/or usability. Supporting evidence for JITAI development was identified in 46 studies, with 67% applying this to develop tailored intervention content. Over half (55%) relied solely on self‐reported data for tailoring, and 13 studies used only passive monitoring data. While data processing methods were commonly reported, 44% did not specify their techniques. 89% of JITAI designs achieved full marks on the TIDieR checklist and provided sufficient details on JITAI components. Overall, JITAIs proved to be feasible, acceptable and user‐friendly across behaviours and settings. Randomized trials showed tailored interventions were efficacious, though outcomes varied by behaviour.ConclusionsJITAIs offer a promising approach to developing personalized interventions, with their potential effects continuously growing. The recommended checklist emphasizes the importance of reporting transparency in establishing robust intervention designs.",

      "abstract": "Background            Understanding patterns of real-world usage of mental health apps is key to maximizing their potential to increase public self-management of care. Although developer-led studies have published results on the use of mental health apps in real-world settings, no study yet has systematically examined usage patterns of a large sample of mental health apps relying on independently collected data.                                Objective            Our aim is to present real-world objective data on user engagement with popular mental health apps.                                Methods            A systematic engine search was conducted using Google Play to identify Android apps with 10,000 installs or more targeting anxiety, depression, or emotional well-being. Coding of apps included primary incorporated techniques and mental health focus. Behavioral data on real-world usage were obtained from a panel that provides aggregated nonpersonal information on user engagement with mobile apps.                                Results            In total, 93 apps met the inclusion criteria (installs: median 100,000, IQR 90,000). The median percentage of daily active users (open rate) was 4.0% (IQR 4.7%) with a difference between trackers (median 6.3%, IQR 10.2%) and peer-support apps (median 17.0%) versus breathing exercise apps (median 1.6%, IQR 1.6%; all z≥3.42, all P<.001). Among active users, daily minutes of use were significantly higher for mindfulness/meditation (median 21.47, IQR 15.00) and peer support (median 35.08, n=2) apps than for apps incorporating other techniques (tracker, breathing exercise, psychoeducation: medians range 3.53-8.32; all z≥2.11, all P<.05). The medians of app 15-day and 30-day retention rates were 3.9% (IQR 10.3%) and 3.3% (IQR 6.2%), respectively. On day 30, peer support (median 8.9%, n=2), mindfulness/meditation (median 4.7%, IQR 6.2%), and tracker apps (median 6.1%, IQR 20.4%) had significantly higher retention rates than breathing exercise apps (median 0.0%, IQR 0.0%; all z≥2.18, all P≤.04). The pattern of daily use presented a descriptive peak toward the evening for apps incorporating most techniques (tracker, psychoeducation, and peer support) except mindfulness/meditation, which exhibited two peaks (morning and night).                                Conclusions            Although the number of app installs and daily active minutes of use may seem high, only a small portion of users actually used the apps for a long period of time. More studies using different datasets are needed to understand this phenomenon and the ways in which users self-manage their condition in real-world settings.",

However, a comprehensive synthesis of strategies contributing to these interventions is lacking.                                Objective            This study aims to (1) identify and categorize the strategies used in digital health interventions over the past 25 years; (2) explore the differences and changes in these strategies across time periods, countries, populations, delivery methods, and senders; and (3) serve as a valuable reference for future researchers and practitioners to improve the effectiveness of digital health interventions.                                Methods            This study followed a systematic review approach, complemented by close reading and text coding. A comprehensive search for published English academic papers from PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus was conducted. The search employed a combination of digital health and intervention-related terms, along with database-specific subject headings and filters. The time span covered 25 years, from January 1, 1999, to March 10, 2024. Sample papers were selected based on study design, intervention details, and strategies. The strategies were identified and categorized based on the principles of Behavior Change Techniques and Behavior Strategies.                                Results            A total of 885 papers involving 954,847 participants met the eligibility criteria. We identified 173 unique strategies used in digital health interventions, categorized into 19 themes. The 3 most frequently used strategies in the sample papers were “guide” (n=492, 55.6%), “monitor” (n=490, 55.4%), and “communication” (n=392, 44.3%). The number of strategies employed in each paper ranged from 1 to 32. Most interventions targeted clients (n=844, 95.4%) and were carried out in hospitals (n=268, 30.3%). High-income countries demonstrated a substantially higher number and diversity of identified strategies than low- and middle-income countries, and the number of studies targeting the public (n=647, 73.1%) far exceeded those focusing on vulnerable groups (n=238, 26.9%).                                Conclusions            Digital health interventions and strategies have undergone considerable development over the past 25 years. They have evolved from simple approaches to sophisticated, personalized techniques and are trending toward multifaceted interventions, leveraging advanced technologies for real-time monitoring and feedback. Future studies should focus on rigorous evaluations, long-term effectiveness, and tailored approaches for diverse populations, and more attention should be given to vulnerable groups.",

As the burden of chronic diseases continues to grow globally, so does the impact of non-adherence. Mobile technologies are increasingly being used in health care and public health practice (mHealth) for patient communication, monitoring, and education, and to facilitate adherence to chronic diseases management. Objective We conducted a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the effectiveness of mHealth in supporting the adherence of patients to chronic diseases management (“mAdherence”), and the usability, feasibility, and acceptability of mAdherence tools and platforms in chronic disease management among patients and health care providers. Methods We searched PubMed, Embase, and EBSCO databases for studies that assessed the role of mAdherence in chronic disease management of diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, and chronic lung diseases from 1980 through May 2014. Outcomes of interest included effect of mHealth on patient adherence to chronic diseases management, disease-specific clinical outcomes after intervention, and the usability, feasibility, and acceptability of mAdherence tools and platforms in chronic disease management among target end-users. Results In all, 107 articles met all inclusion criteria. Short message service was the most commonly used mAdherence tool in 40.2% (43/107) of studies. Usability, feasibility, and acceptability or patient preferences for mAdherence interventions were assessed in 57.9% (62/107) of studies and found to be generally high. A total of 27 studies employed randomized controlled trial (RCT) methods to assess impact on adherence behaviors, and significant improvements were observed in 15 of those studies (56%). Of the 41 RCTs that measured effects on disease-specific clinical outcomes, significant improvements between groups were reported in 16 studies (39%). Conclusions There is potential for mHealth tools to better facilitate adherence to chronic disease management, but the evidence supporting its current effectiveness is mixed. Further research should focus on understanding and improving how mHealth tools can overcome specific barriers to adherence.",

      "abstract": "Background Digital therapeutics are patient-facing digital health interventions that can significantly alter the health care landscape. Despite digital therapeutics being used to successfully treat a range of conditions, their uptake in health systems remains limited. Understanding the full spectrum of uptake factors is essential to identify ways in which policy makers and providers can facilitate the adoption of effective digital therapeutics within a health system, as well as the steps developers can take to assist in the deployment of products. Objective In this review, we aimed to map the most frequently discussed factors that determine the integration of digital therapeutics into health systems and practical use of digital therapeutics by patients and professionals. Methods A scoping review was conducted in MEDLINE, Web of Science, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Google Scholar. Relevant data were extracted and synthesized using a thematic analysis. Results We identified 35,541 academic and 221 gray literature reports, with 244 (0.69%) included in the review, covering 35 countries. Overall, 85 factors that can impact the uptake of digital therapeutics were extracted and pooled into 5 categories: policy and system, patient characteristics, properties of digital therapeutics, characteristics of health professionals, and outcomes. The need for a regulatory framework for digital therapeutics was the most stated factor at the policy level. Demographic characteristics formed the most iterated patient-related factor, whereas digital literacy was considered the most important factor for health professionals. Among the properties of digital therapeutics, their interoperability across the broader health system was most emphasized. Finally, the ability to expand access to health care was the most frequently stated outcome measure. Conclusions The map of factors developed in this review offers a multistakeholder approach to recognizing the uptake factors of digital therapeutics in the health care pathway and provides an analytical tool for policy makers to assess their health system’s readiness for digital therapeutics.",

Because the opportunity cost of investing in DHIs can be large, countries must make choices about which interventions to scale up. To make good investment decisions about DHIs, there is a need to define and establish their value within the local health system. Economic evaluation enables a systematic and evidence-based approach to describing value; however, guidance and applied economic evaluation of DHIs in developing country settings are limited. The implementation context and regulatory framework for DHIs in many resource-constrained settings is often fragmented and uncertain, creating unique challenges for economic evaluation. However, limited resources reinforce the need to adopt analytical approaches to manage this uncertainty and inform high-value investments in digital health.                  This paper develops an economic evaluation framework to assist in establishing the economic value of DHIs to inform policy, programming and appropriate scale-up in resource-constrained settings. It is intended for country governments and those providing technical assistance in global development related to digital health. The DHI economic evaluation framework consists of 5 steps: (1) determine the context, (2) determine the intervention type, (3) establish the level of complexity, (4) apply the analytic principles and (5) represent the value proposition. The framework facilitates methodological transparency and structure, thereby improving the overall usefulness of economic evaluations of DHIs and a starting point for more comprehensive and localized processes.                                                RESUMEN                  Las Intervenciones de Salud Digital (ISD) ofrecen una promesa significativa para abordar desafíos del sistema de salud y el ‘estudio piloto de ISD’ es ubicuo en el contexto de los países en vías de desarrollo. Dado que el coste de oportunidad de invertir en ISD puede ser alto, los países tienen que tomar decisiones al escoger qué intervenciones escalar. Para tomar buenas decisiones en el financiamiento de las ISD, se necesita definir y establecer su valor dentro del sistema de salud local. La evaluación económica permite adscribir valía de manera sistemática y basándose en pruebas, pero la orientación y evaluación económica aplicada a ISD en países en desarrollo son escasas. El contexto para la implementación y los marcos normativos que operan sobre las ISD suelen ser inciertos y fragmentarios en lugares de limitados recursos, lo que crea desafíos singulares para la evaluación económica. A pesar de lo anterior, el hecho mismo de que los recursos sean limitados subraya la necesidad de adoptar enfoques analíticos para manejar esta incertidumbre e informar la inversión de alto nivel en salud digital.                  Este escrito desarrolla un marco de evaluación económica que ayude a establecer el valor económico de las ISD para informar políticas, programación, y escalamiento apropiado, en entornos de recursos limitados. Está dirigido a gobiernos de estado y a quienes proveen asistencia técnica en desarrollo global con relación a salud digital. El marco de evaluación económica de ISD consta de 5 pasos: (1) determina el contexto; (2) determina el tipo de intervención; (3) establece el nivel de complejidad; (4) aplica los principios analíticos; y (5) representa la propuesta de valor. El Marco facilita la transparencia y estructura metodológicas, mejorando así la utilidad general de las evaluaciones económicas de las ISD y brindando un punto de partida para procesos más exhaustivos y localizados.                                                RESUMO                  As intervenções de saúde digitais (DHI) são muito promissoras para enfrentar os desafios do sistema de saúde e o ‘piloto DHI’ é omnipresente nos contextos dos países em desenvolvimento. Uma vez que o custo de oportunidade do investimento em IDS pode ser elevado, os países têm de fazer escolhas sobre quais as intervenções a alargar. Para tomar boas decisões de investimento nas IDS, é necessário definir e estabelecer o seu valor no âmbito do sistema de saúde local. A avaliação económica permite uma abordagem sistemática e baseada em provas para descrever o valor. No entanto, as orientações e a avaliação económica aplicada das IDS nos países em desenvolvimento são limitadas. O contexto de implementação e o quadro regulamentar das IDS em muitos contextos com recursos limitados são frequentemente fragmentados e incertos, criando desafios únicos para a avaliação económica. No entanto, os recursos limitados reforçam a necessidade de adotar abordagens analíticas para gerir esta incerteza e informar os investimentos de elevado valor na saúde digital.                  Este documento desenvolve um quadro de avaliação económica para ajudar a estabelecer o valor económico das DHI para informar a política, a programação e a expansão adequada em contextos de recursos limitados. Destina-se aos governos nacionais e aos que prestam assistência técnica no desenvolvimento global relacionado com a saúde digital. O quadro de avaliação económica das IDS é composto por 5 etapas: (1) determinar o contexto, (2) determinar o tipo de intervenção, (3) estabelecer o nível de complexidade, (4) aplicar os princípios analíticos e (5) representar a proposta de valor. O Quadro facilita a transparência e a estrutura metodológica, melhorando assim a utilidade global das avaliações económicas das IDS e constituindo um ponto de partida para processos mais abrangentes e localizados.                                                RÉSUMÉ                  Les interventions de santé numérique (ISN) sont très prometteuses pour relever les défis du système de santé et le « projet pilote ISN » est omniprésent dans les contextes des pays en développement. Étant donné que le coût de l’opportunité d’investissement dans les ISN peut être important, les pays doivent faire des choix quant aux interventions à intensifier. Pour prendre de bonnes décisions d’investissement concernant les ISN, il est nécessaire de définir et d’établir leur valeur au sein du système de santé local. Une évaluation économique permet une approche systématique et fondée sur des données probantes pour décrire leur valeur, mais les directives et l’évaluation économique appliquée des ISN dans les pays en développement sont limitées. Le contexte de mise en œuvre et le cadre réglementaire des ISN dans de nombreux contextes aux ressources limitées sont souvent fragmentés et incertains, créant des défis uniques pour l’évaluation économique. Cependant, les ressources limitées renforcent la nécessité d’adopter des approches analytiques pour gérer cette incertitude et éclairer les investissements à forte valeur ajoutée dans la santé numérique.                  Ce document développe un cadre d’évaluation économique pour aider à établir la valeur économique des ISN afin d’éclairer les politiques, la programmation et une mise à l’échelle appropriée dans des contextes aux ressources limitées. Il est destiné aux gouvernements des pays et à ceux qui fournissent une assistance technique dans le développement mondial lié à la santé numérique. Le cadre d’évaluation économique des ISN comprend 5 étapes: (1) déterminer le contexte, (2) déterminer le type d’intervention, (3) établir le niveau de complexité, (4) appliquer les principes analytiques et (5) représenter la proposition de valeur.. Le cadre facilite la transparence et la structure méthodologiques, améliorant ainsi l’utilité globale des évaluations économiques des ISN et constituant un point de départ pour des processus plus complets et localisés.",

      "abstract": "AbstractThe mobile health (mHealth) industry is an enormous global market; however, the dropout or continuance of mHealth is a major challenge that is affecting its positive outcomes. To date, the results of studies on the impact factors have been inconsistent. Consequently, research on the pooled effects of impact factors on the continuance intention of mHealth is limited. Therefore, this study aims to systematically analyze quantitative studies on the continuance intention of mHealth and explore the pooled effect of each direct and indirect impact factor. Until October 2021, eight literature databases were searched. Fifty-eight peer-reviewed studies on the impact factors and effects on continuance intention of mHealth were included. Out of the 19 direct impact factors of continuance intention, 15 are significant, with attitude (β = 0.450; 95% CI: 0.135, 0.683), satisfaction (β = 0.406; 95% CI: 0.292, 0.509), health empowerment (β = 0.359; 95% CI: 0.204, 0.497), perceived usefulness (β = 0.343; 95% CI: 0.280, 0.403), and perceived quality of health life (β = 0.315, 95% CI: 0.211, 0.412) having the largest pooled effect coefficients on continuance intention. There is high heterogeneity between the studies; thus, we conducted a subgroup analysis to explore the moderating effect of different characteristics on the impact effects. The geographic region, user type, mHealth type, user age, and publication year significantly moderate influential relationships, such as trust and continuance intention. Thus, mHealth developers should develop personalized continuous use promotion strategies based on user characteristics.",

      "abstract": "Abstract                      Background            Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Frequent exacerbations result in higher use of emergency services and hospitalizations, leading to poor patient outcomes and high costs. The objective of this study is to demonstrate the feasibility of a multimodal, community-based intervention in treating acute COPD exacerbations.                                Results            Over 18 months, 1,333 patients were approached and 100 (7.5%) were enrolled (mean age 66, 52% female). Ninety-six participants (96%) remained in the study for the full enrollment period. Fifty-five (55%) participated in tele-pulmonary-rehabilitation. Participants wore the smartwatch for a median of 114 days (IQR 30–210) and 18.9 h/day (IQR16-20) resulting in a median of 1034 min/day (IQR 939–1133). The rate at which participants completed scheduled survey instruments ranged from 78–93%. Nearly all participants (85%) performed COPD ecological momentary assessment at least once with a median of 4.85 recordings during study participation. On average, a 2.48-point improvement (p = 0.03) in COPD Assessment Test Score was observed from baseline to study completion. The adherence and symptom improvement metrics were not associated with baseline patient activation measures.                                Conclusions            A multimodal intervention combining preventative care, symptom and biometric monitoring, and MIH services was feasible in adults living with COPD. Participants demonstrated high protocol fidelity and engagement and reported improved quality of life.

      "abstract": "The potential and threat of digital tools to achieve health equity has been highlighted for over a decade, but the success of achieving equitable access to health technologies remains challenging. Our paper addresses renewed concerns regarding equity in digital health access that were deepened during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our viewpoint is that (1) digital health tools have the potential to improve health equity if equitable access is achieved, and (2) improving access and equity in digital health can be strengthened by considering behavioral science–based strategies embedded in all phases of tool development. Using behavioral, equity, and access frameworks allowed for a unique and comprehensive exploration of current drivers of digital health inequities. This paper aims to present a compilation of strategies that can potentially have an actionable impact on digital health equity. Multilevel factors drive unequal access, so strategies require action from tool developers, individual delivery agents, organizations, and systems to effect change. Strategies were shaped with a behavioral medicine focus as the field has a unique role in improving digital health access; arguably, all digital tools require the user (individual, provider, and health system) to change behavior by engaging with the technology to generate impact. This paper presents a model that emphasizes using multilevel strategies across design, delivery, dissemination, and sustainment stages to advance digital health access and foster health equity.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Most adults do not engage in sufficient physical activity to maintain good health. Smartphone apps are increasingly used to support physical activity but typically focus on tracking behaviors with no support for the complex process of behavior change. Tracking features do not engage all users, and apps could better reach their targets by engaging users in reflecting their reasons, capabilities, and opportunities to change. Motivational interviewing supports this active engagement in self-reflection and self-regulation by fostering psychological needs proposed by the self-determination theory (ie, autonomy, competence, and relatedness). However, it is unknown whether digitalized motivational interviewing in a smartphone app engages users in this process.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aimed to describe the theory- and evidence-based development of the Precious app and to examine how digitalized motivational interviewing using a smartphone app engages users in the behavior change process. Specifically, we aimed to determine if use of the Precious app elicits change talk in participants and how they perceive autonomy support in the app.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A multidisciplinary team built the Precious app to support engagement in the behavior change process. The Precious app targets reflective processes with motivational interviewing and spontaneous processes with gamified tools, and builds on the principles of self-determination theory and control theory by using 7 relational techniques and 12 behavior change techniques. The feasibility of the app was tested among 12 adults, who were asked to interact with the prototype and think aloud. Semistructured interviews allowed participants to extend their statements. Participants’ interactions with the app were video recorded, transcribed, and analyzed with deductive thematic analysis to identify the theoretical themes related to autonomy support and change talk.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Participants valued the autonomy supportive features in the Precious app (eg, freedom to pursue personally relevant goals and receive tailored feedback). We identified the following five themes based on the theory-based theme autonomy support: valuing the chance to choose, concern about lack of autonomy, expecting controlling features, autonomous goals, and autonomy supportive feedback. The motivational interviewing features actively engaged participants in reflecting their outcome goals and reasons for activity, producing several types of change talk and very little sustain talk. The types of change talk identified were desire, need, reasons, ability, commitment, and taking steps toward change.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The Precious app takes a unique approach to engage users in the behavior change process by targeting both reflective and spontaneous processes. It allows motivational interviewing in a mobile form, supports psychological needs with relational techniques, and targets intrinsic motivation with gamified elements. The motivational interviewing approach shows promise, but the impact of its interactive features and tailored feedback needs to be studied over time. The Precious app is undergoing testing in a series of n-of-1 randomized controlled trials.",

Eight databases were searched for studies published in English from 1995 to 17 September 2014. Eighty‐four studies were included, with 183 intervention arms, of which 76% (n = 139) included an eHealth component. Sixty‐one studies had the primary aim of weight loss, 10 weight loss maintenance, eight weight gain prevention, and five weight loss and maintenance. eHealth interventions were predominantly delivered using the Internet, but also email, text messages, monitoring devices, mobile applications, computer programs, podcasts and personal digital assistants. Forty percent (n = 55) of interventions used more than one type of technology, and 43.2% (n = 60) were delivered solely using eHealth technologies. Meta‐analyses demonstrated significantly greater weight loss (kg) in eHealth weight loss interventions compared with control (MD −2.70 [−3.33,−2.08], P < 0.001) or minimal interventions (MD −1.40 [−1.98,−0.82], P < 0.001), and in eHealth weight loss interventions with extra components or technologies (MD 1.46 [0.80, 2.13], P < 0.001) compared with standard eHealth programmes. The findings support the use of eHealth interventions as a treatment option for obesity, but there is insufficient evidence for the effectiveness of eHealth interventions for weight loss maintenance or weight gain prevention.",

      "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundDigital public health (DiPH) provides novel approaches for prevention, potentially leading to long-term health benefits in resource-limited health systems. However, cost-effectiveness of DiPH interventions is unclear. This systematized review investigates the use of decision-analytic modelling in health economic evaluations of DiPH primary prevention and health promotion interventions, focusing on intervention’s design, methods used, results, and reporting quality.MethodsPubMed, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched for studies of decision-analytic economic evaluations of digital interventions in primary prevention or health promotion, published up to June 2022. Intervention characteristics and selected items were extracted based on the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS). Incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) were then extracted and price-adjusted to compare the economic evaluation results. Finally, the included studies’ reporting quality was assessed by building a score using CHEERS.ResultsThe database search (including search update) produced 2,273 hits. After removing duplicates, 1,434 titles and abstracts were screened. Of the 89 studies meeting the full-text search criteria, 14 were ultimately reviewed. The most common targets were physical activity (five studies) and weight loss (four). Digital applications include text messages, web-based inventions, app-based interventions, e-learning devices, and the promotion of smartphone apps. The mean ICER of the 12 studies using quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) is €20,955 per QALY (min. − €3,949; max. €114,211). The mean of reported CHEERS items per study is 81% (min. 59%; max. 91%).ConclusionsThis review only includes primary prevention and health promotion, and thus excludes other DiPH fields (e.g. secondary prevention). It also focuses on decision-analytic models, excluding study-based economic evaluations. Standard methods of economic evaluation could be adapted more to the specifics of DiPH by measuring the effectiveness of more current technologies through alternative methods, incorporating a societal perspective, and more clearly defining comparators. Nevertheless, the review demonstrates using common thresholds that the new field of DiPH shows potential for cost-effective preventive interventions.",

      "abstract": "Background            Mobile health (mHealth) apps show vast potential in supporting patients and health care systems with the increasing prevalence and economic costs of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) worldwide. However, despite the availability of evidence-based mHealth apps, a substantial proportion of users do not adhere to them as intended and may consequently not receive treatment. Therefore, understanding the factors that act as barriers to or facilitators of adherence is a fundamental concern in preventing intervention dropouts and increasing the effectiveness of digital health interventions.                                Objective            This review aimed to help stakeholders develop more effective digital health interventions by identifying factors influencing the continued use of mHealth apps targeting NCDs. We further derived quantified adherence scores for various health domains to validate the qualitative findings and explore adherence benchmarks.                                Methods            A comprehensive systematic literature search (January 2007 to December 2020) was conducted on MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and ACM Digital Library. Data on intended use, actual use, and factors influencing adherence were extracted. Intervention-related and patient-related factors with a positive or negative influence on adherence are presented separately for the health domains of NCD self-management, mental health, substance use, nutrition, physical activity, weight loss, multicomponent lifestyle interventions, mindfulness, and other NCDs. Quantified adherence measures, calculated as the ratio between the estimated intended use and actual use, were derived for each study and compared with the qualitative findings.                                Results            The literature search yielded 2862 potentially relevant articles, of which 99 (3.46%) were included as part of the inclusion criteria. A total of 4 intervention-related factors indicated positive effects on adherence across all health domains: personalization or tailoring of the content of mHealth apps to the individual needs of the user, reminders in the form of individualized push notifications, user-friendly and technically stable app design, and personal support complementary to the digital intervention. Social and gamification features were also identified as drivers of app adherence across several health domains. A wide variety of patient-related factors such as user characteristics or recruitment channels further affects adherence. The derived adherence scores of the included mHealth apps averaged 56.0% (SD 24.4%).                                Conclusions            This study contributes to the scarce scientific evidence on factors that positively or negatively influence adherence to mHealth apps and is the first to quantitatively compare adherence relative to the intended use of various health domains. As underlying studies mostly have a pilot character with short study durations, research on factors influencing adherence to mHealth apps is still limited. To facilitate future research on mHealth app adherence, researchers should clearly outline and justify the app’s intended use; report objective data on actual use relative to the intended use; and, ideally, provide long-term use and retention data.",

Multilevel interventions that incorporate policy, environmental, and individual components should be evaluated with measurements suited to their settings, goals, and purpose. In this commentary, the authors propose a model (termed the RE-AIM model) for evaluating public health interventions that assesses 5 dimensions: reach, efficacy, adoption, implementation, and maintenance. These dimensions occur at multiple levels (e.g., individual, clinic or organization, community) and interact to determine the public health or population-based impact of a program or policy. The authors discuss issues in evaluating each of these dimensions and combining them to determine overall public health impact. Failure to adequately evaluate programs on all 5 dimensions can lead to a waste of resources, discontinuities between stages of research, and failure to improve public health to the limits of our capacity. The authors summarize strengths and limitations of the RE-AIM model and recommend areas for future research and application.",

      "abstract": "Health care technologies have the ability to bridge or hinder equitable care. Advocates of digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) report that such technologies are poised to reduce the documented gross health care inequities that have plagued generations of people seeking care in the United States. This is due to a multitude of factors such as their potential to revolutionize access; mitigate logistical barriers to in-person mental health care; and leverage patient inputs to formulate tailored, responsive, and personalized experiences. Although we agree with the potential of DMHIs to advance health equity, we articulate several steps essential to mobilize and sustain meaningful forward progression in this endeavor, reflecting on decades of research and learnings drawn from multiple fields of expertise and real-world experience. First, DMHI manufacturers must build diversity, equity, inclusion, and belonging (DEIB) processes into the full spectrum of product evolution itself (eg, product design, evidence generation) as well as into the fabric of internal company practices (eg, talent recruitment, communication principles, and advisory boards). Second, awareness of the DEIB efforts—or lack thereof—in DMHI research trials is needed to refine and optimize future study design for inclusivity as well as proactively address potential barriers to doing so. Trials should incorporate thoughtful, inclusive, and creative approaches to recruitment, enrollment, and measurement of social determinants of health and self-identity, as well as a prioritization of planned and exploratory analyses examining outcomes across various groups of people. Third, mental health care advocacy, research funding policies, and local and federal legislation can advance these pursuits, with directives from the US Preventive Services Taskforce, National Institutes of Health, and Food and Drug Administration applied as poignant examples. For products with artificial intelligence/machine learning, maintaining a “human in the loop” as well as prespecified and adaptive analytic frameworks to monitor and remediate potential algorithmic bias can reduce the risk of increasing inequity. Last, but certainly not least, is a call for partnership and transparency within and across ecosystems (academic, industry, payer, provider, regulatory agencies, and value-based care organizations) to reliably build health equity into real-world DMHI product deployments and evidence-generation strategies. All these considerations should also extend into the context of an equity-informed commercial strategy for DMHI manufacturers and health care organizations alike. The potential to advance health equity in innovation with DMHI is apparent. We advocate the field’s thoughtful and evergreen advancement in inclusivity, thereby redefining the mental health care experience for this generation and those to come.",

      "abstract": "Background            The effectiveness of timely medication, physical activity (PA), a healthy diet, and blood pressure (BP) monitoring for promoting health outcomes and behavioral changes among patients with hypertension is supported by a substantial amount of literature, with “adherence” playing a pivotal role. Nevertheless, there is a lack of consistent evidence regarding whether digital interventions can improve adherence to healthy behaviors among individuals with hypertension.                                Objective            The aim was to develop a health behavioral digital intervention for hypertensive patients (HBDIHP) based on an intelligent health promotion system and WeChat following the behavior change wheel (BCW) theory and digital micro-intervention care (DMIC) model and assess its efficacy in controlling BP and improving healthy behavior adherence.                                Methods            A 2-arm, randomized trial design was used. We randomly assigned 68 individuals aged >60 years with hypertension in a 1:1 ratio to either the control or experimental group. The digital intervention was established through the following steps: (1) developing digital health education materials focused on adherence to exercise prescriptions, Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH), prescribed medication, and monitoring of BP; (2) using the BCW theory to select behavior change techniques; (3) constructing the intervention's logic following the guidelines of the DMIC model; (4) creating an intervention manual including the aforementioned elements. Prior to the experiment, participants underwent physical examinations at the community health service center's intelligent health cabin and received intelligent personalized health recommendations. The experimental group underwent a 12-week behavior intervention via WeChat, while the control group received routine health education and a self-management manual. The primary outcomes included BP and adherence indicators. Data analysis was performed using SPSS, with independent sample t tests, chi-square tests, paired t tests, and McNemar tests. A P value <.05 was considered statistically significant.                                Results            The final analysis included 54 participants with a mean age of 67.24 (SD 4.19) years (n=23 experimental group, n=31 control group). The experimental group had improvements in systolic BP (–7.36 mm Hg, P=.002), exercise time (856.35 metabolic equivalent [MET]-min/week, P<.001), medication adherence (0.56, P=.001), BP monitoring frequency (P=.02), and learning performance (3.23, P<.001). Both groups experienced weight reduction (experimental: 1.2 kg, P=.002; control: 1.11 kg, P=.009) after the intervention. The diet types and quantities for both groups (P<.001) as well as the subendocardial viability ratio (0.16, P=.01) showed significant improvement. However, there were no statistically significant changes in other health outcomes.                                Conclusions            The observations suggest our program may have enhanced specific health outcomes and adherence to health behaviors in older adults with hypertension. However, a longer-term, larger-scale trial is necessary to validate the effectiveness.

      "abstract": "Abstract                      Background            Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have immense potential to support disease self-management for people with complex medical conditions following treatment regimens that involve taking medicine and other self-management activities. However, there is no consensus on what discrete behavior change techniques (BCTs) should be used in an effective adherence and self-management–promoting mHealth solution for any chronic illness. Reviewing the extant literature to identify effective, cross-cutting BCTs in mHealth interventions for adherence and self-management promotion could help accelerate the development, evaluation, and dissemination of behavior change interventions with potential generalizability across complex medical conditions.                                Objective            This study aimed to identify cross-cutting, mHealth-based BCTs to incorporate into effective mHealth adherence and self-management interventions for people with complex medical conditions, by systematically reviewing the literature across chronic medical conditions with similar adherence and self-management demands.                                Methods            A registered systematic review was conducted to identify published evaluations of mHealth adherence and self-management interventions for chronic medical conditions with complex adherence and self-management demands. The methodological characteristics and BCTs in each study were extracted using a standard data collection form.                                Results            A total of 122 studies were reviewed; the majority involved people with type 2 diabetes (28/122, 23%), asthma (27/122, 22%), and type 1 diabetes (19/122, 16%). mHealth interventions rated as having a positive outcome on adherence and self-management used more BCTs (mean 4.95, SD 2.56) than interventions with no impact on outcomes (mean 3.57, SD 1.95) or those that used >1 outcome measure or analytic approach (mean 3.90, SD 1.93; P=.02). The following BCTs were associated with positive outcomes: self-monitoring outcomes of behavior (39/59, 66%), feedback on outcomes of behavior (34/59, 58%), self-monitoring of behavior (34/59, 58%), feedback on behavior (29/59, 49%), credible source (24/59, 41%), and goal setting (behavior; 14/59, 24%). In adult-only samples, prompts and cues were associated with positive outcomes (34/45, 76%). In adolescent and young adult samples, information about health consequences (1/4, 25%), problem-solving (1/4, 25%), and material reward (behavior; 2/4, 50%) were associated with positive outcomes. In interventions explicitly targeting medicine taking, prompts and cues (25/33, 76%) and credible source (13/33, 39%) were associated with positive outcomes. In interventions focused on self-management and other adherence targets, instruction on how to perform the behavior (8/26, 31%), goal setting (behavior; 8/26, 31%), and action planning (5/26, 19%) were associated with positive outcomes.                                Conclusions            To support adherence and self-management in people with complex medical conditions, mHealth tools should purposefully incorporate effective and developmentally appropriate BCTs. A cross-cutting approach to BCT selection could accelerate the development of much-needed mHealth interventions for target populations, although mHealth intervention developers should continue to consider the unique needs of the target population when designing these tools.",

We analyzed 17 reviews, which assessed 55,604 original intervention studies, that met the inclusion criteria.

All reviews examined changes in biomarkers, and some reviews assessed treatment adherence (n=7) and health behaviors (n=9). Although the effectiveness of mHealth interventions varied widely by study, all reviews concluded that mHealth was a feasible option and had the potential for improving patient health when compared with standard care, especially for glycemic control (−0.3% to −0.5% greater reduction in hemoglobin A1c) and weight reduction (−1.0 kg to −2.4 kg body weight). Overall, the existing 6 meta-analysis studies showed pooled favorable effects of these mHealth interventions (−0.79, 95% CI −1.17 to −0.42; I2=90.5).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              mHealth interventions are promising, but there is limited evidence about their effectiveness in glycemic control and weight reduction. Future research to develop evidence-based mHealth strategies should use valid measures and rigorous study designs.

Rather than being independent of one another, health behaviors often co-occur, suggesting that targeting more than one health behavior in an intervention has the potential to be more effective in promoting better health outcomes.\n            \n            \n              Purpose\n              We aimed to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized trials of interventions that target more than one behavior to examine the effectiveness of multiple health behavior change interventions in patients with chronic conditions.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Five electronic databases (Web of Science, PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE, and Cochrane) were systematically searched in November 2023, and studies included in previous reviews were also consulted. We included randomized trials of interventions aiming to change more than one health behavior in individuals with chronic conditions. Two independent reviewers screened and extracted data, and used Cochrane’s Risk of Bias 2 tool. Meta-analyses were conducted to estimate the effects of interventions on change in health behaviors. Results were presented as Cohen’s d for continuous data, and risk ratio for dichotomous data.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Sixty-one studies were included spanning a range of chronic diseases: cardiovascular (k = 25), type 2 diabetes (k = 15), hypertension (k = 10), cancer (k = 7), one or more chronic conditions (k = 3), and multiple conditions (k = 1). Most interventions aimed to change more than one behavior simultaneously (rather than in sequence) and most targeted three particular behaviors at once: “physical activity, diet and smoking” (k = 20). Meta-analysis of 43 eligible studies showed for continuous data (k = 29) a small to substantial positive effect on behavior change for all health behaviors (d = 0.081–2.003) except for smoking (d = −0.019). For dichotomous data (k = 23) all analyses showed positive effects of targeting more than one behavior on all behaviors (RR = 1.026–2.247).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Targeting more than one behavior at a time is effective in chronic disease management and more research should be directed into developing the science of multiple behavior change.",

      "abstract": "Background            Digital health interventions (DHIs) are defined as digital technologies such as digital health applications and information and communications technology systems (including SMS text messages) implemented to meet health objectives. DHIs implemented using various technologies, ranging from electronic medical records to videoconferencing systems and mobile apps, have experienced substantial growth and uptake in recent years. Although the clinical effectiveness of DHIs for children and adolescents has been relatively well studied, much less is known about the cost-effectiveness of these interventions.                                Objective            This study aimed to systematically review economic evaluations of DHIs for pediatric and adolescent populations. This study also reviewed methodological issues specific to economic evaluations of DHIs to inform future research priorities.                                Methods            We conducted a database search in PubMed from 2011 to 2021 using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist. In total, 2 authors independently screened the titles and abstracts of the search results to identify studies eligible for full-text review. We generated a data abstraction procedure based on recommendations from the Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine. The types of economic evaluations included in this review were cost-effectiveness analyses (costs per clinical effect), cost-benefit analyses (costs and effects expressed in monetary terms as net benefit), and cost-utility analyses (cost per quality-adjusted life year or disability-adjusted life year). Narrative analysis was used to synthesize the quantitative data because of heterogeneity across the studies. We extracted methodological issues related to study design, analysis framework, cost and outcome measurement, and methodological assumptions regarding the health economic evaluation.                                Results            We included 22 articles assessing the cost-effectiveness of DHI interventions for children and adolescents. Most articles (14/22, 64%) evaluated interventions delivered through web-based portals or SMS text messaging, most frequently within the health care specialties of mental health and maternal, newborn, and child health. In 82% (18/22) of the studies, DHIs were found to be cost-effective or cost saving compared with the nondigital standard of care. The key drivers of cost-effectiveness included population coverage, cost components, intervention effect size and scale-up, and study perspective. The most frequently identified methodological challenges were related to study design (17/22, 77%), costing (11/22, 50%), and economic modeling (9/22, 41%).                                Conclusions            This is the first systematic review of economic evaluations of DHIs targeting pediatric and adolescent populations. We found that most DHIs (18/22, 82%) for children and adolescents were cost-effective or cost saving compared with the nondigital standard of care. In addition, this review identified key methodological challenges directly related to the conduct of economic evaluations of DHIs and highlighted areas where further methodological research is required to address these challenges. These included the need for measurement of user involvement and indirect effects of DHIs and the development of children-specific, generic quality-of-life outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Racial bias in health algorithms\n            \n              The U.S. health care system uses commercial algorithms to guide health decisions. Obermeyer\n              et al.\n              find evidence of racial bias in one widely used algorithm, such that Black patients assigned the same level of risk by the algorithm are sicker than White patients (see the Perspective by Benjamin). The authors estimated that this racial bias reduces the number of Black patients identified for extra care by more than half. Bias occurs because the algorithm uses health costs as a proxy for health needs. Less money is spent on Black patients who have the same level of need, and the algorithm thus falsely concludes that Black patients are healthier than equally sick White patients. Reformulating the algorithm so that it no longer uses costs as a proxy for needs eliminates the racial bias in predicting who needs extra care.\n            \n            \n              Science\n              , this issue p.\n              447\n              ; see also p.\n              421\n            \n          , \n            A health algorithm that uses health costs as a proxy for health needs leads to racial bias against Black patients.\n          , \n            Health systems rely on commercial prediction algorithms to identify and help patients with complex health needs. We show that a widely used algorithm, typical of this industry-wide approach and affecting millions of patients, exhibits significant racial bias: At a given risk score, Black patients are considerably sicker than White patients, as evidenced by signs of uncontrolled illnesses. Remedying this disparity would increase the percentage of Black patients receiving additional help from 17.7 to 46.5%. The bias arises because the algorithm predicts health care costs rather than illness, but unequal access to care means that we spend less money caring for Black patients than for White patients. Thus, despite health care cost appearing to be an effective proxy for health by some measures of predictive accuracy, large racial biases arise. We suggest that the choice of convenient, seemingly effective proxies for ground truth can be an important source of algorithmic bias in many contexts.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundDigital health interventions (DHIs) have increased exponentially all over the world. Furthermore, the interest in the sustainability of digital health interventions is growing significantly. However, a systematic synthesis of digital health intervention sustainability challenges is lacking. This systematic review aimed to identify the barriers and facilitators for the sustainability of digital health intervention in low and middle-income countries.MethodsThree electronic databases (PubMed, Embase and Web of Science) were searched. Two independent reviewers selected eligible publications based on inclusion and exclusion criteria. Data were extracted and quality assessed by four team members. Qualitative, quantitative or mixed studies conducted in low and middle-income countries and published from January 2000 to May 2022 were included.ResultsThe sustainability of digital health interventions is very complex and multidimensional. Successful sustainability of digital health interventions depends on interdependent complex factors that influence the implementation and scale-up level in the short, middle and long term. Barriers identified among others are associated with infrastructure, equipment, internet, electricity and the DHIs. As for the facilitators, they are more focused on the strong commitment and involvement of relevant stakeholders: Government, institutional, sectoral, stakeholders' support, collaborative networks with implementing partners, improved satisfaction, convenience, privacy, confidentiality and trust in clients, experience and confidence in using the system, motivation and competence of staff. All stakeholders play an essential role in the process of sustainability. Digital technology can have long term impacts on health workers, patients, and the health system, by improving data management for decision-making, the standard of healthcare service delivery and boosting attendance at health facilities and using services. Therefore, management changes with effective monitoring and evaluation before, during, and after DHIs are essential.ConclusionThe sustainability of digital health interventions is crucial to maintain good quality healthcare, especially in low and middle-income countries. Considering potential barriers and facilitators for the sustainability of digital health interventions should inform all stakeholders, from their planning until their scaling up. Besides, it would be appropriate at the health facilities level to consolidate facilitators and efficiently manage barriers with the participation of all stakeholders.",

Our goal was to determine if a mHealth intervention augmented and extended benefits of center-based cardiac rehabilitation (CR) for physical activity levels at 6-months. We delivered a randomized clinical trial to low and moderate risk patients with a compatible smartphone enrolled in CR at two health systems. All participants received a compatible smartwatch and usual CR care. Intervention participants received a mHealth intervention that included a just-in-time-adaptive intervention (JITAI) as text messages. The primary outcome was change in remote 6-minute walk distance at 6-months stratified by device type. Here we report the results for 220 participants enrolled in the study (mean [SD]: age 59.6 [10.6] years; 67 [30.5%] women). For our primary outcome at 6 months, there is no significant difference in the change in 6 min walk distance across smartwatch types (Intervention versus control: +31.1 meters Apple Watch, −7.4 meters Fitbit; p = 0.28). Secondary outcomes show no difference in mean step counts between the first and final weeks of the study, but a change in 6 min walk distance at 3 months for Fitbit users. Amongst patients enrolled in center-based CR, a mHealth intervention did not improve 6-month outcomes but suggested differences at 3 months in some users.",

      "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundThere is high prevalence of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Saudi Arabia that is still increasing. Early diagnosis of prediabetes, and immediate, effective intervention is yet unestablished. Conventional health promotion approaches are used to educate prediabetic patients. Behavior modification is very effective in prediabetics to delay T2DM. Thus, the main objective of this study is to examine the effect of the new behavioral model, the Transtheoretical Model short messages (text 4 change) to modify lifestyle to prevent or delay the onset of T2DM, through promotion of a healthy diet and increased physical activity, in impaired glucose tolerance patients. Another objective is to estimate the impact of this model on markers of cardiovascular and metabolic risks as T2DM is one of the modifiable risk factors to prevent cardiovascular diseases.MethodsThis is a randomized controlled trial. One thousand and sixteen, eligible Saudi adults will be recruited from the Heart Health Promotion study (HHP), which was conducted at the King Saud University from July 2013 to April 2014. These adults were at a higher risk of developing T2DM within 2–3 years. The research team’s database has a contact list and they will recruit individuals over 6–8 weeks. All participants will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio into two groups, receive group education about lifestyle modifications and written information about diet and physical activity. Text 4 change SMS texts will be sent only to the intervention group. All participants will be assessed at baseline, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months for behavioral change using a World Health Organization (WHO) STEPS questionnaire and for glycated hemoglobin, biochemical and anthropometric measurements using standard methods.DiscussionThis new approach for promoting the importance of behavior modification in prediabetics is expected to delay and/or prevent the development of T2DM in Saudi Arabia, subsequently reducing the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality too. Results from this study will promote an innovative and high-tech way to decrease the burden of cardiovascular diseases in Saudi Arabia.Trial registrationInternational Standard Randomized Control Trial, registration numberISRCTN10857643.

      "abstract": "AbstractHealth economic evaluations are comparative analyses of alternative courses of action in terms of their costs and consequences. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS) statement, published in 2013, was created to ensure health economic evaluations are identifiable, interpretable, and useful for decision making. It was intended as guidance to help authors report accurately which health interventions were being compared and in what context, how the evaluation was undertaken, what the findings were, and other details that may aid readers and reviewers in interpretation and use of the study. The new CHEERS 2022 statement replaces previous CHEERS reporting guidance. It reflects the need for guidance that can be more easily applied to all types of health economic evaluation, new methods and developments in the field, as well as the increased role of stakeholder involvement including patients and the public. It is also broadly applicable to any form of intervention intended to improve the health of individuals or the population, whether simple or complex, and without regard to context (such as health care, public health, education, social care, etc). This summary article presents the new CHEERS 2022 28-item checklist and recommendations for each item. The CHEERS 2022 statement is primarily intended for researchers reporting economic evaluations for peer reviewed journals as well as the peer reviewers and editors assessing them for publication. However, we anticipate familiarity with reporting requirements will be useful for analysts when planning studies. It may also be useful for health technology assessment bodies seeking guidance on reporting, as there is an increasing emphasis on transparency in decision making.",

Machine learning can leverage self-reported data collected with apps to predict periods of increased health risk, alert users, and signpost interventions. Despite this, mHealth must balance the treatment burden of frequent self-reporting and predictive performance and safety. Here we report how user engagement with a widely used and clinically validated mHealth app, myCOPD (designed for the self-management of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease), directly impacts the performance of a machine learning model predicting an acute worsening of condition (i.e., exacerbations). We classify how users typically engage with myCOPD, finding that 60.3% of users engage frequently, however, less frequent users can show transitional engagement (18.4%), becoming more engaged immediately ( < 21 days) before exacerbating. Machine learning performed better for users who engaged the most, however, this performance decrease can be mostly offset for less frequent users who engage more near exacerbation. We conduct interviews and focus groups with myCOPD users, highlighting digital diaries and disease acuity as key factors for engagement. Users of mHealth can feel overburdened when self-reporting data necessary for predictive modelling and confidence of recognising exacerbations is a significant barrier to accurate self-reported data. We demonstrate that users of mHealth should be encouraged to engage when they notice changes to their condition (rather than clinically defined symptoms) to achieve data that is still predictive for machine learning, while reducing the likelihood of disengagement through desensitisation.",

We identified 69 studies on diabetes (\n              n\n               = 29), cardiovascular diseases (\n              n\n               = 13), chronic respiratory diseases (\n              n\n               = 13), cancer (\n              n\n               = 10) or their combinations (\n              n\n               = 4). The apps rarely adopted developmental factors in the design stage, with only around one-third of studies reporting user or healthcare professional engagement. Apps differed significantly in content, with a median of eight behaviour change techniques adopted, most frequently pertaining to the ‘Feedback and monitoring’ (91%) and ‘Shaping knowledge’ (72%) categories. As for the study methodologies, all studies adopted a traditional randomised control trial (RCT) design, with relatively short follow-ups and limited sample sizes. Findings were not significant for the majority of studies across all CD, with most RCTs revealing a high risk of bias. To support the adoption of apps for CD management, this review reinforces the need for more robust development and appropriate study characteristics to sustain evidence generation and elucidate whether study results reflect the true benefits of apps or a biased estimate due to unsuitable designs.",

      "abstract": "AbstractThe aim of this meta-meta-analysis was to systematically review randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence examining the effectiveness of e- and m-Health interventions designed to improve physical activity, sedentary behaviour, healthy eating and sleep. Nine electronic databases were searched for eligible studies published from inception to 1 June 2023. Systematic reviews with meta-analyses of RCTs that evaluate e- and m-Health interventions designed to improve physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep and healthy eating in any adult population were included. Forty-seven meta-analyses were included, comprising of 507 RCTs and 206,873 participants. Interventions involved mobile apps, web-based and SMS interventions, with 14 focused on physical activity, 3 for diet, 4 for sleep and 26 evaluating multiple behaviours. Meta-meta-analyses showed that e- and m-Health interventions resulted in improvements in steps/day (mean difference, MD = 1329 [95% CI = 593.9, 2065.7] steps/day), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MD = 55.1 [95% CI = 13.8, 96.4] min/week), total physical activity (MD = 44.8 [95% CI = 21.6, 67.9] min/week), sedentary behaviour (MD = −426.3 [95% CI = −850.2, −2.3] min/week), fruit and vegetable consumption (MD = 0.57 [95% CI = 0.11, 1.02] servings/day), energy intake (MD = −102.9 kcals/day), saturated fat consumption (MD = −5.5 grams/day), and bodyweight (MD = −1.89 [95% CI = −2.42, −1.36] kg). Analyses based on standardised mean differences (SMD) showed improvements in sleep quality (SMD = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.40, 0.72) and insomnia severity (SMD = −0.90, 95% CI = −1.14, −0.65). Most subgroup analyses were not significant, suggesting that a variety of e- and m-Health interventions are effective across diverse age and health populations. These interventions offer scalable and accessible approaches to help individuals adopt and sustain healthier behaviours, with implications for broader public health and healthcare challenges.",

      "abstract": "AbstractE-mental health (EMH) interventions gain increasing importance in the treatment of mental health disorders. Their outpatient efficacy is well-established. However, research on EMH in inpatient settings remains sparse and lacks a meta-analytic synthesis. This paper presents a meta-analysis on the efficacy of EMH in inpatient settings. Searching multiple databases (PubMed, ScienceGov, PsycInfo, CENTRAL, references), 26 randomized controlled trial (RCT) EMH inpatient studies (n = 6112) with low or medium assessed risk of bias were included. A small significant total effect of EMH treatment was found (g = 0.3). The effect was significant both for blended interventions (g = 0.42) and post-treatment EMH-based aftercare (g = 0.29). EMH treatment yielded significant effects across different patient groups and types of therapy, and the effects remained stable post-treatment. The results show the efficacy of EMH treatment in inpatient settings. The meta-analysis is limited by the small number of included studies.",

      "abstract": "AbstractAims  To assess Sweet Talk, a text‐messaging support system designed to enhance self‐efficacy, facilitate uptake of intensive insulin therapy and improve glycaemic control in paediatric patients with Type 1 diabetes.Methods  One hundred and twenty‐six patients fulfilled the eligibility criteria; Type 1 diabetes for > 1 year, on conventional insulin therapy, aged 8–18 years. Ninety‐two patients were randomized to conventional insulin therapy (n = 28), conventional therapy and Sweet Talk (n = 33) or intensive insulin therapy and Sweet Talk (n = 31). Goal‐setting at clinic visits was reinforced by daily text‐messages from the Sweet Talk software system, containing personalized goal‐specific prompts and messages tailored to patients’ age, sex and insulin regimen.Results  HbA1c did not change in patients on conventional therapy without or with Sweet Talk (10.3 ± 1.7 vs. 10.1 ± 1.7%), but improved in patients randomized to intensive therapy and Sweet Talk (9.2 ± 2.2%, 95% CI −1.9, −0.5, P < 0.001). Sweet Talk was associated with improvement in diabetes self‐efficacy (conventional therapy 56.0 ± 13.7, conventional therapy plus Sweet Talk 62.1 ± 6.6, 95% CI +2.6, +7.5, P = 0.003) and self‐reported adherence (conventional therapy 70.4 ± 20.0, conventional therapy plus Sweet Talk 77.2 ± 16.1, 95% CI +0.4, +17.4, P = 0.042). When surveyed, 82% of patients felt that Sweet Talk had improved their diabetes self‐management and 90% wanted to continue receiving messages.Conclusions  Sweet Talk was associated with improved self‐efficacy and adherence; engaging a classically difficult to reach group of young people. While Sweet Talk alone did not improve glycaemic control, it may have had a role in supporting the introduction of intensive insulin therapy. Scheduled, tailored text messaging offers an innovative means of supporting adolescents with diabetes and could be adapted for other health‐care settings and chronic diseases.",

Mobile telephone text messaging may be a scalable means to support medication adherence.\n\n\nOBJECTIVES\nTo conduct a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials to assess the effect of mobile telephone text messaging on medication adherence in chronic disease.\n\n\nDATA SOURCES\nMEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO, and CINAHL (from database inception to January 15, 2015), as well as reference lists of the articles identified. The data were analyzed in March 2015.\n\n\nSTUDY SELECTION\nRandomized clinical trials evaluating a mobile telephone text message intervention to promote medication adherence in adults with chronic disease.\n\n\nDATA EXTRACTION\nTwo authors independently extracted information on study characteristics, text message characteristics, and outcome measures as per the predefined protocol.\n\n\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES\nOdds ratios and pooled data were calculated using random-effects models. Risk of bias and study quality were assessed as per Cochrane guidelines. Disagreement was resolved by consensus.\n\n\nRESULTS\nSixteen randomized clinical trials were included, with 5 of 16 using personalization, 8 of 16 using 2-way communication, and 8 of 16 using a daily text message frequency. The median intervention duration was 12 weeks, and self-report was the most commonly used method to assess medication adherence. In the pooled analysis of 2742 patients (median age, 39 years and 50.3% [1380 of 2742] female), text messaging significantly improved medication adherence (odds ratio, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.52-2.93; P < .001). The effect was not sensitive to study characteristics (intervention duration or type of disease) or text message characteristics (personalization, 2-way communication, or daily text message frequency). In a sensitivity analysis, our findings remained robust to change in inclusion criteria based on study quality (odds ratio, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.21-2.29; P = .002). There was moderate heterogeneity (I2 = 62%) across clinical trials. After adjustment for publication bias, the point estimate was reduced but remained positive for an intervention effect (odds ratio, 1.68; 95% CI, 1.18-2.39).\n\n\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE\nMobile phone text messaging approximately doubles the odds of medication adherence. This increase translates into adherence rates improving from 50% (assuming this baseline rate in patients with chronic disease) to 67.8%, or an absolute increase of 17.8%. While promising, these results should be interpreted with caution given the short duration of trials and reliance on self-reported medication adherence measures. Future studies need to determine the features of text message interventions that improve success, as well as appropriate patient populations, sustained effects, and influences on clinical outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Although impressive progress has been made toward developing empirically‐supported psychological treatments, the reality remains that a significant proportion of people with mental health problems do not receive these treatments. Finding ways to reduce this treatment gap is crucial. Since app‐supported smartphone interventions are touted as a possible solution, access to up‐to‐date guidance around the evidence base and clinical utility of these interventions is needed. We conducted a meta‐analysis of 66 randomized controlled trials of app‐supported smartphone interventions for mental health problems. Smartphone interventions significantly outperformed control conditions in improving depressive (g=0.28, n=54) and generalized anxiety (g=0.30, n=39) symptoms, stress levels (g=0.35, n=27), quality of life (g=0.35, n=43), general psychiatric distress (g=0.40, n=12), social anxiety symptoms (g=0.58, n=6), and positive affect (g=0.44, n=6), with most effects being robust even after adjusting for various possible biasing factors (type of control condition, risk of bias rating). Smartphone interventions conferred no significant benefit over control conditions on panic symptoms (g=–0.05, n=3), post‐traumatic stress symptoms (g=0.18, n=4), and negative affect (g=–0.08, n=5). Studies that delivered a cognitive behavior therapy (CBT)‐based app and offered professional guidance and reminders to engage produced larger effects on multiple outcomes. Smartphone interventions did not differ significantly from active interventions (face‐to‐face, computerized treatment), although the number of studies was low (n≤13). The efficacy of app‐supported smartphone interventions for common mental health problems was thus confirmed. Although mental health apps are not intended to replace professional clinical services, the present findings highlight the potential of apps to serve as a cost‐effective, easily accessible, and low intensity intervention for those who cannot receive standard psychological treatment.",

While advances in digital health technologies have increased individuals' access to care for hypertension, few studies have analyzed the use of digital health interventions in vulnerable populations.\nOBJECTIVE: To assess the association between digital health interventions and changes in BP and to characterize tailored strategies for populations experiencing health disparities.\nDATA SOURCES: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, a systematic search identified studies evaluating digital health interventions for BP management in the Cochrane Library, Ovid Embase, Google Scholar, Ovid MEDLINE, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases from inception until October 30, 2023.\nSTUDY SELECTION: Included studies were randomized clinical trials or cohort studies that investigated digital health interventions for managing hypertension in adults; presented change in systolic BP (SBP) or baseline and follow-up SBP levels; and emphasized social determinants of health and/or health disparities, including a focus on marginalized populations that have historically been underserved or digital health interventions that were culturally or linguistically tailored to a population with health disparities. The study followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guideline.\nDATA EXTRACTION AND SYNTHESIS: Two reviewers extracted and verified data. Mean differences in BP between treatment and control groups were analyzed using a random-effects model.\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Primary outcomes included mean differences (95% CIs) in SBP and diastolic BP (DBP) from baseline to 6 and 12 months of follow-up between digital health intervention and control groups. Shorter- and longer-term follow-up durations were also assessed, and sensitivity analyses accounted for baseline BP levels.\nRESULTS: A total of 28 studies (representing 8257 participants) were included (overall mean participant age, 57.4 years [range, 46-71 years]; 4962 [60.1%], female). Most studies examined multicomponent digital health interventions incorporating remote BP monitoring (18 [64.3%]), community health workers or skilled nurses (13 [46.4%]), and/or cultural tailoring (21 [75.0%]). Sociodemographic characteristics were similar between intervention and control groups. Between the intervention and control groups, there were statistically significant mean differences in SBP at 6 months (-4.24 mm Hg; 95% CI, -7.33 to -1.14 mm Hg; P = .01) and SBP changes at 12 months (-4.30 mm Hg; 95% CI, -8.38 to -0.23 mm Hg; P = .04). Few studies (4 [14.3%]) reported BP changes and hypertension control beyond 1 year.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this systematic review and meta-analysis of digital health interventions for hypertension management in populations experiencing health disparities, BP reductions were greater in the intervention groups compared with the standard care groups. The findings suggest that tailored initiatives that leverage digital health may have the potential to advance equity in hypertension outcomes.",

An evolution of Rogers's person-centered counseling approach, MI elicits the client's own motivations for change. The rapidly growing evidence base for MI is summarized in a new meta-analysis of 72 clinical trials spanning a range of target problems. The average short-term between-group effect size of MI was 0.77, decreasing to 0.30 at follow-ups to one year. Observed effect sizes of MI were larger with ethnic minority populations, and when the practice of MI was not manual-guided. The highly variable effectiveness of MI across providers, populations, target problems, and settings suggests a need to understand and specify how MI exerts its effects. Progress toward a theory of MI is described, as is research on how clinicians develop proficiency in this method.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Connection with nature has well-established physical and psychological benefits. However, women with metastatic breast cancer (MBC) are often unable to access nature because of physical limitations, psychological barriers, and treatment demands. Virtual reality (VR) nature experiences offer an alternative means of connecting with nature and may be of particular benefit to patients with cancer who are house- or hospital-bound.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aims to explore whether VR nature experiences are associated with physical and psychological benefits for women with MBC who are disconnected with nature.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              This secondary analysis of a previous randomized controlled crossover trial recruited participants from the emailing lists of breast cancer support organizations. Participants were provided VR headsets for daily use in their homes for over 3 weeks. In the first week, participants used 1 of 2 VR nature experiences (Ripple or Happy Place) daily, followed by a 1-week washout period, before using the other VR experience every day for the final week. Outcomes assessed changes between baseline and postintervention scores in quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), pain (Brief Pain Inventory Short Form), fatigue (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy-fatigue), depression (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-depression), anxiety (Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scale-anxiety), and spiritual well-being (Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy- Spiritual Well-being) and investigated whether benefits were greater in participants who were not strongly connected with nature at baseline.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 38 women with MBC completed the VR interventions and were included in the analyses. Participants reported significantly less fatigue (P=.001), less depression (P<.001), and greater quality of life (P=.02) following the interventions than at baseline. Women with a weaker connection to nature reported greater fatigue (P=.03), depression (P=.006), and anxiety (P=.001), and poorer spirituality (P=.004) than their strongly connected counterparts. Only those with a weaker baseline connection with nature showed improvements in depression following the intervention (P=.03), with similar trends observed in fatigue (P=.07) and quality of life (P=.10).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This study provides preliminary evidence that feeling connected with nature is associated with better physical and psychological status in patients with MBC and that VR nature interventions might be beneficial for this clinical population. Future studies should focus on activities that encourage connection with nature (rather than simply exposure to nature) and investigate the aspects of VR nature interventions that have the greatest therapeutic potential.\n            \n            \n              Trial Registration\n              Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12619001480178; https://tinyurl.com/et6z3vac",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) has become a popular mobile health study design to understand the lived experiences of dynamic environments. The numerous study design choices available to EMA researchers, however, may quickly increase participant burden and could affect overall adherence, which could limit the usability of the collected data.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study quantifies what study design, participant attributes, and momentary factors may affect self-reported burden and adherence.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              The EMA from the Phase 1 Family Matters Study (n=150 adult Black, Hmong, Latino or Latina, Native American, Somali, and White caregivers; n=1392 observation days) was examined to understand how participant self-reported survey burden was related to both design and momentary antecedents of adherence. The daily burden was measured by the question “Overall, how difficult was it for you to fill out the surveys today?” on a 5-item Likert scale (0=not at all and 4=extremely). Daily protocol adherence was defined as completing at least 2 signal-contingent surveys, 1 event-contingent survey, and 1 end-of-day survey each. Stress and mood were measured earlier in the day, sociodemographic and psychosocial characteristics were reported using a comprehensive cross-sectional survey, and EMA timestamps for weekends and weekdays were used to parameterize time-series models to evaluate prospective correlates of end-of-day study burden.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The burden was low at 1.2 (SD 1.14) indicating “a little” burden on average. Participants with elevated previous 30-day chronic stress levels (mean burden difference: 0.8; P=.04), 1 in 5 more immigrant households (P=.02), and the language primarily spoken in the home (P=.04; 3 in 20 more non-English–speaking households) were found to be population attributes of elevated moderate-high burden. Current and 1-day lagged nonadherence were correlated with elevated 0.39 and 0.36 burdens, respectively (P=.001), and the association decayed by the second day (β=0.08; P=.47). Unit increases in momentary antecedents, including daily depressed mood (P=.002) and across-day change in stress (P=.008), were positively associated with 0.15 and 0.07 higher end-of-day burdens after controlling for current-day adherence.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The 8-day EMA implementation appeared to capture momentary sources of stress and depressed mood without substantial burden to a racially or ethnically diverse and immigrant or refugee sample of parents. Attention to sociodemographic attributes (eg, EMA in the primary language of the caregiver) was important for minimizing participant burden and improving data quality. Momentary stress and depressed mood were strong determinants of participant-experienced EMA burden and may affect adherence to mobile health study protocols. There were no strong indicators of EMA design attributes that created a persistent burden for caregivers. EMA stands to be an important observational design to address dynamic public health challenges related to human-environment interactions when the design is carefully tailored to the study population and to study research objectives.",

This study presents a novel approach to disease risk assessment using generative LLMs through conversational artificial intelligence (AI), eliminating the need for programming.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study evaluates the use of pretrained generative LLMs, including LLaMA2-7b and Flan-T5-xl, for COVID-19 severity prediction with the goal of enabling a real-time, no-code, risk assessment solution through chatbot-based, question-answering interactions. To contextualize their performance, we compare LLMs with traditional machine learning classifiers, such as logistic regression, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost), and random forest, which rely on tabular data.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We fine-tuned LLMs using few-shot natural language examples from a dataset of 393 pediatric patients, developing a mobile app that integrates these models to provide real-time, no-code, COVID-19 severity risk assessment through clinician-patient interaction. The LLMs were compared with traditional classifiers across different experimental settings, using the area under the curve (AUC) as the primary evaluation metric. Feature importance derived from LLM attention layers was also analyzed to enhance interpretability.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Generative LLMs demonstrated strong performance in low-data settings. In zero-shot scenarios, the T0-3b-T model achieved an AUC of 0.75, while other LLMs, such as T0pp(8bit)-T and Flan-T5-xl-T, reached 0.67 and 0.69, respectively. At 2-shot settings, logistic regression and random forest achieved an AUC of 0.57, while Flan-T5-xl-T and T0-3b-T obtained 0.69 and 0.65, respectively. By 32-shot settings, Flan-T5-xl-T reached 0.70, similar to logistic regression (0.69) and random forest (0.68), while XGBoost improved to 0.65. These results illustrate the differences in how generative LLMs and traditional models handle the increasing data availability. LLMs perform well in low-data scenarios, whereas traditional models rely more on structured tabular data and labeled training examples. Furthermore, the mobile app provides real-time, COVID-19 severity assessments and personalized insights through attention-based feature importance, adding value to the clinical interpretation of the results.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Generative LLMs provide a robust alternative to traditional classifiers, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. Their ability to handle unstructured inputs and deliver personalized, real-time assessments without coding makes them highly adaptable to clinical settings. This study underscores the potential of LLM-powered conversational artificial intelligence (AI) in health care and encourages further exploration of its use for real-time, disease risk assessment and decision-making support.",

Anecdotally, doctors at our study site were dissatisfied with the medication-related alerts being generated, both in terms of volume being experienced and clinical relevance.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aimed to involve end users in the redesign of medication-related alerts in a hospital EMR, 4 years post implementation.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              This work was undertaken at a private not-for-profit teaching hospital in Sydney, Australia. Since EMR implementation in 2015, the organization elected to implement all medication-related alert types available in the system for prescribers: allergy and intolerance alerts, therapeutic duplication alerts, pregnancy alerts, and drug-drug interaction alerts. The EMR included no medication administration alerts for nurses. To obtain feedback on current alerts and suggestions for redesign, a Web-based survey was distributed to all doctors and nurses at the site via hospital mailing lists.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Despite a general dissatisfaction with alerts, very few end users completed the survey. In total, only 3.37% (36/1066) of doctors and 14.5% (60/411) of nurses took part. Approximately 90% (30/33) of doctors who responded held the view that too many alerts were triggered in the EMR. Doctors suggested that most alerts be removed and that alerts be more specific and less sensitive. In contrast, 97% (58/60) of the nurse respondents indicated that they would like to receive medication administration alerts in the EMR. Most nurses indicated that they would like to receive all the alert types available at all severity levels.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Attempting to engage with end users several years post implementation was challenging. Involving users so late in the implementation process may lead to clinicians viewing the provision of feedback to be futile. Seeking user feedback on usefulness, volume, and design of alerts is extremely valuable; however, we suggest this is undertaken early, preferably before system implementation.",

The purpose of this systematic review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the efficacy of chatbot interventions designed to improve physical activity, diet and sleep. Electronic databases were searched for randomised and non-randomised controlled trials, and pre-post trials that evaluated chatbot interventions targeting physical activity, diet and/or sleep, published before 1 September 2022. Outcomes were total physical activity, steps, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA), fruit and vegetable consumption, sleep quality and sleep duration. Standardised mean differences (SMD) were calculated to compare intervention effects. Subgroup analyses were conducted to assess chatbot type, intervention type, duration, output and use of artificial intelligence. Risk of bias was assessed using the Effective Public Health Practice Project Quality Assessment tool. Nineteen trials were included. Sample sizes ranged between 25–958, and mean participant age ranged between 9–71 years. Most interventions (\n              n\n               = 15, 79%) targeted physical activity, and most trials had a low-quality rating (\n              n\n               = 14, 74%). Meta-analysis results showed significant effects (all\n              p\n               < 0.05) of chatbots for increasing total physical activity (SMD = 0.28 [95% CI = 0.16, 0.40]), daily steps (SMD = 0.28 [95% CI = 0.17, 0.39]), MVPA (SMD = 0.53 [95% CI = 0.24, 0.83]), fruit and vegetable consumption (SMD = 0.59 [95% CI = 0.25, 0.93]), sleep duration (SMD = 0.44 [95% CI = 0.32, 0.55]) and sleep quality (SMD = 0.50 [95% CI = 0.09, 0.90]). Subgroup analyses showed that text-based, and artificial intelligence chatbots were more efficacious than speech/voice chatbots for fruit and vegetable consumption, and multicomponent interventions were more efficacious than chatbot-only interventions for sleep duration and sleep quality (all\n              p\n               < 0.05). Findings from this systematic review and meta-analysis indicate that chatbot interventions are efficacious for increasing physical activity, fruit and vegetable consumption, sleep duration and sleep quality. Chatbot interventions were efficacious across a range of populations and age groups, with both short- and longer-term interventions, and chatbot only and multicomponent interventions being efficacious.",

In collaboration with a large retail supermarket chain, we conducted a multisite supermarket and web-based intervention targeting nutrition trial (no. NCT03895580), randomizing participants (\n              n\n               = 247 (139 women and 108 men)) 2:2:1 to two levels of dietary education (Strategy 1 and Strategy 2) or an enhanced control group that included educational components beyond the routine standard of care. Both Strategies 1 and 2 included individualized, in-person, dietitian-led, purchasing data-guided interventions. Strategy 2 also included online tools for shopping, home delivery, selection of healthier purchases, meal planning and healthy recipes. The primary endpoint was change in dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score (a measure of adherence to the DASH diet) from baseline to 3 months. The primary endpoint was met because, at 3 months, the DASH score increased by 4.7 more for the combined Strategy 1 and Strategy 2 groups than for the control group (95% confidence interval (CI) (0.9, 8.5),\n              P\n               = 0.02). In a prespecified hierarchical test, at 3 months, DASH score increased by 3.8 more for the Strategy 2 group than for the Strategy 1 group (95% CI (0.8, 6.9),\n              P\n               = 0.01). This trial demonstrates the efficacy of data-guided, supermarket-based, dietary interventions and modern online shopping tools in improving dietary quality in a free-living, community-based population. The trial also demonstrates the opportunity for academic investigators to collaborate with retailers to design and rigorously test comprehensive healthcare interventions.",

This study examined the use of SMART goals by Australian community pharmacists providing a brief goal-oriented wellbeing intervention with service-users experiencing severe and persistent mental illnesses (SPMIs), in particular, which aspects of SMART goal planning were incorporated into the documented goals. Goal data from the PharMIbridge Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) were used to investigate how community pharmacists operationalized SMART goals, goal quality, and which SMART goal planning format aspects were most utilized. Goals were evaluated using the SMART Goal Evaluation Method (SMART-GEM) tool to determine how closely each documented goal met the SMART criteria. Goals were also categorized into five domains describing their content or purpose. Descriptive analysis was used to describe the SMART-GEM evaluation results, and the Kruskal-Wallis H test was used to compare the evaluation results across the goal domains. All goals (n = 512) co-designed with service-users (n = 156) were classified as poor quality when assessed against the SMART guidelines for goal statements, although most goals contained information regarding a specific behaviour and/or action (71.3% and 86.3%, respectively). Less than 25% of goals identified how goal achievement would be measured, with those related to lifestyle and wellbeing behaviours most likely to include measurement information. Additionally, the majority (93.5%) of goals lacked details regarding monitoring goal progress. Study findings raise questions regarding the applicability of the SMART goal format in brief health interventions provided in primary healthcare settings, particularly for service-users experiencing SPMIs. Further research is recommended to identify which elements of SMART goals are most relevant for brief interventions. Additionally, further investigation is needed regarding the impact of SMART goal training or support tools on goal quality.",

Among those who opted out, multivariable multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to identify predictors of opting out early (within 3 days and between 4 and 7 days into the quit attempt) compared to opting out late (more than 7 days into the quit attempt), adjusting for the same confounders.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Survival analyses indicated that younger age, female sex, higher levels of nicotine dependence, lower intention to be smoke free, and enrolling in SmokefreeTXT ≤1 week before initiating the quit attempt were associated with an increased risk of opting out. For example, users who smoked within 5 minutes of waking up were 1.17 times more likely to opt out than those who smoked more than 5 minutes after waking up (95% CI 1.01-1.35). Among users who opted out from SmokefreeTXT, logistic regression modeling indicated that compared to users who were never or rarely around other smokers, those who were sometimes around other smokers had 1.96 times more likely to opt out within the first 3 days of the quit attempt (95% CI 1.18-3.25). In addition, compared to users with high levels of long-term quit intention, users with lower levels of intention had 1.80 times the odds of opting out between 4 and 7 days into the quit attempt (95% CI 1.02-3.18). Users who reset their quit date after initiating a quit attempt were less likely to opt out at either time point compared with those who did not reset their quit date.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Several user characteristics are associated with retention in an adult text messaging smoking cessation program. These results provide guidance on potential characteristics that should be addressed in future text messaging smoking cessation programs. Providing additional support to users with these characteristics may increase retention in text messaging programs and ultimately lead to smoking cessation.",

      "abstract": "Introduction:\n              Devices for male circumcision (MC) are becoming available in 14 priority countries where MC is being implemented for HIV prevention. Understanding potential impact on demand for services is one important programmatic consideration because countries determine whether to scale up devices within MC programs.\n            \n            \n              Methods:\n              A population-based survey measuring willingness to undergo MC, assuming availability of surgical MC and 3 devices, was conducted among 1250 uncircumcised men, ages 10–49 years in Zambia and 1000 uncircumcised men, ages 13–49 years in Zimbabwe. Simulated Test Market methodology was used to estimate incremental MC demand and the extent to which devices might be preferred over surgery, assuming availability of: surgical MC in both countries; the devices PrePex, ShangRing, and Unicirc in Zambia; and PrePex in Zimbabwe.\n            \n            \n              Results:\n              Modeled estimates indicate PrePex has the potential to provide an overall increase in MC demand ranging from an estimated 13%–50%, depending on country and WHO prequalification ages, replacing 11%–41% of surgical procedures. In Zambia, ShangRing could provide 8% overall increase, replacing 45% of surgical procedures, and Unicirc could provide 30% overall increase, replacing 85% of surgical procedures.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions:\n              In both countries, devices have potential to increase overall demand for MC, assuming wide scale awareness and availability of circumcision by the devices. With consideration for age and country, PrePex may provide the greatest potential increase in demand, followed by Unicirc (measured in Zambia only) and ShangRing (also Zambia only). These results inform one program dimension for decision making on potential device introduction strategies; however, they must be considered within the broader programmatic context.",

In Tanzania, 1 in 4 children is not fully vaccinated. The objective of this mixed methods study was to describe and contextualize parental concerns towards vaccines in Tanzania.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              \n                Between 2016 and 2017, we conducted a cross-sectional survey (\n                n\n                 = 134) and four focus group discussions (FGDs,\n                n\n                 = 38) with mothers of children under 2 years of age residing in Mtwara region in Southern Tanzania. The survey and FGDs assessed vaccination knowledge and concerns and barriers to timely vaccinations.

Although vaccine coverage was high, timeliness of vaccinations was lower and varied by vaccine. Rural mothers reported more vaccine-related concerns compared to urban mothers; literacy and access to information were identified as key drivers of the difference. Mothers participating in FGDs indicated high perceived risk of vaccine-preventable illnesses, but expressed concerns related to poor geographic accessibility, unreliability of services, and missed opportunities for vaccinations resulting from provider efforts to minimize vaccine wastage.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Findings from our cross-sectional survey indicate the presence of vaccination delays and maternal concerns related to childhood vaccines in Tanzania. In FGDs, mothers raised issues related to convenience more often than issues related to vaccine confidence or complacency. Further research is necessary to understand how these issues may contribute to the emergence and persistence of vaccine hesitancy and to identify effective mitigation strategies.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Emerging health care strategies addressing medication adherence include the use of direct-to-patient incentives or elements adapted from computer games. However, there is currently no published evidence synthesis on the use of gamification or financial incentives in mobile apps to improve medication adherence.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The aim of this scoping review is to synthesize and appraise the literature pertaining to the use of mobile apps containing gamification or financial incentives for medication adherence. There were two objectives: to explore the reported effectiveness of these features and to describe and appraise the design and development process, including patient involvement.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              The following databases were searched for relevant articles published in English from database inception to September 24, 2020: Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and Web of Science. The framework by Arksey and O’Malley and the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist guided this scoping review. Using a systematic screening process, studies were included if incentives or game features were used within mobile apps to specifically address medication adherence. An appraisal using risk of bias tools was also applied to their respective study design.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 11 studies from the initial 691 retrieved articles were included in this review. Across the studies, gamification alone (9/11, 82%) was used more than financial incentives (1/11, 9%) alone or a combination of the two (1/11, 9%). The studies generally reported improved or sustained optimal medication adherence outcomes; however, there was significant heterogeneity in the patient population, methodology such as outcome measures, and reporting of these studies. There was considerable variability in the development process and evaluation of the apps, with authors opting for either the waterfall or agile methodology. App development was often guided by a theory, but across the reviewed studies, there were no common theories used. Patient involvement was not commonly evident in predevelopment phases but were generally reserved for evaluations of feasibility, acceptance, and effectiveness. Patient perspectives on gamified app features indicated a potential to motivate positive health behaviors such as medication adherence along with critical themes of repetitiveness and irrelevance of certain features. The appraisal indicated a low risk of bias in most studies, although concerns were identified in potential confounding.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              To effectively address medication adherence via gamified and incentivized mobile apps, an evidence-based co-design approach and agile methodology should be used. This review indicates some adoption of an agile approach in app development; however, patient involvement is lacking in earlier stages. Further research in a generalized cohort of patients living with chronic conditions would facilitate the identification of barriers, potential opportunities, and the justification for the use of gamification and financial incentives in mobile apps for medication adherence.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n            Nudging or ‘choice architecture’ refers to strategic changes in the environment that are anticipated to alter people’s behaviour in a predictable way, without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives. Nudging strategies may be used to promote healthy eating behaviour. However, to date, the scientific evidence has not been systematically reviewed to enable practitioners and policymakers to implement, or argue for the implementation of, specific measures to support nudging strategies. This systematic review investigated the effect of positional changes of food placement on food choice. In total, seven scientific databases were searched using relevant keywords to identify interventions that manipulated food position (proximity or order) to generate a change in food selection, sales or consumption, among normal-weight or overweight individuals across any age group. From 2576 identified articles, fifteen articles comprising eighteen studies met our inclusion criteria. This review has identified that manipulation of food product order or proximity can influence food choice. Such approaches offer promise in terms of impacting on consumer behaviour. However, there is a need for high-quality studies that quantify the magnitude of positional effects on food choice in conjunction with measuring the impact on food intake, particularly in the longer term. Future studies should use outcome measures such as change in grams of food consumed or energy intake to quantify the impact on dietary intake and potential impacts on nutrition-related health. Research is also needed to evaluate potential compensatory behaviours secondary to such interventions.",

The authors explore the effectiveness of framing social distancing messages around prosocial vs. self-interested appeals in driving message compliance and helping behavior. The results show that when a message emphasizes benefits for everyone in society, rather than solely for the individual, citizens find the message more persuasive to engage in social distancing, and also more motivating to help others. The results further demonstrate that the proposed effects are higher for individuals who have a lower locus of control and lower fear of coronavirus as prosocial messages lead them to feel a joint responsibility in protecting from the pandemic.

Various researchers have discussed substantial conceptual differences between these 2 concepts, supported by empirical studies showing differences in the effects on specific health behaviors. However, researchers also frequently report cases in which terms related to these 2 concepts are used ambiguously or even interchangeably. It remains unclear to what extent existing health care research explicitly distinguishes between gamification and serious games and whether it draws on existing conceptual considerations to do so.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aims to address this lack of knowledge by capturing the current state of conceptualizations of gamification and serious games in health care research. Furthermore, we aim to provide tools for researchers to disambiguate the reporting of game-based interventions.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We used a 2-step research approach. First, we conducted a systematic literature review of 206 studies, published in the Journal of Medical Internet Research and its sister journals, containing terms related to gamification, serious games, or both. We analyzed their conceptualizations of gamification and serious games, as well as the distinctions between the two concepts. Second, based on the literature review findings, we developed a set of guidelines for researchers reporting on game-based interventions and evaluated them with a group of 9 experts from the field.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Our results show that less than half of the concept mentions are accompanied by an explicit definition. To distinguish between the 2 concepts, we identified four common approaches: implicit distinction, synonymous use of terms, serious games as a type of gamified system, and distinction based on the full game dimension. Our Game-Based Intervention Reporting Guidelines (GAMING) consist of 25 items grouped into four topics: conceptual focus, contribution, mindfulness about related concepts, and individual concept definitions.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Conceptualizations of gamification and serious games in health care literature are strongly heterogeneous, leading to conceptual ambiguity. Following the GAMING can support authors in rigorous reporting on study results of game-based interventions.",

Active ingredients in the goal-setting process include, interdisciplinary teamworking, shared decision-making, having meaningful and specific goals, and including action planning, coping planning, feedback, and review. Clinicians have expressed barriers and enablers to implementing these active ingredients in rehabilitation teams. Interventions designed to improve goal-setting practices need to be tailored to address context specific barriers and enablers. Attempts to understand and enhance goal-setting practices in rehabilitation settings should be supported using theory, process models and determinant frameworks. Few studies have been undertaken to enhance goal-setting practices in varied case-mix rehabilitation settings.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              This study is part of a larger program of research guided by the Knowledge to Action (KTA) framework. A multisite, participatory, codesign approach was used in five sites to address three stages of the KTA. (1) Focus groups were conducted to understand barriers and enablers to implementing goal-setting at each site. Following the focus groups three staff co-design workshops and one consumer workshop were run at each site to (2) adapt knowledge to local context, and to (3) select and tailor interventions to improve goal-setting practices. Focus groups were analysed using the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) and informed the selection of behaviour change techniques incorporated into the implementation plan.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Barriers and enablers identified in this study were consistent with previous research. Clinicians lacked knowledge and understanding of the differences between a goal and an action plan often confusing both terms. Clinicians were unable to demonstrate an understanding of the importance of comprehensive action planning and review processes that extended beyond initial goal-setting. Interventions developed across the sites included staff training modules, a client held workbook, educational rehabilitation service flyers, interdisciplinary goal-based case conference templates, communication goal boards and a key worker model. Implementation plans were specifically established for each site.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Rehabilitation teams continue to struggle to incorporate a truly client-centred, interdisciplinary model of goal-setting in rehabilitation. Whilst clinicians continue to lack understanding of how they can use aspects of goal-setting to enhance client outcomes and autonomy in rehabilitation settings.",

Unfortunately, existing tests cannot quantify tension across the bulk of the cord, making the diagnostic evaluation of stretch ambiguous. A potential non-destructive metric for spinal cord tension is ultrasound-derived shear wave velocity (SWV). The velocity is sensitive to tissue elasticity and boundary conditions including strain. We use the term Ultrasound Tensography to describe the acoustic evaluation of tension with SWV.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Our solution Tethered cord Assessment with Ultrasound Tensography (TAUT) was utilized in three sub-studies: finite element simulations, a cadaveric benchtop validation, and a neurosurgical case series. The simulation computed SWV for given tensile forces. The cadaveric model with induced tension validated the SWV-tension relationship. Lastly, SWV was measured intraoperatively in patients diagnosed with tethered cords who underwent treatment (spinal column shortening). The surgery alleviates tension by decreasing the vertebral column length.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              \n                Here we observe a strong linear relationship between tension and squared SWV across the preclinical sub-studies. Higher tension induces faster shear waves in the simulation (\n                R\n                2\n                 = 0.984) and cadaveric (\n                R\n                2\n                 = 0.951) models. The SWV decreases in all neurosurgical procedures (\n                p\n                 < 0.001). Moreover, TAUT has a c-statistic of 0.962 (0.92-1.00), detecting all tethered cords.\n              \n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This study presents a physical, clinical metric of spinal cord tension. Strong agreement among computational, cadaveric, and clinical studies demonstrates the utility of ultrasound-induced SWV for quantitative intraoperative feedback. This technology is positioned to enhance tethered cord diagnosis, treatment, and postoperative monitoring as it differentiates stretched from healthy cords.",

Threats to mental health, psychological safety, and well-being are now emerging, increasing the impact of this virus on world health. Providing support for these challenges is difficult because of the high number of people requiring support in the context of a need to maintain physical distancing. This protocol describes the use of SMS text messaging (Text4Hope) as a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible population-level mental health intervention. This program is evidence-based, with prior research supporting good outcomes and high user satisfaction.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The project goal is to implement a program of daily supportive SMS text messaging (Text4Hope) to reduce distress related to the COVID-19 crisis, initially among Canadians.

      "abstract": "Background\n              Implementation of digital health technologies has grown rapidly, but many remain limited to pilot studies due to challenges, such as a lack of evidence or barriers to implementation. Overcoming these challenges requires learning from previous implementations and systematically documenting implementation processes to better understand the real-world impact of a technology and identify effective strategies for future implementation.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              A group of global experts, facilitated by the Geneva Digital Health Hub, developed the Guidelines and Checklist for the Reporting on Digital Health Implementations (iCHECK-DH, pronounced “I checked”) to improve the completeness of reporting on digital health implementations.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A guideline development group was convened to define key considerations and criteria for reporting on digital health implementations. To ensure the practicality and effectiveness of the checklist, it was pilot-tested by applying it to several real-world digital health implementations, and adjustments were made based on the feedback received. The guiding principle for the development of iCHECK-DH was to identify the minimum set of information needed to comprehensively define a digital health implementation, to support the identification of key factors for success and failure, and to enable others to replicate it in different settings.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The result was a 20-item checklist with detailed explanations and examples in this paper.

This allows for meaningful comparison and evaluation of results, transparency, and accountability and informs stakeholder decision-making. i-CHECK-DH facilitates standardization of the way information is collected and reported, improving systematic documentation and knowledge transfer that can lead to the development of more effective digital health interventions and better health outcomes.",

However, many studies using mHealth apps are hampered by substantial participant dropout or attrition, which may impact the representativeness of the sample and the effectiveness of the study. Therefore, it is imperative for researchers to understand what makes participants stay with mHealth apps or studies using mHealth apps.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aimed to review the current peer-reviewed research literature to identify the notable factors and strategies used in adult participant engagement and retention.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We conducted a systematic search of PubMed, MEDLINE, and PsycINFO databases for mHealth studies that evaluated and assessed issues or strategies to improve the engagement and retention of adults from 2015 to 2020.

Inequalities in digital health across the domains of equity are not routinely examined; yet, the long-term integration of digitally delivered services needs to consider such inequalities to ensure equitable benefits.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This scoping review aimed to map inequities in access, use, and engagement with digital health technologies across equity domains.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We searched 4 electronic databases (MEDLINE, ASSIA, PsycINFO, and Scopus) for quantitative and mixed methods reviews and meta-analyses published between January 2016 and May 2022. Reviews were limited to those that included studies from the World Health Organization’s European region. Extracted data were mapped against Cochrane’s PROGRESS PLUS (place of residence, race, ethnicity, culture, and language, occupation, gender and sex, religion, education, socioeconomic status, social capital, and other characteristics) dimensions of equity.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              In total, 404 unique citations were identified from the searches, and 2 citations were identified from other sources.

Consistent evidence was found showing higher access to digital health technologies among patients who were of White ethnicity, were English speaking, and had no disability. There were no reviews that explored differences in access to digital health care by age, gender and sex, occupation, education, or homeless or substance misuse. Higher use of digital health technologies was observed among populations that were White, English speaking, younger, with a higher level of education, of higher economic status, and residents in urban areas. No clear evidence of differences in the use of digital technologies by occupation, gender and sex, disability, or homeless or substance misuse was found, nor was clear evidence found in the included reviews on inequalities in the engagement with digital technologies.

      "abstract": "Social support has been associated with improved mental health; however, the mechanisms underlying this relationship remain unclear. This study aimed to explore whether perceived stress mediate the relationship between social support and positive affect, anxiety, and depression. Drawing from Lazarus and Folkman’s stress and coping theory, the study emphasized the influential role of social support in appraising stressful events. A cross-sectional survey was conducted online among 426 Filipino adults during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. Participants completed measures including the Multidimensional Scale of Perceived Social Support (MSPSS), the Perceived Stress Scale-10 (PSS-10), the Positive Affect subscale of PANAS, and the Depression and Anxiety subscales of DASS-21. The hypotheses of the study were tested using mediation analysis. Consistent with the hypotheses, perceived stress significantly mediated the relationship between family and significant other support with positive affect, anxiety, and depression. Family and significant other support decreased perceived stress, increasing positive affect, and decreasing anxiety and depression. On the other hand, perceived stress did not mediate the relationship between friend support and positive affect, anxiety, and depression. Implications and future research directions are discussed.",

The discovery of disease-associated proteins with causal genetic evidence offers a chance to uncover novel therapeutic targets.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              \n                First, we comprehensively investigated the causal association between 2994 proteins and MM through two-sample mendelian randomization (MR) analysis using summary-level data from public genome-wide association studies of plasma proteome (\n                N\n                 = 3301 healthy individuals) and MM (598 cases and 180,756 controls). Sensitivity analyses were performed for these identified causal proteins. Furthermore, we pursued the exploration of enriched biological pathways, prioritized the therapeutic proteins, and evaluated their druggability using the KEGG pathway analysis, MR-Bayesian model averaging analysis, and cross-reference with current databases, respectively.\n              \n            \n            \n              Results\n              \n                We identified 13 proteins causally associated with MM risk (false discovery rate corrected\n                P\n                 < 0.05). Six proteins were positively associated with the risk of MM, including nicotinamide phosphoribosyl transferase (NAMPT; OR [95% CI]: 1.35 [1.18, 1.55]), tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin-like and EGF-like domains 1 (TIE1; 1.14 [1.06, 1.22]), neutrophil cytosol factor 2 (NCF2; 1.27 [1.12, 1.44]), carbonyl reductase 1, cAMP-specific 3',5'-cyclic phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D), platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase IB subunit beta (PAFAH1B2). Seven proteins were inversely associated with MM, which referred to suppressor of cytokine signaling 3 (SOCS3; 0.90 [0.86, 0.94]), Fc-gamma receptor III-B (FCGR3B; 0.75 [0.65,0.86]), glypican-1 (GPC1; 0.69 [0.58,0.83]), follistatin-related protein 1, protein tyrosine phosphatase non-receptor type 4 (PTPN4), granzyme B, complement C1q subcomponent subunit C (C1QC). Three of the causal proteins, SOCS3, FCGR3B, and NCF2, were enriched in the osteoclast differentiation pathway in KEGG enrichment analyses while GPC1 (marginal inclusion probability (MIP):0.993; model averaged causal effects (MACE): − 0.349), NAMPT (MIP:0.433; MACE: − 0.113), and NCF2 (MIP:0.324; MACE:0.066) ranked among the top three MM-associated proteins according to MR-BMA analyses.

      "abstract": "Background\n              Although gamification continues to be a popular approach to increase engagement, motivation, and adherence to behavioral interventions, empirical studies have rarely focused on this topic. There is a need to empirically evaluate gamification models to increase the understanding of how to integrate gamification into interventions.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The model of gamification principles for digital health interventions proposes a set of five independent yet interrelated gamification principles. This study aimed to examine the validity and reliability of this model to inform its use in Web- and mobile-based apps.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A total of 17 digital health interventions were selected from a curated website of mobile- and Web-based apps (PsyberGuide), which makes independent and unbiased ratings on various metrics. A total of 133 independent raters trained in gamification evaluation techniques were instructed to evaluate the apps and rate the degree to which gamification principles are present. Multiple ratings (n≥20) were collected for each of the five gamification principles within each app. Existing measures, including the PsyberGuide credibility score, mobile app rating scale (MARS), and the app store rating of each app were collected, and their relationship with the gamification principle scores was investigated.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Apps varied widely in the degree of gamification implemented (ie, the mean gamification rating ranged from 0.17≤m≤4.65 out of 5). Inter-rater reliability of gamification scores for each app was acceptable (κ≥0.5). There was no significant correlation between any of the five gamification principles and the PsyberGuide credibility score (P≥.49 in all cases). Three gamification principles (supporting player archetypes, feedback, and visibility) were significantly correlated with the MARS score, whereas three principles (meaningful purpose, meaningful choice, and supporting player archetypes) were significantly correlated with the app store rating. One gamification principle was statistically significant with both the MARS and the app store rating (supporting player archetypes).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Overall, the results support the validity and potential utility of the model of gamification principles for digital health interventions. As expected, there was some overlap between several gamification principles and existing app measures (eg, MARS). However, the results indicate that the gamification principles are not redundant with existing measures and highlight the potential utility of a 5-factor gamification model structure in digital behavioral health interventions. These gamification principles may be used to improve user experience and enhance engagement with digital health programs.",

      "abstract": "This study characterized the evolution of Brazilian public telemedicine policy in the Brazilian Unified Health System for 30 years from 1988 to 2019 by analyzing its legal framework. We identified 79 telemedicine-related legislations from the federal government (laws, decrees, and ordinances) and 31 regulations of federal councils of health professionals. Three historical phases were established according to the public policy cycle, and material was classified according to the purpose of the normative documents. The content analysis was based on the advocacy coalition framework model. Of the federal legislations, 8.9% were for the Formulation/Decision-Making phase, 43% for the Organization/Implementation phase, and 48.1% for the Expansion/Maturation phase of telemedicine policy in Brazil. The Federal Council of Medicine was the most active in standardizing telemedicine and was responsible for 21 (67.7%) regulations. The first legislations were passed in 2000; however, the coalitions discussed topics related to telemedicine and created their belief systems from the 1990’s. The time cycle which included formulation and decision making for Brazilian telemedicine policy, extended until 2007 with the creation of several technical working groups. The expansion and maturation of telemedicine services began in 2011 with the decentralization of telemedicine policy actions across the country. Telemedicine centers which performed telediagnosis influenced the computerization of primary health care units. We conclude that Brazilian telemedicine field has greatly grown and changed in recent years. However, despite the proliferation of legislations and regulations in the period studied, there is still no fully consolidated process for setting up a wholly defined regulatory framework for telemedicine in Brazil.",

Furthermore, usage of gamification-related terminology is inconsistent. Current applications of gamification for health and well-being have also been critiqued for adopting a behaviorist approach that relies on positive reinforcement and extrinsic motivators.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aimed to analyze current applications of gamification for mental health and well-being by answering 3 research questions (RQs). RQ1: which gamification elements are most commonly applied to apps and technologies for improving mental health and well-being? RQ2: which mental health and well-being domains are most commonly targeted by these gamified apps and technologies? RQ3: what reasons do researchers give for applying gamification to these apps and technologies? A systematic review of the literature was conducted to answer these questions.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We searched ACM Digital Library, CINAHL, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, IEEE Explore, JMIR, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, PubMed, ScienceDirect, Scopus, and Web of Science for qualifying papers published between the years 2013 and 2018. To answer RQ1 and RQ2, papers were coded for gamification elements and mental health and well-being domains according to existing taxonomies in the game studies and medical literature. During the coding process, it was necessary to adapt our coding frame and revise these taxonomies. Thematic analysis was conducted to answer RQ3.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The search and screening process identified 70 qualifying papers that collectively reported on 50 apps and technologies. The most commonly observed gamification elements were levels or progress feedback, points or scoring, rewards or prizes, narrative or theme, personalization, and customization; the least commonly observed elements were artificial assistance, unlockable content, social cooperation, exploratory or open-world approach, artificial challenge, and randomness. The most commonly observed mental health and well-being domains were anxiety disorders and well-being, whereas the least commonly observed domains were conduct disorder and bipolar disorders. Researchers’ justification for applying gamification to improving mental health and well-being was coded in 59% (41/70) of the papers and was broadly divided into 2 themes: (1) promoting engagement and (2) enhancing an intervention’s intended effects.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Our findings suggest that the current application of gamification to apps and technologies for improving mental health and well-being does not align with the trend of positive reinforcement critiqued in the greater health and well-being literature. We also observed overlap between the most commonly used gamification techniques and existing behavior change frameworks. Results also suggest that the application of gamification is not driven by health behavior change theory, and that many researchers may treat gamification as a black box without consideration for its underlying mechanisms. We call for the inclusion of more comprehensive and explicit descriptions of how gamification is applied and the standardization of applied games terminology within and across fields.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Controlling blood pressure (BP) is an international health concern, and high BP is a major contributor to cardiovascular disease mortality. Evidence has shown that educational interventions directed at patients potentially improve BP control and adherence to medications and lifestyle modifications. In addition, a text messaging intervention has a potential effect on BP control; however, the dosage of a text messaging intervention has not been determined in previous reviews, resulting in difficult application in practice.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This review aimed to identify the effectiveness of a text messaging intervention on hypertension management with a specific focus on the dosage of text messaging and the type of additional interventions with text messaging.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A systematic review was conducted and reported on in accordance with PRISMA guideline. Participants were aged 18 years and older and diagnosed with primary hypertension. The included studies used text messaging as a component of the intervention. We searched for randomized controlled trials published until June 30, 2020, from the following health-related electronic databases: Embase, Medline, CINAHL Complete, PsycINFO, and Scopus. Data were extracted for qualitative synthesis and meta-analysis. The Physiotherapy Evidence Database Scale was used to assess the methodological quality of each study, and the quality of the included studies was assessed independently by two authors.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. The overall methodological quality was fair (mean score 5.75). The frequency of text message delivery varied from daily to biweekly. Health education was identified in 4 studies as an additional intervention with text messaging. The overall results showed that the text messaging intervention significantly reduced systolic BP (SBP) but not diastolic BP (DBP). There was no significant difference in BP reduction between studies that lasted 6 months or less and those that lasted more than 7 months. Seven studies that lasted 6 months or less involving 1428 patients with hypertension were pooled for further meta-analysis. Text messages delivered at a lower frequency (once per week or less) had a small effect on SBP reduction (effect size 0.35, P<.01) and DBP reduction (effect size 0.28, P=.01). In addition, the use of a text messaging intervention halved the odds of uncontrolled BP among patients with hypertension in 6 months (odds ratio 0.46, P=.02).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This review found that a text messaging intervention was effective in BP control. One-way text messaging delivered in a weekly manner was suggested to be effective and required fewer resources. Future studies should use different forms of text message and be integrated into other interventions to improve adherence behaviors and BP control among patients with hypertension.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Young adulthood (ages 18-29 years) is marked by substantial weight gain, leading to increased lifetime risks of chronic diseases. Engaging in sufficient levels of physical activity and sleep, and limiting sedentary time are important contributors to the prevention of weight gain. Dual-process models of decision-making and behavior that delineate reflective (ie, deliberative, slow) and reactive (ie, automatic, fast) processes shed light on different mechanisms underlying the adoption versus maintenance of these energy-balance behaviors. However, reflective and reactive processes may unfold at different time scales and vary across people.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This paper describes the study design, recruitment, and data collection procedures for the Temporal Influences on Movement and Exercise (TIME) study, a 12-month intensive longitudinal data collection study to examine real-time microtemporal influences underlying the adoption and maintenance of physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Intermittent ecological momentary assessment (eg, intentions, self-control) and continuous, sensor-based passive monitoring (eg, location, phone/app use, activity levels) occur using smartwatches and smartphones.

      "abstract": "In recent years, policy makers worldwide have begun to acknowledge the potential value of insights from psychology and behavioral economics into how people make decisions. These insights can inform the design of nonregulatory and nonmonetary policy interventions—as well as more traditional fiscal and coercive measures. To date, much of the discussion of behaviorally informed approaches has emphasized “nudges,” that is, interventions designed to steer people in a particular direction while preserving their freedom of choice. Yet behavioral science also provides support for a distinct kind of nonfiscal and noncoercive intervention, namely, “boosts.” The objective of boosts is to foster people’s competence to make their own choices—that is, to exercise their own agency. Building on this distinction, we further elaborate on how boosts are conceptually distinct from nudges: The two kinds of interventions differ with respect to (a) their immediate intervention targets, (b) their roots in different research programs, (c) the causal pathways through which they affect behavior, (d) their assumptions about human cognitive architecture, (e) the reversibility of their effects, (f) their programmatic ambitions, and (g) their normative implications. We discuss each of these dimensions, provide an initial taxonomy of boosts, and address some possible misconceptions.",

Real-time user-chatbot interaction data, such as user preferences and behavioral performance, were collected on the chatbot platform to identify ways of providing personalized services. The AI chatbots demonstrated potential for scalability by deployment through accessible devices and platforms (eg, smartphones and Facebook Messenger). The participants also reported that AI chatbots offered a nonjudgmental space for communicating sensitive information.

These methods yield multiple snapshots of people's experiences over time in daily life and allow researchers to identify patterns of behavior within a given individual, rather than strictly identify patterns of behavior across individuals, as with standard nomothetic approaches. In this article, we discuss the origin and evolution of idiographic methods in the field of personality and explain how experience sampling methods function as modern day idiographic methods in this field. We then review four primary ways in which experience sampling methods have been used to foster idiographic approaches in personality research. Specifically, we highlight approaches that examine individual differences in temporal and behavioral distributions, situation–behavior contingencies, daily processes, and the structure of daily experience. Following a brief methodology primer, we end by discussing future directions for idiographic experience sampling approaches in personality psychology and beyond.",

Identifying the right moment for the intervention is a crucial component. In this paper the reinforcement learning (RL) technique has been used in a smartphone exercise application to promote physical activity. This RL model determines the ‘right’ time to deliver a restricted number of notifications adaptively, with respect to users’ temporary context information (i.e., time and calendar). A four-week trial study was conducted to examine the feasibility of our model with real target users. JITAI reminders were sent by the RL model in the fourth week of the intervention, while the participants could only access the app’s other functionalities during the first 3 weeks. Eleven target users registered for this study, and the data from 7 participants using the application for 4 weeks and receiving the intervening reminders were analyzed. Not only were the reaction behaviors of users after receiving the reminders analyzed from the application data, but the user experience with the reminders was also explored in a questionnaire and exit interviews. The results show that 83.3% reminders sent at adaptive moments were able to elicit user reaction within 50 min, and 66.7% of physical activities in the intervention week were performed within 5 h of the delivery of a reminder. Our findings indicated the usability of the RL model, while the timing of the moments to deliver reminders can be further improved based on lessons learned.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Digital health interventions, such as personalized SMS coaching, are considered affordable and scalable methods to support healthy lifestyle changes. SMS, or texting, is a readily available service to most people in Sweden, and personalized SMS coaching has shown great promise in supporting behavior changes.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aims to explore the effectiveness of highly personalized SMS coaching for behavior change according to the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation–Behavior (COM-B) model on a sample of physically inactive adults in a nonprofit fitness organization in Sweden.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              The study used a mixed methods design in which clients acted as their own controls. The participants were clients (n=28) and fitness consultants (n=12). Three types of data were collected: (1) quantitative data at baseline and after the SMS intervention and the waitlist from the clients, (2) qualitative data from semistructured interviews with the fitness consultants, and (3) pseudonymized texting conversations between the fitness consultants and clients.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Overall, the results showed that personalized SMS coaching was effective in supporting the clients’ behavior changes. The quantitative analysis showed how the clients’ capabilities (Cohen d=0.50), opportunities (Cohen d=0.43), and relationship with the fitness consultants (Cohen d=0.51) improved during the SMS intervention in comparison with baseline. Furthermore, the qualitative analysis revealed how personalized texts added value to existing work methods (eg, increasing continuity and flexibility) and how the relationship between the clients and fitness consultants changed during the intervention, which helped motivate the clients.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Personalized SMS coaching is an effective method for supporting healthy behavior changes. The human connection that emerged in this study needs to be further explored to fully understand the effectiveness of a digital health intervention.",

Owing to their cost-effectiveness and accessibility, conversational agent interventions (CAIs) are promising in the field of mental health care.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aims to present a thorough summary of the traits of CAIs available for a range of mental health problems, find evidence of efficacy, and analyze the statistically significant moderators of efficacy via a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trial.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Web-based databases (Embase, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane) were systematically searched dated from the establishment of the database to October 30, 2021, and updated to May 1, 2022. Randomized controlled trials comparing CAIs with any other type of control condition in improving depressive symptoms, generalized anxiety symptoms, specific anxiety symptoms, quality of life or well-being, general distress, stress, mental disorder symptoms, psychosomatic disease symptoms, and positive and negative affect were considered eligible. This study followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines. Data were extracted by 2 independent reviewers, checked by a third reviewer, and pooled using both random effect models and fixed effects models. Hedges g was chosen as the effect size.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Of the 6900 identified records, a total of 32 studies were included, involving 6089 participants. CAIs showed statistically significant short-term effects compared with control conditions in improving depressive symptoms (g=0.29, 95% CI 0.20-0.38), generalized anxiety symptoms (g=0.29, 95% CI 0.21-0.36), specific anxiety symptoms (g=0.47, 95% CI 0.07-0.86), quality of life or well-being (g=0.27, 95% CI 0.16-0.39), general distress (g=0.33, 95% CI 0.20-0.45), stress (g=0.24, 95% CI 0.08-0.41), mental disorder symptoms (g=0.36, 95% CI 0.17-0.54), psychosomatic disease symptoms (g=0.62, 95% CI 0.14-1.11), and negative affect (g=0.28, 95% CI 0.05-0.51). However, the long-term effects of CAIs for the most mental health outcomes were not statistically significant (g=−0.04 to 0.39). Personalization and empathic response were 2 critical facilitators of efficacy. The longer duration of interaction with conversational agents was associated with the larger pooled effect sizes.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The findings show that CAIs are research-proven interventions that ought to be implemented more widely in mental health care.

      "abstract": "Background\n              Although the health benefits of physical activity are well established, it remains challenging for people to adopt a more active lifestyle. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions can be effective tools to promote physical activity and reduce sedentary behavior. Promising results have been obtained by using gamification techniques as behavior change strategies, especially when they were tailored toward an individual’s preferences and goals; yet, it remains unclear how goals could be personalized to effectively promote health behaviors.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              In this study, we aim to evaluate the impact of personalized goal setting in the context of gamified mHealth interventions. We hypothesize that interventions suggesting health goals that are tailored based on end users’ (self-reported) current and desired capabilities will be more engaging than interventions with generic goals.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              The study was designed as a 2-arm randomized intervention trial. Participants were recruited among staff members of 7 governmental organizations. They participated in an 8-week digital health promotion campaign that was especially designed to promote walks, bike rides, and sports sessions. Using an mHealth app, participants could track their performance on two social leaderboards: a leaderboard displaying the individual scores of participants and a leaderboard displaying the average scores per organizational department. The mHealth app also provided a news feed that showed when other participants had scored points. Points could be collected by performing any of the 6 assigned tasks (eg, walk for at least 2000 m). The level of complexity of 3 of these 6 tasks was updated every 2 weeks by changing either the suggested task intensity or the suggested frequency of the task. The 2 intervention arms—with participants randomly assigned—consisted of a personalized treatment that tailored the complexity parameters based on participants’ self-reported capabilities and goals and a control treatment where the complexity parameters were set generically based on national guidelines. Measures were collected from the mHealth app as well as from intake and posttest surveys and analyzed using hierarchical linear models.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The results indicated that engagement with the program inevitably dropped over time. However, engagement was higher for participants who had set themselves a goal in the intake survey. The impact of personalization was especially observed for frequency parameters because the personalization of sports session frequency did foster higher engagement levels, especially when participants set a goal to improve their capabilities. In addition, the personalization of suggested ride duration had a positive effect on self-perceived biking performance.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Personalization seems particularly promising for promoting the frequency of physical activity (eg, promoting the number of suggested sports sessions per week), as opposed to the intensity of the physical activity (eg, distance or duration). Replications and variations of our study setup are critical for consolidating and explaining (or refuting) these effects.\n            \n            \n              Trial Registration\n              ClinicalTrials.gov NCT05264155; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT05264155",

These are referred to as just-in-time (JIT) interventions. The Playful Active Urban Living (PAUL) app is among the first to include 2 types of JIT prompts: JIT adaptive reminder messages to initiate a run or walk and JIT strength exercise prompts during a walk or run (containing location-based instruction videos). This paper reports on the feasibility of the PAUL app and its JIT prompts.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The main objective of this study was to examine user experience, app engagement, and users’ perceptions and opinions regarding the PAUL app and its JIT prompts and to explore changes in the PA behavior, intrinsic motivation, and the perceived capability of the PA behavior of the participants.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              In total, 2 versions of the closed-beta version of the PAUL app were evaluated: a basic version (Basic PAUL) and a JIT adaptive version (Smart PAUL). Both apps send JIT exercise prompts, but the versions differ in that the Smart PAUL app sends JIT adaptive reminder messages to initiate running or walking behavior, whereas the Basic PAUL app sends reminder messages at randomized times. A total of 23 participants were randomized into 1 of the 2 intervention arms. PA behavior (accelerometer-measured), intrinsic motivation, and the perceived capability of PA behavior were measured before and after the intervention. After the intervention, participants were also asked to complete a questionnaire on user experience, and they were invited for an exit interview to assess user perceptions and opinions of the app in depth.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              No differences in PA behavior were observed (Z=−1.433; P=.08), but intrinsic motivation for running and walking and for performing strength exercises significantly increased (Z=−3.342; P<.001 and Z=−1.821; P=.04, respectively). Furthermore, participants increased their perceived capability to perform strength exercises (Z=2.231; P=.01) but not to walk or run (Z=−1.221; P=.12). The interviews indicated that the participants were enthusiastic about the strength exercise prompts. These were perceived as personal, fun, and relevant to their health. The reminders were perceived as important initiators for PA, but participants from both app groups explained that the reminder messages were often not sent at times they could exercise. Although the participants were enthusiastic about the functionalities of the app, technical issues resulted in a low user experience.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The preliminary findings suggest that the PAUL apps are promising and innovative interventions for promoting PA. Users perceived the strength exercise prompts as a valuable addition to exercise apps. However, to be a feasible intervention, the app must be more stable.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              It is unclear why some physical activity (PA) mobile health (mHealth) interventions successfully promote PA whereas others do not. One possible explanation is the variety in PA mHealth interventions—not only do interventions differ in the selection of persuasive strategies but also the design and implementation of persuasive strategies can vary. However, limited studies have examined the different designs and technical implementations of strategies or explored if they indeed influenced the effectiveness of the intervention.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This scoping review sets out to explore the different technical implementations and design characteristics of common and likely most effective persuasive strategies, namely, goal setting, monitoring, reminders, rewards, sharing, and social comparison. Furthermore, this review aims to explore whether previous mHealth studies examined the influence of the different design characteristics and technical operationalizations of common persuasive strategies on the effectiveness of the intervention to persuade the user to engage in PA.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              An unsystematic snowball and gray literature search was performed to identify the literature that evaluated the persuasive strategies in experimental trials (eg, randomized controlled trial, pre-post test). Studies were included if they targeted adults, if they were (partly) delivered by a mobile system, if they reported PA outcomes, if they used an experimental trial, and when they specifically compared the effect of different designs or implementations of persuasive strategies. The study methods, implementations, and designs of persuasive strategies, and the study results were systematically extracted from the literature by the reviewers.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 29 experimental trials were identified. We found a heterogeneity in how the strategies are being implemented and designed. Moreover, the findings indicated that the implementation and design of the strategy has an influence on the effectiveness of the PA intervention. For instance, the effectiveness of rewarding was shown to vary between types of rewards; rewarding goal achievement seems to be more effective than rewarding each step taken. Furthermore, studies comparing different ways of goal setting suggested that assigning a goal to users might appear to be more effective than letting the user set their own goal, similar to using adaptively tailored goals as opposed to static generic goals. This study further demonstrates that only a few studies have examined the influence of different technical implementations on PA behavior.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The different implementations and designs of persuasive strategies in mHealth interventions should be critically considered when developing such interventions and before drawing conclusions on the effectiveness of the strategy as a whole. Future efforts are needed to examine which implementations and designs are most effective to improve the translation of theory-based persuasive strategies into practical delivery forms.",

This study aimed to investigate the clinical impact and quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving interventions evaluating TS, machine learning (ML), and deep learning (DL) prediction tools. A systematic review on PubMed was conducted to identify RCTs involving TS/ML/DL tool interventions in the past decade. A total of 65 RCTs from 26,082 records were included. A majority of them had model development studies and generally good performance was achieved. The function of TS and ML tools in the RCTs mainly included assistive treatment decisions, assistive diagnosis, and risk stratification, but DL trials were only conducted for assistive diagnosis. Nearly two-fifths of the trial interventions showed no clinical benefit compared to standard care. Though DL and ML interventions achieved higher rates of positive results than TS in the RCTs, in trials with low risk of bias (17/65) the advantage of DL to TS was reduced while the advantage of ML to TS disappeared. The current applications of DL were not yet fully spread performed in medicine. It is predictable that DL will integrate more complex clinical problems than ML and TS tools in the future. Therefore, rigorous studies are required before the clinical application of these tools.",

Despite the popularity of LLMs, there is a significant gap in systematized information on their use in patient care.

In this manuscript we develop diagnostic reasoning prompts to study whether LLMs can imitate clinical reasoning while accurately forming a diagnosis. We find that GPT-4 can be prompted to mimic the common clinical reasoning processes of clinicians without sacrificing diagnostic accuracy. This is significant because an LLM that can imitate clinical reasoning to provide an interpretable rationale offers physicians a means to evaluate whether an LLMs response is likely correct and can be trusted for patient care. Prompting methods that use diagnostic reasoning have the potential to mitigate the “black box” limitations of LLMs, bringing them one step closer to safe and effective use in medicine.",

There is an increase in research for advanced AI techniques, such as deep learning, to build predictive models for the early detection of diseases. Such predictive models leverage mobile health (mHealth) data from wearable sensors and smartphones to discover novel ways for detecting and managing chronic diseases and mental health conditions.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              Currently, little is known about the use of AI-powered mHealth (AIM) settings. Therefore, this scoping review aims to map current research on the emerging use of AIM for managing diseases and promoting health. Our objective is to synthesize research in AIM models that have increasingly been used for health care delivery in the last 2 years.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Using Arksey and O’Malley’s 5-point framework for conducting scoping reviews, we reviewed AIM literature from the past 2 years in the fields of biomedical technology, AI, and information systems. We searched 3 databases, PubsOnline at INFORMS, e-journal archive at MIS Quarterly, and Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) Digital Library using keywords such as “mobile healthcare,” “wearable medical sensors,” “smartphones”, and “AI.” We included AIM articles and excluded technical articles focused only on AI models. We also used the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) technique for identifying articles that represent a comprehensive view of current research in the AIM domain.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              We screened 108 articles focusing on developing AIM models for ensuring better health care delivery, detecting diseases early, and diagnosing chronic health conditions, and 37 articles were eligible for inclusion, with 31 of the 37 articles being published last year (76%). Of the included articles, 9 studied AI models to detect serious mental health issues, such as depression and suicidal tendencies, and chronic health conditions, such as sleep apnea and diabetes. Several articles discussed the application of AIM models for remote patient monitoring and disease management. The considered primary health concerns belonged to 3 categories: mental health, physical health, and health promotion and wellness. Moreover, 14 of the 37 articles used AIM applications to research physical health, representing 38% of the total studies. Finally, 28 out of the 37 (76%) studies used proprietary data sets rather than public data sets. We found a lack of research in addressing chronic mental health issues and a lack of publicly available data sets for AIM research.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The application of AIM models for disease detection and management is a growing research domain. These models provide accurate predictions for enabling preventive care on a broader scale in the health care domain. Given the ever-increasing need for remote disease management during the pandemic, recent AI techniques, such as federated learning and explainable AI, can act as a catalyst for increasing the adoption of AIM and enabling secure data sharing across the health care industry.",

      "abstract": "Introduction:\n              Many adults do not reach the recommended physical activity (PA) guidelines, which can lead to serious health problems. A promising method to increase PA is the use of smartphone PA applications. However, despite the development and evaluation of multiple PA apps, it remains unclear how to develop and design engaging and effective PA apps. Furthermore, little is known on ways to harness the potential of artificial intelligence for developing personalized apps. In this paper, we describe the design and development of the Playful data-driven Active Urban Living (PAUL): a personalized PA application.\n            \n            \n              Methods:\n              The two-phased development process of the PAUL apps rests on principles from the behavior change model; the Integrate, Design, Assess, and Share (IDEAS) framework; and the behavioral intervention technology (BIT) model. During the first phase, we explored whether location-specific information on performing PA in the built environment is an enhancement to a PA app. During the second phase, the other modules of the app were developed. To this end, we first build the theoretical foundation for the PAUL intervention by performing a literature study. Next, a focus group study was performed to translate the theoretical foundations and the needs and wishes in a set of user requirements. Since the participants indicated the need for reminders at a for-them-relevant moment, we developed a self-learning module for the timing of the reminders. To initialize this module, a data-mining study was performed with historical running data to determine good situations for running.\n            \n            \n              Results:\n              The results of these studies informed the design of a personalized mobile health (mHealth) application for running, walking, and performing strength exercises. The app is implemented as a set of modules based on the persuasive strategies “monitoring of behavior,” “feedback,” “goal setting,” “reminders,” “rewards,” and “providing instruction.” An architecture was set up consisting of a smartphone app for the user, a back-end server for storage and adaptivity, and a research portal to provide access to the research team.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions:\n              The interdisciplinary research encompassing psychology, human movement sciences, computer science, and artificial intelligence has led to a theoretically and empirically driven leisure time PA application. In the current phase, the feasibility of the PAUL app is being assessed.",

      "abstract": "Motivational interviewing is an approach based upon principles of experimental social psychology, applying processes such as attribution, cognitive dissonance, and self-efficacy. Motivation is conceptualized not as a personality trait but as an interpersonal process. The model deemphasizes labeling and places heavy emphasis on individual responsibility and internal attribution of change. Cognitive dissonance is created by contrasting the ongoing problem behavior with salient awareness of the behavior's negative consequences. Empathic processes from the methods of Carl Rogers, social psychological principles of motivation, and objective assessment feedback are employed to channel this dissonance toward a behavior change solution, avoiding the “short circuits” of low self-esteem, low self-efficacy, and denial. This motivational process is understood within a larger developmental model of change in which contemplation and determination are important early steps which can be influenced by therapist interventions. A schematic diagram of the motivational process and a six-step sequence for implementing motivational interviewing are suggested.",

      "abstract": "Objective: Motivational interviewing (MI) is a treatment approach that has been widely examined as an intervention for tobacco dependence and is recommended in clinical practice guidelines. Previous reviews evaluating the efficacy of MI for smoking cessation noted effects that were modest in magnitude but included few studies. The current study is a comprehensive meta-analysis of MI for smoking cessation. Method: The meta-analysis included 31 controlled trials with an abstinence outcome variable. Studies with nonpregnant (N 23) and pregnant samples (N 8) were analyzed separately. Results: For nonpregnant samples, combined results suggest that MI significantly outperformed comparison conditions at long-term follow-up points (dc .17). The magnitudes of this result represented a 2.3% difference in abstinence rates between MI and comparison groups. All analyses investigating the impact of moderating participant, intervention, and study design characteristics on outcome were nonsignificant, with the exception of studies including international, non-U.S. samples, which had larger effects overall. Several subgroups of studies had significant combined effect sizes, pointing to potentially promising applications of MI, including studies that had participants with young age, medical comorbidities, low tobacco dependence, and, consistent with clinical practice guidelines, low motivation or intent to quit. Effects were smaller among pregnant samples. In addition, significant combined effect sizes were observed among subgroups of studies that administered less than 1 hr of MI and among studies that reported high levels of treatment fidelity. Conclusions: The results are interpreted in light of other behavioral approaches to smoking cessation, and the public health implications of the findings are discussed.",

Participants were randomized to either electronic cigarette (EC) or nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) treatment arms. We compared EMA data collected through automated SMS text message prompts sent to participants 4 times daily for 12 weeks, including cigarettes smoked per day (CPD), craving, and satisfaction, to survey data collected at 12 weeks. Convergent validity between survey- and EMA-reported measures was evaluated using Pearson correlation and paired\n                t\n                tests. CPD was modeled using negative binomial regression. Relative rates (RRs) of reaching at least 50%, 75%, and 100% CPD reduction between two arms were calculated using both EMA and survey data.\n              \n            \n            \n              Results\n              \n                The majority of participants were non-Hispanic White (63/109, 58%) and female (60/109, 55%), and had a median age of 60 (IQR 54‐65) years. Among the 109 participants, 59.6% (n=65) were consistently adherent to the EMA protocol over the 12-week period. Median weekly EMA response rate remained high over the 12-week study period even though a modest decline was observed (week 1, 97.8% and week 12, 89.4%). The mean CPD declined significantly (week 1, mean 14.2, SD 9.9 and week 12, mean 4.6, SD 6.7;\n                P\n                <.001). EMA-derived and survey-based CPD measurements were positively correlated (\n                r\n                =0.73, 95% CI 0.6-0.82) as were measures of craving (\n                r\n                =0.38, 95% CI 0.17-0.56). No significant paired difference in CPD was observed between EMA measurements and surveys. A significant effect of time on CPD EMA data (incidence rate ratio [IRR] 1-week change 0.93;\n                P\n                <.01) and survey data was found (IRR 12-week change 0.36;\n                P\n                <.01). However, the treatment effect was not significant, which aligned with the RR results. An increase in the EC consumption was observed over time in the EC arm, with 12.1% (7/58) fully switched to EC (defined as CPD=0 and EC use>0) and 20.7% (12/58) mostly switched (defined as a reduction in CPD>75% and EC use>0) in week 12.\n              \n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              EMA is a suitable method to collect recall-based smoking-related data. Though results from mixed effect modeling and RR comparisons were similar using EMA or survey data, EMA provides unique advantages, namely greater granularity in the time and the capability to detect switching patterns in near real time. These findings provide the feasibility of using EMA in developing smoking cessation interventions in future tobacco harm reduction research.",

This trend study aimed to examine the effects of race/ethnicity and the intersecting effects of race/ethnicity with other marginalized identities related to gender, income, education, and occupation on the first- and second-level digital divide.\n            \n            \n              Research Design and Methods\n              Utilizing a nationally representative sample of older community dwellers from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, we conducted weighted logistic regressions at 3 time points (2011/2013, 2015, and 2019).

      "abstract": "Background\n              Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is one of the leading causes of death in pediatric patients. Continued recruitment of pediatric TBI participants into a biobank amidst the COVID-19 pandemic not only necessitates adaptive changes to traditional recruitment methods but also requires an evaluation of emergency department (ED) utilization by TBI-presenting patients.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The primary objective of this exploratory retrospective study was to evaluate pediatric TBI-related ED utilization during the pandemic. The secondary objective was to appraise the efficacy of the research team’s internal screening processes.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Potential participants (ie, individuals who met all inclusion criteria and would be approached by a consenter) were screened from an ED’s electronic health record system. Data regarding their visit were recorded in a Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act–compliant manner, which were cleaned through Google Sheets. Cleaned data were then coded as either a screening variable or a hospital utilization variable to examine the effects of the pandemic on internal operations and hospital utilization patterns. The variables were compared between select months during the pandemic in 2020 to analogous months in 2019 in the R programming language via the two-sample Student t test and the Mann-Whitney-Wilcoxon rank-sum test.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The sample (N=2321) consisted of 1245 entries from 2019 and 1076 entries from 2020. A significantly greater proportion of potential participants (P<.001) were identified in 2020 (222/633, 35.1%) than in 2019 (195/908, 21.4%). A significantly greater proportion of potential participants (P<.001) had a visit reason indicative of a TBI in 2020 (181/222, 81.5%) than in 2019 (103/195, 52.8%). A significantly greater proportion of these injuries (P=.02) occurred inside (39/181, 21.5%) in 2020 than in 2019 (11/103, 10.7%). No significant difference was found across the mechanism of injury categories reported for potential participants between 2019 and 2020. Potential participants were significantly older (P=.006) in 2019 (mean 8.93 years) than in 2020 (mean 7.31 years). Screeners spent significantly longer (P=.03) to identify potential participants in March 2020 (55 minutes) than in March 2019 (32 minutes), but spent significantly less time (P=.01) to do so in July 2020 (22 minutes) than in July 2019 (42 minutes). Screening coverage was significantly lower (P<.001) in March 2020 (241.8 hours) than in March 2019 (346.5 hours). Screening coverage was significantly greater (P<.001) in April 2020 (611.5 hours) and July 2020 (513.5 hours) than in April 2019 (470.5 hours) and July 2019 (404.3 hours), respectively.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              There was a significant increase in the rate of incoming TBI cases to the ED during the COVID-19 pandemic, warranting continued enrollment with added safety measures. Additionally, refinement of internal processes improved the accuracy of data collection. As demonstrated in this study, researchers can leverage ongoing data collection to facilitate process improvements and evaluate the impact of unexpected global events on their research.",

Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) have shown that text messaging helps people to lose weight, but the effectiveness of interventions varies between studies. Thus, this review aimed to (1) identify RCTs that used text messages for overweight management, (2) identify components of the interventions, and (3) test their effectiveness. PubMed, Web of Science, ProQuest, and Scopus databases were searched to identify relevant studies. Quality scores for selected articles were assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) critical appraisal tools for interventional studies. The effectiveness of the interventions was tested using random effect models. Twelve studies that met inclusion criteria were included in this review. Ten of the included studies reported that text message interventions had a significant effect on weight loss. The pooled mean difference in body mass index (BMI) change after the intervention was −0.43 kg/m\n              2\n              (95% confidence interval, − 0.63 to – 0.23 kg/m\n              2\n              ). Synthesis of the included studies provides evidence that (1) regular text messages; (2) interventions targeting weight monitoring, diet habit, and physical activity; and (3) the use of behavior change techniques led to significant weight loss.",

      "abstract": "Sepsis is considered a medical emergency where delays in initial treatment are associated with increased morbidity and mortality, yet there is no gold standard for identifying sepsis onset and thus treatment timing. We leverage electronic health record (EHR) data with clinical expertise to develop a continuous-time Markov decision process (MDP) optimal stopping model that identifies the optimal first intervention action (anti-infective, fluid, or wait). To study the impact of initial treatment of patients at risk for developing sepsis, we define the delayed treatment population who received delayed treatment upon admission or during hospitalization and serves as an approximation of the natural history of sepsis. We apply the optimal first treatment policy to sample patient visits from the nondelayed treatment population. This analysis indicates the average risk of death could be reduced by approximately 2.2%, the average time until treatment could be reduced by 106 minutes, and the average severity of the treatment state could be reduced by 15.5% compared with the treatment they received in the hospital. We study the properties of the optimal policy to define an easily interpretable initial treatment heuristic that considers a patient’s organ dysfunction, location, and septic shock status. This generalizable framework can inform personalized treatment of patients at risk for sepsis.\n            History: This paper has been accepted for the Decision Analysis Special Issue on Emerging Topics in Health Decision Analysis.\n            Funding: This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation [Grant 1522107 (North Carolina State University), 1522106 (Mayo Clinic), and 1833538 (Drexel University)].",

However, the nature of current multi-touch tabletops to detect and react to all forms of touch, including unintentional touches, impedes users from acting naturally on them. In our research, we leverage gaze direction, head orientation and screen contact data to identify and filter out unintentional touches, so that users can take full advantage of the physical properties of an interactive tabletop, e.g., resting hands or leaning on the tabletop during the interaction. To achieve this, we first conducted a user study to identify behavioral pattern differences (gaze, head and touch) between completing usual tasks on digital versus physical tabletops. We then compiled our findings into five types of spatiotemporal features, and train a machine learning model to recognize unintentional touches with an F1 score of 91.3%, outperforming the state-of-the-art model by 4.3%. Finally we evaluated our algorithm in a real-time filtering system. A user study shows that our algorithm is stable and the improved tabletop effectively screens out unintentional touches, and provide more relaxing and natural user experience. By linking their gaze and head behavior to their touch behavior, our work sheds light on the possibility of future tabletop technology to improve the understanding of users' input intention.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n            \n              Background\n              Generative artificial intelligence (AI)—particularly large language models (LLMs)—has generated unprecedented interest in applications ranging from everyday questions and answers to health-related inquiries. However, little is known about how everyday users decide whether to trust and adopt these technologies in high-stakes contexts such as personal health.\n            \n            \n              Objectives\n              This study examines how ease of use, perceived usefulness, and risk perception interact to shape user trust in and intentions to adopt DeepSeek, an emerging LLM-based platform, for health care purposes.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We adapted survey items from validated technology acceptance scales to assess user perception of DeepSeek. A 12-item Likert scale questionnaire was developed and pilot-tested (n=20). It was then distributed on the web to users in India, the United Kingdom, and the United States who had used DeepSeek within the past 2 weeks. Data analysis involved descriptive frequency assessments and Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling. The model assessed direct and indirect effects, including potential quadratic relationships.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 556 complete responses were collected, with respondents almost evenly split across India (n=184), the United Kingdom (n=185), and the United States (n=187). Regarding AI in health care, when asked whether they were comfortable with their health care provider using AI tools, 59.3% (n=330) were fine with AI use provided their doctor verified its output, and 31.5% (n=175) were enthusiastic about its use without conditions. DeepSeek was used primarily for academic and educational purposes, 50.7% (n=282) used DeepSeek as a search engine, and 47.7% (n=265) used it for health-related queries. When asked about their intent to adopt DeepSeek over other LLMs such as ChatGPT, 52.1% (n=290) were likely to switch, and 28.9% (n=161) were very likely to do so. The study revealed that trust plays a pivotal mediating role; ease of use exerts a significant indirect impact on usage intentions through trust. At the same time, perceived usefulness contributes to trust development and direct adoption. By contrast, risk perception negatively affects usage intent, emphasizing the importance of robust data governance and transparency. Significant nonlinear paths were observed for ease of use and risk, indicating threshold or plateau effects.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Users are receptive to DeepSeek when it is easy to use, useful, and trustworthy. The model highlights trust as a mediator and shows nonlinear dynamics shaping AI-driven health care tool adoption. Expanding the model with mediators such as privacy and cultural differences could provide deeper insights. Longitudinal experimental designs could establish causality. Further investigation into threshold and plateau phenomena could refine our understanding of user perceptions as they become more familiar with AI-driven health care tools.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, preoperative care, also termed prehabilitation, has become increasingly relevant due to the decreasing functional and psychosocial health of patients with cancer, which is a result of the pandemic restrictions. Concurrently, access to telehealth has improved; telehealth comprises all remote care delivery facilitated by information technologies (ie, virtually).\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The aim of this protocol is to describe the rationale and methodology for a major trial investigating the feasibility and safety of multimodal virtual prehabilitation services (ie, teleprehabilitation).\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              This single-arm feasibility trial aims to recruit 100 patients with cancer to receive teleprehabilitation throughout their preoperative period. The inclusion criteria are as follows: (1) 18 years of age or older, (2) scheduled for elective cancer surgery and referred by a surgeon, (3) medically cleared by the referring physician to engage in physical activity, and (4) have a good comprehension of the English or French language. Feasibility will be assessed by documenting recruitment, adherence, and retention rates, in addition to patients’ motives for not participating in the trial, low participation, or discontinuation. The secondary outcome of safety will be assessed by reporting program-related adverse events.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The Montreal General Hospital Foundation funded the project in August 2020. The protocol was then approved by the Research Ethics Board of the McGill University Health Centre in January 2021 (ID No. 2021-6730). The first patient was recruited in March 2021, and recruitment is expected to end in September 2022. As of March 2022, 36 patients have been recruited, including 24 who have completed their participation. No adverse events have been reported. Data collection is expected to conclude in November 2022. Data analysis will be performed, and the results will be published by the beginning of 2023.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This trial will provide guidance on the use of telehealth in the administration of prehabilitation services. The trial will provide a large amount of information that will respond to gaps in the literature, as there are minimal reports on the use of telehealth rehabilitation and prehabilitation services among elderly populations and in acute contexts, such as the preoperative period.\n            \n            \n              Trial Registration\n              ClinicalTrials.gov NCT0479956; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04799561\n            \n            \n              International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID)\n              DERR1-10.2196/29936",

      "abstract": "The effectiveness of healthy eating nudges in field settings increases as they shift from focusing on influencing cognition to affect to behavior.\n          , \n            We examine the effectiveness in field settings of seven healthy eating nudges, classified according to whether they are (1) cognitively oriented, such as “descriptive nutritional labeling,” “evaluative nutritional labeling,” or “visibility enhancements”; (2) affectively oriented, such as “hedonic enhancements or “healthy eating calls”; or (3) behaviorally oriented, such as “convenience enhancements” or “size enhancements.” Our multivariate, three-level meta-analysis of 299 effect sizes, controlling for eating behavior, population, and study characteristics, yields a standardized mean difference (Cohen’s d) of 0.23 (equivalent to −124 kcal/day). Effect sizes increase as the focus of the nudges shifts from cognition (d = 0.12, −64 kcal) to affect (d = 0.24, −129 kcal) to behavior (d = 0.39, −209 kcal). Interventions are more effective at reducing unhealthy eating than increasing healthy eating or reducing total eating. Effect sizes are larger in the United States than in other countries, in restaurants or cafeterias than in grocery stores, and in studies including a control group. Effect sizes are similar for food selection versus consumption and for children versus adults and are independent of study duration. Compared with the typical nudge study (d = 0.12), one implementing the best nudge scenario can expect a sixfold increase in effectiveness (to d = 0.74) with half the result of switching from cognitively oriented to behaviorally oriented nudges.",

      "abstract": "Framing health messages systematically in terms of either gains or losses influences the behaviors that people adopt. Rothman and Salovey proposed that the relative influence of gain-and loss-framed messages is contingent on people’s perception of the risk or uncertainty associated with adopting the recommended behavior. Specifically, loss-framed messages are more effective when promoting illness-detecting (screening) behaviors, but gain-framed messages are more effective when promoting health-affirming (prevention) behaviors. Two experiments provide a direct test of this conceptual framework. In Experiment 1, participants’ willingness to act after reading about a new disease was a function of how the information was framed and the type of behavior promoted. Experiment 2 replicated and extended these findings with a real health concern—gum disease. Gain-framed pamphlets heightened interest in a plaque-fighting mouth rinse, whereas loss-framed pamphlets heightened interest in a plaque-detecting disclosing rinse. Research on message framing provides a theoretically based guide for the development of effective health messages.",

      "abstract": "Theories about health behavior are commonly used in public health and often frame problems as ascribed or related to individuals’ actions or inaction. This framing suggests that poor health occurs because individuals are unable or unwilling to heed preventive messages or recommended treatment actions. The recent United Nations call for strategies to reduce the global disease burden of noncommunicable diseases like diabetes requires a reassessment of individual-based approaches to behavior change. We argue that public health and health behavior intervention should focus more on culture than behavior to achieve meaningful and sustainable change resulting in positive health outcomes. To change negative health behaviors, one must first identify and promote positive health behaviors within the cultural logic of its contexts. To illustrate these points, we discuss stigma associated with obesity and human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immune deficiency syndrome. We conclude that focusing on positive behaviors and sustaining cultural and personal transformations requires a culturally grounded approach to public health interventions, such as that provided by the PEN-3 model.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              To date, several medication adherence apps have been developed. However, the existing apps have been developed without involving relevant stakeholders and were not subjected to mobile health app guidelines. In addition, the usability and utility of these apps have not been tested with end users.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aimed to describe the usability and utility testing of a newly developed medication adherence app—Med Assist—among ambulatory care patients in Malaysia.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              The Med Assist app was developed based on the Theory of Planned Behavior and the Nielson usability model. Beta testing was conducted from March to May 2016 at a primary care clinic in Kuala Lumpur. Ambulatory care patients who scored ≥40% on the electronic health literacy scale, were aged ≥21 years, and were taking two or more long-term medications were recruited. Two rounds of in-depth interviews were conducted with each participant. The first interview, which was conducted upon participant recruitment, was to assess the usability of Med Assist. Participants were asked to download Med Assist on their phone and perform two tasks (register themselves on Med Assist and enter at least one medication). Participants were encouraged to “concurrently think aloud” when using Med Assist, while nonverbal cues were observed and recorded. The participants were then invited for a second interview (conducted ≥7 days after the first interview) to assess the utility of Med Assist after using the app for 1 week. This was done using “retrospective probing” based on a topic guide developed for utilities that could improve medication adherence.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Usability and utility testing was performed for the Med Assist app (version P4). A total of 13 participants were recruited (6 men, 7 women) for beta testing. Three themes emerged from the usability testing, while three themes emerged from the utility testing. From the usability testing, participants found Med Assist easy to use and user friendly, as they were able to complete the tasks given to them. However, the details required when adding a new medication were found to be confusing despite displaying information in a hierarchical order. Participants who were caregivers as well as patients found the multiple-user support and pill buddy utility useful. This suggests that Med Assist may improve the medication adherence of patients on multiple long-term medications.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The usability and utility testing of Med Assist with end users made the app more patient centered in ambulatory care. From the usability testing, the overall design and layout of Med Assist were simple and user friendly enough for participants to navigate through the app and add a new medication. From the participants’ perspectives, Med Assist was a useful and reliable tool with the potential to improve medication adherence. In addition, utilities such as multiple user support and a medication refill reminder encouraged improved medication management.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              The year 2020 has been challenging for many, particularly for young adults who have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic. Emerging adulthood is a developmental phase with significant changes in the patterns of daily living; it is a risky phase for the onset of major mental illness. College students during the pandemic face significant risk, potentially losing several protective factors (eg, housing, routine, social support, job, and financial security) that are stabilizing for mental health and physical well-being. Individualized multiple assessments of mental health, referred to as multimodal personal chronicles, present an opportunity to examine indicators of health in an ongoing and personalized way using mobile sensing devices and wearable internet of things.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              To assess the feasibility and provide an in-depth examination of the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on college students through multimodal personal chronicles, we present a case study of an individual monitored using a longitudinal subjective and objective assessment approach over a 9-month period throughout 2020, spanning the prepandemic period of January through September.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              The individual, referred to as Lee, completed psychological assessments measuring depression, anxiety, and loneliness across 4 time points in January, April, June, and September. We used the data emerging from the multimodal personal chronicles (ie, heart rate, sleep, physical activity, affect, behaviors) in relation to psychological assessments to understand patterns that help to explicate changes in the individual’s psychological well-being across the pandemic.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Over the course of the pandemic, Lee’s depression severity was highest in April, shortly after shelter-in-place orders were mandated. His depression severity remained mildly severe throughout the rest of the months. Associations in positive and negative affect, physiology, sleep, and physical activity patterns varied across time periods. Lee’s positive affect and negative affect were positively correlated in April (r=0.53, P=.04) whereas they were negatively correlated in September (r=–0.57, P=.03). Only in the month of January was sleep negatively associated with negative affect (r=–0.58, P=.03) and diurnal beats per minute (r=–0.54, P=.04), and then positively associated with heart rate variability (resting root mean square of successive differences between normal heartbeats) (r=0.54, P=.04). When looking at his available contextual data, Lee noted certain situations as supportive coping factors and other situations as potential stressors.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              We observed more pandemic concerns in April and noticed other contextual events relating to this individual’s well-being, reflecting how college students continue to experience life events during the pandemic. The rich monitoring data alongside contextual data may be beneficial for clinicians to understand client experiences and offer personalized treatment plans. We discuss benefits as well as future directions of this system, and the conclusions we can draw regarding the links between the COVID-19 pandemic and college student mental health.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Engagement is essential for the effectiveness of digital behavior change interventions. Existing systematic reviews examining hypertension self-management interventions via mobile apps have primarily focused on intervention efficacy and app usability. Engagement in the prevention or management of hypertension is largely unknown.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This systematic review explores the definition and role of engagement in hypertension-focused mobile health (mHealth) interventions, as well as how determinants of engagement (ie, tailoring and interactivity) have been implemented.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A systematic review of mobile app interventions for hypertension self-management targeting adults, published from 2013 to 2020, was conducted. A total of 21 studies were included in this systematic review.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The engagement was defined or operationalized as a microlevel concept, operationalized as interaction with the interventions (ie, frequency of engagement, time or duration of engagement with the program, and intensity of engagement). For all 3 studies that tested the relationship, increased engagement was associated with better biomedical outcomes (eg, blood pressure change). Interactivity was limited in digital behavior change interventions, as only 7 studies provided 2-way communication between users and a health care professional, and 9 studies provided 1-way communication in possible critical conditions; that is, when abnormal blood pressure values were recorded, users or health care professionals were notified. The tailoring of interventions varied at different aspects, from the tailoring of intervention content (including goals, patient education, advice and feedback from health professionals, reminders, and motivational messages) to the tailoring of intervention dose and communication mode. Tailoring was carried out in a number of ways, considering patient characteristics such as goals, preferences, disease characteristics (eg, hypertension stage and medication list), disease self-management experience levels, medication adherence rate, and values and beliefs.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Available studies support the importance of engagement in intervention effectiveness as well as the essential roles of patient factors in tailoring, interactivity, and engagement. A patient-centered engagement framework for hypertension self-management using mHealth technology is proposed here, with the intent of facilitating intervention design and disease self-management using mHealth technology.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Knee osteoarthritis is a chronic condition with no known cure. Treatment focuses on symptom management, with exercise recommended as a core component by all clinical practice guidelines. However, long-term adherence to exercise is poor among many people with knee osteoarthritis, which limits its capacity to provide sustained symptom relief. To improve exercise outcomes, scalable interventions that facilitate exercise adherence are needed. SMS (short message service) interventions show promise in health behavior change. The Behavior Change Wheel (BCW) is a widely used framework that provides a structured approach to designing behavior change interventions and has been used extensively in health behavior change intervention design.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The study aimed to describe the development of, and rationale for, an SMS program to support exercise adherence in people with knee osteoarthritis using the BCW framework.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              The intervention was developed in two phases. Phase 1 involved using the BCW to select the target behavior and associated barriers, facilitators, and behavior change techniques (BCTs). Phase 2 involved design of the program functionality and message library. Messages arranged into a 24-week schedule were provided to an external company to be developed into an automated SMS program.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The target behavior was identified as participation in self-directed home-based strengthening exercise 3 times a week for 24 weeks. A total of 13 barriers and 9 facilitators of the behavior and 20 BCTs were selected to use in the intervention. In addition, 198 SMS text messages were developed and organized into a 24-week automated program that functions by prompting users to self-report the number of home exercise sessions completed each week. Users who reported ≥3 exercise sessions/week (adherent) received positive reinforcement messages. Users who reported &lt;3 exercise sessions/week (nonadherent) were asked to select a barrier (from a list of standardized response options) that best explains why they found performing the exercises challenging in the previous week. This automatically triggers an SMS containing a BCT suggestion relevant to overcoming the selected barrier. Users also received BCT messages to facilitate exercise adherence, irrespective of self-reported adherence.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This study demonstrates application of the BCW to guide development of an automated SMS intervention to support exercise adherence in knee osteoarthritis. Future research is needed to assess whether the intervention improves adherence to the prescribed home-based strengthening exercise.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n            \n              Gamification, the application of gaming elements to increase enjoyment and engagement, has the potential to improve the effectiveness of digital health interventions, while the effectiveness of competition gamification components remains poorly understood on residency. To address this gap, we evaluate the effect of smartphone-based gamified team competition intervention on daily step count and sleep duration via a micro-randomized trial on medical interns. Our aim is to assess potential improvements in the factors (namely step count and sleep) that may help interns cope with stress and improve well-being. In 1779 interns, team competition intervention significantly increases the mean daily step count by 105.8 steps (SE 35.8,\n              p\n               = 0.03) relative to the no competition arm, while does not significantly affect the mean daily sleep minutes (\n              p\n               = 0.76). Moderator analyses indicate that the causal effects of competition on daily step count and sleep minutes decreased by 14.5 steps (SE 10.2,\n              p\n               = 0.16) and 1.9 minutes (SE 0.6,\n              p\n               = 0.003) for each additional week-in-study, respectively. Intra-institutional competition negatively moderates the causal effect of competition upon daily step count by −90.3 steps (SE 86.5,\n              p\n               = 0.30). Our results show that gamified team competition delivered via mobile app significantly increases daily physical activity which suggests that team competition can function as a mobile health intervention tool to increase short-term physical activity levels for medical interns. Future improvements in strategies of forming competition opponents and introducing occasional competition breaks may improve the overall effectiveness.",

A purposive sample of experts specialized in out-of-hours unplanned care and/or older persons across Belgium were recruited as panelists. Eligibility criteria included experts with at least 2 years of relevant experience. Level of consensus was defined to be reached when at least 70% of the panelists agreed or disagreed regarding the value of each item proposed within a survey for the top 10 most frequently used protocols for triaging older adults. Responses were analyzed over several rounds until expert consensus was found. Descriptive and thematic analyses were used to aggregate responses.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              \n                N\n                 = 12 panelists agreed that several important missing protocol topics were not covered by the existing OOH-TT service.

Furthermore, panelists also stressed the importance of considering feasibility in implementing protocols within the real-world setting and prioritizing the right type of training for operators which can facilitate the delivery of high-quality triage. Overall, consensus was found for nine of the top 10 most frequently used protocols for triaging older adults with no consensus found for the protocol on triaging patients unwell for no apparent reason.\n              \n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              Our findings show that overall, a combination of patient related factors must be addressed to provide high quality triage for adults seeking non-urgent unplanned care over the telephone (in addition to age). However, further elements such as appropriate operator training and feasibility of implementing more population-specific protocols must also be considered. This study presents a useful step towards identifying key items which must be targeted within the larger scope of providing non-urgent out-of-hours telephone triage services for older adults seeking non-urgent unplanned care.",

      "abstract": "Introduction\n              Depression and diabetes are highly disabling diseases with a high prevalence and high rate of comorbidity, particularly in low-income ethnic minority patients. Though comorbidity increases the risk of adverse outcomes and mortality, most clinical interventions target these diseases separately. Increasing physical activity might be effective to simultaneously lower depressive symptoms and improve glycaemic control. Self-management apps are a cost-effective, scalable and easy access treatment to increase physical activity. However, cutting-edge technological applications often do not reach vulnerable populations and are not tailored to an individual’s behaviour and characteristics. Tailoring of interventions using machine learning methods likely increases the effectiveness of the intervention.\n            \n            \n              Methods and analysis\n              In a three-arm randomised controlled trial, we will examine the effect of a text-messaging smartphone application to encourage physical activity in low-income ethnic minority patients with comorbid diabetes and depression. The adaptive intervention group receives messages chosen from different messaging banks by a reinforcement learning algorithm. The uniform random intervention group receives the same messages, but chosen from the messaging banks with equal probabilities. The control group receives a weekly mood message. We aim to recruit 276 adults from primary care clinics aged 18–75 years who have been diagnosed with current diabetes and show elevated depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale-8 (PHQ-8) >5). We will compare passively collected daily step counts, self-report PHQ-8 and most recent haemoglobin A1c from medical records at baseline and at intervention completion at 6-month follow-up.\n            \n            \n              Ethics and dissemination\n              The Institutional Review Board at the University of California San Francisco approved this study (IRB: 17-22608).

Known as MUST diabetes awareness program, patients were included if they had diabetes, owned a mobile phone, and could read SMS messages or lived with someone that could read for them. Intervention patients received daily messages and weekly reminders addressing various diabetes care categories. We expected greater improvement in their glycemic control compared to controls who only received paper-based educational material. The primary outcome was the change in HbA1c, measured by the difference between endpoint and baseline values and by the number of patients who experienced at least 1% reduction from baseline to endpoint. Key secondary outcomes included blood glucose levels, body weight, treatment and medication adherence, self-efficacy, and diabetes knowledge. Data were analyzed using ANCOVA, chi-square, and t-tests.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              \n                Thirty four intervention and 39 control patients completed the study. Over 12 weeks, 3880 messages were sent. Each intervention patient received 84 educational and 12 reminder messages plus one welcome message. Our primary outcome did not differ significantly (Δ 0.290; 95% CI -0.402 to 0.983;\n                p\n                 = 0.406) between groups after 3 months, demonstrating a mean drop of −0.69% and −1.05% in the control and intervention group respectively. However, 16 intervention patients achieved the targeted 1% drop versus only 6 controls, suggesting clear association between study group and 1% HbA1c reductions (chi-square = 8.655; df = 1;\n                p\n                 = 0.003). Secondary outcomes seemed in favor of intervention patients at endpoint, with considerable improvements in treatment and medication adherence, self-efficacy, and knowledge scores. Participants also indicated full satisfaction with the program.\n              \n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              SMS education is a feasible and acceptable method for improving glycemic control and self-management behaviors among Egyptian diabetics. However, whether it is more effective than traditional paper-based methods needs further investigation.\n            \n            \n              Trial registration\n              \n                ClinicalTrials.gov\n                NCT02868320\n                .

      "abstract": "With thousands of mobile health (mHealth) solutions on the market, patients and health care providers struggle to identify which solution to use and prescribe. The lack of evidence-based mHealth solutions may be because of limited research on intervention development and the continued use of traditional research methods for mHealth evaluation. The Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) is a framework that aids in developing interventions that produce the best-expected outcomes (ie, effectiveness), given constraints imposed on affordability, scalability, and efficiency (also known as achieving intervention EASE). The preparation phase of the MOST highlights the importance of formative intervention development—a stage often overlooked and rarely published. The aim of the preparation phase of the MOST is to identify candidate intervention components, create a conceptual model, and define the optimization objective. Although the MOST sets these 3 targets, no guidance is provided on how to conduct quality research within the preparation phase and what specific steps can be taken to identify potential intervention components, develop the conceptual model, and achieve intervention EASE with the implementation context in mind. To advance the applicability of the MOST within the field of implementation science, this study provides an account of the methods used to develop an mHealth intervention using the MOST. Specifically, we provide an example of how to achieve the goals of the preparation phase by outlining the formative development of an mHealth-prompting intervention within a diabetes prevention program. In addition, recommendations are proposed for future researchers to consider when conducting formative research on mHealth interventions with implementation in mind. Given its considerable reach, mHealth has the potential to positively affect public health by decreasing implementation costs and improving accessibility. The MOST is well-suited for the efficient development and optimization of mHealth interventions. By using an implementation-focused lens and outlining the steps in developing an mHealth intervention using the preparation phase of the MOST, this study may guide future intervention developers toward maximizing the impact of mHealth outside academia.",

The adoption of LLM technology into medical education and training has varied, and little empirical evidence exists to support its use in clinical teaching environments.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The aim of the study is to identify and qualitatively evaluate potential use cases and limitations of LLM technology for real-time ward-based educational contexts.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A brief, single-site exploratory evaluation of the publicly available ChatGPT-3.5 (OpenAI) was conducted by implementing the tool into the daily attending rounds of a general internal medicine inpatient service at a large urban academic medical center. ChatGPT was integrated into rounds via both structured and organic use, using the web-based “chatbot” style interface to interact with the LLM through conversational free-text and discrete queries. A qualitative approach using phenomenological inquiry was used to identify key insights related to the use of ChatGPT through analysis of ChatGPT conversation logs and associated shorthand notes from the clinical sessions.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Identified use cases for ChatGPT integration included addressing medical knowledge gaps through discrete medical knowledge inquiries, building differential diagnoses and engaging dual-process thinking, challenging medical axioms, using cognitive aids to support acute care decision-making, and improving complex care management by facilitating conversations with subspecialties. Potential additional uses included engaging in difficult conversations with patients, exploring ethical challenges and general medical ethics teaching, personal continuing medical education resources, developing ward-based teaching tools, supporting and automating clinical documentation, and supporting productivity and task management. LLM biases, misinformation, ethics, and health equity were identified as areas of concern and potential limitations to clinical and training use. A code of conduct on ethical and appropriate use was also developed to guide team usage on the wards.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Overall, ChatGPT offers a novel tool to enhance ward-based learning through rapid information querying, second-order content exploration, and engaged team discussion regarding generated responses. More research is needed to fully understand contexts for educational use, particularly regarding the risks and limitations of the tool in clinical settings and its impacts on trainee development.",

Whether or not tobacco's pro‐atherosclerotic effect is influenced by alcohol consumption is unknown. We aimed to estimate the impact of alcohol intake on the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis in femoral arteries in smoking and non‐smoking middle‐aged men.\n            \n            \n              Design, Setting and Participants\n              Cross‐sectional analysis of a subset of the Aragon Workers Health Study (AWHS), comprising 2099 men with mean age 50.9 years without previous cardiovascular disease.\n            \n            \n              Measurements\n              The presence of plaques in femoral arteries was assessed by high‐resolution sonography. Self‐reported alcohol consumption over the previous year was measured with a food frequency questionnaire. The sample was divided into four groups according to their daily grams of alcohol consumption ≤ 1 (abstainers), ≥ 2 to < 30, ≥ 30 to < 60 and ≥ 60 g/day. Participants were divided on ever‐smoking (current and former) versus never‐smoking strata in the main analysis.\n            \n            \n              Findings\n              \n                We did not find a significant association between the different levels of alcohol intake and the likelihood of developing femoral artery atherosclerosis in never‐smokers. Ever‐smoking was positively associated with femoral atherosclerosis overall [odds ratio (OR) = 3.00; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.40, 3.74;\n                P\n                 < 0.001] and within each level of alcohol consumption.

However, among these ever‐smokers, atherosclerosis prevalence was still higher than among never‐smokers who consumed alcohol in the same amount (2 g/day or more but less than 30 g/day) (OR = 2.73; 95% CI = 2.07, 3.61;\n                P\n                 < 0.001).\n              \n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Among middle‐aged men, moderate alcohol consumption appears to be associated with lower prevalence of femoral artery subclinical atherosclerosis compared with alcohol abstinence only in ever‐smokers.",

Eligibility criteria included English or Spanish language preference and a documented diagnosis of diabetes and elevated depression symptoms. The trial had 3 arms: a Control group receiving a weekly mood monitoring message, a Random messaging group receiving randomly selected feedback and motivational text messages daily, and an Adaptive messaging group receiving text messages selected by a reinforcement learning algorithm daily. Randomization was performed with a 1:1:1 allocation. The primary outcome, changes in daily step counts, was passively collected via a mobile app. The primary analysis assessed changes in daily step count using a linear mixed-effects model. An a priori subanalysis compared the primary step count outcome within recruitment samples.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              In total, 168 participants were analyzed, including those with 24% (40/168) Spanish language preference and 37.5% (63/168) from clinic-based recruitment. The results of the linear mixed-effects model indicated that participants in the Adaptive arm cumulatively gained an average of 3.6 steps each day (95% CI 2.45-4.78; P<.001) over the 24-week intervention (average of 608 total steps), whereas both the Control and Random arm participants had significantly decreased rates of change. Postintervention estimates suggest that participants in the Adaptive messaging arm showed a significant step count increase of 19% (606/3197; P<.001), in contrast to 1.6% (59/3698) and 3.9% (136/3480) step count increase in the Random and Control arms, respectively. Intervention effectiveness differences were observed between participants recruited from the San Francisco clinics and those recruited via web-based platforms, with the significant step count trend persisting across both samples for participants in the Adaptive group.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Our study supports the use of reinforcement learning algorithms for personalizing text messaging interventions to increase physical activity in a diverse sample of people with diabetes and depression.

First, we describe the development and validation (\n              N\n               = 215) of a questionnaire to measure individual susceptibility to different social influence strategies. To evaluate the external validity of this Susceptibility to Persuasion Scale (STPS) we set up a two week text-messaging intervention that used text messages implementing social influence strategies as prompts to reduce snacking behavior. In this experiment (\n              N\n               = 73) we show that messages that are personalized (tailored) to the individual based on their scores on the STPS, lead to a higher decrease in snacking consumption than randomized messages or messages that are not tailored (contra-tailored) to the individual. We discuss the importance of this finding for the design of persuasive systems and detail how designers can use tailoring at the level of social influence strategies to increase the effects of their persuasive technologies.",

      "abstract": "Background Motivational interviewing is a type of counselling that can be used to help people to stop smoking. It aims to help people explore the reasons that they may feel unsure about quitting and find ways to make them feel more willing and able to stop smoking. Rather than telling the person why and how they should change their behaviour, counsellors try to help people to choose to change their own behaviour, increasing their confidence that they can succeed. This review explores whether motivational interviewing helps more people to stop smoking than no treatment, or other types of stop smoking treatment. It also looks at whether longer motivational interviewing, with more counselling sessions, helps more people to quit than shorter motivational interviewing with fewer sessions. Study characteristics This review included 37 trials covering over 15,000 people who smoked tobacco. Studies were conducted in a lot of different types of people, including people with health problems or drug use problems, young people, homeless people, and people who had been arrested or were in prison. Some people felt ready to quit smoking and others did not. Motivational interviewing was provided in one to 12 sessions and took from as little as five minutes, to as much as eight hours, to deliver. Studies lasted for at least six months. The evidence is up to date to August 2018. Key results There was not enough information available to decide whether motivational interviewing helped more people to stop smoking than no stop smoking treatment. People were slightly more likely to stop smoking if they were provided with motivational interviewing rather than another type of treatment to stop smoking, but our findings suggest that there is still a chance that motivational interviewing could also reduce a person's chances of quitting compared with other stop smoking treatments. This means more research is needed to decide whether motivational interviewing can help more people to quit than other types of treatment. Using longer motivational interviewing with more treatment sessions may help more people to give up smoking than shorter motivational interviewing with fewer sessions, however more research is needed to be sure that this is the case. We also looked at whether being provided with motivational interviewing to quit smoking increased people's well‐being. Most studies did not provide any information about this, and so more studies are needed to answer this question. Quality of the evidence There is low‐quality evidence looking at whether motivational interviewing helps more people to quit smoking than no treatment. This means it is difficult to know whether motivational interviewing helps people to quit smoking or not, and more studies are needed. The quality of the evidence was also low for all of the other questions we asked about quitting smoking, which means that our findings may change when new research is carried out. The quality of the research is rated as low because there were problems with the design of studies, findings of studies were very different to one another, and there were not enough data, making it difficult to determine whether motivational interviewing or more intense motivational interviewing helped people to quit smoking or not.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Although many pain-related smartphone apps exist, little attention has been given to understanding how these apps are used over time and what factors contribute to greater compliance and patient engagement.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This retrospective analysis was designed to help identify factors that predicted the benefits and future use of a smartphone pain app among patients with chronic pain.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              An app designed for both Android and iOS devices was developed by Brigham and Women’s Hospital Pain Management Center (BWH-PMC) for users with chronic pain to assess and monitor pain and communicate with their providers. The pain app offered chronic pain assessment, push notification reminders and communication, personalized goal setting, relaxation sound files, topics of interest with psychological and medical pain management strategies, and line graphs from daily assessments. BWH-PMC recruited 253 patients with chronic pain over time to use the pain app. All subjects completed baseline measures and were asked to record their progress every day using push notification daily assessments. After 3 months, participants completed follow-up questionnaires and answered satisfaction questions. We defined the number of completed daily assessments as a measure of patient engagement with the pain app.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The average age of participants was 51.5 years (SD 13.7, range 18-92), 72.8% (182/253) were female, and 36.8% (78/212) reported the low back as their primary pain site. The number of daily assessments ranged from 1 to 426 (average 62.0, SD 49.9). The app was easy to introduce among patients, and it was well accepted. Those who completed more daily assessments (greater patient engagement) throughout the study were more likely to report higher pain intensity, more activity interference, and greater disability and were generally overweight compared with others. Patients with higher engagement with the app rated the app as offering greater benefit in coping with their pain and expressed more willingness to use the app in the future (P<.05) compared with patients showing lower engagement. Patients completing a small number of daily assessments reported less pain intensity, less daily activity interference, and less pain-related disability on average and were less likely to use the two-way messaging than those who were more engaged with the pain app (P<.05).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Patients with chronic pain who appeared to manage their pain better were less likely to report benefits of a smartphone pain app designed for chronic pain management. They demonstrated lower patient engagement in reporting their daily progress, in part, owing to the perceived burden of regularly using an app without a perceived benefit. An intrinsically different pain app designed and targeted for individuals based on early identification of user characteristics and adapted for each individual would likely improve compliance and app-related patient engagement.",

Twelve databases were searched systematically for experimental studies with predefined choice architecture interventions in the period of\n              J\n              une 2011–\n              M\n              arch 2012. The 12 included studies were grouped according to type of interventions and underwent a narrative synthesis. The evidence indicates that (i) health labelling at point of purchase is associated with healthier food choice, while (ii) manipulating the plate and cutlery size has an inconclusive effect on consumption volume. Finally, (iii) assortment manipulation and (iv) payment option manipulation was associated with healthier food choices. The majority of studies were of very weak quality and future research should emphasize a real‐life setting and compare their results with the effect of other more well‐established interventions on food behaviour in self‐service eating settings.",

Digital interventions can affect people’s experiences of self-managing a chronic condition, and SMS text messages may provide an effective delivery method for an intervention. The Support Through Mobile Messaging and Digital Health Technology for Diabetes (SuMMiT-D) intervention uses evidence-based SMS text messages to support people with type 2 diabetes with regular and consistent use of diabetes medication.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This process analysis, conducted alongside a randomized controlled trial of SuMMiT-D, aimed to explore (1) the contextual factors that may interact with the SuMMiT-D intervention and (2) the self-reported mechanisms through which change in behavior or attitude might occur.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A nested qualitative process study was conducted within primary care in England. A total of 43 trial participants diagnosed with type 2 diabetes were assigned to receive the SuMMiT-D intervention, were undergoing oral glucose-lowering treatment, blood pressure-lowering treatment or lipid-lowering treatment, either alone or in combination, and had access to a mobile phone, took part in semistructured telephone interviews. Data were analyzed using inductive thematic analysis.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              In total, 2 overarching themes were developed exploring relevant contextual factors and potential mechanisms of change. The system exerted a range of holistic benefits and supported the cognitions, beliefs, and behaviors necessary for longitudinal self-management. The perceived value of the messages was fluid and linked to contextual need. Appraisal of the system was influenced by existing routines, lifestyle disruption, people’s understanding of type 2 diabetes, relationships with other people, and subjective attitudes toward living with type 2 diabetes in contemporary society.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This work demonstrates the value of engaging people longitudinally in thinking about their general health, the importance of interrogating context, and the holistic benefit of health messaging. Many people perceived wide-ranging and unexpected benefits from using the intervention over time, challenging assumptions about who might be expected to appraise the system more positively and who should be offered access to it.",

Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) involves repeated sampling of subjects’ current behaviors and experiences in real time, in subjects’ natural environments. EMA aims to minimize recall bias, maximize ecological validity, and allow study of microprocesses that influence behavior in real-world contexts. EMA studies assess particular events in subjects’ lives or assess subjects at periodic intervals, often by random time sampling, using technologies ranging from written diaries and telephones to electronic diaries and physiological sensors. We discuss the rationale for EMA, EMA designs, methodological and practical issues, and comparisons of EMA and recall data.

      "abstract": "Background\n              The use of ecological momentary assessment (EMA) designs has been on the rise in mental health epidemiology. However, there is a lack of knowledge of the determinants of participation in and compliance with EMA studies, reliability of measures, and underreporting of methodological details and data quality indicators.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aims to evaluate the quality of EMA data in a large sample of university students by estimating participation rate and mean compliance, identifying predictors of individual-level participation and compliance, evaluating between- and within-person reliability of measures of negative and positive affect, and identifying potential careless responding.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A total of 1259 university students were invited to participate in a 15-day EMA study on mental health problems. Logistic and Poisson regressions were used to investigate the associations between sociodemographic factors, lifetime adverse experiences, stressful events in the previous 12 months, and mental disorder screens and EMA participation and compliance. Multilevel reliability and intraclass correlation coefficients were obtained for positive and negative affect measures. Careless responders were identified based on low compliance or individual reliability coefficients.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Of those invited, 62.1% (782/1259) participated in the EMA study, with a mean compliance of 76.9% (SD 27.7%). Participation was higher among female individuals (odds ratio [OR] 1.41, 95% CI 1.06-1.87) and lower among those aged ≥30 years (OR 0.20, 95% CI 0.08-0.43 vs those aged 18-21 years) and those who had experienced the death of a friend or family member in the previous 12 months (OR 0.73, 95% CI 0.57-0.94) or had a suicide attempt in the previous 12 months (OR 0.26, 95% CI 0.10-0.64). Compliance was particularly low among those exposed to sexual abuse before the age of 18 years (exponential of β=0.87) or to sexual assault or rape in the previous year (exponential of β=0.80) and among those with 12-month positive alcohol use disorder screens (exponential of β=0.89). Between-person reliability of negative and positive affect was strong (RkRn>0.97), whereas within-person reliability was fair to moderate (Rcn>0.43). Of all answered assessments, 0.86% (291/33,626) were flagged as careless responses because the response time per item was <1 second or the participants gave the same response to all items. Of the participants, 17.5% (137/782) could be considered careless responders due to low compliance (<25/56, 45%) or very low to null individual reliability (raw Cronbach α<0.11) for either negative or positive affect.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Data quality assessments should be carried out in EMA studies in a standardized manner to provide robust conclusions to advance the field. Future EMA research should implement strategies to mitigate nonresponse bias as well as conduct sensitivity analyses to assess possible exclusion of careless responders.",

While these societal changes help contain the pandemic, they also have unintended negative consequences, including anxiety and depression. We developed StayWell, a daily skills-based SMS text messaging program, to mitigate COVID-19–related depression and anxiety symptoms among people who speak English and Spanish in the United States.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This paper describes the changes in StayWell participants’ anxiety and depression levels after 60 days of exposure to skills-based SMS text messages.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We used self-administered, empirically supported web-based questionnaires to assess the demographic and clinical characteristics of StayWell participants. Anxiety and depression were measured using the 2-item Generalized Anxiety Disorder (GAD-2) scale and the 8-item Patient Health Questionnaire-8 (PHQ-8) scale at baseline and 60-day timepoints. We used 2-tailed paired t tests to detect changes in PHQ-8 and GAD-2 scores from baseline to follow-up measured 60 days later.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The analytic sample includes 193 participants who completed both the baseline and 60-day exit questionnaires. At the 60-day time point, there were significant reductions in both PHQ-8 and GAD-2 scores from baseline. We found an average reduction of –1.72 (95% CI –2.35 to –1.09) in PHQ-8 scores and –0.48 (95% CI –0.71 to –0.25) in GAD-2 scores. These improvements translated to an 18.5% and 17.2% reduction in mean PHQ-8 and GAD-2 scores, respectively.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              StayWell is an accessible, low-intensity population-level mental health intervention. Participation in StayWell focused on COVID-19 mental health coping skills and was related to improved depression and anxiety symptoms. In addition to improvements in outcomes, we found high levels of engagement during the 60-day intervention period.

      "abstract": "Background\n              Ecological momentary assessment (EMA) is a measurement methodology that involves the repeated collection of real-time data on participants’ behavior and experience in their natural environment. While EMA allows researchers to gain valuable insights into dynamic behavioral processes, the need for frequent self-reporting can be burdensome and disruptive. Compliance with EMA protocols is important for accurate, unbiased sampling; yet, there is no “gold standard” for EMA study design to promote compliance.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The purpose of this study was to use a factorial design to identify optimal study design factors, or combinations of factors, for achieving the highest completion rates for smartphone-based EMAs.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Participants recruited from across the United States were randomized to 1 of 2 levels on each of 5 design factors in a 2×2×2×2×2 design (32 conditions): factor 1—number of questions per EMA survey (15 vs 25); factor 2—number of EMAs per day (2 vs 4); factor 3—EMA prompting schedule (random vs fixed times); factor 4—payment type (US $1 paid per EMA vs payment based on the percentage of EMAs completed); and factor 5—EMA response scale type (ie, slider-type response scale vs Likert-type response scale; this is the only within-person factor; each participant was randomized to complete slider- or Likert-type questions for the first 14 days or second 14 days of the study period). All participants were asked to complete prompted EMAs for 28 days. The effect of each factor on EMA completion was examined, as well as the effects of factor interactions on EMA completion. Finally, relations between demographic and socioenvironmental factors and EMA completion were examined.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Participants (N=411) were aged 48.4 (SD 12.1) years; 75.7% (311/411) were female, 72.5% (298/411) were White, 18.0% (74/411) were Black or African American, 2.7% (11/411) were Asian, 1.5% (6/411) were American Indian or Alaska Native, 5.4% (22/411) belonged to more than one race, and 9.6% (38/396) were Hispanic/Latino. On average, participants completed 83.8% (28,948/34,552) of scheduled EMAs, and 96.6% (397/411) of participants completed the follow-up survey. Results indicated that there were no significant main effects of the design factors on compliance and no significant interactions. Analyses also indicated that older adults, those without a history of substance use problems, and those without current depression tended to complete more EMAs than their counterparts. No other demographic or socioenvironmental factors were related to EMA completion rates. Finally, the app was well liked (ie, system usability scale score=82.7), and there was a statistically significant positive association between liking the app and EMA compliance.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Study results have broad implications for developing best practices guidelines for future studies that use EMA methodologies.\n            \n            \n              Trial Registration\n              ClinicalTrials.gov number NCT05194228; https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05194228",

Using an international multidisciplinary consensus method, including lived experience expertise and a systematic review, we identified three key challenges: (i) lack of agreed metrics for engagement; (ii) lack of evidence on how better engagement improves outcomes; (iii) lack of standards for user involvement. Three potential solutions encompassed: (i) standardisation of frameworks for reporting engagement metrics and optimal doses of digital tools, (ii) measuring engagement with more precise reporting of outcomes, including potential harms; (iii) defining standards of user involvement (including appropriate diversity, and clinician as well as user input). Digital interventions have real potential in meeting the shortfall in service provision for mental health, but this will require focus on high quality research studies of the underlying mechanisms of engagement and optimal outcomes. Our findings identify and highlight the next best steps in this process.",

Mobile Health (mHealth) solutions, such as AI Chatbots and Mindfulness Apps, have gained traction as they expand beyond traditional clinical settings to support daily life. However, the effectiveness of current mHealth solutions is impeded by the lack of context-awareness, personalization, and modularity to foster their reusability. This paper introduces CAREForMe, a contextual multi-armed bandit (CMAB) recommendation framework for mental health. Designed with context-awareness, personalization, and modularity at its core, CAREForMe harnesses mobile sensing and integrates online learning algorithms with user clustering capability to deliver timely, personalized recommendations. With its modular design, CAREForMe serves as both a customizable recommendation framework to guide future research, and a collaborative platform to facilitate interdisciplinary contributions in mHealth research. We showcase CAREForMe's versatility through its implementation across various platforms (e.g., Discord, Telegram) and its customization to diverse recommendation features.",

We address the inherent challenge of bridging the gap between LLMs' original text data training and the numerical nature of time series data, and explore strategies for transferring and distilling knowledge from LLMs to numerical time series analysis. We detail various methodologies, including (1) direct prompting of LLMs, (2) time series quantization, (3) aligning techniques, (4) utilization of the vision modality as a bridging mechanism, and (5) the combination of LLMs with tools. Additionally, this survey offers a comprehensive overview of the existing multimodal time series and text datasets in diverse domains, and discusses the challenges and future opportunities of this emerging field.",

      "abstract": "In the wake of the vast population of smart device users worldwide, mobile health (mHealth) technologies are hopeful to generate positive and wide influence on people's health. They are able to provide flexible, affordable and portable health guides to device users. Current online decision-making methods for mHealth assume that the users are completely heterogeneous. They share no information among users and learn a separate policy for each user. However, data for each user is very limited in size to support the separate online learning, leading to unstable policies that contain lots of variances. Besides, we find the truth that a user may be similar with some, but not all, users, and connected users tend to have similar behaviors. In this paper, we propose a network cohesion constrained (actor-critic) Reinforcement Learning (RL) method for mHealth. The goal is to explore how to share information among similar users to better convert the limited user information into sharper learned policies. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first online actor-critic RL for mHealth and first network cohesion constrained (actor-critic) RL method in all applications. The network cohesion is important to derive effective policies. We come up with a novel method to learn the network by using the warm start trajectory, which directly reflects the users' property. The optimization of our model is difficult and very different from the general supervised learning due to the indirect observation of values. As a contribution, we propose two algorithms for the proposed online RLs. Apart from mHealth, the proposed methods can be easily applied or adapted to other health-related tasks. Extensive experiment results on the HeartSteps dataset demonstrates that in a variety of parameter settings, the proposed two methods obtain obvious improvements over the state-of-the-art methods.",

      "abstract": "Delivering treatment recommendations via pervasive electronic devices such as mobile phones has the potential to be a viable and scalable treatment medium for long-term health behavior management. But active experimentation of treatment options can be time-consuming, expensive and altogether unethical in some cases. There is a growing interest in methodological approaches that allow an experimenter to learn and evaluate the usefulness of a new treatment strategy before deployment. We present the first development of a treatment recommender system for emotion regulation using real-world historical mobile digital data from n = 114 high socially anxious participants to test the usefulness of new emotion regulation strategies. We explore a number of offline contextual bandits estimators for learning and propose a general framework for learning algorithms. Our experimentation shows that the proposed doubly robust offline learning algorithms performed significantly better than baseline approaches, suggesting that this type of recommender algorithm could improve emotion regulation. Given that emotion regulation is impaired across many mental illnesses and such a recommender algorithm could be scaled up easily, this approach holds potential to increase access to treatment for many people. We also share some insights that allow us to translate contextual bandit models to this complex real-world data, including which contextual features appear to be most important for predicting emotion regulation strategy effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Effective patient monitoring is vital for timely interventions and improved healthcare outcomes. Traditional monitoring systems often struggle to handle complex, dynamic environments with fluctuating vital signs, leading to delays in identifying critical conditions. To address this challenge, we propose a novel AI-driven patient monitoring framework using multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Our approach deploys multiple learning agents, each dedicated to monitoring a specific physiological feature, such as heart rate, respiration, and temperature. These agents interact with a generic healthcare monitoring environment, learn the patients' behavior patterns, and make informed decisions to alert the corresponding Medical Emergency Teams (METs) based on the level of emergency estimated. In this study, we evaluate the performance of the proposed multi-agent DRL framework using real-world physiological and motion data from two datasets: PPG-DaLiA and WESAD. We compare the results with several baseline models, including Q-Learning, PPO, Actor-Critic, Double DQN, and DDPG, as well as monitoring frameworks like WISEML and CA-MAQL. Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed DRL approach outperforms all other baseline models, achieving more accurate monitoring of patient's vital signs. Furthermore, we conduct hyperparameter optimization to fine-tune the learning process of each agent. By optimizing hyperparameters, we enhance the learning rate and discount factor, thereby improving the agents' overall performance in monitoring patient health status.",

      "abstract": "Much attention has been devoted recently to the development of machine learning algorithms with the goal of improving treatment policies in healthcare. Reinforcement learning (RL) is a sub-field within machine learning that is concerned with learning how to make sequences of decisions so as to optimize long-term effects. Already, RL algorithms have been proposed to identify decision-making strategies for mechanical ventilation, sepsis management and treatment of schizophrenia. However, before implementing treatment policies learned by black-box algorithms in high-stakes clinical decision problems, special care must be taken in the evaluation of these policies. In this document, our goal is to expose some of the subtleties associated with evaluating RL algorithms in healthcare. We aim to provide a conceptual starting point for clinical and computational researchers to ask the right questions when designing and evaluating algorithms for new ways of treating patients. In the following, we describe how choices about how to summarize a history, variance of statistical estimators, and confounders in more ad-hoc measures can result in unreliable, even misleading estimates of the quality of a treatment policy. We also provide suggestions for mitigating these effects---for while there is much promise for mining observational health data to uncover better treatment policies, evaluation must be performed thoughtfully.",

Eligible patients were invited to participate in a focus group conducted in Spanish between April 13 and November 9, 2023. A total of 5 focus groups were conducted. Focus groups 1‐3 centered on ranking 40 barriers to diabetes medication adherence (derived from REACH and the extant literature), whereas focus groups 4‐5 centered on translation and cultural modifications of the original SMS text message content associated with each of the REACH barriers. Barriers were mapped onto information-motivation-behavioral constructs. We used descriptive statistics to summarize participant characteristics.

Gamification, applied with mHealth (mobile health) applications, has the potential to better facilitate patient self-management. This review article addresses a knowledge gap around the effective use of gamification design principles, or mechanics, in developing mHealth applications. Badges, leaderboards, points and levels, challenges and quests, social engagement loops, and onboarding are mechanics that comprise gamification. These mechanics are defined and explained from a design and development perspective. Health and fitness applications with gamification mechanics include: bant which uses points, levels, and social engagement, mySugr which uses challenges and quests, RunKeeper which uses leaderboards as well as social engagement loops and onboarding, Fitocracy which uses badges, and Mango Health, which uses points and levels. Specific design considerations are explored, an example of the efficacy of a gamified mHealth implementation in facilitating improved self-management is provided, limitations to this work are discussed, a link between the principles of gaming and gamification in health and wellness technologies is provided, and suggestions for future work are made.

      "abstract": "The use of ecological-momentary-assessment (EMA) data to study individuals in their everyday lives is popular in many areas of social and life sciences. At the same time, EMA data sets are complex, the psychometric properties of EMA items are often not investigated systematically, and scales are often neither standardized nor validated beyond their face validity. Here, we present different descriptive statistics and data-visualization techniques to increase the understanding of the performance of EMA items. We apply these techniques to a wide range of items used in a large EMA data set (599 participants, 360 time points) collected in the WARN-D study to investigate their distributions, contextual influences, change over time, sources of variability, and relationship with classical static measures of psychopathology. We discuss the theoretical and substantive implications of our findings and provide researchers with R code that they can adapt to their own EMA data, as well as literature recommendations for each topic. We hope to inspire more researchers to share in-depth descriptive summaries of their experience-sampling data such that the field can move forward in understanding the performance of EMA measures across contexts.",

      "abstract": "Ecological momentary assessment has been increasingly used in autism studies over the last decade to capture and understand autistic people’s behaviours, thoughts, feelings and daily experiences. This systematic review synthesised previous autism ecological momentary assessment studies to learn about the feasibility of ecological momentary assessment with autistic people and derive ideas to optimise the applicability of ecological momentary assessment in autism studies. Five databases (MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Web of Science, EMBASE and CINAHL) were searched, covering the time between January 1990 and October 2024, for studies using ecological momentary assessment with autistic participants. We identified 32 studies with 930 autistic participants. These studies supported the acceptability and feasibility of ecological momentary assessment with young and middle-aged autistic adults with average or above-average intelligence and language skills. Previous researchers and autistic participants in the reviewed literature suggested considering adaptations in the design of sampling schedules, ecological momentary assessment questionnaires and the implementation of incentive strategies, to improve the applicability of ecological momentary assessment with the autistic population. Future ecological momentary assessment studies could address the limitations in the extant literature, for example, lack of evidence from youth and older autistic people and a wider range of study topics.\n            \n              Lay abstract\n              Ecological momentary assessments assess people’s in-the-moment thoughts and behaviours in their daily lives in natural environments. The number of ecological momentary assessment studies with autistic people has increased over the last decade. For the first time, this review (1) summarises how well ecological momentary assessment works for allowing autistic people to describe and express their thoughts, emotions and experiences, and (2) provides suggestions for the design of ecological momentary assessment to make this research method more accessible to future autistic participants. In total, we synthesised participation experiences from 930 autistic people. Overall, ecological momentary assessment is generally acceptable for autistic adults aged from 18 to 60 and with average or above-average intelligence and language. We also identified several issues in the ecological momentary assessment procedure and suggested researchers consider these when designing future ecological momentary assessment studies with autistic people. The findings of this review provide evidence that ecological momentary assessment can be used to investigate many different questions with autistic people and suggest a wider application of ecological momentary assessment in future studies with autistic people.",

Text message interventions (TMIs) have the potential to improve adherence but have had mixed effects on diet and activity in T2D. We developed an eight-week, adaptive, algorithm-driven TMI to promote physical activity, diet, self-care, and well-being. Then, in a single-arm trial, we assessed its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy in 15 individuals with T2D and suboptimal adherence.\n            \n            \n              Methods:\n              Participants received daily text messages and were asked to rate the utility of each message (0=not helpful, 10=very helpful). These ratings were used by an algorithm to select subsequent messages based on each participant’s prior ratings. We assessed intervention feasibility by rates of message transmission/response and acceptability through ratings of message utility and burden. Finally, we examined pre-post changes in diabetes self-care, diet, physical activity, and psychological outcomes and calculated effect sizes (Cohen’s d).\n            \n            \n              Results:\n              All text messages were delivered, and participants provided ratings for 79% of messages, above our a priori thresholds for feasibility. Participants rated the individual messages and overall TMI as subjectively useful (utility: 8.1 [SD=2.1] and 7.8 [SD=2.0], respectively) and not burdensome (burden: 0.8 [SD=1.8]). The intervention led to significant, medium- to large-sized improvements in self-care ( d=0.77), diet ( d=0.99), and activity ( d=0.61) but minimal change in psychological outcomes.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions:\n              The TMI was feasible and well-accepted, and it led to promising improvements in adherence-related outcomes. These findings should be confirmed in a larger randomized controlled trial.",

Furthermore, sleep is emerging as a salient intervention target for weight management. This study examines feasibility and acceptability of two text messaging interventions for weight control in emerging adults, one of which includes sleep intervention content.\n            \n            \n              Methods:\n              Forty-three emerging adults who were overweight (BMI ≥ 25 < 30; ages 18–21) were randomized to receive either a text messaging intervention focused on diet and physical activity change, or a text messaging intervention designed to modify sleep behavior plus diet and physical activity. The interventions included motivational interviewing, education around health behaviors, physical activity, and dietary goal setting, as well as sleep goals for those in the sleep condition. All participants self-monitored diet, physical activity, and weight via text message for 3 months; those in the sleep intervention monitored nightly sleep duration.\n            \n            \n              Results:\n              Intervention acceptability and engagement were high for both conditions.

A barrier is the need to generate and constantly post novel but on-topic messages, which creates a resource-intensive bottleneck.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              In this study, we aim to harness the latest advances in artificial intelligence (AI) to build a pilot system that can generate many candidate messages, which could be used for a campaign to suggest novel, on-topic candidate messages. The issue of folic acid, a B-vitamin that helps prevent major birth defects, serves as an example; however, the system can work with other issues that could benefit from higher levels of public awareness.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We used the Generative Pretrained Transformer-2 architecture, a machine learning model trained on a large natural language corpus, and fine-tuned it using a data set of autodownloaded tweets about #folicacid. The fine-tuned model was then used as a message engine, that is, to create new messages about this topic. We conducted a web-based study to gauge how human raters evaluate AI-generated tweet messages compared with original, human-crafted messages.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              We found that the Folic Acid Message Engine can easily create several hundreds of new messages that appear natural to humans. Web-based raters evaluated the clarity and quality of a human-curated sample of AI-generated messages as on par with human-generated ones. Overall, these results showed that it is feasible to use such a message engine to suggest messages for web-based campaigns that focus on promoting awareness.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The message engine can serve as a starting point for more sophisticated AI-guided message creation systems for health communication. Beyond the practical potential of such systems for campaigns in the age of social media, they also hold great scientific potential for the quantitative analysis of message characteristics that promote successful communication. We discuss future developments and obvious ethical challenges that need to be addressed as AI technologies for health persuasion enter the stage.",

Over the past few decades, interest in understanding the choice to adopt technology has led to the development of numerous theories and models. In 1979, however, psychologists Kahneman and Tversky published their seminal research article that has pioneered the field of behavioral economics. They named their model the prospect theory and used it to explain decision-making behaviors under conditions of risk and uncertainty as well as to provide an understanding of why individuals may make irrational or inconsistent choices. Although the prospect theory has been used to explain decision-making in economics, law, political science, and clinically, at the individual level, its application to understanding choice in the adoption of digital health technology has not been explored. Herein, we discuss how the main components of the prospect theory’s editing phase (framing effect) and evaluation phase (value function and weighting function) can provide valuable insight on why health care patients, providers, technology companies, and policymakers may decide to accept or reject digital health technologies.",

      "abstract": "Background: Higher BMI in middle age is associated with ischemic stroke, but little is known about BMI over adulthood, and the risk for ischemic stroke as most studies relied on a single measurement of BMI. Methods: BMI was measured four times over a period of 42 years. We calculated average BMI values and group-based trajectory models and related these to the prospective risk of ischemic stroke after the last examination in Cox models with a follow-up time of 12 years. Results: A total of 14,139 participants, with a mean age of 65.2 years and 55.4% women, had information on BMI from all four examinations, and we observed 856 ischemic strokes. People with overweight and obesity over adulthood had a higher risk for ischemic stroke with a multivariable-adjusted hazard ratio of 1.29 (95% CI 1.11−1.48) and 1.27 (95% CI 0.96−1.67), respectively, when compared to normal weight participants. Excess weight tended to have stronger effects earlier than later in life. A trajectory of developing obesity throughout life was associated with higher risk than other trajectories. Conclusions: High average BMI, especially at an early age, is a risk factor for ischemic stroke. Early weight control and long-term weight reduction for those with high BMI may decrease the later occurrence of ischemic stroke.",

We focused our review on four key areas: (1) definition and conceptualisation; (2) format and measurement; (3) mechanisms and processes; and (4) design issues. Overall, evidence supports the effectiveness of planning interventions in health behaviour with advantages including low cost and response burden. There is, however, considerable heterogeneity in the effects across studies and relatively few registered randomised trials that include objective behavioural measures. Optimally effective planning interventions should adopt “if–then” plans, account for salient and relevant cues, include examples of cues, be guided rather than user‐defined, and include boosters. Future studies should adopt randomised controlled designs, report study protocols, include fidelity checks and relevant comparison groups, and adopt long‐term behavioural follow‐up measures. Priority areas for future research include the identification of the moderators and mediators of planning intervention effects. Future research also needs to adopt “best practice” components of planning interventions more consistently to elucidate the mechanisms and processes involved.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are experiencing major increases in diabetes and cardiovascular conditions linked to overweight and obesity. Lifestyle interventions such as the United States National Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) developed in high-income countries require adaptation and cultural tailoring for LMICs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of “Lifestyle Africa,” an adapted version of the DPP tailored for an underresourced community in South Africa compared to usual care.\n            \n            \n              Methods and findings\n              \n                Participants were residents of a predominantly Xhosa-speaking urban township of Cape Town, South Africa characterized by high rates of poverty. Participants with body mass index (BMI) ≥ 25 kg/m\n                2\n                who were members of existing social support groups or “clubs” receiving health services from local nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) were enrolled in a cluster randomized controlled trial that compared Lifestyle Africa (the intervention condition) to usual care (the control condition). The Lifestyle Africa intervention consisted of 17 video-based group sessions delivered by trained community health workers (CHWs). Clusters were randomized using a numbered list of the CHWs and their assigned clubs based on a computer-based random allocation scheme. CHWs, participants, and research team members could not be blinded to condition. Percentage weight loss (primary outcome), hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), blood pressure, triglycerides, and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol were assessed 7 to 9 months after enrollment. An individual-level intention-to-treat analysis was conducted adjusting for clustering within clubs and baseline values. Trial registration is at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03342274). Between February 2018 and May 2019, 782 individuals were screened, and 494 were enrolled. Participants were predominantly retired (57% were receiving a pension) and female (89%) with a mean age of 68 years. Participants from 28 clusters were allocated to Lifestyle Africa (15,\n                n\n                = 240) or usual care (13,\n                n\n                = 254). Fidelity assessments indicated that the intervention was generally delivered as intended. The modal number of sessions held across all clubs was 17, and the mean attendance of participants across all sessions was 61%. Outcome assessment was completed by 215 (90%) intervention and 223 (88%) control participants. Intent-to-treat analyses utilizing multilevel modeling included all randomized participants. Mean weight change (primary outcome) was −0.61% (95% confidence interval (CI) = −1.22, −0.01) in Lifestyle Africa and −0.44% (95% CI = −1.06, 0.18) in control with no significant difference (group difference = −0.17%; 95% CI = −1.04, 0.71;\n                p\n                = 0.71). However, HbA1c was significantly lower at follow-up in Lifestyle Africa compared to the usual care group (mean difference = −0.24, 95% CI = −0.39, −0.09,\n                p\n                = 0.001). None of the other secondary outcomes differed at follow-up: systolic blood pressure (group difference = −1.36; 95% CI = −6.92, 4.21;\n                p\n                = 0.63), diastolic blood pressure (group difference = −0.39; 95% CI = −3.25, 2.30;\n                p\n                = 0.78), LDL (group difference = −0.07; 95% CI = −0.19, 0.05;\n                p\n                = 0.26), triglycerides (group difference = −0.02; 95% CI = −0.20, 0.16;\n                p\n                = 0.80). There were no unanticipated problems and serious adverse events were rare, unrelated to the intervention, and similar across groups (11 in Lifestyle Africa versus 13 in usual care). Limitations of the study include the lack of a rigorous dietary intake measure and the high representation of older women.\n              \n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              In this study, we found that Lifestyle Africa was feasible for CHWs to deliver and, although it had no effect on the primary outcome of weight loss or secondary outcomes of blood pressure or triglycerides, it had an apparent small significant effect on HbA1c. The study demonstrates the potential feasibility of CHWs to deliver a program without expert involvement by utilizing video-based sessions.

A content analysis of the semantic domains was used to analyze patients’ UX. To describe the UX, the Hassenzahl UX model was applied, examining 4 of the 5 key elements of UX from a user’s perspective: (1) patients’ standards and expectations, (2) apparent character (pragmatic and hedonic attributes), (3) usage situation, and (4) consequences (appeal, emotions, and behavior).\n            \n            \n              Results\n              BSCT appeared to be a mostly positively experienced service. Patients had a positive-pragmatic standard and neutral-open expectation toward BSCT at the treatment start. The pragmatic attributes of the F2F sessions were mostly perceived as positive, whereas the pragmatic attributes of the web sessions were perceived as both positive and negative. For the hedonic attributes, there seemed to be a difference between the F2F and web sessions. Specifically, the hedonic attributes of the web sessions were experienced as mostly negative, whereas those of the F2F sessions were experienced as mostly positive. For the usage situation, the physical and social contexts were experienced positively, whereas the task and technical contexts were experienced negatively. Nevertheless, the consequential appeal of BSCT was positive. However, the consequential emotions and behavior varied, ultimately resulting in diverse combinations of consequential appeal, emotions, and behavior (positive, negative, and mixed).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This study provided insights into the UX of a blended treatment, and the results support the expectation that in a blended treatment, the strengths of one mode of delivery may compensate for the weaknesses of the other. However, in this certain setting, this is mainly achieved in only one way: F2F sessions compensated for the weaknesses of the web sessions. As a practical conclusion, this may mean that the web sessions, supported by the strengths of the F2F sessions, offer an interesting approach for further improving the blended treatment. Our theoretical findings reflect the relevance of the aspects of hedonism, such as fun, joy, or happiness in the UX, which were not mentioned in relation to the web sessions and were only scarcely mentioned in relation to the F2F sessions. Future research should further investigate the role of hedonistic aspects in a blended treatment and whether increased enjoyment of a blended treatment could increase treatment adherence and, ultimately, effectiveness.",

This study aims to perform a systematical meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy of planning interventions for improving PA in the general population. Eight databases, including Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, ProQuest, CNKI, and Wanfang Data, were searched to locate relevant randomized controlled trials (RCTs) from their inception to 31 December 2021. In total, 41 trials with 5439 samples were included in this systematic review, and 35 trials were used in our meta-analysis. The results showed that PA was better promoted in the planned intervention group compared to the control group (SMD = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.25–0.44, I2 = 61.4%). Based on the subgroup analyses, we found that planning strategies were more effective among patients, males, when adopting AP intervention, when using the face-to-face sessions delivery mode, and when reinforcements were conducted during the follow-up. The findings of this study indicate that planning interventions significantly improved PA behavior, and, in some contexts, the effects performed better. Future research needs to be conducted to explore the underlying mechanisms of planning interventions and validate their effects more extensively.",

And yet, scant comparative research has been conducted on the two regions of Zhejiang and Jilin in particular, which differ considerably in economic development but witness nearly the same ageing trend. In response, this article compares Zhejiang, an advanced economic province, with Jilin, with its relatively low level of economic development, to explore the ageing issue and analyse the spatial correlation between older populations and socioeconomic factors. Using the spatiotemporal data analysis and geographical detector approaches, we obtain three significant findings: 1. both provinces have maintained steady rates of increase in ageing; 2. the older populations in Zhejiang and Jilin are mostly concentrated in the provincial capitals and nearby cities with reasonably established economies; and 3. the factors, including local fiscal expenditures, beds in hospitals and nursing homes, and coverage of social security, show a highly similar spatial pattern between older populations in Zhejiang and Jilin. The\n              q\n              -values of all the selected socioeconomic factors in Jilin showed a growth trend, indicating that the spatial correlation between these factors and ageing is strengthening year on year, that is, the resources gained from the socioeconomic development of Jilin have shifted steadily toward old-age services. As a consequence, a vicious circle of the slowing down of the economic growth drives away working forces and quickens the pace of population ageing, is present. From a policy perspective, Jilin province is strongly dependent on state-owned enterprises characterised by institutional rigidity, an inflexible market economy and an under-developed private sector, all of which are profoundly influenced by ageing. The consequence is large population outflows of young people. In contrast, the economy of Zhejiang province is partially decoupled from the ageing trend, so the gap in level of development between its counties has been narrowing. The policy implication here is that Zhejiang represents an active private economy that has coped successfully with ageing by attracting young migrants and developing new forms of development, such as the digital economy.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Conversational agents (CAs), also known as chatbots, are computer programs that simulate human conversations by using predetermined rule-based responses or artificial intelligence algorithms. They are increasingly used in health care, particularly via smartphones. There is, at present, no conceptual framework guiding the development of smartphone-based, rule-based CAs in health care. To fill this gap, we propose structured and tailored guidance for their design, development, evaluation, and implementation.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The aim of this study was to develop a conceptual framework for the design, evaluation, and implementation of smartphone-delivered, rule-based, goal-oriented, and text-based CAs for health care.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We followed the approach by Jabareen, which was based on the grounded theory method, to develop this conceptual framework. We performed 2 literature reviews focusing on health care CAs and conceptual frameworks for the development of mobile health interventions. We identified, named, categorized, integrated, and synthesized the information retrieved from the literature reviews to develop the conceptual framework. We then applied this framework by developing a CA and testing it in a feasibility study.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The Designing, Developing, Evaluating, and Implementing a Smartphone-Delivered, Rule-Based Conversational Agent (DISCOVER) conceptual framework includes 8 iterative steps grouped into 3 stages, as follows: design, comprising defining the goal, creating an identity, assembling the team, and selecting the delivery interface; development, including developing the content and building the conversation flow; and the evaluation and implementation of the CA. They were complemented by 2 cross-cutting considerations—user-centered design and privacy and security—that were relevant at all stages. This conceptual framework was successfully applied in the development of a CA to support lifestyle changes and prevent type 2 diabetes.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Drawing on published evidence, the DISCOVER conceptual framework provides a step-by-step guide for developing rule-based, smartphone-delivered CAs. Further evaluation of this framework in diverse health care areas and settings and for a variety of users is needed to demonstrate its validity. Future research should aim to explore the use of CAs to deliver health care interventions, including behavior change and potential privacy and safety concerns.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Limited access to mental health care services due to provider shortages, geographic limitations, and cost has driven the area of mobile health (mHealth) care to address these access gaps. Reports from the Cohen Veterans Network and National Council for Behavioral Health show that in states where mental health care is more accessible, 38% of people still do not receive the care they need. mHealth strategies help to provide care to individuals experiencing these barriers at lower cost and greater convenience, making mHealth a great resource to bridge the gaps.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              We present a mixed methods study to evaluate user experiences with the mental mHealth service, Cope Notes. Specifically, we aimed to investigate the following research questions: How do users perceive the service in relation to stigma, impact of the intervention, and perceived usefulness? How do users rate the Cope Notes service and SMS text messaging along various dimensions of acceptability? What is the relationship between Cope Notes SMS text message ratings, user personality, and coping strategies? What are user perspectives of leveraging ubiquitous sensing technologies to improve delivery and provide tailored content?\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We performed qualitative interviews with Cope Notes users (N=14) who have used the service for at least 30 days to evaluate their experiences and usefulness of the service. These interviews were coded by 2 raters (SLK and JL), and the interrater reliability was calculated with SPSS (IBM Corp) at 61.8%. In addition, participants completed quantitative measures, including a user experiences survey, personality inventory (Big Five Inventory-10), and coping assessment (Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced).\n            \n            \n              Results\n              We derived 7 themes from our qualitative interviews: Likes or Perceived Benefits, Dislikes or Limitations, Suggested Changes, Stigma or Help Seeking, Perceptions of Ubiquitous Sensing, Cultural Sensitivity, and Alternative mHealth Resources. Exploratory analyses between acceptability ratings of Cope Notes and personality factors showed statistically significant positive relationships between seeing oneself as someone who is generally trusting and acceptability items, the most significant being item 7 (I fully understood the sentiment behind Cope Notes Messages) with (rs(10)=0.82, P=.001). We also found statistically significant relationships between acceptability and Brief Coping Orientation to Problems Experienced items, with the strongest positive correlation between participants strongly endorsing coping by accepting the reality that an event has happened and acceptability item 7 (rs(8)=0.86, P=.001).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Our study found that Cope Notes subscribers appreciate the service for reframing their mental wellness with statistically significant correlations between personality and acceptability of the service. We found that some users prefer a more personalized experience with neutral to positive reactions to a potential companion app that continuously monitors user behavior via smartphone sensors to provide just-in-time interventions when users need it most.",

There has been limited investment in handling and aggregating data from different sources for use in academic and clinical research focusing on remote monitoring studies. In this study, we created a modular mobile health research platform to collect and integrate data from a variety of third-party devices in several patient populations.

With adequate training,\n                FHW\n                s were able to use mobile phones to enhance various aspects of their work activities. Training of\n                FHW\n                s to use mobile phones for healthcare delivery ranged from a few hours to about 1 week. Five key thematic areas for the use of mobile phones by\n                FHW\n                s were identified as follows: data collection and reporting, training and decision support, emergency referrals, work planning through alerts and reminders, and improved supervision of and communication between healthcare workers. Findings suggest that mobile based data collection improves promptness of data collection, reduces error rates and improves data completeness. Two methodologically robust studies suggest that regular access to health information via\n                SMS\n                or mobile‐based decision‐support systems may improve the adherence of the\n                FHW\n                s to treatment algorithms.

La formation des\n                ASPL\n                à l’’utilisation des téléphones portables pour la délivrance de soins de santé varie de quelques heures à environ une semaine. Cinq domaines thématiques clés pour l'utilisation des téléphones portables par les\n                ASPL\n                ont été identifiés: la collecte et l'enregistrement des données, la formation et l'aide à la décision, les transferts d'urgence, la planification du travail grâce à des alertes et des rappels et l'amélioration de la supervision et de la communication entre les agents de la santé. La collecte des données par les téléphones portables semble améliorer la rapidité de la collecte et la réduction des taux d'erreur, et améliorer l'exhaustivité des données. Deux études méthodologiquement robustes suggèrent que l'accès régulier à des informations de santé par\n                SMS\n                ou par des systèmes d'aide aux décisions basés sur les téléphones portables peut améliorer l'adhérence des\n                ASPL\n                aux algorithmes de traitement.

Se extrajeron los datos y se sintetizaron en tres temáticas: viabilidad del uso de herramientas móviles por\n                TSPL\n                , entrenamiento requerido para la adopción de herramientas móviles y efectividad de tales intervenciones.\n              \n            \n            \n              Resultados\n              \n                Se incluyeron 42 estudios en la revisión. Con el entrenamiento adecuado, los\n                TSPL\n                fueron capaces de utilizar los teléfonos móviles para mejorar varios aspectos de sus actividades laborales. El entrenamiento de los\n                TSPL\n                necesario para la utilización de los teléfonos móviles en la atención sanitaria estaba entre unas pocas horas y hasta casi una semana. Se identificaron cinco áreas temáticas para el uso de teléfonos móviles por\n                TSPL\n                : Recolección y reporte de datos, entrenamiento y apoyo a las decisiones, traslados por emergencias, planificación del trabajo mediante alertas y recordatorios, y una supervisión mejorada de la comunicación entre los trabajadores sanitarios.

Among men who were tested, 19.5% did not meet Endocrine Society guidelines for low testosterone. In the 12 months after initiating treatment, 52.4% received a serum testosterone test and 43.3% received a PSA test.

These systems link a continuous glucose monitor (CGM) and insulin pump with a control algorithm, but require users to announce meals, without which the system can only react to the rise in blood glucose.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              We investigate whether CGM data can be used to automatically infer meals in daily life even in the presence of physical activity, which can raise or lower blood glucose.\n            \n            \n              Materials and Methods\n              We propose a novel meal detection algorithm that combines simulations with CGM, insulin pump, and heart rate monitor data.

Responses to a survey with 28 items were collected using computer-assisted telephone interviews conducted in October 2020. The items were divided into four topics: (1) general attitudes toward digitization, (2) COVID-19 pandemic, (3) physical activity, and (4) perceived digital health (eHealth) literacy measured with the eHealth Literacy Scale (eHEALS; sum score of 8=lowest to 40=highest perceived eHealth literacy). The data were analyzed in IBM-SPSS24 using relative frequencies. Three univariate multiple regression analyses (linear or binary logistic) were performed to investigate the associations among the sociodemographic factors (age, gender, education, and household income) and digital technology use.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The participants included 1014 internet users (n=528, 52.07% women) aged 14 to 93 years (mean 54, SD 17). Among all participants, 66.47% (674/1014) completed up to tertiary (primary and secondary) education and 45.07% (457/1017) reported a household income of up to 3500 Euro/month (1 Euro=US $1.18). Over half (579/1014, 57.10%) reported having used digital technologies for health-related purposes. The majority (898/1014, 88.56%) noted that digitization will be important for therapy and health care, in the future. Only 25.64% (260/1014) reported interest in smartphone apps for health promotion/prevention and 42.70% (433/1014) downloaded the COVID-19 contact-tracing app. Although 52.47% (532/1014) reported that they come across inaccurate digital information on the COVID-19 pandemic, 78.01% (791/1014) were confident in their ability to recognize such inaccurate information. Among those who use digital technologies for moderate physical activity (n=220), 187 (85.0%) found such technologies easy to use and 140 (63.6%) reported using them regularly (at least once a week). Although the perceived eHealth literacy was high (eHEALS mean score 31 points, SD 6), less than half (43.10%, 400/928) were confident in using digital information for health decisions. The use of digital technologies for health was associated with higher household income (odds ratio [OR] 1.28, 95% CI 1.11-1.47). The use of digital technologies for physical activity was associated with younger age (OR 0.95, 95% CI 0.94-0.96) and more education (OR 1.22, 95% CI 1.01-1.46). A higher perceived eHealth literacy score was associated with younger age (β=–.22, P<.001), higher household income (β=.21, P<.001), and more education (β=.14, P<.001).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Internet users in Germany expect that digitization will affect preventive and therapeutic health care in the future. The facilitators and barriers associated with the use of digital technologies for health warrant further research. A gap exists between high confidence in the perceived ability to evaluate digital information and low trust in internet-based information on the COVID-19 pandemic and health decisions.",

There is significant potential for the application of Big Data to healthcare, but there are still some impediments to overcome, such as fragmentation, high costs, and questions around data ownership. Envisioning a future role for Big Data within the digital healthcare context means balancing the benefits of improving patient outcomes with the potential pitfalls of increasing physician burnout due to poor implementation leading to added complexity. Oncology, the field where Big Data collection and utilization got a heard start with programs like TCGA and the Cancer Moon Shot, provides an instructive example as we see different perspectives provided by the United States (US), the United Kingdom (UK) and other nations in the implementation of Big Data in patient care with regards to their centralization and regulatory approach to data. By drawing upon global approaches, we propose recommendations for guidelines and regulations of data use in healthcare centering on the creation of a unique global patient ID that can integrate data from a variety of healthcare providers. In addition, we expand upon the topic by discussing potential pitfalls to Big Data such as the lack of diversity in Big Data research, and the security and transparency risks posed by machine learning algorithms.",

We conducted a machine learning analysis to discriminate the important characteristics.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A higher engagement rate was associated with higher weight loss at 8 weeks (r=−0.59; P<.001) and 24 weeks (r=−0.52; P=.001). Applying the machine learning approach, lower self-esteem on the conventional phenotype and higher in-app motivational measures on digital phenotypes commonly accounted for both engagement and health outcomes. In addition, 16 types of digital phenotypes (ie, lower intake of high-calorie food and evening snacks and higher interaction frequency with mentors) predicted engagement rates (mean R2 0.416, SD 0.006). The prediction of short-term weight change (mean R2 0.382, SD 0.015) was associated with 13 different digital phenotypes (ie, lower intake of high-calorie food and carbohydrate and higher intake of low-calorie food). Finally, 8 measures of digital phenotypes (ie, lower intake of carbohydrate and evening snacks and higher motivation) were associated with a long-term weight change (mean R2 0.590, SD 0.011).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Our findings successfully demonstrated how multiple psychological constructs, such as emotional, cognitive, behavioral, and motivational phenotypes, elucidate the mechanisms and clinical efficacy of a digital intervention using the machine learning method. Accordingly, our study designed an interpretable digital phenotype model, including multiple aspects of motivation before and during the intervention, predicting both engagement and clinical efficacy.

In addition, we aimed to further establish 4 entities of risk using a machine learning approach that would achieve the best distinction between groups and demonstrate the dose-response relationship.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              In this study, we used Taiwan’s National Health Insurance Research Database to develop a machine learning multimorbidity frailty index (ML-mFI) using the theory of cumulative diseases/deficits of an individual older person. Compared to the conventional mFI, in which the selection of diseases/deficits is based on expert opinion, we adopted the random forest method to select the most influential diseases/deficits that predict adverse outcomes for older people. To ensure that the survival curves showed a dose-response relationship with overlap during the follow-up, we developed the distance index and coverage index, which can be used at any time point to classify the ML-mFI of all subjects into the categories of fit, mild frailty, moderate frailty, and severe frailty. Survival analysis was conducted to evaluate the ability of the ML-mFI to predict adverse outcomes, such as unplanned hospitalizations, intensive care unit (ICU) admissions, and mortality.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The final ML-mFI model contained 38 diseases/deficits. Compared with conventional mFI, both indices had similar distribution patterns by age and sex; however, among people aged 65 to 69 years, the mean mFI and ML-mFI were 0.037 (SD 0.048) and 0.0070 (SD 0.0254), respectively. The difference may result from discrepancies in the diseases/deficits selected in the mFI and the ML-mFI. A total of 86,133 subjects aged 65 to 100 years were included in this study and were categorized into 4 groups according to the ML-mFI. Both the Kaplan-Meier survival curves and Cox models showed that the ML-mFI significantly predicted all outcomes of interest, including all-cause mortality, unplanned hospitalizations, and all-cause ICU admissions at 1, 5, and 8 years of follow-up (P<.01). In particular, a dose-response relationship was revealed between the 4 ML-mFI groups and adverse outcomes.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The ML-mFI consists of 38 diseases/deficits that can successfully stratify risk groups associated with all-cause mortality, unplanned hospitalizations, and all-cause ICU admissions in older people, which indicates that precise, patient-centered medical care can be a reality in an aging society.",

      "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic brought the world to a standstill, posing unprecedented challenges for healthcare systems worldwide. The overwhelming number of patients infected with the virus placed an enormous burden on healthcare providers, who struggled to cope with the sheer volume of cases. Furthermore, the lack of effective treatments or vaccines means that quarantining has become a necessary measure to slow the spread of the virus. However, quarantining places a significant burden on healthcare providers, who often lack the resources to monitor patients with mild symptoms or asymptomatic patients. In this study, we propose an Internet of Things (IoT)-based wearable health monitoring system that can remotely monitor the exact locations and physiological parameters of quarantined individuals in real time. The system utilizes a combination of highly miniaturized optoelectronic and electronic technologies, an anti-epidemic watch, a mini-computer, and a monitor terminal to provide real-time updates on physiological parameters. Body temperature, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO\n              2\n              ), and heart rate are recorded as the most important measurements for critical care. If these three physiological parameters are aberrant, then it could represent a life-endangering situation and/or a short period over which irreversible damage may occur. Therefore, these parameters are automatically uploaded to a cloud database for remote monitoring by healthcare providers. The monitor terminal can display real-time health data for multiple patients and provide early warning functions for medical staff. The system significantly reduces the burden on healthcare providers, as it eliminates the need for manual monitoring of patients in quarantine. Moreover, it can help healthcare providers manage the COVID-19 pandemic more effectively by identifying patients who require medical attention in real time. We have validated the system and demonstrated that it is well suited to practical application, making it a promising solution for managing future pandemics. In summary, our IoT-based wearable health monitoring system has the potential to revolutionize healthcare by providing a cost-effective, remote monitoring solution for patients in quarantine. By allowing healthcare providers to monitor patients remotely in real time, the burden on medical resources is reduced, and more efficient use of limited resources is achieved. Furthermore, the system can be easily scaled to manage future pandemics, making it an ideal solution for managing the health challenges of the future.",

Our aim was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of DL algorithms to identify pathology in medical imaging. Searches were conducted in Medline and EMBASE up to January 2020. We identified 11,921 studies, of which 503 were included in the systematic review. Eighty-two studies in ophthalmology, 82 in breast disease and 115 in respiratory disease were included for meta-analysis. Two hundred twenty-four studies in other specialities were included for qualitative review. Peer-reviewed studies that reported on the diagnostic accuracy of DL algorithms to identify pathology using medical imaging were included. Primary outcomes were measures of diagnostic accuracy, study design and reporting standards in the literature. Estimates were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. In ophthalmology, AUC’s ranged between 0.933 and 1 for diagnosing diabetic retinopathy, age-related macular degeneration and glaucoma on retinal fundus photographs and optical coherence tomography. In respiratory imaging, AUC’s ranged between 0.864 and 0.937 for diagnosing lung nodules or lung cancer on chest X-ray or CT scan. For breast imaging, AUC’s ranged between 0.868 and 0.909 for diagnosing breast cancer on mammogram, ultrasound, MRI and digital breast tomosynthesis. Heterogeneity was high between studies and extensive variation in methodology, terminology and outcome measures was noted. This can lead to an overestimation of the diagnostic accuracy of DL algorithms on medical imaging. There is an immediate need for the development of artificial intelligence-specific EQUATOR guidelines, particularly STARD, in order to provide guidance around key issues in this field.",

The design mechanism incorporates a rule definition language enabling experts to specify triggering conditions for interventions based on momentary and historical contextual/personal data. The framework continuously monitors and processes personal data space and evaluates intervention-triggering conditions. We benefit from reinforcement learning methods to develop personalized intervention delivery strategies with respect to timing, frequency, and type (content) of interventions. To validate the personalization algorithm, we lay out a simulation testbed with 2 personas, differing in their various simulated real-life conditions.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              We evaluate the design mechanism by presenting example intervention definitions based on behavior change taxonomies and clinical guidelines.

Many patients with an exacerbation of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are often treated in the emergency departments for a very short period before discharged to their homes. It is possible that this treatment could take place in the patients’ homes with sufficient diagnostics supporting the treatment.\n              In an effort to keep the diagnostics and treatment of some of these patients in their homes and thus to reduce the patient load at the emergency departments, we implemented a prehospital treat-and-release strategy based on ultrasonography and blood testing performed by emergency medical technicians (EMT) or paramedics (PM) in patients with acute exacerbation of COPD.\n            \n            \n              Method\n              EMTs and PMs were enrolled in a six-hour educational program covering ultrasonography of the lungs and point of care blood tests. During the seasonal peak of COPD exacerbations (October 2018 – May 2019) all patients who were treated by the ambulance crews for respiratory insufficiency were screened in the ambulances. If the patient had uncomplicated COPD not requiring immediate transport to the hospital, ultrasonographic examination of the lungs, measurements of C-reactive protein and venous blood gases analyses were performed. The response to the initial treatment and the results obtained were discussed via telemedical consultation with a prehospital anaesthesiologist who then decided to either release the patient at the scene or to have the patient transported to the hospital. The primary outcome was strategy feasibility.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              We included 100 EMTs and PMs in the study. During the study period, 771 patients with respiratory insufficiency were screened. Uncomplicated COPD was rare as only 41patients were treated according to the treat-and-release strategy. Twenty of these patients (49%) were released at the scene. In further ten patients, technical problems were encountered hindering release at the scene.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              In a few selected patients with suspected acute exacerbations of COPD, it was technically and organisationally feasible for EMTs and PMs to perform prehospital POCT-ultrasound and laboratory testing and release the patients following treatment. None of the patients released at the scene requested a secondary ambulance within the first 48 h following the intervention.",

      "abstract": "Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a subset of Artificial Intelligence, specifically focused on understanding and generating human language. NLP technologies are becoming more prevalent in healthcare and hold potential solutions to current problems. Some examples of existing and future uses include: public sentiment analysis in relation to health policies, electronic health record (EHR) screening, use of speech to text technology for extracting EHR data from point of care, patient communications, accelerated identification of eligible clinical trial candidates through automated searches and access of health data to assist in informed treatment decisions. This narrative review aims to summarize the current uses of NLP in healthcare, highlight successful implementation of computational linguistics-based approaches, and identify gaps, limitations, and emerging trends within the subfield of NLP in public health. The online databases Google Scholar and PubMed were scanned for papers published between 2018 and 2023. Keywords “Natural Language Processing, Health Policy, Large Language Models” were utilized in the initial search. Then, papers were limited to those written in English. Each of the 27 selected papers was subject to careful analysis, and their relevance in relation to NLP and healthcare respectively is utilized in this review. NLP and deep learning technologies scan large datasets, extracting valuable insights in various realms. This is especially significant in healthcare where huge amounts of data exist in the form of unstructured text. Automating labor intensive and tedious tasks with language processing algorithms, using text analytics systems and machine learning to analyze social media data and extracting insights from unstructured data allows for better public sentiment analysis, enhancement of risk prediction models, improved patient communication, and informed treatment decisions. In the recent past, some studies have applied NLP tools to social media posts to evaluate public sentiment regarding COVID-19 vaccine use. Social media data also has the capacity to be harnessed to develop pandemic prediction models based on reported symptoms. Furthermore, NLP has the potential to enhance healthcare delivery across the globe. Advanced language processing techniques such as Speech Recognition (SR) and Natural Language Understanding (NLU) tools can help overcome linguistic barriers and facilitate efficient communication between patients and healthcare providers.",

Rwanda deployed a digital health service nationally to assist public health clinicians to remotely monitor and support SARS-CoV-2 cases via their mobile phones using daily interactive short message service (SMS) check-ins. We aimed to assess the texting patterns and communicated topics to better understand patient experiences. We extracted data on all COVID-19 cases and exposed contacts who were enrolled in the WelTel text messaging program between March 18, 2020, and March 31, 2022, and linked demographic and clinical data from the national COVID-19 registry. A sample of the text conversation corpus was English-translated and labeled with topics of interest defined by medical experts. Multiple natural language processing (NLP) topic classification models were trained and compared using F1 scores. Best performing models were applied to classify unlabeled conversations. Total 33,081 isolated patients (mean age 33·9, range 0–100), 44% female, including 30,398 cases and 2,683 contacts) were registered in WelTel. Registered patients generated 12,119 interactive text conversations in Kinyarwanda (n = 8,183, 67%), English (n = 3,069, 25%) and other languages. Sufficiently trained large language models (LLMs) were unavailable for Kinyarwanda. Traditional machine learning (ML) models outperformed fine-tuned transformer architecture language models on the native untranslated language corpus, however, the reverse was observed of models trained on English-only data. The most frequently identified topics discussed included symptoms (69%), diagnostics (38%), social issues (19%), prevention (18%), healthcare logistics (16%), and treatment (8·5%). Education, advice, and triage on these topics were provided to patients. Interactive text messaging can be used to remotely support isolated patients in pandemics at scale. NLP can help evaluate the medical and social factors that affect isolated patients which could ultimately inform precision public health responses to future pandemics.",

It remains unclear what strategies facilitate engagement with digital interventions that target mental health promotion.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              Our aim is to conduct a scoping review to investigate user engagement strategies and methods to evaluate engagement with digital interventions that target mental health promotion in adults.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              This scoping review adheres to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for scoping reviews. The search was conducted in 7 electronic databases from inception to April 2020. The inclusion criteria for studies were as follows: adult (aged ≥18 years) users of digital interventions for mental health promotion from the general population; any digital intervention for mental health promotion; and user engagement strategies described in the intervention design. We extracted the following data items: study characteristics, digital intervention (type and engagement strategy), evaluation of engagement strategy (method and result specifying whether the strategy was effective at facilitating engagement), and features of engagement (extent of use and subjective experience of users).\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 2766 studies were identified, of which 16 (0.58%) met the inclusion criteria. The 16 studies included randomized controlled trials (6/16, 37%), studies analyzing process data (5/16, 31%), observational studies (3/16, 19%), and qualitative studies (2/16, 13%). The digital interventions for mental health promotion were either web based (12/16, 75%) or mobile app based (4/16, 25%). The engagement strategies included personalized feedback about intervention content or users’ mental health status; guidance regarding content and progress through e-coaching; social forums, and interactivity with peers; content gamification; reminders; and flexibility and ease of use. These engagement strategies were deemed effective based on qualitative user feedback or responses on questionnaires or tools (4/16, 25%), usability data (5/16, 31%), or both (7/16, 44%). Most studies identified personalized support in the form of e-coaching, peer support through a social platform, personalized feedback, or joint videoconference sessions as an engaging feature.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Personalized support during the intervention, access to social support, and personalized feedback seem to promote engagement with digital interventions for mental health promotion. These findings need to be interpreted with caution because the included studies were heterogeneous, had small sample sizes, and typically did not address engagement as the primary outcome. Despite the importance of user engagement for the effectiveness of digital interventions, this field has not yet received much attention. Further research is needed on the effectiveness of different strategies required to facilitate user engagement in digital interventions for mental health promotion.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Digital health care is increasingly used to improve health service accessibility and reduce costs. Remote health care requires a significant self-management role for service users, and this generates information provision and support needs that should be reflected in service planning. SMS text messaging offers a convenient and low-cost method of communication and is increasingly used across digital health care services to provide remote support.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The aim of this study was to quantify the number of messages generated through user interaction with a two-way SMS text messaging support service within an online sexual health service and to thematically explore the content of the messages and type of support required to facilitate self-management.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              The content of all SMS text messages received by an online sexual health service was analyzed from April 4, 2018, to July 5, 2018. Messages were classified as being either administrative or clinical in nature and service or user initiated. For those messages that were both clinical and user initiated, a qualitative thematic analysis was completed to fully describe the content of the interactions.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 267 actionable messages were generated per 1000 orders requested through the service. Of the 8562 messages, 5447 (63.62%) messages were administrative and 3115 (36.38%) were clinical. Overall, 4306 of the 8562 messages (50.29%) responded to service-generated queries reflecting the public health and clinical responsibilities of an online provider, and 4256 (49.71%) were user-generated queries, demonstrating a willingness by users to proactively engage with a two-way SMS text messaging support service. Of the 3115 clinical messages, 968 (31.08%) clinical messages were user initiated and shared personal and complex clinical information, including requests for help with the self-testing process and personalized clinical advice relating to symptoms and treatment.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This study demonstrates the willingness of users of an online sexual health service to engage with two-way SMS text messaging and provides insight into the quantity and nature of the support required to facilitate service delivery and self-care.

Search terms for skin cancer, digital strategies, and prevention were combined to search PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane Library from inception until July 2022. Randomized clinical trials that reported dropouts of participants and compared digital strategies with other interventions to prevent skin cancer in healthy or disease-free participants were included. Two independent reviewers extracted data for analysis. The Revised Cochrane Collaboration Bias tool was employed. We calculated the pooled dropout rate of participants through a meta-analysis of proportions and examined whether dropout was more or less frequent in digital interventions against comparators via an odds ratio (OR) meta-analysis. Data were pooled using a random-effects model. Subgroup meta-analyses were conducted in a meta-analysis of proportions and OR meta-analysis to assess the dropout events when data were sorted by digital interventions or control comparator. A univariate metaregression based on a random-effects model assessed possible moderators of dropout. Participants’ dropout rates as pooled proportions were calculated for all groups combined, and the digital and comparator groups separately. OR>1 indicated higher dropouts for digital-based interventions. Metaregressions were performed for age, sex, length of intervention, and sample size.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 17 studies were included. The overall pooled dropout rate was 9.5% (95% CI 5.0-17.5). The subgroup meta-analysis of proportions revealed a dropout rate of 11.6% for digital strategies (95% CI 6.8-19.0) and 10.0% for comparators (95% CI 5.5-17.7). A trend of higher dropout rates for digital strategies was observed in the overall (OR 1.16, 95% CI 0.98-1.36) and subgroup OR meta-analysis, but no significant differences were found between the groups.

      "abstract": "Background\n              Continued use of mHealth apps can achieve better effects in health management. Gamification is an important factor in promoting users’ intention to continue using mHealth apps. Past research has rarely explored the factors underlying the continued use of mobile health (mHealth) apps and gamification’s impact mechanism or path on continued use.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aimed to explore the factors influencing mHealth app users’ intention to continue using mHealth apps and the impact mechanism and path of users’ feelings induced by gamification on continued mHealth app use.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              First, based on the expectation confirmation model of information system continuance, we built a theoretical model for continued use of mHealth apps based on users’ feelings toward gamification. We used self-determination theory to analyze gamification’s impact on user perceptions and set the resulting feelings (competence, autonomy, and relatedness) as constructs in the model. Second, we used the survey method to validate the research model, and we used partial least squares to analyze the data.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 2988 responses were collected from mHealth app users, and 307 responses were included in the structural equation model after passing the acceptance criteria. The intrinsic motivation for using mHealth apps is significantly affected by autonomy (β=.312; P<.001), competence (β=.346; P<.001), and relatedness (β=.165; P=.004) induced by gamification. The intrinsic motivation for using mHealth apps has a significant impact on satisfaction (β=.311, P<.001) and continuance intention (β=.142; P=.045); furthermore, satisfaction impacts continuance intention significantly (β=.415; P<.001). Confirmation has a significant impact on perceived usefulness (β=.859; P<.001) and satisfaction (β=.391; P<.001), and perceived usefulness has a significant impact on satisfaction (β=.269; P<.001) and continuance intention (β=.273; P=.001). The mediating effect analysis showed that in the impact path of the intrinsic motivation for using the mHealth apps on continuance intention, satisfaction plays a partial mediating role (β=.129; P<.001), with a variance accounted for of 0.466.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This study explored the impact path of users’ feelings induced by gamification on the intention of continued mHealth app use. We confirmed that perceived usefulness, confirmation, and satisfaction in the classical continued use theory for nonmedical information systems positively affect continuance intention. We also found that the path and mechanism of users' feelings regarding autonomy, competence, and relatedness generated during interactions with different gamification elements promote the continued use of mHealth apps.",

It is important to characterise the content of this information in terms of specific behaviour change techniques (BCTs) for the purpose of future development. This study aimed to (i) extend a proven system for coding BCTs to text messaging and (ii) characterise Txt2Stop using this system. A taxonomy previously used to specify BCTs in face-to-face behavioural support for smoking cessation was adapted for the Txt2Stop messages and inter-rater reliability for the adapted system assessed. The system was then applied to all the messages in the Txt2Stop programme to determine its profile in terms of BCTs used. The text message taxonomy comprised 34 BCTs. Inter-rater reliability was moderate, reaching a ceiling of 61% for the core program messages with all discrepancies readily resolved. Of 899 texts delivering BCTs, 218 aimed to maintain motivation to remain abstinent, 870 to enhance self-regulatory capacity or skills, 39 to promote use of adjuvant behaviours such as using stop-smoking medication, 552 to maintain engagement with the intervention and 24 were general communication techniques. The content of Txt2Stop focuses on helping smokers with self-regulation and maintaining engagement with the intervention. The intervention focuses to a lesser extent on boosting motivation to remain abstinent; little attention is given to promoting effective use of adjuvant behaviours such as use of nicotine replacement therapy. As new interventions of this kind are developed it will be possible to compare their effectiveness and relate this to standardised descriptions of their content using this system.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Motivational incentive interventions are highly effective for smoking cessation. Yet, these interventions are not widely available to people who want to quit smoking, in part, due to barriers such as administrative burden, concern about the use of extrinsic reinforcement (i.e., incentives) to improve cessation outcomes, suboptimal intervention engagement, individual burden, and up-front costs.\n            \n            \n              Purpose\n              Technological advancements can mitigate some of these barriers. For example, mobile abstinence monitoring and digital, automated incentive delivery have the potential to lower the clinic burden associated with monitoring abstinence and administering incentives while also reducing the frequency of clinic visits. However, to fully realize the potential of digital technologies to deliver motivational incentives it is critical to develop strategies to mitigate longstanding concerns that reliance on extrinsic monetary reinforcement may hamper internal motivation for cessation, improve individual engagement with the intervention, and address scalability limitations due to the up-front cost of monetary incentives. Herein, we describe the state of digitally-delivered motivational incentives. We then build on existing principles for creating just-in-time adaptive interventions to highlight new directions in leveraging digital technology to improve the effectiveness and scalability of motivational incentive interventions.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Technological advancement in abstinence monitoring coupled with digital delivery of reinforcers has made the use of motivational incentives for smoking cessation increasingly feasible. We propose future directions for a new era of motivational incentive interventions that leverage technology to integrate monetary and non-monetary incentives in a way that addresses the changing needs of individuals as they unfold in real-time.",

      "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed learning technique through which models can be trained using the data collected by user devices in resource-constrained situations while protecting user privacy. However, FL has three main limitations: First, the parameter server (PS), which aggregates the local models that are trained using local user data, is typically far from users. The large distance may burden the path links between the PS and local nodes, thereby increasing the consumption of the network and computing resources. Second, user device resources are limited, but this aspect is not considered in the training of the local model and transmission of the model parameters. Third, the PS-side links tend to become highly loaded as the number of participating clients increases. The links become congested owing to the large size of model parameters. In this study, we propose a resource-efficient FL scheme. We follow the Pareto optimality concept with the biased client selection to limit client participation, thereby ensuring efficient resource consumption and rapid model convergence. In addition, we propose a hierarchical structure with location-based clustering for device-to-device communication using k-means clustering. Simulation results show that with prate at 0.75, the proposed scheme effectively reduced transmitted and received network traffic by 75.89% and 78.77%, respectively, compared to the FedAvg method. It also achieves faster model convergence compared to other FL mechanisms, such as FedAvg and D2D-FedAvg.",

Guided iCBT was associated with more effectiveness than unguided iCBT (mean difference [MD] in posttreatment PHQ-9 scores, −0.8; 95% CI, −1.4 to −0.2), but we found no evidence of a difference at 6 or 12 months following randomization. Baseline depression was found to be the most important modifier of the relative association for efficacy of guided vs unguided iCBT. Differences between unguided and guided iCBT in people with baseline symptoms of subthreshold depression (PHQ-9 scores 5-9) were small, while guided iCBT was associated with overall better outcomes in patients with baseline PHQ-9 greater than 9.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions and Relevance\n              In this network meta-analysis with IPD, guided iCBT was associated with more effectiveness than unguided iCBT for individuals with depression, benefits were more substantial in individuals with moderate to severe depression. Unguided iCBT was associated with similar effectiveness among individuals with symptoms of mild/subthreshold depression. Personalized treatment selection is entirely possible and necessary to ensure the best allocation of treatment resources for depression.",

Several remotely conducted studies have recruited thousands of participants over a span of a few months allowing researchers to collect real-world data at scale and at a fraction of the cost of traditional research. Unfortunately, remote studies have been hampered by substantial participant attrition, calling into question the representativeness of the collected data including generalizability of outcomes. We report the findings regarding recruitment and retention from eight remote digital health studies conducted between 2014–2019 that provided individual-level study-app usage data from more than 100,000 participants completing nearly 3.5 million remote health evaluations over cumulative participation of 850,000 days. Median participant retention across eight studies varied widely from 2–26 days (median across all studies = 5.5 days). Survival analysis revealed several factors significantly associated with increase in participant retention time, including (i) referral by a clinician to the study (increase of 40 days in median retention time); (ii) compensation for participation (increase of 22 days, 1 study); (iii) having the clinical condition of interest in the study (increase of 7 days compared with controls); and (iv) older age (increase of 4 days). Additionally, four distinct patterns of daily app usage behavior were identified by unsupervised clustering, which were also associated with participant demographics. Most studies were not able to recruit a sample that was representative of the race/ethnicity or geographical diversity of the US. Together these findings can help inform recruitment and retention strategies to enable equitable participation of populations in future digital health research.",

With the advent of treatment for COVID-19, finding individuals infected with SARS-CoV-2 is an urgent clinical and public health priority. While these kinds of Bayesian search algorithms are used widely in other settings (eg, to find downed aircraft, in submarine recovery, and to aid in oil exploration), this is the first time that Bayesian adaptive approaches have been used for active disease surveillance in the field.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study’s objective was to evaluate a Bayesian search algorithm to target hotspots of SARS-CoV-2 transmission in the community with the goal of detecting the most cases over time across multiple locations in Columbus, Ohio, from August to October 2021.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              The algorithm used to direct pop-up SARS-CoV-2 testing for this project is based on Thompson sampling, in which the aim is to maximize the average number of new cases of SARS-CoV-2 diagnosed among a set of testing locations based on sampling from prior probability distributions for each testing site. An academic-governmental partnership between Yale University, The Ohio State University, Wake Forest University, the Ohio Department of Health, the Ohio National Guard, and the Columbus Metropolitan Libraries conducted a study of bandit algorithms to maximize the detection of new cases of SARS-CoV-2 in this Ohio city in 2021. The initiative established pop-up COVID-19 testing sites at 13 Columbus locations, including library branches, recreational and community centers, movie theaters, homeless shelters, family services centers, and community event sites. Our team conducted between 0 and 56 tests at the 16 testing events, with an overall average of 25.3 tests conducted per event and a moving average that increased over time. Small incentives—including gift cards and take-home rapid antigen tests—were offered to those who approached the pop-up sites to encourage their participation.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Over time, as expected, the Bayesian search algorithm directed testing efforts to locations with higher yields of new diagnoses. Surprisingly, the use of the algorithm also maximized the identification of cases among minority residents of underserved communities, particularly African Americans, with the pool of participants overrepresenting these people relative to the demographic profile of the local zip code in which testing sites were located.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This study demonstrated that a pop-up testing strategy using a bandit algorithm can be feasibly deployed in an urban setting during a pandemic. It is the first real-world use of these kinds of algorithms for disease surveillance and represents a key step in evaluating the effectiveness of their use in maximizing the detection of undiagnosed cases of SARS-CoV-2 and other infections, such as HIV.",

These regimes are particularly useful for managing chronic disorders and fit well into the larger paradigm of personalized medicine. They provide one way to operationalize a clinical decision support system. Statistics plays a key role in the construction of evidence-based dynamic treatment regimes—informing the best study design as well as efficient estimation and valid inference. Owing to the many novel methodological challenges this area offers, it has been growing in popularity among statisticians in recent years. In this article, we review the key developments in this exciting field of research. In particular, we discuss the sequential multiple assignment randomized trial designs, estimation techniques like Q-learning and marginal structural models, and several inference techniques designed to address the associated nonstandard asymptotics. We reference software whenever available. We also outline some important future directions.",

However, its role in CKD has not been totally elucidated. This study aimed to evaluate zonulin levels in subjects with diabetic kidney disease (DKD). This case-control study included two cases groups: 1) Advanced DKD cases: T2DM patients with estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) <60ml/min/1.73m\n              2\n              ; 2) Albuminuric T2DM cases: diabetic patients with urinary albumin excretion (UAE) >30mg/g creatinine, but with eGFR>60ml/min/1.73m\n              2\n              . Two control groups were also included: 1) T2DM controls: patients with T2DM without impaired kidney function; 2) Non-T2DM controls: subjects without T2DM and normal renal function. Serum levels of zonulin were measured by ELISA. Eighty-six individuals were included. Zonulin levels was different among study groups (P = 0.003). T2DM controls presented higher zonulin levels than non-T2DM controls [(131.35 (83.0–170.5) vs. 87.25 (54.7–111.8), P = 0.018] and advanced DKD cases [63.72 (45.03–106.0); P = 0.007]. Zonulin showed a positive correlation with eGFR (r = 0.222; P = 0.040), total cholesterol (r = 0.299; P = 0.034), LDL (r = 0.258; P = 0.021), and negative with albuminuria (r = -0.243; P = 0.024) and body fat (r = -0.271; P = 0.014). In the multivariate logistic regression analyses, zonulin levels were independently associated to renal outcomes [OR 0.99 (0.98–0.99, P = 0.012)] after 5-year inclusion. In conclusion, increased zonulin levels in patients with TD2M without renal disease suggest an impaired intestinal permeability. Moreover, its association with renal outcomes could indicate its use as a disease monitoring marker. However, the mechanisms behind this association should be better understood.",

      "abstract": "Digital mental health (DMH) interventions, such as text-message-based lessons and activities, offer immense potential for accessible mental health support. While these interventions can be effective, real-world experimental testing can further enhance their design and impact. Adaptive experimentation, utilizing algorithms like Thompson Sampling for (contextual) multi-armed bandit (MAB) problems, can lead to continuous improvement and personalization. However, it remains unclear when these algorithms can simultaneously increase user experience rewards and facilitate appropriate data collection for social-behavioral scientists to analyze with sufficient statistical confidence. Although a growing body of research addresses the practical and statistical aspects of MAB and other adaptive algorithms, further exploration is needed to assess their impact across diverse real-world contexts. This paper presents a software system developed over two years that allows text-messaging intervention components to be adapted using bandit and other algorithms while collecting data for side-by-side comparison with traditional uniform random non-adaptive experiments. We evaluate the system by deploying a text-message-based DMH intervention to 1100 users, recruited through a large mental health non-profit organization, and share the path forward for deploying this system at scale. This system not only enables applications in mental health but could also serve as a model testbed for adaptive experimentation algorithms in other domains.",

We report an open source tool to accelerate docking-based virtual screening with strong empirical performance.\n          , \n            The discovery of therapeutic molecules is fundamentally a multi-objective optimization problem. One formulation of the problem is to identify molecules that simultaneously exhibit strong binding affinity for a target protein, minimal off-target interactions, and suitable pharmacokinetic properties. Inspired by prior work that uses active learning to accelerate the identification of strong binders, we implement multi-objective Bayesian optimization to reduce the computational cost of multi-property virtual screening and apply it to the identification of ligands predicted to be selective based on docking scores to on- and off-targets. We demonstrate the superiority of Pareto optimization over scalarization across three case studies. Further, we use the developed optimization tool to search a virtual library of over 4M molecules for those predicted to be selective dual inhibitors of EGFR and IGF1R, acquiring 100% of the molecules that form the library's Pareto front after exploring only 8% of the library. This workflow and associated open source software can reduce the screening burden of molecular design projects and is complementary to research aiming to improve the accuracy of binding predictions and other molecular properties.",

The goal is to notify patients when their messages indicate an emergency, guiding them to seek immediate help rather than using the patient portal, to improve patient safety.\n            \n            \n              Materials and Methods\n              We selected 1020 messages sent to Vanderbilt University Medical Center providers between January 1, 2022 and March 7, 2023. We developed four models to triage these messages for emergencies: (1) Prompt-Only: the patient message was input with a prompt directly into the LLM; (2) Naïve Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG): provided retrieved information as context to the LLM; (3) RAG from Knowledge Graph with Local Search: a knowledge graph was used to retrieve locally relevant information based on semantic similarities; (4) RAG from Knowledge Graph with Global Search: a knowledge graph was used to retrieve globally relevant information through hierarchical community detection. The knowledge base was a triage book covering 225 protocols.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The RAG from Knowledge Graph model with global search outperformed other models, achieving an accuracy of 0.99, a sensitivity of 0.98, and a specificity of 0.99. It demonstrated significant improvements in triaging emergency messages compared to LLM without RAG and naïve RAG.\n            \n            \n              Discussion\n              The traditional LLM without any retrieval mechanism underperformed compared to models with RAG, which aligns with the expected benefits of augmenting LLMs with domain-specific knowledge sources. Our results suggest that providing external knowledge, especially in a structured manner and in community summaries, can improve LLM performance in triaging patient portal messages.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              LLMs can effectively assist in triaging emergency patient messages after integrating with a knowledge graph about a nurse triage book. Future research should focus on expanding the knowledge graph and deploying the system to evaluate its impact on patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n            The rapid advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) have led to the development of sophisticated large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 and Bard. The potential implementation of LLMs in healthcare settings has already garnered considerable attention because of their diverse applications that include facilitating clinical documentation, obtaining insurance pre-authorization, summarizing research papers, or working as a chatbot to answer questions for patients about their specific data and concerns. While offering transformative potential, LLMs warrant a very cautious approach since these models are trained differently from AI-based medical technologies that are regulated already, especially within the critical context of caring for patients. The newest version, GPT-4, that was released in March, 2023, brings the potentials of this technology to support multiple medical tasks; and risks from mishandling results it provides to varying reliability to a new level. Besides being an advanced LLM, it will be able to read texts on images and analyze the context of those images. The regulation of GPT-4 and generative AI in medicine and healthcare without damaging their exciting and transformative potential is a timely and critical challenge to ensure safety, maintain ethical standards, and protect patient privacy. We argue that regulatory oversight should assure medical professionals and patients can use LLMs without causing harm or compromising their data or privacy. This paper summarizes our practical recommendations for what we can expect from regulators to bring this vision to reality.",

Yet current assumptions are based on general-purpose LLMs such as ChatGPT, which are not developed for medical use. This study develops a generative clinical LLM, GatorTronGPT, using 277 billion words of text including (1) 82 billion words of clinical text from 126 clinical departments and approximately 2 million patients at the University of Florida Health and (2) 195 billion words of diverse general English text. We train GatorTronGPT using a GPT-3 architecture with up to 20 billion parameters and evaluate its utility for biomedical natural language processing (NLP) and healthcare text generation. GatorTronGPT improves biomedical natural language processing. We apply GatorTronGPT to generate 20 billion words of synthetic text. Synthetic NLP models trained using synthetic text generated by GatorTronGPT outperform models trained using real-world clinical text.

Questions were derived from discussions among four physician experts and prior work on race-based medical misconceptions believed by medical trainees. We assessed four large language models with nine different questions that were interrogated five times each with a total of 45 responses per model. All models had examples of perpetuating race-based medicine in their responses. Models were not always consistent in their responses when asked the same question repeatedly. LLMs are being proposed for use in the healthcare setting, with some models already connecting to electronic health record systems.

While they have received much attention and demonstrated potential in digital health, their application in mental health, particularly in clinical settings, has generated considerable debate.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This systematic review aims to critically assess the use of LLMs in mental health, specifically focusing on their applicability and efficacy in early screening, digital interventions, and clinical settings. By systematically collating and assessing the evidence from current studies, our work analyzes models, methodologies, data sources, and outcomes, thereby highlighting the potential of LLMs in mental health, the challenges they present, and the prospects for their clinical use.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Adhering to the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines, this review searched 5 open-access databases: MEDLINE (accessed by PubMed), IEEE Xplore, Scopus, JMIR, and ACM Digital Library. Keywords used were (mental health OR mental illness OR mental disorder OR psychiatry) AND (large language models). This study included articles published between January 1, 2017, and April 30, 2024, and excluded articles published in languages other than English.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              In total, 40 articles were evaluated, including 15 (38%) articles on mental health conditions and suicidal ideation detection through text analysis, 7 (18%) on the use of LLMs as mental health conversational agents, and 18 (45%) on other applications and evaluations of LLMs in mental health. LLMs show good effectiveness in detecting mental health issues and providing accessible, destigmatized eHealth services. However, assessments also indicate that the current risks associated with clinical use might surpass their benefits. These risks include inconsistencies in generated text; the production of hallucinations; and the absence of a comprehensive, benchmarked ethical framework.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This systematic review examines the clinical applications of LLMs in mental health, highlighting their potential and inherent risks. The study identifies several issues: the lack of multilingual datasets annotated by experts, concerns regarding the accuracy and reliability of generated content, challenges in interpretability due to the “black box” nature of LLMs, and ongoing ethical dilemmas. These ethical concerns include the absence of a clear, benchmarked ethical framework; data privacy issues; and the potential for overreliance on LLMs by both physicians and patients, which could compromise traditional medical practices. As a result, LLMs should not be considered substitutes for professional mental health services. However, the rapid development of LLMs underscores their potential as valuable clinical aids, emphasizing the need for continued research and development in this area.\n            \n            \n              Trial Registration\n              PROSPERO CRD42024508617; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=508617",

While outpatient portals have been extensively studied, there is a recognized need for research that examines inpatient portals.\n            Objective We conducted this study to improve our understanding about the role of a portal in the context of inpatient care. Our study focused on a large sample of the general adult inpatient population and obtained perspectives from both patients and care team members about inpatient portal use.\n            Methods We interviewed patients (n = 120) who used an inpatient portal during their hospitalization at 15 days or 6 months after discharge to learn about their portal use. We also interviewed care team members (n = 331) 4 weeks, 6 months, and 12 months after inpatient portal implementation to collect information about their ongoing perspectives about patients' use of the portal.\n            Results The perspectives of patients and care team members generally converged on their views of the inpatient portal. Three features—(1) ordering meals, (2) looking up health information, and (3) viewing the care team—were most commonly used; the secure messaging feature was less commonly used and of some concern to care team members. The inpatient portal benefited patients in four main ways: (1) promoted independence, (2) reduced anxiety, (3) informed families, and (4) increased empowerment.\n            Conclusion Inpatient portals are recognized as a tool that can enhance the delivery of patient-centered care. In addition to empowering patients by increasing their sense of control, inpatient portals can support family members and caregivers throughout the hospital stay. Given the consistency of perspectives about portal use across patients and care team members, our findings suggest that inpatient portals may facilitate shifts in organizational culture that increase the patient centeredness of care and improve patient experience in the hospital context.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              As user modification can alter the addictiveness and toxicity of electronic nicotine delivery systems (ENDS), more research is needed to understand the types, motivations, risks, and information sources that lead to these product alterations. YouTube has been identified as a major platform where ENDS users obtain and share information about ENDS products and modifications. However, a comprehensive study of ENDS modification videos on YouTube is lacking.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aimed to analyze the content of YouTube videos depicting modifications of ENDS.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              YouTube was searched in March 2019 to identify videos depicting ENDS modifications. Search terms were derived from interviews with ENDS users and current literature. We used 28 search phrases that combined the words vape and vaping with modification-related key terms (eg, custom build, modification, and dripping). The final sample included 168 videos.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Videos were 1 to 108 min long (median 9.55). Presenters were largely male (117/168, 69.6%), white (94/168, 56.0%), and older than 25 years (94/168, 56.0%). Most videos gave how to instructions (148/168, 88.1%), but few offered warnings (30/168, 17.9%) or mentioned commercial alternatives to modifications they presented (16/168, 9.5%). The ENDS devices most often featured were drippers (63/168, 37.5%) and refillable tanks (37/168, 22.0%). The most often modified ENDS components were coils (82/168, 48.8%) and e-liquids (34/168, 20.2%), which included adding other substances, such as cannabis, to the e-liquids (6/168, 3.6%). Most videos portrayed ENDS modifications positively (106/168, 63.1% positive; 60/168, 35.7% neutral; and 2/168, 1.2% negative) and were either neutral or positive in their overall portrayal of ENDS devices (78/168, 46.4% positive; 89/168, 53.0% neutral; and 1/168, 0.6% negative).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This study identified several concerning trends in popular YouTube videos on ENDS modifications, including lack of warnings, the addition of marijuana derivatives to e-liquids, and the positive portrayal of ENDS devices and modifications. By identifying the types of modifications (coil and e-liquid being the most prevalent), this study sets an agenda for research on the effects of modifications.",

Methods and Results—            In this pragmatic, single-blind, 3-arm, randomized trial (SMS-Text Adherence Support [StAR]) undertaken in South Africa, patients treated for high blood pressure were randomly allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to information only, interactive SMS text messaging, or usual care. The primary outcome was change in systolic blood pressure at 12 months from baseline measured with a validated oscillometric device. All trial staff were masked to treatment allocation. Analyses were intention to treat. Between June 26, 2012, and November 23, 2012, 1372 participants were randomized to receive information-only SMS text messages (n=457), interactive SMS text messages (n=458), or usual care (n=457). Primary outcome data were available for 1256 participants (92%). At 12 months, the mean adjusted change in systolic blood pressure compared with usual care was −2.2 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, −4.4 to −0.04) with information-only SMS and −1.6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, −3.7 to 0.6) with interactive SMS. Odds ratios for the proportion of participants with a blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg were 1.42 (95% confidence interval, 1.03–1.95) for information-only messaging and 1.41 (95% confidence interval, 1.02–1.95) for interactive messaging compared with usual care.                                Conclusions—            In this randomized trial of an automated adherence support program delivered by SMS text message in a general outpatient population of adults with high blood pressure, we found a small reduction in systolic blood pressure control compared with usual care at 12 months. There was no evidence that an interactive intervention increased this effect.

      "abstract": "Background\n              Over the past decade, a large number of mobile health (mHealth) apps have been created to help individuals to better manage their own health. However, very few of these mHealth apps were specifically designed for people with disabilities, and only a few of them have been assessed for accessibility for people with disabilities. As a result, people with disabilities have difficulties using many of these mHealth apps.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The objective of this study was to identify an approach that can be generally applied to improve the accessibility of mHealth apps.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We recruited 5 study participants with a primary diagnosis of cerebral palsy or spinal cord injury. All the participants had fine motor impairment or lack of dexterity, and hence, they had difficulties using some mHealth apps. These 5 study participants were first asked to use multiple modules in the client app of a novel mHealth system (iMHere 2.0), during which their performance was observed. Interviews were conducted post use to collect study participants’ desired accessibility features. These accessibility features were then implemented into the iMHere 2.0 client app as customizable options. The 5 participants were asked to use the same modules in the app again, and their performance was compared with that in the first round. A brief interview and a questionnaire were then performed at the end of the study to collect the 5 participants’ comments and impression of the iMHere 2.0 app in general and of the customizable accessibility features.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Study results indicate that the study participants on their first use of the iMHere 2.0 client app experienced various levels of difficulty consistent with the severity of their lack of dexterity. Their performance was improved after their desired accessibility features were added into the app, and they liked the customizable accessibility features. These participants also expressed an interest in using this mHealth system for their health self-management tasks.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The accessibility features identified in this study improved the accessibility of the mHealth app for people with dexterity issues. Our approach for improving mHealth app accessibility may also be applied to other mHealth apps to make those apps accessible to people with disabilities.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              As health care becomes more fragmented, it is even more important to focus on the provision of integrated, coordinated care between health and social care systems. With the aging population, this coordination is even more vital. Information and communication technology (ICT) can support integrated care if the form of technology follows and supports functional integration. Health TAPESTRY (Teams Advancing Patient Experience: Strengthening Quality) is a program centered on the health of older adults, supported by volunteers, primary care teams, community engagement and connections, and an ICT known as the Health TAPESTRY application (TAP-App), a web-based application that supports volunteers in completing client surveys, volunteer coordinators in managing the volunteer program, and primary care teams in requesting and receiving information.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This paper describes the development, evolution, and implementation of the TAP-App ICT to share the lessons learned.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A case study was conducted with the TAP-App as the case and the perspectives of end users and stakeholders as the units of analysis. The data consisted of researchers’ perspectives on the TAP-App from their own experiences, as well as feedback from other stakeholders and end user groups. Data were collected through written retrospective reflection with the program manager, a specific interview with the technology lead, key emailed questions to the TAP-App developer, and viewpoints and feedback during paper drafting from other research team members. There were 2 iterations of Health TAPESTRY and the TAP-App and we focused on learnings from the second implementation (2018-2020) which was a pragmatic implementation scale-up trial using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance framework at 6 primary care sites across Ontario, Canada.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              TAP-App (version 1.0), which was iteratively developed, was introduced as a tool to schedule volunteer and client visits and collect survey data using a tablet computer. TAP-App (version 2.0) was developed based on this initial experience and a desire for a program management tool that focused more on dual flow among users and provided better support for research. The themes of the lessons learned were as follows: iterative feedback is valuable; if ICT will be used for research, develop it with research in mind; prepare for challenges in the integration of ICT into the existing workflow; ask whether interoperability should be a goal; and know that technology cannot do it alone yet—the importance of human touch points.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Health TAPESTRY is human-centered. The TAP-App does not replace these elements but rather helps enable them. Despite this shift in supporting integrated care, barriers remained to the uptake of the TAP-App that would have allowed a full flow of information between health and social settings in supporting patient care. This indicates the need for an ongoing focus on the human use of ICT in similar programs.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              The use of wearables facilitates data collection at a previously unobtainable scale, enabling the construction of complex predictive models with the potential to improve health. However, the highly personal nature of these data requires strong privacy protection against data breaches and the use of data in a way that users do not intend. One method to protect user privacy while taking advantage of sharing data across users is federated learning, a technique that allows a machine learning model to be trained using data from all users while only storing a user’s data on that user’s device. By keeping data on users’ devices, federated learning protects users’ private data from data leaks and breaches on the researcher’s central server and provides users with more control over how and when their data are used. However, there are few rigorous studies on the effectiveness of federated learning in the mobile health (mHealth) domain.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              We review federated learning and assess whether it can be useful in the mHealth field, especially for addressing common mHealth challenges such as privacy concerns and user heterogeneity. The aims of this study are to describe federated learning in an mHealth context, apply a simulation of federated learning to an mHealth data set, and compare the performance of federated learning with the performance of other predictive models.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We applied a simulation of federated learning to predict the affective state of 15 subjects using physiological and motion data collected from a chest-worn device for approximately 36 minutes. We compared the results from this federated model with those from a centralized or server model and with the results from training individual models for each subject.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              In a 3-class classification problem using physiological and motion data to predict whether the subject was undertaking a neutral, amusing, or stressful task, the federated model achieved 92.8% accuracy on average, the server model achieved 93.2% accuracy on average, and the individual model achieved 90.2% accuracy on average.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Our findings support the potential for using federated learning in mHealth. The results showed that the federated model performed better than a model trained separately on each individual and nearly as well as the server model. As federated learning offers more privacy than a server model, it may be a valuable option for designing sensitive data collection methods.",

However, there are currently limited examples of such techniques being successfully deployed into clinical practice. This article explores the main challenges and limitations of AI in healthcare, and considers the steps required to translate these potentially transformative technologies from research to clinical practice.\n            \n            \n              Main body\n              Key challenges for the translation of AI systems in healthcare include those intrinsic to the science of machine learning, logistical difficulties in implementation, and consideration of the barriers to adoption as well as of the necessary sociocultural or pathway changes. Robust peer-reviewed clinical evaluation as part of randomised controlled trials should be viewed as the gold standard for evidence generation, but conducting these in practice may not always be appropriate or feasible. Performance metrics should aim to capture real clinical applicability and be understandable to intended users. Regulation that balances the pace of innovation with the potential for harm, alongside thoughtful post-market surveillance, is required to ensure that patients are not exposed to dangerous interventions nor deprived of access to beneficial innovations. Mechanisms to enable direct comparisons of AI systems must be developed, including the use of independent, local and representative test sets. Developers of AI algorithms must be vigilant to potential dangers, including dataset shift, accidental fitting of confounders, unintended discriminatory bias, the challenges of generalisation to new populations, and the unintended negative consequences of new algorithms on health outcomes.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              The safe and timely translation of AI research into clinically validated and appropriately regulated systems that can benefit everyone is challenging. Robust clinical evaluation, using metrics that are intuitive to clinicians and ideally go beyond measures of technical accuracy to include quality of care and patient outcomes, is essential. Further work is required (1) to identify themes of algorithmic bias and unfairness while developing mitigations to address these, (2) to reduce brittleness and improve generalisability, and (3) to develop methods for improved interpretability of machine learning predictions. If these goals can be achieved, the benefits for patients are likely to be transformational.",

Being the first full-scale global pandemic of the digital age, COVID-19 has presented novel challenges pertinent to government advice, the spread of news and misinformation, and the trade-off between the accessibility of science and the premature public use of unproven medical interventions. \n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aims to assess the use of internet search terms relating to COVID-19 information and misinformation during the global pandemic, identify which were most used in six affected countries, investigate any temporal trends and the likely propagators of key search terms, and determine any correlation between the per capita cases and deaths with the adoption of these search terms in each of the six countries.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              This study uses relative search volume data extracted from Google Trends for search terms linked to the COVID-19 pandemic alongside per capita case and mortality data extracted from the European Open Data Portal to identify the temporal dynamics of the spread of news and misinformation during the global pandemic in six affected countries (Australia, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States). A correlation analysis was carried out to ascertain any correlation between the temporal trends of search term use and the rise of per capita mortality and disease cases.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Of the selected search terms, most were searched immediately following promotion by governments, public figures, or viral circulation of information, but also in relation to the publication of scientific resources, which were sometimes misinterpreted before further dissemination. Strong correlations were identified between the volume of these COVID-19–related search terms (overall mean Spearman rho 0.753, SD 0.158), and per capita mortality (mean per capita deaths Spearman rho 0.690, SD 0.168) and cases (mean per capita cases Spearman rho 0.800, SD 0.112).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              These findings illustrate the increased rate and volume of the public consumption of novel information during a global health care crisis. The positive correlation between mortality and online searching, particularly in countries with lower COVID-19 testing rates, may demonstrate the imperative to safeguard official communications and dispel misinformation in these countries. Online news, government briefings, and social media provide a powerful tool for the dissemination of important information to the public during pandemics, but their misuse and the presentation of misrepresented medical information should be monitored, minimized, and addressed to safeguard public safety. Ultimately, governments, public health authorities, and scientists have a moral imperative to safeguard the truth and maintain an accessible discourse with the public to limit fear.",

Data were analyzed following deductive and inductive approaches using a priori codes and emergent coding based on the NASSS.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              We identified themes across NASSS domains: (1) Condition: The aTS was considered relevant for a range of patient needs; however, perceptions of patient suitability were guided by texting experience and clinical complexity rather than potential benefits. (2) Technology: Onboarding of the aTS presented difficulty and the staff had different opinions on incorporating patient-generated data into care planning. (3) Value: Supply-side value relied on the flexibility of the aTS and its impact on staff workload whereas demand-side value was driven by patient perceptions of the psychological and behavioral impacts of the aTS. (4) Adopters: Limited clarity on staff roles and responsibilities presented challenges in incorporating the aTS into clinical processes. (5) Organization: Staff were willing to try the aTS; however, perceptions of leadership support and clinic readiness hindered usage. (6) Wider system: Staff focused on enhancing aTS interoperability with the electronic medical record. (7) Embedding and adaptation over time: The interplay of aTS versatility, patient and staff demands, and broader societal changes in preferences for communicating health information facilitated aTS implementation.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              VHA’s new aTS has the potential to further engage patients and expand the reach of VHA care; however, patients and staff require additional support to adopt, implement, and sustain the aTS.

      "abstract": "Abstract\n            Several studies underscore the potential of deep learning in identifying complex patterns, leading to diagnostic and prognostic biomarkers. Identifying sufficiently large and diverse datasets, required for training, is a significant challenge in medicine and can rarely be found in individual institutions. Multi-institutional collaborations based on centrally-shared patient data face privacy and ownership challenges. Federated learning is a novel paradigm for data-private multi-institutional collaborations, where model-learning leverages all available data without sharing data between institutions, by distributing the model-training to the data-owners and aggregating their results. We show that federated learning among 10 institutions results in models reaching 99% of the model quality achieved with centralized data, and evaluate generalizability on data from institutions outside the federation. We further investigate the effects of data distribution across collaborating institutions on model quality and learning patterns, indicating that increased access to data through data private multi-institutional collaborations can benefit model quality more than the errors introduced by the collaborative method. Finally, we compare with other collaborative-learning approaches demonstrating the superiority of federated learning, and discuss practical implementation considerations. Clinical adoption of federated learning is expected to lead to models trained on datasets of unprecedented size, hence have a catalytic impact towards precision/personalized medicine.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              The adoption of health information technology (HIT) by health care providers is commonly believed to improve the quality of care. Policy makers in the United States and Germany follow this logic and deploy nationwide HIT adoption programs to fund hospital investments in digital technologies. However, scientific evidence for the beneficial effects of HIT on care quality at a national level remains mostly US based, is focused on electronic health records (EHRs), and rarely accounts for the quality of digitization from a hospital user perspective.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aimed to examine the effects of digitization on clinical outcomes and patient experience in German hospitals. Hence, this study adds to the small stream of literature in this field outside the United States. It goes beyond assessing the effects of mere HIT adoption and also considers user-perceived HIT value. In addition, the impact of a variety of technologies beyond EHRs was examined.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Multiple linear regression models were estimated using emergency care outcomes, elective care outcomes, and patient satisfaction as dependent variables. The adoption and user-perceived value of HIT represented key independent variables, and case volume, hospital size, ownership status, and teaching status were included as controls. Care outcomes were captured via risk-adjusted, observed-to-expected outcome ratios for patients who had stroke, myocardial infarction, or hip replacement. The German Patient Experience Questionnaire of Weisse Liste provided information on patient satisfaction. Information on the adoption and user-perceived value of 10 subdomains of HIT and EHRs was derived from the German 2020 Healthcare IT Report.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Statistical analysis was based on an overall sample of 383 German hospitals. The analyzed data set suggested no significant effect of HIT or EHR adoption on clinical outcomes or patient satisfaction. However, a higher user-perceived value or quality of the installed tools did improve outcomes. Emergency care outcomes benefited from user-friendly overall digitization (β=−.032; P=.04), which was especially driven by the user-friendliness of admission HIT (β=−.023; P=.07). Elective care outcomes were positively impacted by user-friendly EHR installations (β=−.138; P=.008). Similarly, the results suggested user-friendly, overall digitization to have a moderate positive effect on patient satisfaction (β=−.009; P=.01).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The results of this study suggest that hospital digitization is not an end in itself. Policy makers and hospitals are well advised to not only focus on the mere adoption of digital technologies but also continuously work toward digitization that is perceived as valuable by physicians and nurses who rely on it every day. Furthermore, hospital digitization strategies should consider that the assumed benefits of single technologies are not realized across all care domains.",

Digital technology can continuously measure HPA objectively, capturing nuanced measures relating to its volume, intensity, pattern, and variability.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              To understand HPA participation in people with cognitive impairment, this systematic review aims to (1) identify digital methods and protocols; (2) identify metrics used to assess HPA; (3) describe differences in HPA between people with dementia, MCI, and controls; and (4) make recommendations for measuring and reporting HPA in people with cognitive impairment.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Key search terms were input into 6 databases: Scopus, Web of Science, Psych Articles, PsychInfo, MEDLINE, and Embase. Articles were included if they included community dwellers with dementia or MCI, reported HPA metrics derived from digital technology, were published in English, and were peer reviewed. Articles were excluded if they considered populations without dementia or MCI diagnoses, were based in aged care settings, did not concern digitally derived HPA metrics, or were only concerned with physical activity interventions. Key outcomes extracted included the methods and metrics used to assess HPA and differences in HPA outcomes across the cognitive spectrum. Data were synthesized narratively. An adapted version of the National Institute of Health Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-sectional Studies was used to assess the quality of articles.

The quality assessment suggested that studies were moderate-to-good quality. Accelerometers worn on the wrist or lower back were the most prevalent methods, while metrics relating to volume (eg, daily steps) were most common for measuring HPA. People with dementia had lower volumes, intensities, and variability with different daytime patterns of HPA than controls. Findings in people with MCI varied, but they demonstrated different patterns of HPA compared to controls.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This review highlights limitations in the current literature, including lack of standardization in methods, protocols, and metrics; limited information on validity and acceptability of methods; lack of longitudinal research; and limited associations between HPA metrics and clinically meaningful outcomes. Limitations of this review include the exclusion of functional physical activity metrics (eg, sitting/standing) and non-English articles. Recommendations from this review include suggestions for measuring and reporting HPA in people with cognitive impairment and for future research including validation of methods, development of a core set of clinically meaningful HPA outcomes, and further investigation of socioecological factors that may influence HPA participation.\n            \n            \n              Trial Registration\n              PROSPERO CRD42020216744; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=216744",

      "abstract": "Blockchain technology has recently inspired remarkable attention due to its unique features, such as privacy, accountability, immutability, and anonymity, to name of the few. In contrast, core functionalities of most Internet of Things (IoT) resources make them vulnerable to security threats. The IoT devices, such as smartphones and tablets, have limited capacity in terms of network, computing, and storage, which make them easier for vulnerable threats. Furthermore, a massive amount of data produced by the IoT devices, which is still an open challenge for the existing platforms to process, analyze, and unearth underlying patterns to provide convenience environment. Therefore, a new solution is required to ensure data accountability, improve data privacy and accessibility, and extract hidden patterns and useful knowledge to provide adequate services. In this paper, we present a secure fitness framework that is based on an IoT-enabled blockchain network integrated with machine learning approaches. The proposed framework consists of two modules: a blockchain-based IoT network to provide security and integrity to sensing data as well as an enhanced smart contract enabled relationship and inference engine to discover hidden insights and useful knowledge from IoT and user device network data. The enhanced smart contract aims to support users with a practical application that provides real-time monitoring, control, easy access, and immutable logs of multiple devices that are deployed in several domains. The inference engine module aims to unearth underlying patterns and useful knowledge from IoT environment data, which helps in effective decision making to provide convenient services. For experimental analysis, we implement an intelligent fitness service that is based on an enhanced smart contract enabled relationship and inference engine as a case study where several IoT fitness devices are used to securely acquire user personalized fitness data. Furthermore, a real-time inference engine investigates user personalized data to discover useful knowledge and hidden insights. Based on inference engine knowledge, a recommendation model is developed to recommend a daily and monthly diet, as well as a workout plan for better and improved body shape. The recommendation model aims to facilitate a trainer formulating effective future decisions of trainee’s health in terms of a diet and workout plan. Lastly, for performance analysis, we have used Hyperledger Caliper to access the system performance in terms of latency, throughput, resource utilization, and varying orderer and peers nodes. The analysis results imply that the design architecture is applicable for resource-constrained IoT blockchain platform and it is extensible for different IoT scenarios.",

This manuscript reviews the proceedings of a multi-stakeholder conference to discuss the current and future state of ML for clinical research. Key areas of clinical trial methodology in which ML holds particular promise and priority areas for further investigation are presented alongside a narrative review of evidence supporting the use of ML across the clinical trial spectrum.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Conference attendees included stakeholders, such as biomedical and ML researchers, representatives from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), artificial intelligence technology and data analytics companies, non-profit organizations, patient advocacy groups, and pharmaceutical companies. ML contributions to clinical research were highlighted in the pre-trial phase, cohort selection and participant management, and data collection and analysis. A particular focus was paid to the operational and philosophical barriers to ML in clinical research. Peer-reviewed evidence was noted to be lacking in several areas.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              ML holds great promise for improving the efficiency and quality of clinical research, but substantial barriers remain, the surmounting of which will require addressing significant gaps in evidence.",

Existing medical data is not fully exploited by ML primarily because it sits in data silos and privacy concerns restrict access to this data. However, without access to sufficient data, ML will be prevented from reaching its full potential and, ultimately, from making the transition from research to clinical practice. This paper considers key factors contributing to this issue, explores how federated learning (FL) may provide a solution for the future of digital health and highlights the challenges and considerations that need to be addressed.",

Development efforts have often not included the voice and requirements of people with impairments, who make up 15% of the world’s population, despite the fact that this can help ensure broad access and utilisation. Little attention to and limited inclusion of people with impairments in the development of digital health solutions results in continued and reinforced inequalities in health services provision for people with impairments. This review investigates the needs and barriers of people with impairments related to use of digital health solutions and strategies to foster user participation, access and utilisation of digital health solutions.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              This scoping review, based on the Joanna Briggs Institute Manual, had five phases: 1) identification of aim and research questions, 2) literature search in five databases (April/May 2020), 3) literature screening based on predetermined inclusion and exclusion criteria, 4) data extraction, and (5) reporting results.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The literature search resulted in 5968 sources, of which 25 met our inclusion criteria. People with impairments appreciate digital health solutions that are designed to meet their specific impairment-related challenges. The reported needs and barriers related to technological design varied depending on the individuals’ challenges. The literature reported different types of participatory co-design strategies to foster access and utilisation of digital health solutions.\n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              This scoping review support needs for increased awareness among developers to design solutions that meet people’s needs, contexts and states of health. By applying universal design as a strategy and including people with different types of impairments, starting in the idea creation phase of digital health solutions and throughout the development, developers can design solutions with better accessibility. Digital health solutions that are accessible and usable have a tremendous opportunity to foster health equity and achieve health promotion, prevention and self-care. This in turn can contribute to closing the gap between different population groups, reduce disparities and get the most from available healthcare services.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Motivational interviewing (MI) can increase health-promoting behaviors and decrease health-damaging behaviors. However, MI is often resource intensive, precluding its use with people with limited financial or time resources. Mobile health–based versions of MI interventions or technology-delivered adaptations of MI (TAMIs) might increase reach.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              We aimed to understand the characteristics of existing TAMIs. We were particularly interested in the inclusion of people from marginalized sociodemographic groups, whether the TAMI addressed sociocontextual factors, and how behavioral and health outcomes were reported.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We employed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) guidelines for scoping reviews to conduct our scoping review. We searched PubMed, CINAHL, and PsycInfo from January 1, 1996, to April 6, 2022, to identify studies that described interventions incorporating MI into a mobile or electronic health platform. For inclusion, the study was required to (1) describe methods/outcomes of an MI intervention, (2) feature an intervention delivered automatically via a mobile or electronic health platform, and (3) report a behavioral or health outcome. The exclusion criteria were (1) publication in a language other than English and (2) description of only in-person intervention delivery (ie, no TAMI). We charted results using Excel (Microsoft Corp).\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Thirty-four studies reported the use of TAMIs. Sample sizes ranged from 10 to 2069 participants aged 13 to 70 years. Most studies (n=27) directed interventions toward individuals engaging in behaviors that increased chronic disease risk. Most studies (n=22) oversampled individuals from marginalized sociodemographic groups, but few (n=3) were designed specifically with marginalized groups in mind. TAMIs used text messaging (n=8), web-based intervention (n=22), app + text messaging (n=1), and web-based intervention + text messaging (n=3) as delivery platforms. Of the 34 studies, 30 (88%) were randomized controlled trials reporting behavioral and health-related outcomes, 23 of which reported statistically significant improvements in targeted behaviors with TAMI use. TAMIs improved targeted health behaviors in the remaining 4 studies. Moreover, 11 (32%) studies assessed TAMI feasibility, acceptability, or satisfaction, and all rated TAMIs highly in this regard. Among 20 studies with a disproportionately high number of people from marginalized racial or ethnic groups compared with the general US population, 16 (80%) reported increased engagement in health behaviors or better health outcomes. However, no TAMIs included elements that addressed sociocontextual influences on behavior or health outcomes.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Our findings suggest that TAMIs may improve some health promotion and disease management behaviors. However, few TAMIs were designed specifically for people from marginalized sociodemographic groups, and none included elements to help address sociocontextual challenges. Research is needed to determine how TAMIs affect individual health outcomes and how to incorporate elements that address sociocontextual factors, and to identify the best practices for implementing TAMIs into clinical practice.",

Secondary analyses evaluated the association between log-ins and activity within the platform and exercise, dietary, and medication adherence.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We obtained DHI data including active days, total log-ins, tasks completed, educational modules reviewed, medication adherence, and nonmonetary incentive points earned in patients undergoing standard CR following acute coronary syndrome. Linear regression followed by multivariable models were used to evaluate associations between DHI log-ins and weight loss or dietary adherence.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Participants (n=61) were 79% male (48/61) with mean age of 61.0 (SD 9.7) years. We found a significant positive association of total log-ins during CR with weight loss (r2=.10, P=.03). Educational modules viewed (r2=.11, P=.009) and tasks completed (r2=.10, P=.01) were positively significantly associated with weight loss, yet total log-ins were not significantly associated with differences in dietary adherence (r2=.05, P=.12) or improvements in minutes of exercise per week (r2=.03, P=.36).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              These data extend our previous findings and demonstrate increased DHI log-ins portend improved weight loss in patients undergoing CR after acute coronary syndrome.

There are new needs and opportunities for recommender systems to develop new models/approaches to support QS application users.\n              Recommender systems\n              can help to more easily identify relevant artifacts for users and thus improve user experiences. Currently recommender systems are widely and effectively used in the e-commerce domain (e.g., online music services, online bookstores). Next-generation QS applications could include more recommender tools for assisting the users of QS systems based on their personal self-tracking data streams from wearable electronics, biosensors, mobile phones, genomic data, and cloud-based services. In this paper, we propose three new recommendation approaches for QS applications:\n              Virtual Coach\n              ,\n              Virtual Nurse\n              , and\n              Virtual Sleep Regulator\n              which help QS users to improve their health conditions.\n              Virtual Coach\n              works like a real fitness coach to recommend personalized work-out plans whereas\n              Virtual Nurse\n              considers the medical history and health targets of a user to recommend a suitable physical activity plan.\n              Virtual Sleep Regulator\n              is specifically designed for insomnia (a kind of sleep disorder) patients to improve their sleep quality with the help of recommended physical activity and sleep plans. We explain how these proposed recommender technologies can be applied on the basis of the collected QS data to create qualitative recommendations for user needs. We present example recommendation results of\n              Virtual Sleep Regulator\n              on the basis of the dataset from a real world QS application.",

      "abstract": "Living a sedentary lifestyle is one of the major causes of numerous health problems. To encourage employees to lead a less sedentary life, the Hanze University started a health promotion program. One of the interventions in the program was the use of an activity tracker to record participants' daily step count. The daily step count served as input for a fortnightly coaching session. In this paper, we investigate the possibility of automating part of the coaching procedure on physical activity by providing personalized feedback throughout the day on a participant's progress in achieving a personal step goal. The gathered step count data was used to train eight different machine learning algorithms to make hourly estimations of the probability of achieving a personalized, daily steps threshold. In 80% of the individual cases, the Random Forest algorithm was  the best performing algorithm (mean accuracy = 0.93, range = 0.88–0.99, and mean F1-score = 0.90,  range = 0.87–0.94). To demonstrate the practical usefulness of these models, we developed a  proof-of-concept Web application that provides personalized feedback about whether a participant is expected to reach his or her daily threshold. We argue that the use of machine learning could become an invaluable asset in the process of automated personalized coaching. The individualized algorithms allow for predicting physical activity during the day and provides the possibility to intervene in time.",

      "abstract": "Natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning were used to predict suicidal ideation and heightened psychiatric symptoms among adults recently discharged from psychiatric inpatient or emergency room settings in Madrid, Spain. Participants responded to structured mental and physical health instruments at multiple follow-up points. Outcome variables of interest were suicidal ideation and psychiatric symptoms (GHQ-12). Predictor variables included structured items (e.g., relating to sleep and well-being) and responses to one unstructured question, “how do you feel today?” We compared NLP-based models using the unstructured question with logistic regression prediction models using structured data. The PPV, sensitivity, and specificity for NLP-based models of suicidal ideation were 0.61, 0.56, and 0.57, respectively, compared to 0.73, 0.76, and 0.62 of structured data-based models. The PPV, sensitivity, and specificity for NLP-based models of heightened psychiatric symptoms (GHQ-12 ≥ 4) were 0.56, 0.59, and 0.60, respectively, compared to 0.79, 0.79, and 0.85 in structured models. NLP-based models were able to generate relatively high predictive values based solely on responses to a simple general mood question. These models have promise for rapidly identifying persons at risk of suicide or psychological distress and could provide a low-cost screening alternative in settings where lengthy structured item surveys are not feasible.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE:\n              Few studies have tested the impact of motivational interviewing (MI) delivered by primary care providers on pediatric obesity. This study tested the efficacy of MI delivered by providers and registered dietitians (RDs) to parents of overweight children aged 2 through 8.\n            \n            \n              METHODS:\n              Forty-two practices from the Pediatric Research in Office Settings Network of the American Academy of Pediatrics were randomly assigned to 1 of 3 groups. Group 1 (usual care) measured BMI percentile at baseline and 1- and 2-year follow-up. Group 2 (provider only) delivered 4 MI counseling sessions to parents of the index child over 2 years. Group 3 (provider + RD) delivered 4 provider MI sessions plus 6 MI sessions from a RD. The primary outcome was child BMI percentile at 2-year follow up.\n            \n            \n              RESULTS:\n              At 2-year follow-up, the adjusted BMI percentile was 90.3, 88.1, and 87.1 for groups 1, 2, and 3, respectively. The group 3 mean was significantly (P = .02) lower than group 1. Mean changes from baseline in BMI percentile were 1.8, 3.8, and 4.9 across groups 1, 2, and 3.\n            \n            \n              CONCLUSIONS:\n              MI delivered by providers and RDs (group 3) resulted in statistically significant reductions in BMI percentile. Research is needed to determine the clinical significance and persistence of the BMI effects observed. How the intervention can be brought to scale (in particular, how to train physicians to use MI effectively and how best to train RDs and integrate them into primary care settings) also merits future research.",

      "abstract": "Objective\nMobile Health (mHealth) refers to using mobile devices to support health. This study aimed to identify specific methodological challenges in systematic reviews (SRs) of mHealth interventions and to develop guidance for addressing selected challenges. Study Design and Setting: Two-phase participatory research project. First, we sent an online survey to corresponding authors of SRs of mHealth interventions. On a five-category scale, survey respondents rated how challenging they found 24 methodological aspects in SRs of mHealth interventions compared to non-mHealth intervention SRs. Second, a subset of survey respondents participated in an online workshop to discuss recommendations to address the most challenging methodological aspects identified in the survey. Finally, consensus-based recommendations were developed based on the workshop discussion and subsequent interaction via email with the workshop participants and two external mHealth SR authors.\nResults\nWe contacted 953 corresponding authors of mHealth intervention SRs, of whom 50 (5 %) completed the survey. All the respondents identified at least one methodological aspect as more or much more challenging in mHealth intervention SRs than in non-mHealth SRs. A median of 11 (IQR 7.25–15) out of 24 aspects (46 %) were rated as more or much more challenging. Those most frequently reported were: defining intervention intensity and components (85 %), extracting mHealth intervention details (71 %), dealing with dynamic research with evolving interventions (70 %), assessing intervention integrity (69 %), defining the intervention (66 %) and maintaining an updated review (65 %). Eleven survey respondents participated in the workshop (five had authored more than three mHealth SRs). Eighteen consensus-based recommendations were developed to address issues related to mHealth intervention integrity and to keep mHealth SRs up to date.\nConclusion\nmHealth SRs present specific methodological challenges compared to non-mHealth interventions, particularly related to intervention integrity and keeping SRs current. Our recommendations for addressing these challenges can improve mHealth SRs.",

In addition, digital technology is optimising the potential for improved clinical decision-making, treatment options and communication among providers. We also explore the challenges and limitations associated with digital health literacy, including issues related to access, reliability and privacy.

Even though AI-driven systems have been shown to outperform humans in certain analytical tasks, the lack of explainability continues to spark criticism. Yet, explainability is not a purely technological issue, instead it invokes a host of medical, legal, ethical, and societal questions that require thorough exploration. This paper provides a comprehensive assessment of the role of explainability in medical AI and makes an ethical evaluation of what explainability means for the adoption of AI-driven tools into clinical practice.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Taking AI-based clinical decision support systems as a case in point, we adopted a multidisciplinary approach to analyze the relevance of explainability for medical AI from the technological, legal, medical, and patient perspectives. Drawing on the findings of this conceptual analysis, we then conducted an ethical assessment using the “Principles of Biomedical Ethics” by Beauchamp and Childress (autonomy, beneficence, nonmaleficence, and justice) as an analytical framework to determine the need for explainability in medical AI.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Each of the domains highlights a different set of core considerations and values that are relevant for understanding the role of explainability in clinical practice. From the technological point of view, explainability has to be considered both in terms how it can be achieved and what is beneficial from a development perspective. When looking at the legal perspective we identified informed consent, certification and approval as medical devices, and liability as core touchpoints for explainability. Both the medical and patient perspectives emphasize the importance of considering the interplay between human actors and medical AI. We conclude that omitting explainability in clinical decision support systems poses a threat to core ethical values in medicine and may have detrimental consequences for individual and public health.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              To ensure that medical AI lives up to its promises, there is a need to sensitize developers, healthcare professionals, and legislators to the challenges and limitations of opaque algorithms in medical AI and to foster multidisciplinary collaboration moving forward.",

Challenges in summarizing and representing patient data prevent widespread practice of predictive modeling using EHRs. Here we present a novel unsupervised deep feature learning method to derive a general-purpose patient representation from EHR data that facilitates clinical predictive modeling. In particular, a three-layer stack of denoising autoencoders was used to capture hierarchical regularities and dependencies in the aggregated EHRs of about 700,000 patients from the Mount Sinai data warehouse. The result is a representation we name “deep patient”. We evaluated this representation as broadly predictive of health states by assessing the probability of patients to develop various diseases. We performed evaluation using 76,214 test patients comprising 78 diseases from diverse clinical domains and temporal windows. Our results significantly outperformed those achieved using representations based on raw EHR data and alternative feature learning strategies. Prediction performance for severe diabetes, schizophrenia, and various cancers were among the top performing. These findings indicate that deep learning applied to EHRs can derive patient representations that offer improved clinical predictions, and could provide a machine learning framework for augmenting clinical decision systems.",

MI has been widely applied to in-person–delivered, health behavior change interventions; however, mobile health (mHealth) interventions are beginning to adopt and expand the reach of MI in health promotion practice with the use of mobile phones and digital platforms. This study examines whether the use of MI skills (e.g., OARS [open-ended questions, affirmations, reflective listening, and summaries]) promotes change talk in an SMS text messaging intervention for young people living with HIV in San Francisco. We undertake a novel method of analyzing text message intervention data in order to characterize the microprocesses of change talk. Data were collected via computer-assisted self-interviewing surveys of self-reported sociodemographic information, and two-way text messages facilitated by a digital HIV care navigator during the 6-month intervention. We qualitatively assessed all text messages exchanged for the utilization of four basic MI skills on the part of the interventionist (OARS) and participant change talk. This study found that high levels of all four MI skills—and moderate levels of open-ended questions only—were associated with more change talk compared to low levels. Additionally, using three or more MI skills was associated with change talk. Future research is needed to inform how to analyze large amounts of data passively collected as a native part of implementing mHealth and text messaging applications of MI interventions.",

      "abstract": "Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI) is an emerging technique with great potential to support health behavior by providing the right type and amount of support at the right time. A crucial aspect of JITAIs is properly timing the delivery of interventions, to ensure that a user is receptive and ready to process and use the support provided. Some prior works have explored the association of context and some user-specific traits on receptivity, and have built post-study machine-learning models to detect receptivity. For effective intervention delivery, however, a JITAI system needs to make in-the-moment decisions about a user's receptivity. To this end, we conducted a study in which we deployed machine-learning models to detect receptivity in the natural environment, i.e., in free-living conditions.\n            We leveraged prior work regarding receptivity to JITAIs and deployed a chatbot-based digital coach - Ally - that provided physical-activity interventions and motivated participants to achieve their step goals. We extended the original Ally app to include two types of machine-learning model that used contextual information about a person to predict when a person is receptive: a static model that was built before the study started and remained constant for all participants and an adaptive model that continuously learned the receptivity of individual participants and updated itself as the study progressed. For comparison, we included a control model that sent intervention messages at random times. The app randomly selected a delivery model for each intervention message. We observed that the machine-learning models led up to a 40% improvement in receptivity as compared to the control model. Further, we evaluated the temporal dynamics of the different models and observed that receptivity to messages from the adaptive model increased over the course of the study.",

      "abstract": "AbstractHealth promotion interventions offer great potential in advocating a healthy lifestyle and the prevention of diseases. Some barriers to communicating health promotion to people of certain cultural groups might be overcome via the internet- and mobile-based interventions (IMI). This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the effectiveness of culturally adapted IMI for health promotion interventions among culturally diverse populations. We systematically searched on Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EbscoHost/MEDLINE, Ovid/Embase, EbscoHost/PsychINFO, and Web of Science databases in October 2020. Out of 9438 records, 13 randomized controlled trials (RCT) investigating culturally adapted health promotion IMI addressing healthy eating, physical activity, alcohol consumption, sexual health behavior, and smoking cessation included. From the included studies 10,747 participants were eligible. Culturally adapted IMI proved to be non-superior over active control conditions in short- (g = 0.10, [95% CI −0.19 to 0.40]) and long-term (g = 0.20, [95% CI −0.11 to 0.51]) in promoting health behavior. However, culturally adapted IMI for physical activity (k = 3, N = 296) compared to active controls yielded a beneficial effect in long-term (g = 0.48, [95%CI 0.25 to 0.71]). Adapting health promotion IMI to the cultural context of different cultural populations seems not yet to be recommendable given the substantial adaption efforts necessary and the mostly non-significant findings. However, these findings need to be seen as preliminary given the limited number of included trials with varying methodological rigor and the partly substantial between-trial heterogeneity pointing in the direction of potentially useful culturally adapted IMI which now need to be disentangled from the less promising approaches.PROSPERO registration number: 42020152939",

Adherence and effectiveness of the adapted IMI seemed similar to the original IMI; yet, no included study conducted a direct comparison.

A systematic review was conducted to assess the effectiveness of MI in healthcare settings and to consider its relevance for multimorbidity. Twelve meta-analyses pertinent to multimorbidity lifestyle factors were identified.

In phase 2, we conducted an open trial of T2C comprising adolescents with depression referred to mental health care (n=43) and their parents or caregivers (n=28). We assessed usability by examining program engagement, usability ratings, and qualitative feedback at the 4-week follow-up.

Overall, 52% (22/42) of the adolescents who completed follow-up reported that they had attended an appointment with a mental health care specialist. Of the 20 adolescents who had not attended a mental health care appointment, 5% (1/20) reported that it was scheduled for a future date, 10% (2/20) reported that the primary care site did not have the ability to help them schedule a mental health care appointment, and 15% (3/20) reported that they were no longer interested in receiving mental health care.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The findings from this study suggest that T2C is acceptable to adolescents with depression and most parents or caregivers; it is used at high rates; and it may be helpful to reduce cognitive barriers to mental health care initiation.",

Teenagers in the intervention group received motivational interviewing, and the control group received support visits. All participants received individual sessions over 12 months. The main outcome measures assessed at baseline, 6, 12, and 24 months were serum A1C and psychosocial self-report questionnaires including quality of life and well-being measures.\n            RESULTS—At 12 months, 60 patients had complete data. At the end of the intervention (12 months), the mean A1C in the motivational interviewing group was significantly lower than in the control group (P = 0.04), after adjusting for baseline values. At 24 months (when n = 47), this difference in A1C was maintained (P = 0.003). There were differences in psychosocial variables at 12 months, with the motivational interviewing group indicating more positive well-being, improved quality of life, and differences in their personal models of illness (all P &lt; 0.01). Some of these differences were maintained at 24 months.\n            CONCLUSIONS—Motivational interviewing can be an effective method of facilitating behavioral changes in teenagers with type 1 diabetes with subsequent improvement in their glycemic control.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Digital health interventions (DHIs) are poised to reduce target symptoms in a scalable, affordable, and empirically supported way. DHIs that involve coaching or clinical support often collect text data from 2 sources: (1) open correspondence between users and the trained practitioners supporting them through a messaging system and (2) text data recorded during the intervention by users, such as diary entries. Natural language processing (NLP) offers methods for analyzing text, augmenting the understanding of intervention effects, and informing therapeutic decision making.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aimed to present a technical framework that supports the automated analysis of both types of text data often present in DHIs. This framework generates text features and helps to build statistical models to predict target variables, including user engagement, symptom change, and therapeutic outcomes.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We first discussed various NLP techniques and demonstrated how they are implemented in the presented framework. We then applied the framework in a case study of the Healthy Body Image Program, a Web-based intervention trial for eating disorders (EDs). A total of 372 participants who screened positive for an ED received a DHI aimed at reducing ED psychopathology (including binge eating and purging behaviors) and improving body image. These users generated 37,228 intervention text snippets and exchanged 4285 user-coach messages, which were analyzed using the proposed model.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              We applied the framework to predict binge eating behavior, resulting in an area under the curve between 0.57 (when applied to new users) and 0.72 (when applied to new symptom reports of known users). In addition, initial evidence indicated that specific text features predicted the therapeutic outcome of reducing ED symptoms.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The case study demonstrates the usefulness of a structured approach to text data analytics. NLP techniques improve the prediction of symptom changes in DHIs. We present a technical framework that can be easily applied in other clinical trials and clinical presentations and encourage other groups to apply the framework in similar contexts.",

      "abstract": "Background            Mobile ecological momentary assessment (mEMA) permits real-time capture of self-reported participant behaviors and perceptual experiences. Reporting of mEMA protocols and compliance has been identified as problematic within systematic reviews of children, youth, and specific clinical populations of adults.                                Objective            This study aimed to describe the use of mEMA for self-reported behaviors and psychological constructs, mEMA protocol and compliance reporting, and associations between key components of mEMA protocols and compliance in studies of nonclinical and clinical samples of adults.                                Methods            In total, 9 electronic databases were searched (2006-2016) for observational studies reporting compliance to mEMA for health-related data from adults (>18 years) in nonclinical and clinical settings. Screening and data extraction were undertaken by independent reviewers, with discrepancies resolved by consensus. Narrative synthesis described participants, mEMA target, protocol, and compliance. Random effects meta-analysis explored factors associated with cohort compliance (monitoring duration, daily prompt frequency or schedule, device type, training, incentives, and burden score). Random effects analysis of variance (P≤.05) assessed differences between nonclinical and clinical data sets.                                Results            Of the 168 eligible studies, 97/105 (57.7%) reported compliance in unique data sets (nonclinical=64/105 [61%], clinical=41/105 [39%]). The most common self-reported mEMA target was affect (primary target: 31/105, 29.5% data sets; secondary target: 50/105, 47.6% data sets). The median duration of the mEMA protocol was 7 days (nonclinical=7, clinical=12). Most protocols used a single time-based (random or interval) prompt type (69/105, 65.7%); median prompt frequency was 5 per day. The median number of items per prompt was similar for nonclinical (8) and clinical data sets (10). More than half of the data sets reported mEMA training (84/105, 80%) and provision of participant incentives (66/105, 62.9%). Less than half of the data sets reported number of prompts delivered (22/105, 21%), answered (43/105, 41%), criterion for valid mEMA data (37/105, 35.2%), or response latency (38/105, 36.2%). Meta-analysis (nonclinical=41, clinical=27) estimated an overall compliance of 81.9% (95% CI 79.1-84.4), with no significant difference between nonclinical and clinical data sets or estimates before or after data exclusions. Compliance was associated with prompts per day and items per prompt for nonclinical data sets. Although widespread heterogeneity existed across analysis (I2>90%), no compelling relationship was identified between key features of mEMA protocols representing burden and mEMA compliance.                                Conclusions            In this 10-year sample of studies using the mEMA of self-reported health-related behaviors and psychological constructs in adult nonclinical and clinical populations, mEMA was applied across contexts and health conditions and to collect a range of health-related data. There was inconsistent reporting of compliance and key features within protocols, which limited the ability to confidently identify components of mEMA schedules likely to have a specific impact on compliance.",

      "abstract": "Background.\n              Lebanon has a need for innovative approaches to increase access to mental health care to meet the country's current high demand. E-mental health has been included in its national mental health strategy while in parallel the World Health Organization has produced an online intervention called ‘Step-by-Step’ to treat symptoms of depression that is being tested in Lebanon over the coming years.\n            \n            \n              Aim.\n              The primary aim of this study is to conduct bottom-up, community-driven qualitative cognitive interviewing from a multi-stakeholder perspective to inform the cultural adaptation of an Internet-delivered mental health intervention based on behavioural activation in Lebanon.\n            \n            \n              Methods.\n              National Mental Health Programme staff conducted a total of 11 key informant interviews with three mental health professionals, six front-line workers in primary health care centres (PHCCs) and two community members. Also, eight focus group discussions, one with seven front-line workers and seven others with a total of 66 community members (Lebanese, Syrians and Palestinians) were conducted in several PHCCs to inform the adaptation of Step-by-Step. Results were transcribed and analysed thematically by the project coordinator and two research assistants.\n            \n            \n              Results.\n              Feedback generated from the cognitive interviewing mainly revolved around amending the story, illustrations and the delivery methods to ensure relevance and sensitivity to the local context. The results obtained have informed major edits to the content of Step-by-Step and also to the model of provision. Notably, the intervention was made approximately 30% shorter; it includes additional videos of content alongside the originally proposed comic book-style delivery; there is less emphasis on total inactivity as a symptom of low mood and more focus on enjoyable activities to lift mood; the story and ways to contact participants to provide support were updated in line with local gender norms; and many of the suggested or featured activities have been revised in line with suggestions from community members.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions.\n              These findings promote and advocate the use of community-driven adaptation of evidence-based psychological interventions. Some of the phenomena recorded mirror findings from other research about barriers to care seeking in the region and so changes made to the intervention should be useful in improving utility and uptake of ‘Step-by-Step’.",

      "abstract": "AbstractDifferences in the access and use of digital health interventions are driven by culture, in addition to economic and physical factors. To avoid the systematic exclusion of traditionally underserved cultural groups, creating inclusive digital health interventions is essential. One way to achieve this is through cultural adaptations, defined as the systematic modification of an existing intervention that aligns with a target audience’s cultural norms, beliefs, and values. In theory, cultural adaptations can potentially increase the reach and engagement of digital health interventions. However, the evidence of whether and how that is achieved is limited. Justifying, planning, and implementing an adaptation comes with various challenges and takes time and money. This perspective provides a critical overview of the field’s current state and emphasizes the need for technology-specific frameworks that address when and how to culturally adapt digital health interventions.",

This disease has a mortality rate of about 3·7 percent, and successful therapy is desperately needed to combat it. The exact cellular mechanisms of COVID-19 need to be illustrated in detail. This study aimed to evaluate serum cytokines in COVID-19 patients. In this study, serum was collected from volunteer individuals, moderate COVID-19 patients, severe cases of COVID-19 patients, and patients who recovered from COVID-19 (n = 122). The serum concentrations of interleukins such as IL-1, IL-4, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, and tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-α), were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA). The concentrations of IL-1 and TNF-α were did not differ significantly among groups. However, the concentration of IL-6 was significantly higher in moderate COVID-19 and severe cases of COVID-19 groups compared to control and recovered groups indicating it to be an independent predictor in the coronavirus disease. The levels of IFN-γ and IL-4 were significantly lower in the recovery group than the severe case of the COVID-19 group. In contrast, the level of IL-10 in recovered COVID-19 patients was significantly higher in compare to severe cases, COVID-19 patients. Varying levels of cytokines were detected in COVID-19 group than control group suggesting distinct immunoregulatory mechanisms involved in COVID-19 pathogenesis. However, additional investigations are needed to be to be performed to understand the exact cellular mechanism of this disease.",

However, many of these improvements are not incorporated into everyday practice. When designing new health systems, products, and services, involving members of the healthcare community and the public with personal healthcare experience can help to make sure that improvements will be useful and relevant to others like them.\n              \n                Methods\n              \n              Together with healthcare workers and family members with healthcare experience, we developed and applied a step-by-step guide to involving those with personal experience in the design of health system improvements.\n              \n                Results\n              \n              Our guide has three phases— ‘Pre-Design’, ‘Co-Design’, and ‘Post-Design’. This paper describes each of these phases and illustrates how we applied them to our own project, which is to use virtual healthcare methods to improve care for children with chronic healthcare conditions and their families. In our own work, we found that healthcare workers and family members with personal healthcare experiences were able to use their knowledge and creativity to help us imagine how to improve care for children with chronic healthcare conditions and their families. We have created action items from these family member- and healthcare worker-identified needs, which we will use to shape our virtual healthcare system.\n              \n                Conclusions\n              \n              This paper may be useful for those seeking to involve members of the healthcare community and the public in the creation of better healthcare systems, products, and services.\n            \n            \n              Abstract\n              \n                Background\n              \n              Challenges with the adoption, scale, and spread of health innovations represent significant gaps in the evidence-to-practice cycle. In the health innovation design process, a lack of attention paid to the needs of end-users, and subsequent tailoring of innovations to meet these needs, is a possible reason for this deficit. In the creative field of health innovation, which includes the design of healthcare products, systems (governance and organization mechanisms), and services (delivery mechanisms), a framework for both soliciting the needs of end-users and translating these needs into the design of health innovations is needed.\n              \n                Methods\n              \n              To address this gap, our team developed and applied a seven-step methodological framework, called A Generative Co-Design Framework for Healthcare Innovation.

In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical and analytical study of bias in PI systems, including biases in raw data and in the entire machine learning life cycle. We use the most detailed framework to date for exploring the different sources of bias and find that biases exist both in the data generation and the model learning and implementation streams. According to our results, the most affected minority groups are users with health issues, such as diabetes, joint issues, and hypertension, and female users, whose data biases are propagated or even amplified by learning models, while intersectional biases can also be observed.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is a major cause of disability and mortality globally. Premature fatal and non-fatal CVD is considered to be largely preventable through the control of risk factors by lifestyle modifications and preventive medication. Lipid-lowering and antihypertensive drug therapies for primary prevention are cost-effective in reducing CVD morbidity and mortality among high-risk people and are recommended by international guidelines. However, adherence to medication prescribed for the prevention of CVD can be poor. Approximately 9% of CVD cases in the EU are attributed to poor adherence to vascular medications. Low-cost, scalable interventions to improve adherence to medications for the primary prevention of CVD have potential to reduce morbidity, mortality and healthcare costs associated with CVD.\nOBJECTIVES: To establish the effectiveness of interventions delivered by mobile phone to improve adherence to medication prescribed for the primary prevention of CVD in adults.\nSEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, MEDLINE, Embase, and two other databases on 7 January 2020. We also searched two clinical trials registers on 5 February 2020. We searched reference lists of relevant papers. We applied no language or date restrictions.\nSELECTION CRITERIA: We included randomised controlled trials investigating interventions delivered wholly or partly by mobile phones to improve adherence to cardiovascular medications prescribed for the primary prevention of CVD. We only included trials with a minimum of one-year follow-up in order that the outcome measures related to longer-term, sustained medication adherence behaviours and outcomes. Eligible comparators were usual care or control groups receiving no mobile phone-delivered component of the intervention.\nDATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard methodological procedures recommended by Cochrane. The main outcomes of interest were objective measures of medication adherence (blood pressure (BP) and cholesterol), CVD events, and adverse events. We contacted study authors for further information when this was not reported.\nMAIN RESULTS: We included 14 trials with 25,633 randomised participants. Participants were recruited from community-based primary and tertiary care or outpatient clinics. The interventions varied widely from those delivered solely through short messaging service (SMS) to those involving a combination of modes of delivery, such as SMS in addition to healthcare worker training, face-to-face counselling, electronic pillboxes, written materials, and home blood pressure monitors. Some interventions only targeted medication adherence, while others additionally targeted lifestyle changes such as diet and exercise. Due to heterogeneity in the nature and delivery of the interventions and study populations, we reported most results narratively, with the exception of two trials which were similar enough to meaningfully pool in meta-analyses. The body of evidence for the effect of mobile phone-based interventions on objective outcomes of adherence (BP and cholesterol) was of low certainty, due to most trials being at high risk of bias, and inconsistency in outcome effects. Two trials were at low risk of bias. Among five trials (total study enrolment: 5441 participants) recording low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), two studies found evidence for a small beneficial intervention effect on reducing LDL-C (-5.30 mg/dL, 95% confidence interval (CI) -8.30 to -2.30; and -9.20 mg/dL, 95% CI -17.70 to -0.70). The other three studies found results varying from a small reduction (-7.7 mg/dL) to a small increase in LDL-C (0.77 mg/dL). All of which had wide confidence intervals that included no effect. Across 13 studies (25,166 participants) measuring systolic blood pressure, effect estimates ranged from a large reduction (MD -12.45 mmHg, 95% CI -15.02 to -9.88) to a small increase (MD 2.80 mmHg, 95% CI 0.30 to 5.30). We found a similar range of effect estimates for diastolic BP, ranging from -12.23 mmHg (95% CI 14.03 to -10.43) to 1.64 mmHg (95% CI -0.55 to 3.83) (11 trials, 19,716 participants). Four trials showed intervention benefits for systolic and diastolic BP with confidence intervals excluding no effect, and among these were all three of the trials evaluating self-monitoring of blood pressure with mobile phone-based telemedicine. The fourth trial included SMS and provider support (with additional varied features). Seven studies (19,185 participants) reported 'controlled' BP as an outcome, and intervention effect estimates varied from negligible effects (odds ratio (OR) 1.01, 95% CI 0.76 to 1.34) to large improvements in BP control (OR 2.41, 95% CI: 1.57 to 3.68). The three trials of clinician training or decision support combined with SMS (with additional varied features) had confidence intervals encompassing benefits and harms, with point estimates close to zero. Pooled analyses of the two trials of interventions solely delivered through SMS were indicative of little or no beneficial intervention effect on systolic BP (MD -1.55 mmHg, 95% CI -3.36 to 0.25; I2 = 0%) and small increases in controlled BP (OR 1.32, 95% CI 1.06 to 1.65; I2 = 0%). Based on four studies (12,439 participants), there was very low-certainty evidence (downgraded twice for imprecision and once for risk of bias) relating to the intervention effect on combined (fatal and non-fatal) CVD events. Two studies (2535 participants) provided low-certainty evidence for the effect of the intervention on cognitive outcomes, with little or no difference between trial arms for perceived quality of care and satisfaction with treatment. There was moderate-certainty evidence (downgraded due to risk of bias) that the interventions did not cause harm, based on six studies (8285 participants). Three studies reported no adverse events attributable to the intervention. One study reported no difference between groups in experience of adverse effects of statins, and that no participants reported intervention-related adverse events. One study stated that potential side effects were similar between groups. One study reported a similar number of deaths in each arm, but did not provide further information relating to potential adverse events.\nAUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: There is low-certainty evidence on the effects of mobile phone-delivered interventions to increase adherence to medication prescribed for the primary prevention of CVD. Trials of BP self-monitoring with mobile-phone telemedicine support reported modest benefits. One trial at low risk of bias reported modest reductions in LDL cholesterol but no benefits for BP. There is moderate-certainty evidence that these interventions do not result in harm. Further trials of these interventions are warranted.",

However, most texting interventions are neither tested nor designed with diverse end users, which could reduce their impact, and there is limited evidence regarding the optimal design methodology of health text messages tailored to low-income, low–health literacy populations and non-English speakers.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aims to combine participant feedback, crowdsourced data, and researcher expertise to develop motivational text messages in English and Spanish that will be used in a smartphone app–based texting intervention that seeks to encourage physical activity in low-income minority patients with diabetes diagnoses and depression symptoms.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              The design process consisted of 5 phases and was iterative in nature, given that the findings from each step informed the subsequent steps. First, we designed messages to increase physical activity based on the behavior change theory and knowledge from the available evidence. Second, using user-centered design methods, we refined these messages after a card sorting task and semistructured interviews (N=10) and evaluated their likeability during a usability testing phase of the app prototype (N=8). Third, the messages were tested by English- and Spanish-speaking participants on the Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk) crowdsourcing platform (N=134). Participants on MTurk were asked to categorize the messages into overarching theoretical categories based on the capability, opportunity, motivation, and behavior framework. Finally, each coauthor rated the messages for their overall quality from 1 to 5. All messages were written at a sixth-grade or lower reading level and culturally adapted and translated into neutral Spanish by bilingual research staff.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A total of 200 messages were iteratively refined according to the feedback from target users gathered through user-centered design methods, crowdsourced results of a categorization test, and an expert review. User feedback was leveraged to discard unappealing messages and edit the thematic aspects of messages that did not resonate well with the target users. Overall, 54 messages were sorted into the correct theoretical categories at least 50% of the time in the MTurk categorization tasks and were rated 3.5 or higher by the research team members. These were included in the final text message bank, resulting in 18 messages per motivational category.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              By using an iterative process of expert opinion, feedback from participants that were reflective of our target study population, crowdsourcing, and feedback from the research team, we were able to acquire valuable inputs for the design of motivational text messages developed in English and Spanish with a low literacy level to increase physical activity. We describe the design considerations and lessons learned for the text messaging development process and provide a novel, integrative framework for future developers of health text messaging interventions.",

Young people are establishing behaviors that will contribute to the quality of their health later in life, and thus understanding their particular perspectives and receptivity to digital technologies for health promotion is crucial. With this review we aimed to synthesize the published literature reporting perspectives on digital health promotion (DHP) from adolescents and young adults worldwide.\nMethods We conducted a scoping review of the literature on five research databases. We included papers which defined a target population of young people, and encompassed qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods studies. Two independent reviewers thematically analyzed the included publications and provided both a quantitative and a narrative synthesis of the views of youth (namely opportunities and concerns) on digital health promotion.\nResults We retrieved and analyzed 50 studies which met our inclusion and exclusion criteria. The large majority of these studies were conducted in high-income countries, while only a few collected the perspectives of youth in lowor middle-income countries. Findings revealed the importance of certain technology features, such as user interface design, as well as the significance of lack of personalization or user experience friction, for example, as deterrents to engagement with DHP tools. Ethically relevant aspects, such as those related to privacy or scientific reliability of the tools, did not receive much attention from youth. Yet, DHP for particularly sensitive areas of health elicited more frequent concerns about data security and evidence of effectiveness.\nConclusions Young people express distinct opinions and preferences concerning the use of digital technologies for health promotion. Our review identified a general appreciation and receptivity on the part of adolescents and young adults towards these technologies, even when taking potential risks into account.",

However, such programs have not been widely translated into routine care.We aimed to examine the implementation and utility of a customized SMS text message-based support program for patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D), coronary heart disease, or both within a chronic disease integrated care program.We conducted a 6-month pragmatic parallel-group, single-blind randomized controlled trial that recruited people with T2D or coronary heart disease. Intervention participants received 4 semipersonalized SMS text messages per week providing self-management support to supplement standard care. Preprogrammed algorithms customized content based on participant characteristics, and the messages were sent at random times of the day and in random order by a fully automated SMS text messaging engine. Control participants received standard care and only administrative SMS text messages. The primary outcome was systolic blood pressure. Evaluations were conducted face to face whenever possible by researchers blinded to randomization. Participants with T2D were evaluated for glycated hemoglobin level. Participant-reported experience measures were evaluated using questionnaires and focus groups and summarized using proportions and thematic analysis.A total of 902 participants were randomized (n=448, 49.7% to the intervention group and n=454, 50.3% to the control group). Primary outcome data were available for 89.5% (807/902) of the participants. At 6 months, there was no difference in systolic blood pressure between the intervention and control arms (adjusted mean difference=0.9 mm Hg, 95% CI -1.1 to 2.1; P=.38). Of 642 participants with T2D, there was no difference in glycated hemoglobin (adjusted mean difference=0.1%, 95% CI -0.1% to 0.3%; P=.35). Self-reported medication adherence was better in the intervention group (relative risk=0.82, 95% CI 0.68-1.00; P=.045). Participants reported that the SMS text messages were useful (298/344, 86.6%) and easily understood (336/344, 97.7%) and motivated change (217/344, 63.1%). The lack of bidirectional messaging was identified as a barrier.The intervention did not improve blood pressure in this cohort, possibly because of high clinician commitment to improved routine patient care as part of the chronic disease management program as well as favorable baseline metrics. There was high program engagement, acceptability, and perceived value. Feasibility as part of an integrated care program was demonstrated.

Objective            The aim of this study was to conduct a network meta-analysis (NMA) to compare and rank the efficacy of various eHealth interventions in improving medication adherence among patients with cardiovascular diseases (CVDs).                                Methods            A systematic search strategy was conducted in PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane, China National Knowledge Infrastructure Library (CNKI), China Science and Technology Journal Database (Weipu), and WanFang databases to search for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published from their inception on January 15, 2024. We carried out a frequentist NMA to compare the efficacy of various eHealth interventions. The quality of the literature was assessed using the risk of bias tool from the Cochrane Handbook (version 2.0), and extracted data were analyzed using Stata16.0 (StataCorp LLC) and RevMan5.4 software (Cochrane Collaboration). The certainty of evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluations (GRADE) approach.                                Results            A total of 21 RCTs involving 3904 patients were enrolled. The NMA revealed that combined interventions (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.89, 95% CI 0.22-1.57), telephone support (SMD 0.68, 95% CI 0.02-1.33), telemonitoring interventions (SMD 0.70, 95% CI 0.02-1.39), and mobile phone app interventions (SMD 0.65, 95% CI 0.01-1.30) were statistically superior to usual care. However, SMS compared to usual care showed no statistical difference. Notably, the combined intervention, with a surface under the cumulative ranking curve of 79.3%, appeared to be the most effective option for patients with CVDs. Regarding systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure outcomes, the combined intervention also had the highest probability of being the best intervention.                                Conclusions            The research indicates that the combined intervention (SMS text messaging and telephone support) has the greatest likelihood of being the most effective eHealth intervention to improve medication adherence in patients with CVDs, followed by telemonitoring, telephone support, and app interventions. The results of these network meta-analyses can provide crucial evidence-based support for health care providers to enhance patients’ medication adherence. Given the differences in the design and implementation of eHealth interventions, further large-scale, well-designed multicenter trials are needed.

This systematic review examines the effectiveness of SMS‐delivered behaviour change interventions for weight management. Electronic databases were searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) comparing SMS‐delivered adult weight management interventions to control groups, published between 1990 and 2018. Weight change was examined using random effects meta‐analyses at intervention cessation and postintervention follow‐up. Subgroup analyses examined intervention duration, SMS frequency, theory use, SMS interactivity, and SMS tailoring. Fifteen studies met inclusion criteria (2705 participants). For weight loss interventions (n = 12, 1977 participants), the mean difference in weight change was −2.28 kg (95% confidence interval [CI] −3.17 to −1.36 kg). No studies reported postintervention follow‐up. For weight loss maintenance interventions (n = 3, 728 participants), the mean difference in weight change was −0.68 kg (95% CI, −1.31 to −0.05 kg), and postintervention follow‐up (n = 2, 498 participants) effects were −0.57 kg (95% CI, −1.67 to 0.53 kg). No subgroup differences were found. SMS‐delivered behaviour change interventions for weight loss led to significant small to moderate weight loss and weight loss maintenance compared with control groups. Evidence on long‐term effects is limited. SMS‐delivered behaviour change interventions are a potentially effective and scalable intervention option for obesity treatment.",

      "abstract": "Many Americans fail to get life-saving vaccines each year, and the availability of a vaccine for COVID-19 makes the challenge of encouraging vaccination more urgent than ever. We present a large field experiment (\n              N\n              = 47,306) testing 19 nudges delivered to patients via text message and designed to boost adoption of the influenza vaccine. Our findings suggest that text messages sent prior to a primary care visit can boost vaccination rates by an average of 5%. Overall, interventions performed better when they were 1) framed as reminders to get flu shots that were already reserved for the patient and 2) congruent with the sort of communications patients expected to receive from their healthcare provider (i.e., not surprising, casual, or interactive). The best-performing intervention in our study reminded patients twice to get their flu shot at their upcoming doctor’s appointment and indicated it was reserved for them. This successful script could be used as a template for campaigns to encourage the adoption of life-saving vaccines, including against COVID-19.",

      "abstract": "Significance\n            Changing individuals’ behavior is key to tackling some of today’s most pressing societal challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic or climate change. Choice architecture interventions aim to nudge people toward personally and socially desirable behavior through the design of choice environments. Although increasingly popular, little is known about the overall effectiveness of choice architecture interventions and the conditions under which they facilitate behavior change. Here we quantitatively review over a decade of research, showing that choice architecture interventions successfully promote behavior change across key behavioral domains, populations, and locations. Our findings offer insights into the effects of choice architecture and provide guidelines for behaviorally informed policy making.\n          , \n            \n              Over the past decade, choice architecture interventions or so-called nudges have received widespread attention from both researchers and policy makers. Built on insights from the behavioral sciences, this class of behavioral interventions focuses on the design of choice environments that facilitate personally and socially desirable decisions without restricting people in their freedom of choice. Drawing on more than 200 studies reporting over 440 effect sizes (\n              n\n              = 2,148,439), we present a comprehensive analysis of the effectiveness of choice architecture interventions across techniques, behavioral domains, and contextual study characteristics. Our results show that choice architecture interventions overall promote behavior change with a small to medium effect size of Cohen’s\n              d\n              = 0.43 (95% CI [0.38, 0.48]). In addition, we find that the effectiveness of choice architecture interventions varies significantly as a function of technique and domain. Across behavioral domains, interventions that target the organization and structure of choice alternatives (decision structure) consistently outperform interventions that focus on the description of alternatives (decision information) or the reinforcement of behavioral intentions (decision assistance). Food choices are particularly responsive to choice architecture interventions, with effect sizes up to 2.5 times larger than those in other behavioral domains. Overall, choice architecture interventions affect behavior relatively independently of contextual study characteristics such as the geographical location or the target population of the intervention. Our analysis further reveals a moderate publication bias toward positive results in the literature. We end with a discussion of the implications of our findings for theory and behaviorally informed policy making.",

Objective            We examined the effectiveness of an enhanced SMS text message–based support and reminder program in improving clinic attendance, metabolic control, engagement in self-management, and psychological health in young-onset type 2 diabetes.                                Methods            A 12-month, parallel-arm, randomized controlled trial comparing an enhanced, semipersonalized SMS text message–based intervention (incorporating 1-8 supportive and/or informative text messages per month) against standard care was conducted in a specialized clinic for young adult type 2 diabetes. The primary outcome was maintenance of 100% attendance at scheduled quarterly clinical appointments. Secondary outcomes included (1) metabolic indices, (2) pathology and self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) data availability, and (3) psychosocial well-being.                                Results            A total of 40 participants were randomized, and 32 completed their 12-month study visit. The average participant age was 32.7 (SD 5.1) years, 50% (20/40) were male, and baseline glycated hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) was 7.3% (SD 1.9%) (56 mmol/mol, SD 20). A higher proportion of the intervention group achieved 100% attendance (12/21, 57%, vs 5/19, 26%, for the control group); Kaplan-Meier analysis demonstrated significantly greater cumulative attendance in the intervention group (P=.04). There were no between-group differences in HbA1c, BMI, lipids, or availability of pathology and SMBG data. Odds of recording an improvement in the Diabetes Empowerment Scale–Short Form score were higher in the intervention group at 6 months (odds ratio [OR] 4.3, 95% CI 1.1-17), with attenuation of this effect at study end (OR 3.1, 95% CI 0.9-11). Program acceptability was high; >90% of participants would recommend the program to new patients.                                Conclusions            An enhanced SMS text message–based support and reminder program doubled scheduled clinic attendance rates for patients with young-onset type 2 diabetes. The program was highly acceptable and provided early support for patient empowerment but had no significant effect on measures of metabolic control or self-management.

In this study, a chatbot service was developed for the Covenant University Doctor (CUDoctor) telehealth system based on fuzzy logic rules and fuzzy inference. The service focuses on assessing the symptoms of tropical diseases in Nigeria. Telegram Bot Application Programming Interface (API) was used to create the interconnection between the chatbot and the system, while Twilio API was used for interconnectivity between the system and a short messaging service (SMS) subscriber. The service uses the knowledge base consisting of known facts on diseases and symptoms acquired from medical ontologies. A fuzzy support vector machine (SVM) is used to effectively predict the disease based on the symptoms inputted. The inputs of the users are recognized by NLP and are forwarded to the CUDoctor for decision support. Finally, a notification message displaying the end of the diagnosis process is sent to the user. The result is a medical diagnosis system which provides a personalized diagnosis utilizing self-input from users to effectively diagnose diseases. The usability of the developed system was evaluated using the system usability scale (SUS), yielding a mean SUS score of 80.4, which indicates the overall positive evaluation.",

Subjects in the reminders group were sent text-message reminders to wear their Fitbit. The goal-setting group was sent a daily text message asking for a step goal. All subjects had three in-person visits (baseline, 3 and 6 months).

However, their effect on healthcare outcomes in an African context is uncertain. This systematic review aims to landscape randomized trials involving two-way text message interventions and estimate their effect on healthcare outcomes.\n\nMethods\nWe searched Medline, Embase, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, The Global Health Library (up to 12 August 2021) and trial registries (up to 24 April 2020). Published and unpublished trials conducted in Africa comparing two-way text message interventions with standard care and/or one-way text message interventions were included. Trials that reported dichotomous effect estimates on healthcare appointment attendance and/or medicine adherence were assessed for risk of bias and included in meta-analyses. Results of other outcomes were reported descriptively.\n\nResults\nWe included 31 trials (28,563 participants) all set in Sub-Saharan Africa with a wide range of clinical conditions. Overall, ten different trials were included in the primary meta-analyses, and two of these had data on both medicine adherence and appointment attendance. An additional two trials were included in sensitivity analyses. Of the 12 included trials, three were judged as overall low risk of bias and nine as overall high risk of bias trials. Two-way text messages did not improve appointment attendance, RR: 1.03; 95% CI: 0.95–1.12, I2 = 53% (5 trials, 4374 participants) but improved medicine adherence compared to standard care, RR: 1.14, 95% CI: 1.07–1.21, I2 = 8% (6 trials, 2783 participants).\n\nConclusion\nTwo-way text messages seemingly improve medicine adherence but has an uncertain effect on appointment attendance compared to standard care.\n\nSystematic review registration\nPROSPERO CRD42020175810.",

      "abstract": "AbstractThe prevalence of non-communicable diseases, such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease, is rising in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Health behavior change (HBC) interventions such as the widely used Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) are effective at reducing chronic disease risk, but have not been adapted for LMICs. Leveraging mobile health (mHealth) technology such as text messaging (SMS) to enhance reach and participant engagement with these interventions has great promise, yet we lack evidence-informed approaches to guide the integration of SMS specifically to support HBC interventions in LMIC contexts. To address this gap, we integrated guidance from the mHealth literature with expertise and first-hand experience to establish specific development steps for building and implementing SMS systems to support HBC programming in LMICs. Specifically, we provide real-world examples of each development step by describing our experience in designing and delivering an SMS system to support a culturally-adapted DPP designed for delivery in South Africa. We outline eight key SMS development steps, including: 1) determining if SMS is appropriate; 2) developing system architecture and programming; 3) developing theory-based messages; 4) developing SMS technology; 5) addressing international SMS delivery; 6) testing; 7) system training and technical support; and 8) cost considerations. We discuss lessons learned and extractable principles that may be of use to other mHealth and HBC researchers working in similar LMIC contexts.Trial registration Clinicaltrials.gov, NCT03342274.

Provision of support for these challenges is complicated by the high number of people requiring support and the need to maintain physical distancing. Text4Hope, a daily supportive SMS text messaging program, was launched in Canada to mitigate the negative mental health impacts of the pandemic among Canadians.                                Objective            This paper describes the changes in the stress, anxiety, and depression levels of subscribers to the Text4Hope program after 6 weeks of exposure to daily supportive SMS text messages.                                Methods            We used self-administered, empirically supported web-based questionnaires to assess the demographic and clinical characteristics of Text4Hope subscribers. Perceived stress, anxiety, and depression were measured with the 10-Item Perceived Stress Scale (PSS-10), the Generalized Anxiety Disorder–7 (GAD-7) scale, and the Patient Health Questionnaire–9 (PHQ-9) scale at baseline and sixth week time points. Moderate or high perceived stress, likely generalized anxiety disorder, and likely major depressive disorder were assessed using cutoff scores of ≥14 for the PSS-10, ≥10 for the GAD-7, and ≥10 for the PHQ-9, respectively. At 6 weeks into the program, 766 participants had completed the questionnaires at both time points.                                Results            At the 6-week time point, there were statistically significant reductions in mean scores on the PSS-10 and GAD-7 scales but not on the PHQ-9 scale. Effect sizes were small overall. There were statistically significant reductions in the prevalence rates of moderate or high stress and likely generalized anxiety disorder but not likely major depressive disorder for the group that completed both the baseline and 6-week assessments. The largest reductions in mean scores and prevalence rates were for anxiety (18.7% and 13.5%, respectively).                                Conclusions            Text4Hope is a convenient, cost-effective, and accessible means of implementing a population-level psychological intervention. This service demonstrated significant reductions in anxiety and stress levels during the COVID-19 pandemic and could be used as a population-level mental health intervention during natural disasters and other emergencies.

      "abstract": "Background            The vast majority of adolescent mental health and substance use disorders go undiagnosed and undertreated. SMS text messaging is increasingly used as a method to deliver adolescent health services that promote psychological well-being and aim to protect adolescents from adverse experiences and risk factors critical for their current and future mental health. To date, there has been no comprehensive synthesis of the existing literature on the extent, range, and implementation contexts of these SMS text message interventions.                                Objective            The objective of this scoping review was to map and categorize gaps in the current body of peer-reviewed research around the use of SMS text messaging–based interventions for mental health and addiction services among adolescents.                                Methods            A scoping review was conducted according to Levac’s adaptation of Arksey and O’Malley’s methodological framework for scoping reviews in six iterative stages. A search strategy was cocreated and adapted for five unique databases. Studies were screened using Covidence software. The PICO (patient, intervention, comparator, outcome) framework and input from multiple stakeholder groups were used to structure and pilot a data extraction codebook. Data were extracted on study methodology and measures, intervention design, and implementation characteristics, as well as policy, practice, and research implications.                                Results            We screened 1142 abstracts. Of these, 31 articles published between 2013 and 2020 were eligible for inclusion. Intervention engagement was the most common type of outcome measured (18/31), followed by changes in cognitions (16/31; eg, disease knowledge, self-awareness) and acceptability (16/31). Interventions were typically delivered in less than 12 weeks, and adolescents received 1-3 messages per week. Bidirectional messaging was involved in 65% (20/31) of the studies. Limited descriptions of implementation features (eg, cost, policy implications, technology performance) were reported.                                Conclusions            The use of SMS text messaging interventions is a rapidly expanding area of research. However, lack of large-scale controlled trials and theoretically driven intervention designs limits generalizability. Significant gaps in the literature were observed in relation to implementation considerations, cost, clinical workflow, bidirectionality of texting, and level of personalization and tailoring of the interventions. Given the growth of mobile phone–based interventions for this population, a rigorous program of large-scale, well-designed trials is urgently required.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              SMS text messaging programs are increasingly being used for secondary prevention, and have been shown to be effective in a number of health conditions including cardiovascular disease. SMS text messaging programs have the potential to increase the reach of an intervention, at a reduced cost, to larger numbers of people who may not access traditional programs. However, patients regularly reply to the SMS text messages, leading to additional staffing requirements to monitor and moderate the patients’ SMS text messaging replies. This additional staff requirement directly impacts the cost-effectiveness and scalability of SMS text messaging interventions.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aimed to test the feasibility and accuracy of developing a machine learning (ML) program to triage SMS text messaging replies (ie, identify which SMS text messaging replies require a health professional review).\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              SMS text messaging replies received from 2 clinical trials were manually coded (1) into “Is staff review required?” (binary response of yes/no); and then (2) into 12 general categories. Five ML models (Naïve Bayes, OneVsRest, Random Forest Decision Trees, Gradient Boosted Trees, and Multilayer Perceptron) and an ensemble model were tested. For each model run, data were randomly allocated into training set (2183/3118, 70.01%) and test set (935/3118, 29.98%). Accuracy for the yes/no classification was calculated using area under the receiver operating characteristics curve (AUC), false positives, and false negatives. Accuracy for classification into 12 categories was compared using multiclass classification evaluators.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              A manual review of 3118 SMS text messaging replies showed that 22.00% (686/3118) required staff review. For determining need for staff review, the Multilayer Perceptron model had highest accuracy (AUC 0.86; 4.85% false negatives; and 4.63% false positives); with addition of heuristics (specified keywords) fewer false negatives were identified (3.19%), with small increase in false positives (7.66%) and AUC 0.79. Application of this model would result in 26.7% of SMS text messaging replies requiring review (true + false positives). The ensemble model produced the lowest false negatives (1.43%) at the expense of higher false positives (16.19%). OneVsRest was the most accurate (72.3%) for the 12-category classification.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The ML program has high sensitivity for identifying the SMS text messaging replies requiring staff input; however, future research is required to validate the models against larger data sets. Incorporation of an ML program to review SMS text messaging replies could significantly reduce staff workload, as staff would not have to review all incoming SMS text messages. This could lead to substantial improvements in cost-effectiveness, scalability, and capacity of SMS text messaging–based interventions.",

      "abstract": "Background            With the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, providing counseling to people with drug or alcohol addiction while maintaining physical distance has been challenging. This protocol describes the use of text messaging (as used in the Text4Hope-Addiction Support program) as a convenient, evidence-based, cost-effective, and accessible population-level mental health intervention with high user satisfaction proven in prior research.                                Objective            The project goal is to implement a program of daily supportive text messaging (Text4Hope-Addiction Support) to reduce drug or alcohol cravings as well as anxiety and depression, typically associated with alcohol and substance use disorders. The aim of this study is to evaluate the prevalence of cravings, anxiety, and depressive symptoms; demographic correlates of the same; and the outcomes of the Text4Hope-Addiction Support intervention in mitigating cravings, anxiety, and depressive symptoms.                                Methods            Self-administered, anonymous, online questionnaires will be used to assess cravings for the primary substance of addiction (Brief Substance Craving Scale), anxiety (Generalized Anxiety Disorder-7), and depressive symptoms (Patient Health Questionnaire-9). Data will be collected at baseline (onset of receiving text messages), program midpoint (6 weeks), and program end (12 weeks).                                Results            As of October 2020, data collection is in progress; and it is expected to be completed by fall 2021. Data analysis will include parametric and nonparametric techniques, focusing on primary outcomes (ie, cravings, anxiety, and depressive symptoms) and metrics of use, including the number of subscribers and user satisfaction.                                Conclusions            This Text4Hope-Addiction Support project will provide key information regarding the prevalence rates of cravings, anxiety, and depressive symptoms among persons with alcohol and substance use disorders; demographic correlates of cravings, anxiety, and depression; and outcome data related to this scalable population-level intervention. Information from this study will be valuable for addiction care practitioners; it will inform the policy and decision making regarding population-level addiction treatment and support during emergencies.

      "abstract": "Background            The high prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension in Pakistan is predominantly attributed to poor medication adherence. As more than 137 million people in Pakistan use cell phones, a suitable mobile health (mHealth) intervention can be an effective tool to overcome poor medication adherence.                                Objective            We sought to determine whether a novel mHealth intervention is useful in enhancing antihypertensive therapy adherence and treatment outcomes among patients with hypertension in a low- to middle-income country.                                Methods            A 6-month parallel, single-blinded, superiority randomized controlled trial recruited 439 patients with hypertension with poor adherence to antihypertensive therapy and access to smartphones. An innovative, multifaceted mHealth intervention (Multi-Aid-Package), based on the Health Belief Model and containing reminders (written, audio, visual), infographics, video clips, educational content, and 24/7 individual support, was developed for the intervention group; the control group received standard care. The primary outcome was self-reported medication adherence measured using the Self-Efficacy for Appropriate Medication Adherence Scale (SEAMS) and pill counting; the secondary outcome was systolic blood pressure (SBP) change. Both outcomes were evaluated at baseline and 6 months. Technology acceptance feedback was also assessed at the end of the study. A generalized estimating equation was used to control the covariates associated with the probability of affecting adherence to antihypertensive medication.                                Results            Of 439 participants, 423 (96.4%) completed the study. At 6 months post intervention, the median SEAMS score was statistically significantly higher in the intervention group compared to the controls (median 32, IQR 11 vs median 21, IQR 6; U=10,490, P<.001). Within the intervention group, there was an increase in the median SEAMS score by 12.5 points between baseline and 6 months (median 19.5, IQR 5 vs median 32, IQR 11; P<.001). Results of the pill-counting method showed an increase in adherent patients in the intervention group compared to the controls (83/220, 37.2% vs 2/219, 0.9%; P<.001), as well as within the intervention group (difference of n=83, 37.2% of patients, baseline vs 6 months; P<.001). There was a statistically significant difference in the SBP of 7 mmHg between the intervention and control groups (P<.001) at 6 months, a 4 mmHg reduction (P<.001) within the intervention group, and a 3 mmHg increase (P=.314) within the controls. Overall, the number of patients with uncontrolled hypertension decreased by 46 in the intervention group (baseline vs 6 months), but the control group remained unchanged. The variables groups (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.714, 95% CI 2.387-3.825), time (AOR 1.837, 95% CI 1.625-2.754), and age (AOR 1.618, 95% CI 0.225-1.699) significantly contributed (P<.001) to medication adherence. Multi-Aid-Package received a 94.8% acceptability score.                                Conclusions            The novel Multi-Aid-Package is an effective mHealth intervention for enhancing medication adherence and treatment outcomes among patients with hypertension in a low- to middle-income country.

A JITAI involves a sequence of decision rules (i.e., treatment policies) that take the user's current context as input and specify whether and what type of intervention should be provided at the moment. In this work, we describe a reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that continuously learns and improves the treatment policy embedded in the JITAI as data is being collected from the user. This work is motivated by our collaboration on designing an RL algorithm for HeartSteps V2 based on data collected HeartSteps V1. HeartSteps is a physical activity mobile health application. The RL algorithm developed in this work is being used in HeartSteps V2 to decide, five times per day, whether to deliver a context-tailored activity suggestion.",

As little is known about the effect of educational intervention on this population, this systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of mobile phone text message reminders versus usual care to improve medication adherence among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients.                              Methods                PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and African Journals Online, were searched. A random-effects model was employed to estimate combined effect sizes. Subgroup analyses were employed to investigate possible sources of heterogeneity between studies. The overall certainty of the evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach.                              Results                A total of 9 trials with 1,121 participants were included in the review. The pooled estimated impact of mobile phone text message reminders on medication adherence was (SMD: 0.36; 95%CI; 0.14, 0.59) compared to usual care groups among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, subgroup analyses revealed greater medication adherence levels in those studies with intervention durations of more than six months and with self-report/refill adherence scale measurement (SMD: 0.21; 95%CI: 0.02, 0.40) and (SMD: 0.45; 95%CI: 0.22, 0.68), respectively.                              Conclusion                Mobile phone text messages can potentially lead to improved medication adherence levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes despite heterogeneity across the studies. Therefore, mobile phone text messaging when delivered in addition to usual care, have the potential to produce significant improvements in medication adherence.",

      "abstract": "Abstract          Mobile health (mHealth) with continuous real-time monitoring is leading the era of digital medical convergence. Wearable devices and smartphones optimized as personalized health management platforms enable disease prediction, prevention, diagnosis, and even treatment. Ubiquitous and accessible medical services offered through mHealth strengthen universal health coverage to facilitate service use without discrimination. This viewpoint investigates the latest trends in mHealth technology, which are comprehensive in terms of form factors and detection targets according to body attachment location and type. Insights and breakthroughs from the perspective of mHealth sensing through a new form factor and sensor-integrated display overcome the problems of existing mHealth by proposing a solution of smartphonization of wearable devices and the wearable deviceization of smartphones. This approach maximizes the infinite potential of stagnant mHealth technology and will present a new milestone leading to the popularization of mHealth. In the postpandemic era, innovative mHealth solutions through the smartphonization of wearable devices and the wearable deviceization of smartphones could become the standard for a new paradigm in the field of digital medicine.",

      "abstract": "AbstractPatients experiencing mental health crises often seek help through messaging-based platforms, but may face long wait times due to limited message triage capacity. Here we build and deploy a machine-learning-enabled system to improve response times to crisis messages in a large, national telehealth provider network. We train a two-stage natural language processing (NLP) system with key word filtering followed by logistic regression on 721 electronic medical record chat messages, of which 32% are potential crises (suicidal/homicidal ideation, domestic violence, or non-suicidal self-injury). Model performance is evaluated on a retrospective test set (4/1/21–4/1/22, N = 481) and a prospective test set (10/1/22–10/31/22, N = 102,471). In the retrospective test set, the model has an AUC of 0.82 (95% CI: 0.78–0.86), sensitivity of 0.99 (95% CI: 0.96–1.00), and PPV of 0.35 (95% CI: 0.309–0.4). In the prospective test set, the model has an AUC of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.966–0.984), sensitivity of 0.98 (95% CI: 0.96–0.99), and PPV of 0.66 (95% CI: 0.626–0.692). The daily median time from message receipt to crisis specialist triage ranges from 8 to 13 min, compared to 9 h before the deployment of the system. We demonstrate that a NLP-based machine learning model can reliably identify potential crisis chat messages in a telehealth setting. Our system integrates into existing clinical workflows, suggesting that with appropriate training, humans can successfully leverage ML systems to facilitate triage of crisis messages.",

However, there are knowledge gaps in mobile health, including how to maximize engagement.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This study aims to categorize program SMS text messages and participant replies using machine learning (ML) and to examine whether message characteristics are associated with premature program stopping and engagement.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We assessed communication logs from SMS text message–based chronic disease prevention studies that encouraged 1-way (SupportMe/ITM) and 2-way (TEXTMEDS [Text Messages to Improve Medication Adherence and Secondary Prevention]) communication. Outgoing messages were manually categorized into 5 message intents (informative, instructional, motivational, supportive, and notification) and replies into 7 groups (stop, thanks, questions, reporting healthy, reporting struggle, general comment, and other). Grid search with 10-fold cross-validation was implemented to identify the best-performing ML models and evaluated using nested cross-validation. Regression models with interaction terms were used to compare the association of message intent with premature program stopping and engagement (replied at least 3 times and did not prematurely stop) in SupportMe/ITM and TEXTMEDS.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              We analyzed 1550 messages and 4071 participant replies. Approximately 5.49% (145/2642) of participants responded with stop, and 11.7% (309/2642) of participants were engaged. Our optimal ML model correctly classified program message intent with 76.6% (95% CI 63.5%-89.8%) and replies with 77.8% (95% CI 74.1%-81.4%) balanced accuracy (average area under the curve was 0.95 and 0.96, respectively). Overall, supportive (odds ratio [OR] 0.53, 95% CI 0.35-0.81) messages were associated with reduced chance of stopping, as were informative messages in SupportMe/ITM (OR 0.35, 95% CI 0.20-0.60) but not in TEXTMEDS (for interaction, P<.001). Notification messages were associated with a higher chance of stopping in SupportMe/ITM (OR 5.76, 95% CI 3.66-9.06) but not TEXTMEDS (for interaction, P=.01). Overall, informative (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.46-2.12) and instructional (OR 1.47, 95% CI 1.21-1.80) messages were associated with higher engagement but not motivational messages (OR 1.18, 95% CI 0.82-1.70; P=.37). For supportive messages, the association with engagement was opposite with SupportMe/ITM (OR 1.77, 95% CI 1.21-2.58) compared with TEXTMEDS (OR 0.77, 95% CI 0.60-0.98; for interaction, P<.001). Notification messages were associated with reduced engagement in SupportMe/ITM (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.05-0.10) and TEXTMEDS (OR 0.28, 95% CI 0.20-0.39); however, the strength of the association was greater in SupportMe/ITM (for interaction P<.001).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              ML models enable monitoring and detailed characterization of program messages and participant replies. Outgoing message intent may influence premature program stopping and engagement, although the strength and direction of association appear to vary by program type. Future studies will need to examine whether modifying message characteristics can optimize engagement and whether this leads to behavior change.",

      "abstract": "AbstractText messaging can promote healthy behaviors, like adherence to medication, yet its effectiveness remains modest, in part because message content is rarely personalized. Reinforcement learning has been used in consumer technology to personalize content but with limited application in healthcare. We tested a reinforcement learning program that identifies individual responsiveness (“adherence”) to text message content and personalizes messaging accordingly. We randomized 60 individuals with diabetes and glycated hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] ≥ 7.5% to reinforcement learning intervention or control (no messages). Both arms received electronic pill bottles to measure adherence. The intervention improved absolute adjusted adherence by 13.6% (95%CI: 1.7%–27.1%) versus control and was more effective in patients with HbA1c 7.5- < 9.0% (36.6%, 95%CI: 25.1%–48.2%, interaction p < 0.001). We also explored whether individual patient characteristics were associated with differential response to tested behavioral factors and unique clusters of responsiveness. Reinforcement learning may be a promising approach to improve adherence and personalize communication at scale.",

      "abstract": "Background: Mobile phone text messages (short message service, SMS) are used pervasively as a form of communication. Almost 100% of the population uses text messaging worldwide and this technology is being suggested as a promising tool in psychiatry. Text messages can be sent either from a classic mobile phone or a web-based application. Reviews are needed to better understand how text messaging can be used in mental health care and other fields of medicine. Objective: The objective of the study was to review the literature regarding the use of mobile phone text messaging in mental health care. Methods: We conducted a thorough literature review of studies involving text messaging in health care management. Searches included PubMed, PsycINFO, Cochrane, Scopus, Embase and Web of Science databases on May 25, 2015. Studies reporting the use of text messaging as a tool in managing patients with mental health disorders were included. Given the heterogeneity of studies, this review was summarized using a descriptive approach. Results: From 677 initial citations, 36 studies were included in the review. Text messaging was used in a wide range of mental health situations, notably substance abuse (31%), schizophrenia (22%), and affective disorders (17%). We identified four ways in which text messages were used: reminders (14%), information (17%), supportive messages (42%), and self-monitoring procedures (42%). Applications were sometimes combined. Conclusions: We report growing interest in text messaging since 2006. Text messages have been proposed as a health care tool in a wide spectrum of psychiatric disorders including substance abuse, schizophrenia, affective disorders, and suicide prevention. Most papers described pilot studies, while some randomized clinical trials (RCTs) were also reported. Overall, a positive attitude toward text messages was reported. RCTs reported improved treatment adherence and symptom surveillance. Other positive points included an increase in appointment attendance and in satisfaction with management and health care services. Insight into message content, preventative strategies, and innovative approaches derived from the mental health field may be applicable in other medical specialties.",

      "abstract": "Background            The widespread occurrence and devastating impact of adolescent depression warrant health service research focused on feasible and acceptable digital health tools to supplement evidence-based intervention (EBI) efforts, particularly in the context of shelter-in-place guidelines disrupting youth socialization and service use in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic. Given the promise of SMS text message interventions to enhance EBI engagement, our team developed the HealthySMS system as an adjunct to one of the most empirically supported interventions for adolescent depression: cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) group services. The system sends daily SMS text messages requesting responses assessing mood, thoughts, and activities; weekly attendance reminder messages; daily tips about adherence (eg, a prompt for activity completion); and personalized responses based on participants’ texts.                                Objective            This study aims to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of HealthySMS in a real-world setting and explore potential mechanisms of change in EBI engagement, before evaluating the system’s impact on adolescents’ group CBT engagement and, ultimately, depression outcomes.                                Methods            Over the course of 2020, we invited all 20 adolescents receiving CBT group services for depression at an outpatient psychiatry clinic to enroll in our HealthySMS study; ultimately, 17 (85%) adolescents agreed to participate. We tracked participant initiation and engagement with the HealthySMS system as well as the content of SMS text message responses to HealthySMS. We also invited each participant to engage in a semistructured interview to gather additional qualitative inputs on the system.                                Results            All (n=17, 100%) research participants invited agreed to receive HealthySMS messages, and 94% (16/17) of the participants maintained use during the first month without opting out. We uncovered meaningful qualitative themes regarding the feasibility and acceptability of HealthySMS, as well as its potential impact on EBI engagement.                                Conclusions            Taken together, the results of this pilot study suggest that HealthySMS adjunct to adolescent CBT group depression services is feasible and acceptable, as evidenced by high rates of HealthySMS initiation and low rates of dropout, as well as meaningful themes uncovered from participants’ qualitative feedback. In addition, the findings provide evidence regarding iterative improvements to the HealthySMS system and research protocol, as well as potential mechanisms of change for enhanced EBI engagement and, ultimately, adolescent depression outcomes, which can be used in future effectiveness research.",

      "abstract": "Abstract\n            Smartphone applications are one of the main delivery modalities in digital health. Many of these mHealth apps use gamification to engage users, improve user experience, and achieve better health outcomes. Yet, it remains unclear whether gamified approaches help to deliver effective, safe, and clinically beneficial products to users. This study examines the compliance of 69 gamified mHealth apps with the EU Medical Device Regulation and assesses the specific risks arising from the gamified nature of these apps. Of the identified apps, 32 (46.4%) were considered non-medical devices; seven (10.1%) were already cleared/approved by the regulatory authorities, and 31 (44.9%) apps were assessed as likely non-compliant or potentially non-compliant with regulatory requirements. These applications and one approved application were assessed as on the market without the required regulatory approvals. According to our analysis, a higher proportion of these apps would be classified as medical devices in the US. The level of risk posed by gamification remains ambiguous. While most apps showed only a weak link between the degree of gamification and potential risks, this link was stronger for those apps with a high degree of gamification or an immersive game experience.",

      "abstract": "Since the early studies exploring the use of SMS text messaging for health intervention, text messaging has played a pivotal role in the advancement of mobile health. As an intervention modality, text messaging has provided vital learnings for the design and delivery of interventions, particularly in low-resource settings. Despite the advances in technology over the last 25 years, text messaging is still being used in largely the same way to deliver health information, behavior change interventions, and support. The strong, consistent evidence for the benefits of this type of intervention has made text messaging a routine part of health interventions around the world. Key to its success is its simplicity, alongside the benefit of being arguably the most accessible form of consumer digital health intervention. Text message interventions are well suited for public health interventions due to their low cost, vast reach, frequent use, high read rates, and ability to be tailored and personalized. Furthermore, the nature of text messaging interventions makes them ideal for the delivery of multilingual, culturally tailored interventions, which is important in the context of increasing cultural diversity in many countries internationally. Indeed, studies assessing text message–based health interventions have shown them to be effective across sociodemographic and ethnic groups and have led to their adoption into national-level health promotion programs. With a growing focus on artificial intelligence, robotics, sensors, and other advances in digital health, there is an opportunity to integrate these technologies into text messaging programs. Simultaneously, it is essential that equity remains at the forefront for digital health researchers, developers, and implementers. Ensuring digital health solutions address inequities in health experienced across the world while taking action to maximize digital inclusion will ensure the true potential of digital health is realized. Text messaging has the potential to continue to play a pivotal role in the delivery of equitable digital health tools to communities around the world for many years to come. Further new technologies can build on the humble text message, leveraging its success to advance the field of digital health. This Viewpoint presents a retrospective of text messaging in health, drawing on the example of text message–based interventions for smoking cessation, and presents evidence for the continued relevance of this mobile health modality in 2025 and beyond.",

      "abstract": "Interventions to support people with hypertension in attending clinics and taking their medication have potential to improve outcomes, but delivery on a wide scale and at low cost is challenging. Some trials evaluating clinical interventions using short message service (SMS) text-messaging systems have shown important outcomes, although evidence is limited. We have developed a novel SMS system integrated with clinical care for use by people with hypertension in a low-resource setting. We aim to test the efficacy of the system in improving blood pressure control and treatment adherence compared to usual care. The SMS Text-message Adherence suppoRt trial (StAR) is a pragmatic individually randomised three-arm parallel group trial in adults treated for hypertension at a single primary care centre in Cape Town, South Africa. The intervention is a structured programme of clinic appointment, medication pick-up reminders, medication adherence support and hypertension-related education delivered remotely using an automated system with either informational or interactive SMS text-messages. Usual care is supplemented by infrequent non-hypertension related SMS text-messages. Participants are 1:1:1 individually randomised, to usual care or to one of the two active interventions using minimisation to dynamically adjust for gender, age, baseline systolic blood pressure, years with hypertension, and previous clinic attendance. The primary outcome is the change in mean systolic blood pressure at 12-month follow-up from baseline measured with research staff blinded to trial allocation. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with 80% or more of days medication available, proportion of participants achieving a systolic blood pressure less than 140mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure less than 90mmHg, hospital admissions, health status, retention in clinical care, satisfaction with treatment and care, and patient related quality of life. Anonymised demographic data are collected on non-participants. The StAR trial uses a novel, low cost system based on widely available mobile phone technology to deliver the SMS-based intervention, manage communication with patients, and measure clinically relevant outcomes. The results will inform implementation and wider use of mobile phone based interventions for health care delivery in a low-resource setting.                                       NCT02019823",

      "abstract": "Background            Physical activity can confer diverse benefits on cancer survivors. Unfortunately, many cancer survivors are not sufficiently active. The efficacy of physical activity interventions for this population may be increased by grounding them in Self-Determination Theory (SDT). Combining game design elements with wearable technologies may be a useful and scalable approach to targeting SDT constructs to promote cancer survivors’ physical activity.                                Objective            The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of Steps2Health, a physical activity intervention for cancer survivors. It also aims to investigate the effects of the intervention on motivation, physical activity, and step count.                                Methods            We randomized 78 insufficiently active cancer survivors to an experimental or comparison group. All participants received a physical activity tracker. The experimental group participants also received a set sequence of multimedia messaging service messages that were triggered in real time by meeting predetermined cumulative step count totals. Messages presented information about a virtual journey and included photographs and vivid descriptions of locations to increase autonomous motivation. Additional messages targeted perceptions of relatedness (eg, role modeling) and competence (eg, facilitating mastery experiences). We administered pre- and postintervention surveys and conducted 15 individual interviews to evaluate the intervention. We performed directed content analysis of qualitative data and conducted mixed effects linear modeling to investigate participants’ changes in motivation, self-reported physical activity, and device-measured step counts.                                Results            There was minimal loss to follow-up (3/78, 4%), the device wear rate was high (2548/3044, 83.71% of days), and technical problems with messaging based on real-time step counts were limited. Our qualitative data analysis revealed 3 overarching themes: accessibility, autonomous motivation, and relatedness. Participants successfully navigated the technological aspects and game design elements of the intervention. Participants found messages targeting autonomous motivation and competence or self-efficacy to be enjoyable and compelling, but one feasibility criterion for participant engagement (response rate to text messages) was not met. Messages targeting relatedness were less highly rated than the messages targeting autonomous motivation and competence or self-efficacy. During the intervention, both groups increased their motivation for physical activity (B=0.16; 95% CI 0.01 to 0.30; P=.04; d=0.49), and assignment to the experimental group was associated with increased self-reported leisure activity score (B=10.78; 95% CI 3.54 to 18.02; P=.005; d=0.64). The experimental group had greater increases in daily step counts over time (B=322.08; 95% CI 54.01 to 590.15; P=.02; d=0.28).                                Conclusions            This study supports the feasibility of using real-time game design elements to target SDT constructs and increase cancer survivors’ physical activity. Overall, our findings support the acceptability of the Steps2Health intervention, but fostering active participant engagement and targeting relatedness may present additional challenges. Steps2Health may help cancer survivors increase their physical activity levels.",

All participants received a free month of text messaging; starting for the intervention group on their quit day to assist with quitting, and starting for the control group at six months to encourage follow up. Follow up data were available for 1624 (95%) at six weeks and 1265 (74%) at six months.Main outcome measures:The main trial outcome was current non-smoking (that is, not smoking in the past week) six weeks after randomisation. Secondary outcomes included current non-smoking at 12 and 26 weeks.Results:More participants had quit at six weeks in the intervention compared to the control group: 239 (28%)v109 (13%), relative risk 2.20 (95% confidence interval 1.79 to 2.70), p < 0.0001. This treatment effect was consistent across subgroups defined by age, sex, income level, or geographic location (p homogeneity > 0.2). The relative risk estimates were similar in sensitivity analyses adjusting for missing data and salivary cotinine verification tests. Reported quit rates remained high at six months, but there was some uncertainty about between group differences because of incomplete follow up.Conclusions:This programme offers potential for a new way to help young smokers to quit, being affordable, personalised, age appropriate, and not location dependent. Future research should test these findings in different settings, and provide further assessment of long term quit rates.",

It first outlines the historical progress in SMS intervention research publications and the variety of funds from US government agencies. A narrative review follows, highlighting the effectiveness of SMS interventions in key health areas, such as physical activity, diet and weight loss, mental health, and substance use, based on published meta-analyses. It then outlines advantages of text messaging compared to other digital modalities, including the real-time capability to collect information and deliver microdoses of intervention support. Crucial design elements are proposed to optimize effectiveness and longitudinal engagement across communication strategies, psychological foundations, and behavior change tactics. We then discuss advanced functionalities, such as the potential for generative artificial intelligence to improve user interaction. Finally, major challenges to implementation are highlighted, including the absence of a dedicated commercial platform, privacy and security concerns with SMS technology, difficulties integrating SMS interventions with medical informatics systems, and concerns about user engagement. Proposed solutions aim to facilitate the broader application and effectiveness of SMS interventions. Our hope is that these insights can assist researchers and practitioners in using SMS interventions to improve health outcomes and reducing disparities.",

Instead of designing such complex strategies manually, reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to adaptively optimize intervention strategies concerning the user’s context. In this paper, we focus on the issue of overwhelming interactions when learning a good adaptive strategy for the user in RL-based mHealth intervention agents. We present a data-driven approach integrating psychological insights and knowledge of historical data. It allows RL agents to optimize the strategy of delivering context-aware notifications from empirical data when counterfactual information (user responses when receiving notifications) is missing. Our approach also considers a constraint on the frequency of notifications, which reduces the interaction burden for users. We evaluated our approach in several simulation scenarios using real large-scale running data. The results indicate that our RL agent can deliver notifications in a manner that realizes a higher behavioral impact than context-blind strategies.",

Outcomes included assessments of mental health disorder symptom severity specifically targeted at by the app. In total, 5945 records were identified and 165 full-text articles were screened for inclusion by two independent researchers. Nineteen trials with 3681 participants were included in the analysis: depression (k = 6), anxiety (k = 4), substance use (k = 5), self-injurious thoughts and behaviors (k = 4), PTSD (k = 2), and sleep problems (k = 2). Effects on depression (Hedges’ g = 0.33, 95%CI 0.10–0.57, P = 0.005, NNT = 5.43, I2 = 59%) and on smoking behavior (g = 0.39, 95%CI 0.21–0.57, NNT = 4.59, P ≤ 0.001, I2 = 0%) were significant. No significant pooled effects were found for anxiety, suicidal ideation, self-injury, or alcohol use (g = −0.14 to 0.18). Effect sizes for single trials ranged from g = −0.05 to 0.14 for PTSD and g = 0.72 to 0.84 for insomnia. Although some trials showed potential of apps targeting mental health symptoms, using smartphone apps as standalone psychological interventions cannot be recommended based on the current level of evidence.",

      "abstract": "In the quest to discover the next high-technology solution to solve many health problems, proven established technologies are often overlooked in favor of more “technologically advanced” systems that have not been fully explored for their applicability to support behavior change theory, or used by consumers. Text messages or SMS is one example of an established technology still used by consumers, but often overlooked as part of the mobile health (mHealth) toolbox. The purpose of this paper is to describe the benefits of text messages as a health promotion modality and to advocate for broader scale implementation of efficacious text message programs.Text messaging reaches consumers in a ubiquitous real-time exchange, contrasting the multistep active engagement required for apps and wearables. It continues to be the most widely adopted and least expensive mobile phone function. As an intervention modality, text messaging has taught researchers substantial lessons about tailored interactive health communication; reach and engagement, particularly in low-resource settings; and embedding of behavior change models into digital health. It supports behavior change techniques such as reinforcement, prompts and cues, goal setting, feedback on performance, support, and progress review. Consumers have provided feedback to indicate that text messages can provide them with useful information, increase perceived support, enhance motivation for healthy behavior change, and provide prompts to engage in health behaviors. Significant evidence supports the effectiveness of text messages alone as part of an mHealth toolbox or in combination with health services, to support healthy behavior change. Systematic reviews have consistently reported positive effects of text message interventions for health behavior change and disease management including smoking cessation, medication adherence, and self-management of long-term conditions and health, including diabetes and weight loss.  However, few text message interventions are implemented on a large scale. There is still much to be learned from investing in text messaging delivered research. When a modality is known to be effective, we should be learning from large-scale implementation. Many other technologies currently suffer from poor long-term engagement, the digital divide within society, and low health and technology literacy of users. Investing in and incorporating the learnings and lessons from large-scale text message interventions will strengthen our way forward in the quest for the ultimate digitally delivered behavior change model.",

In contrast to traditional supervised learning that typically relies on one-shot, exhaustive, and supervised reward signals, RL tackles sequential decision-making problems with sampled, evaluative, and delayed feedbacks simultaneously. Such a distinctive feature makes RL techniques a suitable candidate for developing powerful solutions in various healthcare domains, where diagnosing decisions or treatment regimes are usually characterized by a prolonged period with delayed feedbacks. By first briefly examining theoretical foundations and key methods in RL research, this survey provides an extensive overview of RL applications in a variety of healthcare domains, ranging from dynamic treatment regimes in chronic diseases and critical care, automated medical diagnosis, and many other control or scheduling problems that have infiltrated every aspect of the healthcare system. In addition, we discuss the challenges and open issues in the current research and highlight some potential solutions and directions for future research.",

Group-based trajectory models were used to identify latent classes of combined BMIZ and HbA1c trajectories.

Black youth were more likely to be in the class with worsening glycemic control and concurrent BMIZ decrease at pandemic onset (relative risk ratio [RRR] vs. White: 3.0 [95% CI 1.3–6.8]) or in the class with progressively worsening glycemic control and obesity (RRR 3.0 [95% CI 1.3–6.8]), while those from the most deprived neighborhoods (RRR ADI tertile 3 vs. 1: 1.9 [95% CI 1.2–2.9]) were more likely to be in the class with stable obesity and glycemic control.

The study was conducted for 7 weeks between August 6 and September 24, 2021. Participants included adults (aged ≥18 years) discharged from 2 urban, academic EDs with an active mobile phone number in the electronic health record. The primary outcome of interest was patient-reported impact of race on overall rating of ED care. Secondary outcomes included overall satisfaction with care and perceived impact of race on components of care, including respect, communication, and quality of care. A 6-point Likert scale was used, and chi-square and Wilcoxon rank sum tests were used to analyze responses.\nResults: A total of 590 (14%) discharged patients consented, and 462 patients completed the entire survey; the mean age was 43 years (SD 17.3); 67% were women, and 60.0% were Black. Black patients reported a higher overall rating of ED care (median 5 [3, 5]; P = 0.013). Proportionately, when compared with White patients, more Black patients reported that race negatively impacted the rating of care (10.8% vs 1.4%; P = 0.002). More than a quarter of Black patients (27.4%) reported race highly impacting being treated with respect (P = 0.024), and 22.4% reported a high impact on quality of service (P = 0.003) when compared with White patients.\nConclusion: Health systems lack methods that specifically identify patient experiences of racism. We demonstrate the feasibility of using text messaging to collect patient-reported experiences of racism. For a significant number of Black patients, race negatively impacted their care, including communication, quality, and respect.",

      "abstract": "Prescribing more opioids than patients need following surgery is associated with long-term use, misuse, and diversion. Interventions are needed to increase adherence to procedure-specific guidelines while preserving the ability to manage pain.To test whether providing clinicians monthly feedback with peer comparisons and patient-reported outcomes would increase adherence to postoperative opioid prescribing guidelines.This stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted at 6 surgical departments or divisions caring for patients undergoing 30 high-volume surgical procedures in a 5-hospital academic health system in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Surgical clinicians (attending surgeons, advanced practice professionals, and resident physicians) with 5 or more opioid prescriptions per month for eligible procedures during a 3-month period at baseline were eligible for inclusion. Six clinician clusters were randomly assigned to the intervention in 3 steps offset by 2 months. Each step included a 9-month baseline, a 6-month intervention, and a 6-month follow-up. The first step of the intervention began on June 8, 2022. Follow-up concluded in October 2023, and data analysis was performed from November 2023 to April 2024.Clinicians were emailed a report on their most frequently performed procedures, which contained a figure of the following mean numbers: pills prescribed relative to guidelines, pills peer clinicians prescribed, and pills patients reported using after a procedure; an additional figure displayed patients’ self-reported ability to manage pain. Monthly reports included prescribing trends, peer comparison feedback, and reminders about how many pills patients take and how well patients reported pain management with guideline-adherent prescriptions.The primary outcome was the proportion of guideline-adherent opioid prescriptions; secondary outcomes included patient-reported ability to manage pain (measured on a 0 to 10 scale, with 0 being not at all able), pain score, pills prescribed, pills leftover, and refill rate.A total of 143 surgical clinicians treating 20 557 patients were included (10 069 at baseline, 5382 during the intervention, and 5106 at follow-up). Mean (SD) patient age was 57.0 (15.7) years, and 10 996 patients (53.5%) were female. The baseline guideline adherence rate was 57.2%. During the intervention, adherence increased to 71.8%, with an adjusted intervention effect of 5.3% (95% CI, 2.0%-8.7%). The impact of the intervention increased over time, and adherence remained above baseline at follow-up (74.4%). The largest change was noted for orthopedic procedures of knee, hip, and shoulder arthroplasty. Patient-reported pain and ability to manage pain were unchanged.In this stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial, a feedback intervention using peer comparisons and patient-reported data increased opioid guideline adherence without compromising patients’ ability to manage pain.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05358522",

      "abstract": "Background\nInsufficient sleep duration is highly prevalent in childhood and is associated with obesity, especially among middle school-aged children. The primary care setting has enormous potential to promote sleep, but limited time and sleep resources at in person appointments are key barriers. Digital health innovations offer solutions to these barriers. Mobile health platforms can be developed to deliver behavioral sleep promotion remotely in the home setting, with tailoring to individual and contextual factors to help ensure equitable effectiveness across sociodemographic groups. This paper presents the protocol for a randomized optimization trial using the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) to develop a mobile health platform for the pediatric care setting to promote longer sleep duration for childhood obesity prevention.\n\nMethods\nThis is a single-site study being conducted at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. We will randomize 325 children, aged 8–12 y, with a body mass index (BMI) between the 50th−95th percentile, and who sleep &lt;8.5 h per night. The Way to Health mobile platform will facilitate remote communication and data collection. A sleep tracker will estimate sleep patterns for 12-months (2-week run-in; 6-month intervention; ≈5.5-month follow-up). A randomized 24 factorial design will assess four components: sleep goal (≥9 h or ≥30 min above baseline sleep duration), digital guidance (active or active with virtual study visits), caregiver incentive (inactive or active), and performance feedback (inactive or active). Fat mass will be measured at baseline, 6-, and 12-months using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Total energy intake and the timing and composition of meals will be measured using 24-h dietary recalls at baseline, 6-, and 12-months. Sociodemographic data (e.g., sex, race, ethnicity) will be measured using self-report and home addresses will be geocoded for geospatial analyses.\n\nDiscussion\nWe anticipate that this innovative optimization trial will identify optimal component settings for sleep promotion in children, with clinically meaningful improvements in fat mass trajectories. Importantly, the platform will have broad impact by promoting sleep health equity across sociodemographic groups. With the optimal settings identified, we will be able to determine the effectiveness of the final intervention package under the evaluation phase of the MOST framework in a future randomized controlled trial. Our proposed research will greatly advance the field of behavioral sleep medicine and reimagine how insufficient sleep duration and obesity are prevented in pediatric healthcare.\n\nTrial registration\nClinicalTrials.gov NCT05703347 registered on 30 January 2023.",

Opioid disposal is a strategy to reduce the risk of persistent use or misuse of opioids. At-home disposal kits allow patients to safely dispose of leftover opioids. In this study, we assess the impact of opioid disposal kits on disposal rates after orthopedic surgery. In a difference-in-differences study of 1,321 eligible patients, disposal kits were associated with a 10.6 percentage point increase (95% CI: -3.5% to 24.7%) in disposal rates as well as a 10.5 percentage point increase (95% CI: 0.2% to 20.9%) in the fraction of opioids disposed.

      "abstract": "1581\n            Background: Patients with advanced cancer undergoing chemotherapy experience significant symptoms and declines in functional status, which are often associated with poor outcomes. Remote monitoring of PROs (symptoms) and step counts (functional status), may proactively identify patients at risk of hospitalization or death. Our objectives were to evaluate the association of 1) longitudinal PROs with step counts, and 2) PROs and step counts with hospitalization or death. Methods: The PROStep randomized trial (NCT04616768) enrolled 108 patients with advanced gastrointestinal (GI) or lung cancers undergoing cytotoxic chemotherapy at a large academic cancer center. Patients were randomized to weekly text-based monitoring of 8 PROs (each measured on a 0-4 scale) + continuous step count monitoring via Fitbit, vs usual care. This pre-planned secondary analysis included 57 of 75 patients randomized to the intervention who had PRO and step data. We analyzed associations between PROs and mean daily step count, and associations of PROs and step counts with the composite outcome of hospitalization or death, using bootstrapped generalized linear models to account for longitudinal data. Results: Among 57 evaluable patients, mean age was 57 years, 24 (42%) were female, 49 (86%) were White, 43 (75%) had advanced GI cancer, and 14 (25%) had advanced lung cancer. A 1-point weekly increase (on a 32-point scale) in aggregate PRO score was associated with 247 fewer mean daily steps (95% CI -277, -213, p < 0.001). PROs most strongly associated with step count decline were patient-reported activity level (daily step change -892), nausea (-677), and constipation (-524). 25 patients (44%) were hospitalized (n = 21) or died (n = 8). A 1-point weekly increase in aggregate PRO score was associated with 20% greater odds of hospitalization or death (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 1.2, 95% CI 1.1, 1.4, p = 0.008). PROs most strongly associated with hospitalization/death were pain (aOR 3.2), decreased activity (aOR 3.2), dypsnea (aOR 2.6) and sadness (aOR 2.1). A decrease in 1000 steps was associated with 16% greater odds of hospitalization or death (aOR 1.2, 95% CI 1.0, 1.3, p = 0.03). Compared to baseline, mean daily step count decreased 6.7%, 8.5%, 16.2% in the 3, 2, and 1 weeks prior to hospitalization/death. Mean aggregate PRO score increased by 11.0%, 25.3%, 36.4% in the 3, 2, and 1 weeks prior to hospitalization/death. Conclusions: In this secondary analysis of a randomized trial, increased PRO-based symptom burden was associated with lower daily step count. Higher symptom burden and decreased step count were independently associated with and predictably worsened close to hospitalization or death. Future interventions should leverage longitudinal PRO and step data to identify risk for poor outcomes. Clinical trial information: NCT04616768 .",

      "abstract": "Background\nSupervised exercise therapy improves walking performance, functional capacity, and quality of life in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). However, few patients with PAD are enrolled in supervised exercise programs, and there are a number of logistical and financial barriers to their participation. A home-based walking intervention is likely to be more accessible to patients with PAD, but no fully home-based walking program has demonstrated efficacy. Concepts from behavioral economics have been used to design scalable interventions that increase daily physical activity in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease, but whether a similar program would be effective in patients with PAD is uncertain.\nStudy Design and Objectives\nGAMEPAD (NCT04536012) is a pragmatic, virtual, randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a gamification strategy informed by concepts from behavioral economics to increase daily physical activity in patients with PAD who are seen in cardiology and vascular surgery clinics affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania Health System. Patients are contacted by email or text message, and complete enrollment and informed consent on the Penn Way to Health online platform. A GAMEPAD substudy will evaluate the effectiveness of opt-in versus opt-out framing when approaching patients for study participation. Patients are then provided with a wearable fitness tracker, establish a baseline daily step count, set a goal to increase daily step count by 33%-50%, and are randomized 1:1 to the gamification or control arms. Interventions continue for 16 weeks, including a 4-week period during which goal step count is gradually increased in the gamification arm, with follow-up for an additional 8 weeks to evaluate the durability of behavior change. The trial has met its enrollment goal of 102 participants, with a primary endpoint of change from baseline in daily steps over the 16-week intervention period. Key secondary endpoints include change from baseline in daily steps over the 8-week postintervention follow-up period and changes in patient-reported measures of PAD symptoms and quality of life over the intervention and follow-up periods.\nConclusions\nGAMEPAD is a virtual, pragmatic randomized clinical trial of a novel, fully home-based walking intervention informed by concepts from behavioral economics to increase physical activity and PAD-specific quality of life in patients with PAD. Its results will have important implications for the application of behavioral economic concepts to scalable home-based strategies to promote physical activity in patients with PAD and other disease processes where physical activity is limited by exertional symptoms.\nClinical trial registration\nclinicaltrials.gov; NCT04536012.",

      "abstract": "Identifying effective strategies for treating obesity is a public health priority.To test an escalating lottery-based incentive tied to daily self-weighing for weight loss maintenance.This 2-phase, 2-arm randomized clinical trial enrolled participants aged 30 to 80 years with an initial body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 30.0 to 45.0 who lost at least 5 kg during 4 to 6 months in a national online weight management program. Study investigators and outcomes assessors were blinded to participant groups. Data were collected and analyzed from May 23, 2016, through November 13, 2017, based on intention to treat.All participants were advised to weigh themselves daily, with a goal of 6 or more days per week, and received text messaging feedback on their performance. Incentive group participants were eligible for a lottery-based incentive worth an expected value of $3.98 in week 1 that escalated by $0.43 each week they achieved their self-weighing goal during months 1 to 6 (phase 1), followed by no incentives during months 7 to 12 (phase 2).The primary outcome was weight change at the end of phase 1. Secondary outcomes included weight change at the end of phase 2 and changes in self-reported physical activity and eating behaviors.A total of 258 participants (128 in the incentive group and 130 in the control group) had a mean (SD) age of 48.0 (10.5) years and mean (SD) body mass index of 32.1 (3.9); 225 (87.2%) were women; 235 (91.1%) were white; and 102 (39.5%) had an annual income of at least $100 000. Weight measurement was transmitted by 250 participants (96.9%) at 6 months and 227 (88.0%) at 12 months. The percentage of weeks that incentive and control participants achieved a mean self-weighing of at least 6 times was 85.3% vs 75.8%, respectively (P = .002) in phase 1 and 37.7% vs 50.2%, respectively (P = .009) in phase 2. Mean weight changes at the end of phase 1 were −1.1 (95% CI, −2.1 to −0.1) kg in the incentive group and −1.9 (95% CI, −2.9 to −0.8) kg in the control group, with a mean difference of 0.7 (95% CI, −0.7 to 2.2) kg (P = .30 for comparison). At the end of phase 2, mean weight changes were 0.2 (95% CI, −1.2 to 1.7) kg in the incentive group and −0.6 (95% CI, −2.0 to 0.8) kg in the control group, with a mean difference of 0.8 (95% CI, −1.2 to 2.8) kg (P = .41 for comparison).Compared with an active control condition of weekly messages, escalating lottery-based incentives transiently increased rates of self-weighing but did not significantly enhance weight loss maintenance.ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01900392",

      "abstract": "Rationale\nProspective clinical research studies are essential for determining the effectiveness and safety of drugs, medical devices, and healthcare delivery interventions. However, low enrollment, particularly among Black and Hispanic patients, challenges the generalizability of results and fairness of research. Leveraging insights from behavioral economics to modify the content of messages recruiting patients to join research studies may increase enrollment and representativeness of trial populations.\nPrimary hypothesis\nMethod of outreach, source of outreach, message framing, and financial incentives will have important effects on enrollment fraction of Black and Hispanic patients electronically approached for participation in a prospective clinical research study.\nDesign\nITERATE (NCT05827718) is a series of 4 randomized clinical trials (RCTs) designed to rigorously, systematically, and iteratively test the effects of different messaging strategies informed by behavioral economic theory on the enrollment of Black and Hispanic individuals into the Penn Medicine BioBank (PMBB), a prospective registry. For all 4 RCTs, we will identify patients eligible for enrollment in the PMBB (those with ≥ 1 encounter with the University of Pennsylvania Health System in the past 3 months, a phone number able to receive text messages or a valid email address on file, no history of consenting to or declining enrollment in the PMBB, and able to provide their own consent) and randomly assign them to receive different outreach messages. RCT 1 will test the method of outreach (email vs. text message vs. email + text message); RCT 2, source of outreach (research team vs. clinical team); RCT 3, message framing (appeal to altruism vs. appeal to social proof vs. control); and RCT 4, financial incentive (none vs. medium guarantee vs. small guarantee + small lottery vs. medium lottery vs. large lottery). In each RCT, at least 50% of the participants will be Black or Hispanic. The primary outcome of each RCT is enrollment fraction, defined as the number of participants who enroll in the PMBB divided by the total number of participants who received an outreach message, compared between arms among both Black and Hispanic patients. Secondary outcomes will include overall enrollment fraction and enrollment fraction among White patients. The “winning” strategies in earlier RCTs will be incorporated as the “standard of care” in the subsequent RCTs.",

      "abstract": "Purpose: This study aims to determine latent classes of study participants using baseline characteristics, explore the patterns within the groups, and determine whether the intervention had differential effects on weight loss across the groups. Design: Secondary analysis of a completed randomized clinical trial. Setting: Participants in a gamification intervention with social incentives who were recruited as pairs and given an intervention for 24 weeks. Participants were randomized to control, gamification, or gamification with primary care physician sharing arms. Participants: All 196 participants in the Lose It trial (recruited as 98 pairs). Measures: Outcome variable—participants’ weight change after 24 and 36 weeks. Factors—intervention arm and latent class. Analysis: Latent class analysis on both participants’ and teams’ characteristics. This was followed by 1-sample t tests of weight at 24 and 36 weeks, stratified by latent class.\nResults: Three groups of participants were identified: “Kin teams,” “Distant teams,” and “Married teams.” “Kin teams” lost more weight after the intervention in the gamification and gamification with PCP sharing arms. The “Distant teams” lost similar amounts of weight in all 3 arms but did not keep it off during maintenance. The “Married teams” lost the most weight across all 3 arms and kept it off following the intervention.\nConclusions: Patient phenotypes can identify variations in response to a gamification weight loss intervention. Future intervention studies may benefit from leveraging this during participant recruitment and allocation.",

We piloted a text message navigation program to improve colonoscopy adherence. Method. We conducted a prospective study of patients aged 18 to 75 years scheduled for outpatient colonoscopy at an urban endoscopy center in April 2018. An intervention arm consisting of bidirectional, automated text messages prior to the procedure was compared with a usual care arm. We enrolled 21 intervention patients by phone and randomly selected 50 controls. Outcomes included colonoscopy appointment adherence, bowel preparation quality, and colonoscopy completion. Results. The arms had similar demographics and comorbidities. Intervention patients had higher colonoscopy appointment adherence (90% vs. 62%, p = 0.049). There were no significant differences in preparation quality or procedure completeness. Poststudy surveys indicated high patient satisfaction and perceived usefulness of the program. Conclusion. A bidirectional, automated texting navigation program improved colonoscopy adherence rates as compared with usual care.",

We present a large field experiment (N=47,306) testing 19 nudges delivered to patients via text message and designed to boost adoption of the influenza vaccine. Our findings suggest that text messages sent prior to a primary care visit can boost vaccination rates by an average of 5%. Overall, interventions performed better when they were (a) framed as reminders to get flu shots that were already reserved for the patient and (b) congruent with the sort of communications patients expected to receive from their healthcare provider (i.e., not surprising, casual, or interactive). The best-performing intervention in our study reminded patients twice to get their flu shot at their upcoming doctor’s appointment and indicated it was reserved for them. This successful script could be used as a template for campaigns to encourage the adoption of life-saving vaccines, including against COVID-19.",

We studied whether incentives informed by behavioral economics increase participation in risk assessment for colorectal cancer (CRC) and completion of colonoscopy for eligible adults.\nMETHODS: Employees of a large academic health system (50–64 y old; n [ 1977) were randomly assigned to groups that underwent risk assessment for CRC screening and direct access colonoscopy scheduling (control), or risk assessment, direct access colonoscopy scheduling, a $10 lossframed incentive to complete risk assessment, and a $25 unconditional incentive for colonoscopy completion (incentive). The primary outcome was the percentage of participants who completed screening colonoscopy within 3 months of initial outreach. Secondary outcomes included the percentage of participants who scheduled colonoscopy and the percentage who completed the risk assessment.\nRESULTS: At 3 months, risk assessment was completed by 19.5% of participants in the control group (95% CI, 17.0–21.9%) and 31.9% of participants in the incentive group (95% CI, 29.0–34.8%) (P < .001).

      "abstract": "Behavioral interventions involving electronic devices, financial incentives, gamification, and specially trained staff to encourage healthy behaviors are becoming increasingly prevalent and important in health innovation and improvement efforts. Although considerations of cost are key to their wider adoption, cost information is lacking because the resources required cannot be costed using standard administrative billing data. Pragmatic clinical trials that test behavioral interventions are potentially the best and often only source of cost information but rarely incorporate costing studies. This article provides a guide for researchers to help them collect and analyze, during the trial and with little additional effort, the information needed to inform potential adopters of the costs of adopting a behavioral intervention. A key challenge in using trial data is the separation of implementation costs, the costs an adopter would incur, from research costs. Based on experience with 3 randomized clinical trials of behavioral interventions, this article explains how to frame the costing problem, including how to think about costs associated with the control group, and describes methods for collecting data on individual costs: specifications for costing a technology platform that supports the specialized functions required, how to set up a time log to collect data on the time staff spend on implementation, and issues in getting data on device, overhead, and financial incentive costs.",

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical trial was conducted in an endoscopy center at an urban academic medical center. Adult patients scheduled for outpatient colonoscopy between January and September 2019 were enrolled by telephone call (early phase) or by automated text message (late phase). Data were analyzed from October 2019 to January 2020. INTERVENTIONS After enrollment, patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to usual care (ie, written instructions and nurse telephone call) or to the intervention (ie, usual care plus an automated series of 9 educational or reminder text messages in the week prior to scheduled colonoscopy). MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was appointment attendance rate with good or excellent bowel preparation. Secondary outcomes included appointment attendance rate, bowel preparation quality (poor or inadequate, fair or adequate, and good or excellent), and cancellation lead time (in days).\nRESULTS Among 753 patients included and randomized in the trial (median [interquartile range] age, 56 [49-64] years; 364 [48.3%] men; 429 [57.2%] Black), 367 patients were randomized to the intervention group and 386 patients were randomized to the control group. There was no significant difference in the primary outcome between groups (patients attending appointments with good or excellent bowel preparation: intervention, 195 patients [53.1%]; control, 210 patients [54.4%]; P = .73), including when stratified by early or late phase enrollment groups. Similarly, there were no significant differences in secondary outcomes.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE This randomized clinical trial found no significant difference in appointment attendance or bowel preparation quality with an automated text messaging intervention compared with the usual care control. Future work could optimize the content and delivery of text message interventions or identify patient subgroups that may benefit from this approach.",

Behaviorally designed gamification can increase mobility in community settings but has not been tested among patients at risk for functional decline during a high-risk transition period after hospitalization.To test a behaviorally designed gamification intervention with a social support partner to increase patient mobility after hospital discharge.This study is a randomized clinical trial of a 12-week intervention without follow-up. Enrollment occurred from January 2018 to June 2019 at a referral hospital with a remote at-home monitoring intervention among patients living predominantly in 3 states (Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware). Participants included adult patients discharged from general medicine and oncology units to home. Data analysis was performed from October 2019 to March 2020.All participants received a wearable device to track daily steps. The control group received feedback from the device but no other interventions. The intervention group entered into a 12-week game informed by behavioral economics to assign points and levels for achieving step goals and reinforced by a support partner who received updates on participant progress.The primary outcome was change in mean daily steps from baseline through the 12-week intervention. Secondary measures were change in functional status and urgent care utilization (ie, emergency department visits and hospital readmissions) within this period.A total of 232 participants were enrolled in the study (118 randomized to control and 114 randomized to the intervention). Participants had a mean (SD) age of 40 (14) years, 141 (61%) were female, 101 (43%) were White, and 103 (44%) had an annual household income less than $50 000. Daily step counts increased from 3795 to 4652 steps (difference, 857 steps; 95% CI, 488 to 1224 steps) among intervention participants and increased from 3951 to 4499 steps (difference, 548 steps; 95% CI, 193 to 903 steps) among control participants. The change in mean daily step count from baseline was not significantly different for participants in the intervention group vs the control group (adjusted difference, 270 steps; 95% CI, −214 to 754 steps; P = .27). Among the subgroup of 76 participants with higher levels of social engagement, post hoc exploratory analyses showed a significant increase in mobility for intervention vs control (adjusted difference, 1125 steps; 95% CI, 409 to 1841 steps; P = .002). Fewer participants in this subgroup experienced functional decline (1 of 36 participants [4%] in the intervention group vs 5 of 40 participants [12%] in the control group) and hospital readmission at 30 days (3 of 36 participants [8%] in the intervention group vs 6 of 40 participants [15%] in the control group), but the differences were not statistically significant. There were no significant differences in these secondary outcomes for the overall sample.Gamification with social incentives did not affect mobility or functional decline in all participants, but post hoc analysis suggests positive findings for both outcomes for patients with higher social engagement.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03321279",

      "abstract": "Surgeons must balance management of acute postoperative pain with opioid stewardship. Patient-centered methods that immediately evaluate pain and opioid consumption can be used to guide prescribing and shared decision-making.To assess the difference between the number of opioid tablets prescribed and the self-reported number of tablets taken as well as self-reported pain intensity and ability to manage pain after orthopedic and urologic procedures with use of an automated text messaging system.This quality improvement study was conducted at a large, urban academic health care system in Pennsylvania. Adult patients (aged ≥18 years) who underwent orthopedic and urologic procedures and received postoperative prescriptions for opioids were included. Data were collected prospectively using automated text messaging until postoperative day 28, from May 1 to December 31, 2019.The primary outcome was the difference between the number of opioid tablets prescribed and the patient-reported number of tablets taken (in oxycodone 5-mg tablet equivalents). Secondary outcomes were self-reported pain intensity (on a scale of 0-10, with 10 being the highest level of pain) and ability to manage pain (on a scale of 0-10, with 10 representing very able to control pain) after orthopedic and urologic procedures.Of the 919 study participants, 742 (80.7%) underwent orthopedic procedures and 177 (19.2%) underwent urologic procedures. Among those who underwent orthopedic procedures, 384 (51.8%) were women, 491 (66.7%) were White, and the median age was 48 years (interquartile range [IQR], 32-61 years); 514 (69.8%) had an outpatient procedure. Among those who underwent urologic procedures, 145 (84.8%) were men, 138 (80.7%) were White, and the median age was 56 years (IQR, 40-67 years); 106 (62%) had an outpatient procedure. The mean (SD) pain score on day 4 after orthopedic procedures was 4.72 (2.54), with a mean (SD) change by day 21 of −0.40 (1.91). The mean (SD) ability to manage pain score on day 4 was 7.32 (2.59), with a mean (SD) change of −0.80 (2.72) by day 21. The mean (SD) pain score on day 4 after urologic procedures was 3.48 (2.43), with a mean (SD) change by day 21 of −1.50 (2.12). The mean (SD) ability to manage pain score on day 4 was 7.34 (2.81), with a mean (SD) change of 0.80 (1.75) by day 14. The median quantity of opioids prescribed for patients who underwent orthopedic procedures was high compared with self-reported consumption (20 tablets [IQR, 15-30 tablets] vs 6 tablets used [IQR, 0-14 tablets]), similar to findings for patients who underwent urologic procedures (7 tablets [IQR, 5-10 tablets] vs 1 tablet used [IQR, 0-4 tablets]). Over the study period, 9452 of 15 581 total tablets prescribed (60.7%) were unused. A total of 589 patients (64.1%) used less than half of the amount prescribed, and 256 patients (27.8%) did not use any opioids (179 [24.1%] who underwent orthopedic procedures and 77 [43.5%] who underwent urologic procedures).In this quality improvement study of adult patients reporting use of opioids after common orthopedic and urologic surgical procedures through a text messaging system, the quantities of opioids prescribed and the quantity consumed differed. Patient-reported data collected through text messaging may support clinicians in tailoring prescriptions and guide shared decision-making to limit excess quantities of prescribed opioids.",

      "abstract": "Financial incentives may improve health by rewarding patients for focusing on present actions—such as medication regimen adherence—that provide longer-term health benefits.To identify barriers to improving statin therapy adherence and control of cholesterol levels with financial incentives and insights for the design of future interventions.This qualitative study involved retrospective interviews with participants in a preplanned secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial of financial incentives for statin therapy adherence. A total of 636 trial participants from several US insurer or employer populations and an academic health system were rank ordered by change in low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDLC) levels. Participants with the most LDLC level improvement (high-improvement group) and those with LDLC levels that did not improve (nonimprovement group) were purposively targeted, stratified across all trial groups, for semistructured telephone interviews that were performed from April 1 to June 30, 2018. Interviews were coded using a team-based, iterative approach. Data were analyzed from July 1, 2018, to October 31, 2020.The primary outcome was mean change in LDLC level from baseline to 12 months; the secondary outcome, statin therapy adherence during the first 6 months.A total of 54 patients were interviewed, divided equally between high-improvement and nonimprovement groups, with a mean (SD) age of 43.5 (10.3) years; 36 (66.7%) were women, 28 (51.9%) had diabetes, and 18 (33.3%) had cardiovascular disease. Compared with the high-improvement group, the nonimprovement group had fewer interviewees with an annual income of greater than $50 000 (11 [40.7%] vs 22 [81.5%]), worse self-reported health (fair to poor, 13 [48.1%] vs 3 [11.1%]), more Black interviewees (16 [59.3%] vs 4 [14.8%]), and lower baseline LDLC levels (&gt;160 mg/dL, 2 [7.4%] vs 25 [92.6%]). Participants in the nonimprovement group had a greater burden of chronic illness (≥2 chronic conditions, 13 [48.1%] vs 6 [22.2%]) and were less frequently employed (full-time, 6 [22.2%] vs 12 [44.4%]). In interviews, the nonimprovement group was less focused on risks of high LDLC levels, described less engagement in LDLC level management, articulated fewer specific nutritional choices for optimizing health, and recounted greater difficulty obtaining healthy food. Participants in both groups had difficulty describing the structure of the financial incentives but did recall features of the electronic pill containers used to track adherence and how those containers affected medication routines.Participants in a statin adherence trial whose LDLC levels did not improve found it more difficult to create medication routines and respond to financial incentives in the context of complex living conditions and a high burden of chronic illness. These findings suggest that future studies should be more attentive to socioeconomic circumstances of trial participants.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01798784",

      "abstract": "Gamification is increasingly being used to promote healthy behaviors. However, it has not been well tested among patients with chronic conditions and over longer durations.To test the effectiveness of behaviorally designed gamification interventions to enhance support, collaboration, or competition to promote physical activity and weight loss among adults with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes.A 4-arm randomized clinical trial with a 1-year intervention was conducted from January 23, 2017, to January 27, 2020, with remotely monitored intervention. Analyses were conducted between February 10 and October 6, 2020. Participants included 361 adults with type 2 diabetes with hemoglobin A1c levels greater than or equal to 8% and body mass index greater than or equal to 25.All participants received a wearable device, smart weight scale, and laboratory testing. Participants in the control group received feedback from their devices but no other interventions. Participants in the gamification arms conducted goal setting and were entered into a 1-year game designed using insights from behavioral economics with points and levels for achieving step goals and weight loss targets. The game varied by trial arm to promote either support, collaboration, or competition.Co-primary outcomes included daily step count, weight, and hemoglobin A1c level. Secondary outcome was low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level. Intention-to-treat analysis was used.Participants had a mean (SD) age of 52.5 (10.1) years; hemoglobin A1c level, 9.6% (1.6%); daily steps, 4632 (2523); weight, 107.4 kg (20.8 kg); and body mass index, 37.1 (6.6). Of the 361 participants, 202 (56.0%) were women, 143 (39.6%) were White, and 185 (51.2%) were Black; with 87 (24.1%) randomized to control; 92 (25.4%) randomized to gamification with support and intervention; 95 (26.3%) randomized to gamification with collaboration; and 87 (24.1%) randomized to gamification with competition. Compared with the control group over 1 year, there was a significant increase in mean daily steps from baseline among participants receiving gamification with support (adjusted difference relative to control group, 503 steps; 95% CI, 103 to 903 steps; P = .01) and competition (606 steps; 95% CI, 201 to 1011 steps; P = .003) but not collaboration (280 steps; 95% CI, −115 to 674 steps; P = .16). All trial arms had significant reductions in weight and hemoglobin A1c levels from baseline, but there were no significant differences between any of the intervention arms and the control arm. There was only 1 adverse event reported that may have been related to the trial (arthritic knee pain).Among adults with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, a behaviorally designed gamification intervention in this randomized clinical trial significantly increased physical activity over a 1-year period when designed to enhance either support or competition but not collaboration. No differences between intervention and control groups were found for other outcomes.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02961192",

We developed and tested an automated text-based remote symptom-monitoring program to facilitate early detection of worsening symptoms and rapid assessment for patients with cancer and suspected or confirmed COVID-19.\n            \n            \n              METHODS\n              We conducted a feasibility study of Cancer COVID Watch, an automated COVID-19 symptom-monitoring program with oncology nurse practitioner (NP)-led triage among patients with cancer between April 23 and June 30, 2020. Twenty-six patients with cancer and suspected or confirmed COVID-19 were enrolled. Enrolled patients received twice daily automated text messages over 14 days that asked “How are you feeling compared to 12 hours ago? Better, worse, or the same?” and, if worse, “Is it harder than usual for you to breathe?” Patients who responded worse and yes were contacted within 1 hour by an oncology NP.\n            \n            \n              RESULTS\n              Mean age of patients was 62.5 years. Seventeen (65%) were female, 10 (38%) Black, and 15 (58%) White. Twenty-five (96%) patients responded to ≥ 1 symptom check-in, and overall response rate was 78%. Four (15%) patients were escalated to the triage line: one was advised to present to the emergency department (ED), and three were managed in the outpatient setting. Median time from escalation to triage call was 11.5 minutes. Four (15%) patients presented to the ED without first escalating their care via our program. Participant satisfaction was high (Net Promoter Score: 100, n = 4).\n            \n            \n              CONCLUSION\n              Implementation of an intensive remote symptom monitoring and rapid NP triage program for outpatients with cancer and suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection is possible. Similar tools may facilitate more rapid triage for patients with cancer in future pandemics.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To determine whether remote monitoring of diuretic adherence and weight changes with financial incentives reduces hospital readmissions or death following discharge with HF. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Electronic Monitoring of Patients Offers Ways to Enhance Recovery (EMPOWER) study, a 3-hospital pragmatic trial, randomized 552 adults recently discharged with HF to usual care (n = 280) or a compound intervention (n = 272) designed to inform clinicians of diuretic adherence and changes in patient weight. Patients were recruited from May 25, 2016, to April 8, 2019, and followed up for 12 months. Investigators were blinded to assignment but patients were not. Analysis was by intent to treat. INTERVENTIONS Participants randomized to the intervention arm received digital scales, electronic pill bottles for diuretic medication, and regret lottery incentives conditional on the previous day’s adherence to both medication and weight measurement, with $1.40 expected daily value. Participants’ physicians were alerted if participants’ weights increased 1.4 kg in 24 hours or 2.3 kg in 72 hours or if diuretic medications were missed for 5 days. Alerts and weights were integrated into the electronic health record. Participants randomized to the control arm received usual care and no further study contact. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Time to death or readmission for any cause within 12 months.\nRESULTS Of the 552 participants, 290 were men (52.5%); 291 patients (52.7%) were Black, 231 were White (41.8%), and 16 were Hispanic (2.9%); mean (SD) age was 64.5 (11.8) years. The mean (SD) ejection fraction was 43% (18.1%). Each month, approximately 75% of participants were 80% adherent to both medication and weight measurement. There were 423 readmissions and 26 deaths in the control group and 377 readmissions and 23 deaths in the intervention group. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups for the combined outcome of all-cause inpatient readmission or death (unadjusted hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.74-1.13; P = .40) and no significant differences in all-cause inpatient readmission or observation stay or death, all-cause cardiovascular readmission or death, time to first event, and total all-cause deaths. Participants in the intervention group were slightly more likely to spend fewer days in the hospital.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this randomized clinical trial, there was no reduction in the combined outcome of readmission or mortality in a year-long intensive remote monitoring program with incentives for patients previously hospitalized for HF.",

Daily step counts were examined descriptively. Predictors of daily steps were explored across the full sample, then by diagnosis, using linear mixed-effects regression analyses.\nResults\nForty participants (n=20 PD; n=20 stroke) were included in the analysis with a mean (SD) age of 72.9 (7.6) years. Participants resided 252.6 (105.6) miles from the coordinating site. Recruitment response rates were 11% (PD) and 6% (stroke). Study completion rates were 71% (PD) and 80% (stroke). Device adherence rates were 97.0% (PD) and 95.2% (stroke). Participants with PD achieved a median [interquartile range] of 2618 [3896] steps per day and participants with stroke achieved 4832 [7383] steps. Age was the only significant predictor of daily steps for the full sample (-265 steps, 95% confidence interval [-407, -123]) and by diagnosis (PD, -175 steps, [-335, -15]; stroke, -357 steps [-603, -112]).\nConclusions\nA remote physical activity monitoring program for rurally residing individuals with PD or stroke was feasible. This study establishes a model for a scalable physical activity program for rural, older populations with neurologic conditions from a central coordinating site.",

      "abstract": "Background\nObesity is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease, particularly through its effects on blood pressure. Though maintaining a negative caloric balance leads to weight loss, many patients struggle to adhere to low calorie diets over the long term. Time-restricted eating, a subtype of intermittent fasting (IF), may be an easier dietary pattern for patients to initiate and maintain. We tested the feasibility of a bidirectional texting strategy to help patients with obesity and hypertension initiate and maintain time-restricted eating, and whether a commitment device, a pledge to behave in a certain way in the future while making nonadherence costlier, would increase adherence beyond bidirectional texting.\nMethods\nPatients with obesity and hypertension seen in cardiology clinics were provided education on time-restricted eating and randomized to a commitment device versus attention control. Attention control consisted of daily bidirectional text messages asking whether patients adhered to IF and weekly text messages asking participants to send their weight and blood pressure. The commitment device involved the same text messages as attention control, plus a commitment contract, setting of implementation intentions with respect to details of time-restricted eating, and involvement of a support partner who received weekly updates on the participant's adherence to time-restricted eating. The intervention lasted 12 weeks, followed by a 6-week follow-up period. The primary outcome was days per week adherent to time-restricted eating over the 18-week study period, measured by daily self-report. We also compared change from baseline weight and blood pressure between randomized groups.\nResults\nA total of 37 patients were randomized and started the study—20 to attention control and 17 to the commitment device. Mean age was 60 years old, and mean BMI was 38.4 kg/m2. Over the 18-week study period, the mean ± standard deviation (SD) number of days per week adherent to time-restricted eating was 4.7 ± 1.9 in the control arm and 5.4 ± 1.7 in the intervention arm (P = .23). Mean systolic blood pressure declined from 135 to 128 mm Hg among all participants (P = .006) with no difference between groups in change from baseline blood pressure (P = .74). Weight decreased from 229 to 223 pounds among all participants (P = .25) with no significant difference between groups in change from baseline weight (P = .84).\nConclusions\nA bidirectional texting strategy was feasible for helping patients with obesity and hypertension initiate and adhere to time-restricted eating. Adding a commitment device to bidirectional texting did not increase adherence to time-restricted eating compared with attention control, nor were there significant between group changes in blood pressure or weight, but these comparisons were underpowered. A larger randomized trial of the effect of this scalable intervention, compared with usual care, on blood pressure and weight among patients with obesity and hypertension is warranted.\nClinical trials registration\nclinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: NCT04836312.",

      "abstract": "Background Heart failure (HF) is one of the most common reasons for hospital admission and is a major cause of morbidity, mortality, and increasing health care costs. The EMPOWER study was a randomized trial that used remote monitoring technology to track patients’ weight and diuretic adherence and a state-of-the-art approach derived from behavioral economics to motivate adherence to the reverse monitoring technology.\nObjective The goal was to explore patient and clinician perceptions of the program and its impact on perceived health outcomes and better understand why some patients or clinicians did better or worse than others in response to the intervention. Approach This was a retrospective qualitative study utilizing semi-structured interviews with 43 patients and 16 clinicians to understand the trial’s processes, reflecting on successes and areas for improvement for future iterations of behavioral economic interventions. Key results Many patients felt supported, and they appreciated the intervention. Many also appreciated the lottery intervention, and while it was not an incentive for enrolling for many respondents, it may have increased adherence during the study. Clinicians felt that the intervention integrated well into their workflow, but the number of alerts was burdensome. Additionally, responses to alerts varied considerably by provider, perhaps because there are no professional guidelines for alerts unaccompanied by severe symptoms.\nConclusion Our qualitative analysis indicates potential areas for additional exploration and consideration to design better behavioral economic interventions to improve cardiovascular health outcomes for patients with HF. Patients appreciated lottery incentives for adhering to program requirements; however, many were too far along in their disease progression to benefit from the intervention. Clinicians found the amount and frequency of electronic alerts burdensome and felt they did not improve patient outcomes. Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT02708654.",

      "abstract": "Background\nHigher levels of physical activity are associated with improvements in cardiovascular health, and consensus guidelines recommend that individuals with or at risk for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) participate in regular physical activity. However, most adults do not achieve recommended levels of physical activity. Concepts from behavioral economics have been used to design scalable interventions that increase physical activity over short time periods, but the longer-term efficacy of these strategies is uncertain.\nStudy Design and Objectives\nBE ACTIVE (NCT03911141) is a pragmatic, virtual, randomized controlled trial designed to evaluate the effectiveness of 3 strategies informed by behavioral economic concepts to increase daily physical activity in patients with established ASCVD or 10-year ASCVD risk > 7.5% who are seen in primary care and cardiology clinics affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania Health System. Patients are contacted by email or text message, and complete enrollment and informed consent on the Penn Way to Health online platform. Patients are then provided with a wearable fitness tracker, establish a baseline daily step count, set a goal to increase daily step count by 33% to 50%, and are randomized 1:2:2:2 to control, gamification, financial incentives, or both gamification and financial incentives. Interventions continue for 12 months, with follow-up for an additional 6 months to evaluate the durability of behavior change. The trial has met its enrollment goal of 1050 participants, with a primary endpoint of change from baseline in daily steps over the 12-month intervention period. Key secondary endpoints include change from baseline in daily steps over the 6-month post-intervention follow-up period and change in moderate to vigorous physical activity over the intervention and follow-up periods. If the interventions prove effective, their effects on life expectancy will be compared with their costs in cost-effectiveness analysis.\nConclusions\nBE ACTIVE is a virtual, pragmatic randomized clinical trial powered to demonstrate whether gamification, financial incentives, or both are superior to attention control in increasing physical activity. Its results will have important implications for strategies to promote physical activity in patients with or at risk for ASCVD, as well as for the design and implementation of pragmatic virtual clinical trials within health systems.",

In this clinical trial, we randomly assigned 500 patients discharged from hospital to home to use either a smartphone or wearable device to collect and transmit remote patient monitoring (RPM) data on activity patterns after hospital discharge. Analyses were conducted at the patient-day level using discrete-time survival analysis. Each arm was split into training and testing folds. The training set used fivefold cross-validation and then final model results are from predictions on the test set. A standard model comprised data collected up to the time of discharge including demographics, comorbidities, hospital length of stay, and vitals prior to discharge. An enhanced model consisted of the standard model plus RPM data. Traditional parametric regression models (logit and lasso) were compared to nonparametric machine learning approaches (random forest, gradient boosting, and ensemble). The main outcome was hospital readmission or death within 30 days of discharge. Prediction of 30-day hospital readmission significantly improved when including remotely-monitored patient data on activity patterns after hospital discharge and using nonparametric machine learning approaches. Wearables slightly outperformed smartphones but both had good prediction of 30-day hospital-readmission.",

Genetic testing is underused overall, and rates are consistently lower among Black and Hispanic populations. Behavioral economics-informed implementation strategies, or nudges, directed towards patients and clinicians may increase the use of this evidence-based clinical practice.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              Patients meeting eligibility for germline genetic testing for breast and ovarian cancer will be identified using electronic phenotyping algorithms. A pragmatic cohort study will test three sequential strategies to promote genetic testing, two directed at patients and one directed at clinicians, deployed in the electronic health record (EHR) for patients in OB-GYN clinics across a diverse academic medical center. We will use rapid cycle approaches informed by relevant clinician and patient experiences, health equity, and behavioral economics to optimize and de-risk our strategies and methods before trial initiation. Step 1 will send patients messages through the health system patient portal. For non-responders, step 2 will reach out to patients via text message. For non-responders, Step 3 will contact patients’ clinicians using a novel “pend and send” tool in the EHR. The primary implementation outcome is engagement with germline genetic testing for breast and ovarian cancer predisposition, defined as a scheduled genetic counseling appointment. Patient data collected through the EHR (e.g., race/ethnicity, geocoded address) will be examined as moderators of the impact of the strategies.\n            \n            \n              Discussion\n              This study will be one of the first to sequentially examine the effects of patient- and clinician-directed strategies informed by behavioral economics on engagement with breast and ovarian cancer genetic testing. The pragmatic and sequential design will facilitate a large and diverse patient sample, allow for the assessment of incremental gains from different implementation strategies, and permit the assessment of moderators of strategy effectiveness. The findings may help determine the impact of low-cost, highly transportable implementation strategies that can be integrated into healthcare systems to improve the use of genomic medicine.\n            \n            \n              Trial registration\n              \n                ClinicalTrials.gov.

      "abstract": "Hypertension management has traditionally been based on office visits. Integrating remote monitoring into routine clinical practices and leveraging social support might improve blood pressure (BP) control.To evaluate the effectiveness of a bidirectional text monitoring program focused on BP control and medication adherence with and without social support in adults with hypertension.This randomized clinical trial included adults aged 18 to 75 treated at an academic family medicine practice in Philadelphia in 2018 and 2019. Patients had been seen at least twice in the prior 24 months and had at least 2 elevated BP measurements (&gt;150/90 mm Hg or &gt;140/90 mm Hg for patients aged 18-59 years or with diabetes or chronic kidney disease) during visits. All participants had a cell phone with text messaging, offered at least 1 support partner, and were taking maintenance medications to treat hypertension. Patients were randomized 2:2:1 to remote monitoring of BP and medication adherence (RM), remote monitoring of BP and medication adherence with feedback provided to a social support partner (SS), or usual care (UC). Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis between October 14, 2019, and May 30, 2020, and were revisited from May 23 through June 2, 2023.The RM and SS groups received an automatic home BP monitor, 3 weekly texts requesting BP measurements, 1 weekly text inquiring about medication adherence, and a weekly text with feedback. In the SS arm, support partners received a weekly progress report. The UC group received UC through their primary care practice. Clinicians caring for the patients in the intervention groups received nudges via electronic health records to adjust medications when 3 of 10 reported BP measurements were elevated. Patients were followed up for 4 months.The primary outcome was systolic BP at 4 months measured during the final follow-up visit. Secondary outcomes included achievement of normotension and diastolic BP.In all, 246 patients (mean [SD] age, 50.9 [11.4] years; 175 females [71.1%]; 223 Black individuals [90.7%] and 13 White individuals [5.3%]) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis: 100 patients in the RM arm, 97 in the SS arm, and 49 in the UC arm. Compared with the UC arm, there was no significant difference in systolic or diastolic BP at the 4-month follow-up visit in the RM arm (systolic BP adjusted mean difference, −5.25 [95% CI, −10.65 to 0.15] mm Hg; diastolic BP adjusted mean difference, −1.94 [95% CI, −5.14 to 1.27] mm Hg) or the SS arm (systolic BP adjusted mean difference, −0.91 [95% CI, −6.37 to 4.55] mm Hg; diastolic BP adjusted mean difference, −0.63 [95% CI, −3.77 to 2.51] mm Hg). Of the 206 patients with a final BP measurement at 4 months, BP was controlled in 49% (41 of 84) of patients in the RM arm, 31% (27 of 87) of patients in the SS arm, and 40% (14 of 35) of patients in the UC arm; these rates did not differ significantly between the intervention arms and the UC group.In this randomized clinical trial, neither remote BP monitoring nor remote BP monitoring with social support improved BP control compared with UC in adults with hypertension. Additional efforts are needed to examine whether interventions directed at helping patients remember to take their BP medications can lead to improved BP control.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT03416283",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Physical activity is associated with a lower risk of major adverse cardiovascular events, but few individuals achieve guideline-recommended levels of physical activity. Strategies informed by behavioral economics increase physical activity, but their longer-term effectiveness is uncertain. We sought to determine the effect of behaviorally designed gamification, loss-framed financial incentives, or their combination on physical activity compared with attention control over 12-month intervention and 6-month postintervention follow-up periods.\nMETHODS: Between May 2019 and January 2024, participants with clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or a 10year risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or cardiovascular death of ≥7.5% by the Pooled Cohort equation were enrolled in a pragmatic randomized clinical trial. Participants received a wearable device to track daily steps, established a baseline, selected a step goal increase, and were randomly assigned to control (n=151), behaviorally designed gamification (n=304), loss-framed financial incentives (n=302), or gamification+financial incentives (n=305). The primary outcome of the trial was the change in mean daily steps from baseline through the 12-month intervention period.\nRESULTS: A total of 1062 patients (mean±SD age, 67±8; 61% female; 31% non-White) were enrolled. Compared with control subjects, participants had significantly greater increases in mean daily steps from baseline during the 12-month intervention in the gamification arm (adjusted difference, 538.0 [95% CI, 186.2–889.9]; P=0.0027), financial incentives arm (adjusted difference, 491.8 [95% CI, 139.6–844.1]; P=0.0062), and gamification+financial incentives arm (adjusted difference, 868.0 [95% CI, 516.3–1219.7]; P<0.0001). During the 6-month follow-up, physical activity remained significantly greater in the gamification+financial incentives arm than in the control arm (adjusted difference, 576.2 [95% CI, 198.5–954]; P=0.0028), but it was not significantly greater in the gamification (adjusted difference, 459.8 [95% CI, 82.0–837.6]; P=0.0171) or financial incentives (adjusted difference, 327.9 [95% CI, −50.2 to 706]; P=0.09) arms after adjustment for multiple comparisons.\nCONCLUSIONS: Behaviorally designed gamification, loss-framed financial incentives, and the combination of both increased physical activity compared with control over a 12-month intervention period, with the largest effect in gamification+financial incentives. These interventions could be a useful component of strategies to reduce cardiovascular risk in high-risk patients.",

Little is known about how patients use these programs and what types of needs are addressed through this approach.\nObjective: The goal of this study was to describe the types and timing of postdischarge needs identified during a 30‐day automated texting program.\nMethods: The program ran from January to August 2021 at a primary care practice in Philadelphia. In this mixed‐methods study, two reviewers conducted a directed content analysis of patient needs expressed during the program, categorizing them along a well‐known transitional care framework. We describe the frequency of need categories and their timing relative to discharge.\nResults: A total of 405 individuals were enrolled; the mean (SD) age was 62.7 (16.2); 64.2% were female; 47.4% were Black; and 49.9% had Medicare insurance. Of this population, 178 (44.0%) expressed at least one need during the 30‐day program. The most frequent needs addressed were related to symptoms (26.8%), coordinating follow‐up care (20.4%), and medication issues (15.7%). The mean (SD) number of days from discharge to need was 10.8 (7.9); there were no significant differences in timing based on need category.\nConclusions: The needs identified via an automated texting program were concentrated in three areas relevant to primary care practice and within nursing scope of practice. This program can serve as a model for health systems looking to support transitions through an operationally efficient approach, and the findings of this analysis can inform future iterations of this type of program.",

      "abstract": "The health care workforce continues to experience high rates of depression and anxiety. Finding ways to effectively support the mental health and well-being of health care workers is challenging.To test the effectiveness of remote, pushed digital assessments and engagement to improve depression and anxiety among health care workers compared with usual care.This was a 9-month randomized clinical trial with a 6-month intervention period. Participants were health care workers with self-reported daily access to a smartphone and at least 4 clinical hours per week. Participants were randomized to usual care or the intervention between January 2022 and March 2023. Data analyses were conducted between May and July 2023.All participants completed baseline, 6-month, and 9-month mental health, well-being, and burnout assessments. The control group had open access to a web-based mental health platform. Participants in the intervention group received monthly text messaging about mental health, mental health assessments, and linkages to care.The primary outcomes were mean change in depression and anxiety scores at 6 months from baseline. Secondary outcomes include mean change in well-being, burnout, and self-reported workplace productivity.In this study, 1275 participants were randomized (642 [50.4%] to the intervention group and 633 [49.6%] to control group). Participants had a mean (SD) age of 38.6 (10.9) years, 1063 participants (83.4%) were female, 320 (25.1%) self-identified as Black, and 793 (62.2%) self-identified as White. Across the groups, the mean difference in depression score was significantly different at 6 months (−0.96 [95% CI, −1.52 to −0.40]) and at 9 months (−1.14 [95% CI, −1.69 to −0.58]). The mean difference in anxiety score from baseline to 6 months was statistically significantly larger for those in the intervention group vs usual care (−0.71 [95% CI, −1.25 to −0.17]) and held true at 9 months (−1.06 [95% CI, −1.59 to −0.52]).In a trial of health care workers, a proactive digital engagement strategy, including pushed text messaging, mobile mental health assessments, and connection to care, improved depression and anxiety over a 6-month period compared with simply making the same resources available for individuals to find and use.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05028075",

      "abstract": "Serious illness conversations (SICs) that elicit patients’ values, goals, and care preferences reduce anxiety and depression and improve quality of life, but occur infrequently for patients with cancer. Behavioral economic implementation strategies (nudges) directed at clinicians and/or patients may increase SIC completion.To test the independent and combined effects of clinician and patient nudges on SIC completion.A 2 × 2 factorial, cluster randomized trial was conducted from September 7, 2021, to March 11, 2022, at oncology clinics across 4 hospitals and 6 community sites within a large academic health system in Pennsylvania and New Jersey among 163 medical and gynecologic oncology clinicians and 4450 patients with cancer at high risk of mortality (≥10% risk of 180-day mortality).Clinician clusters and patients were independently randomized to receive usual care vs nudges, resulting in 4 arms: (1) active control, operating for 2 years prior to trial start, consisting of clinician text message reminders to complete SICs for patients at high mortality risk; (2) clinician nudge only, consisting of active control plus weekly peer comparisons of clinician-level SIC completion rates; (3) patient nudge only, consisting of active control plus a preclinic electronic communication designed to prime patients for SICs; and (4) combined clinician and patient nudges.The primary outcome was a documented SIC in the electronic health record within 6 months of a participant’s first clinic visit after randomization. Analysis was performed on an intent-to-treat basis at the patient level.The study accrued 4450 patients (median age, 67 years [IQR, 59-75 years]; 2352 women [52.9%]) seen by 163 clinicians, randomized to active control (n = 1004), clinician nudge (n = 1179), patient nudge (n = 997), or combined nudges (n = 1270). Overall patient-level rates of 6-month SIC completion were 11.2% for the active control arm (112 of 1004), 11.5% for the clinician nudge arm (136 of 1179), 11.5% for the patient nudge arm (115 of 997), and 14.1% for the combined nudge arm (179 of 1270). Compared with active control, the combined nudges were associated with an increase in SIC rates (ratio of hazard ratios [rHR], 1.55 [95% CI, 1.00-2.40]; P = .049), whereas the clinician nudge (HR, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.64-1.41; P = .79) and patient nudge (HR, 0.99 [95% CI, 0.73-1.33]; P = .93) were not.In this cluster randomized trial, nudges combining clinician peer comparisons with patient priming questionnaires were associated with a marginal increase in documented SICs compared with an active control. Combining clinician- and patient-directed nudges may help to promote SICs in routine cancer care.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT04867850",

However, we lack strong estimates of the incidence of food allergic reactions among adolescents.\nObjective: To estimate the incidence of food allergic and anaphylactic reactions among adolescents with food allergy who have a prescription for epinephrine.\nMethods: As part of a cohort study that was embedded in a randomized trial to promote safe food allergy management, we followed adolescents aged 15 to 19 years with food allergy and a current prescription for epinephrine for a period of 15 months in 2019 to 2020. At monthly intervals, participants were asked, through text message check-ins, whether they had experienced a food allergic reaction due to accidental exposure to food allergens in the past month.\nResults: Among the cohort of 131 adolescents, 112 answered at least 1 of the 15 monthly check-ins. Together, these respondents contributed 742 person-months of follow-up data of a total possible 1680 person-months. In the 15-month study period, the incidence of food allergic reactions among adolescents with food allergy was 34.0 events per 100 person-years (95% CI: 21.0-51.9). The incidence of food allergic reactions meeting the criteria for anaphylaxis was 16.2 events per 100 person-years (95% CI: 7.8-29.7).\nConclusion: Data on the incidence of food allergic reactions can help set expectations for safe food allergy management for adolescents and their families, and can help inform discussions between patients, families, and physicians regarding different treatment options available and their associated risks and beneﬁts.",

      "abstract": "Anxiety disorders are prevalent and undertreated among young adults. Digital mental health interventions for anxiety are promising but limited by a narrow range of therapeutic components and low user engagement.To investigate the efficacy of and engagement with Maya, a scalable, self-guided, comprehensive mobile cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) intervention with embedded engagement features, comparing the effects of 3 incentive conditions.This randomized clinical trial recruited young adults aged 18 to 25 years with anxiety disorders through online advertisements and outpatient psychiatry clinics at Weill Cornell Medicine. Enrollment was between June 16, 2021, and November 11, 2022. Data analysis was performed from December 21, 2022, to June 14, 2024.Participants received a 6-week program of the intervention and were randomized to 1 of 3 different text message–based incentive conditions (gain-framed, loss-framed, or gain–social support).The primary outcome was change in anxious symptoms from baseline to end of treatment, as measured by the Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A). The Anxiety Sensitivity Index and the Leibowitz Social Anxiety Scale scores were secondary measures.The sample consisted of 59 participants (mean [SD] age, 23.1 [1.9] years; 46 [78%] female; 22 [37%] Asian, 3 [5%] Black, 5 [8%] Hispanic or Latino, 1 [2%] American Indian or Alaska Native, 25 [42%] White, and 6 [10%] &gt;1 race; 32 [54%] college-educated and 12 [20%] graduate or professional school-educated; mean [SD] baseline HAM-A score, 15.0 [6.5]). Anxiety, measured by HAM-A, decreased across conditions from baseline to end of the intervention (mean difference, −5.64; 95% CI, −7.23 to −4.05), and symptomatic improvement was maintained at the week 12 follow-up (baseline to follow-up mean difference, −5.67; 95% CI, −7.29 to −4.04). However, there was no evidence that change in anxiety differed by incentive condition (loss-framed vs gain–social support mean difference, −1.40; 95% CI, −4.72 to 1.93; gain-framed vs gain–social support mean difference, 1.38; 95% CI, −1.19 to 3.96). Secondary anxiety measures (Anxiety Sensitivity Index and Liebowitz Social Anxiety Scale scores) showed a similar pattern of improvement, with no evidence of differences between incentive conditions. Participants completed most of the 12 sessions (mean [SD], 10.8 [2.1]; 95% CI, 10.3-11.4), and User Mobile Application Rating Scale app quality ratings exceeded the published threshold for acceptability at all study visits. There was no evidence that either session completion or app quality ratings differed by incentive condition.In this randomized clinical trial of an app-based intervention for anxiety, the primary hypothesis that improvement in anxiety would be greatest in the condition using gain of points plus social incentives was not supported; however, the results suggest that a CBT application incorporating a full suite of CBT skills and embedded user engagement features was efficacious in improving symptoms in young adults with anxiety disorders. Given these findings, digital interventions represent a promising step toward wider dissemination of high-quality, evidence-based interventions.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05130281",

      "abstract": "Background: Late morbidity after childhood cancer may be mitigated by healthy lifestyle behaviors. We piloted a game-based, parent–child digital intervention to increase activity in sedentary survivors.\nMethods: Survivors aged 10–16 treated with cardiotoxic therapy and not meeting US physical activity guidelines were enrolled in a single-arm study with a parent. Following a 14-day run-in, participants chose a prespecified step goal and wore an accelerometer daily for 24 weeks (12-week game-based intervention; 12-week follow-up). Participants completed the Acceptability of Intervention Measure (AIM) at 24 weeks; a subset of dyads completed qualitative interviews.\nResults: Among 129 eligible survivors, 27 enrolled (20.9% participation rate) with a parent. Four dyads were removed during the 14-day run-in period due to noncompliance. Among the 23 dyads who continued to the study, the tracker was worn for 95% of days during the 12-week intervention (95% confidence interval [CI]: 94–96) and 81% during the 12-week follow-up (95% CI: 79–82). Overall, the prespecified step goal was met for 64% (95% CI: 63–66) of days during the intervention and 37% (95% CI: 35–38) during the follow-up. At the end of study, 17/23 dyads responded to AIM; 82% of survivors and 94% of parents reported the intervention as acceptable. During qualitative interviews (n = 5), dyads noted that they liked the accountability of the “buddy system,” but would have liked more personalized goal-setting.\nConclusions: Despite high ratings of acceptability among participants, difficulties with sustained adherence and retention were encountered in this parent–child gamification intervention. Alternate, tailored designs should be considered in the future.",

Suboptimal control of hypertension and hyperlipidemia are common factors contributing to ASCVD risk. The Penn Medicine Healthy Heart (PMHH) Study is a randomized clinical trial testing the effectiveness of a system designed to offload work from primary care clinicians and improve patient follow-through with risk reduction strategies by using a centralized team of nonclinical navigators and advanced practice providers, remote monitoring, and bi-directional text messaging, augmented by behavioral science engagement strategies. The intervention builds on prior nonrandomized evaluations of these design elements that demonstrated significant improvement in patients’ systolic blood pressure and LDL Cholesterol (LDL-C).\nPrimary Hypothesis\nPenn Medicine Healthy Heart will significantly improve systolic blood pressure and LDL-C compared to usual care over the 6 months of this intervention.\nDesign\nRandomized clinical trial of Penn Medicine Healthy Heart in patients aged 35-80 years at elevated risk of ASCVD whose systolic blood pressure and LDL-C are not well controlled. The intervention consists of 4 modules that address blood pressure management, lipid management, nutrition, and smoking cessation, offered in a phased approach to give the participant time to learn about each topic, adopt any recommendations, and build a relationship with the care team.\nSites\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Health System at primary care practices located in inner-city urban and rural/semi-rural areas.\nPrimary Outcomes\nImprovement in systolic blood pressure and LDL-C.\nSecondary Outcomes\nCost-effectiveness analyses are planned to evaluate the health care costs and health outcomes of the intervention approach. An implementation evaluation is planned to understand factors influencing success of the intervention.\nEstimated Enrollment\n2,420 active patients of Penn Medicine primary care practices who have clinical ASCVD, or who are at elevated risk for ASCVD, and who are (a) not on statins or have LDL-C >100 despite being on statins and (b) had systolic blood pressure >140 at 2 recent ambulatory visits.\nEnrollment Dates\nMarch 2024-March 2025.

      "abstract": "Objectives. To test low-cost, scalable interventions designed to encourage seat belt use (primary outcome) and discourage handheld phone use while driving.\nMethods. A randomized controlled trial assigned 1139 consenting General Motors–connected vehicle customers in the United States to 1 of 4 groups for a 10-week intervention: (1) control, (2) behavioral engagement, (3) behavioral engagement plus rafﬂe, and (4) behavioral engagement plus shared pot. Behavioral engagement involved education, personalized tips, a “wish outcome obstacle plan” exercise, and weekly feedback about buckling and handheld-free streaks. Participants in the behavioral engagement plus rafﬂe group also earned a chance at a $125 prize each week they had a buckling or handheld-free streak. Those in the behavioral engagement plus shared pot group earned an equal share of this prize for each streak. The intervention was delivered virtually in spring 2023.\nResults. Participants in the behavioral engagement plus shared pot group had a higher buckling rate (91.3%) than those in the behavioral engagement plus rafﬂe (89.5%), behavioral engagement (89.4%), or control (88.3%) groups—differences that remained signiﬁcant at follow-up. Handheld phone use did not differ signiﬁcantly.\nConclusions.

Three hundred forty eligible primary care physicians (PCPs) were enrolled from a pool of 421. Of 25 627 potentially eligible patients of those PCPs, 1503 enrolled. Patients aged 18 to 80 years were eligible if they had a 10-year Framingham Risk Score (FRS) of 20% or greater, had coronary artery disease equivalents with LDL-C levels of 120 mg/dL or greater, or had an FRS of 10% to 20% with LDL-C levels of 140 mg/dL or greater. Investigators were blinded to study group, but participants were not.Primary care physicians were randomly assigned to control, physician incentives, patient incentives, or shared physician-patient incentives. Physicians in the physician incentives group were eligible to receive up to $1024 per enrolled patient meeting LDL-C goals. Patients in the patient incentives group were eligible for the same amount, distributed through daily lotteries tied to medication adherence. Physicians and patients in the shared incentives group shared these incentives. Physicians and patients in the control group received no incentives tied to outcomes, but all patient participants received up to $355 each for trial participation.Change in LDL-C level at 12 months.Patients in the shared physician-patient incentives group achieved a mean reduction in LDL-C of 33.6 mg/dL (95% CI, 30.1-37.1; baseline, 160.1 mg/dL; 12 months, 126.4 mg/dL); those in physician incentives achieved a mean reduction of 27.9 mg/dL (95% CI, 24.9-31.0; baseline, 159.9 mg/dL; 12 months, 132.0 mg/dL); those in patient incentives achieved a mean reduction of 25.1 mg/dL (95% CI, 21.6-28.5; baseline, 160.6 mg/dL; 12 months, 135.5 mg/dL); and those in the control group achieved a mean reduction of 25.1 mg/dL (95% CI, 21.7-28.5; baseline, 161.5 mg/dL; 12 months, 136.4 mg/dL; P &lt; .001 for comparison of all 4 groups). Only patients in the shared physician-patient incentives group achieved reductions in LDL-C levels statistically different from those in the control group (8.5 mg/dL; 95% CI, 3.8-13.3; P = .002).In primary care practices, shared financial incentives for physicians and patients, but not incentives to physicians or patients alone, resulted in a statistically significant difference in reduction of LDL-C levels at 12 months. This reduction was modest, however, and further information is needed to understand whether this approach represents good value.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier:NCT01346189",

To determine if two widely used behavioral change measures—Stages of Change (SoC) and Patient Activation Measure (PAM)—correlate with each other, are affected by financial incentives, or predict positive outcomes in the context of incentive-based health interventions. Design. Secondary analysis of two randomized controlled trials of incentives for weight loss and for improved diabetes self-monitoring. Setting. Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Newark, New Jersey. Subjects. A total of 132 obese and 75 diabetic adults enrolled in one of two trials. Measures. SoC and PAM scores; weight loss and usage rate of diabetes self-monitoring equipment. Analysis. Multiple regression; Kruskal-Wallis test.\nResults. We found no association between baseline SoC and PAM scores in either study (p ¼ .30 and p ¼ .89). Regression models showed no association between baseline PAM score and SoC and subsequent outcomes for either study (weight loss study: PAM: p ¼ .14, SoC: p ¼ .1; diabetes study: PAM: p ¼ .45, SoC: p ¼ .61). Change in PAM score and SoC among participants in the intervention groups did not differ by study arm or among participants with better outcomes.\nConclusion. PAM score and SoC may not effectively predict success or monitor progress among individuals enrolled in incentive-based interventions. (Am J Health Promot 2015;30[2]:133–135.)",

DESIGN: Three-month, three-arm randomized clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02480530). PARTICIPANTS: One hundred and twenty-six veterans with known coronary artery disease and poor adherence (medication possession ratio <80 %). INTERVENTION: Patients were randomized to one of three groups: (1) a control group (n = 36) that received a pill-monitoring device with no alarms or feedback; (2) an individual feedback group (n = 36) that received a daily alarm and a weekly medication adherence feedback report; and (3) a partner feedback group (n = 54) that received an alarm and a weekly feedback report that was shared with a friend, family member, or a peer. The intervention continued for 3 months, and participants were followed for an additional 3 months after the intervention period. MAIN MEASURES: Adherence as measured by pill bottle. Secondary outcomes included change in LDL (mg/dl), patient activation, and social support. KEY RESULTS: During the 3-month intervention period, medication adherence was higher in both feedback arms than in the control arm (individual feedback group 89 %, partner feedback group 86 %, control group 67 %; p < 0.001 and = 0.001). At 6 months, there was no difference in medication adherence between either of the feedback groups and the control (individual feedback 60 %, partner feedback 52 %, control group 54 %; p = 0.75 and 0.97).\nCONCLUSIONS: Daily alarms combined with individual or partner feedback reports improved statin medication adherence. While neither an individual feedback nor partner feedback strategy created a sustainable medication",

Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting: University of Pennsylvania primary care practices. Participants: Participants of this trial included those with (1) age 18 to 80 years; (2) diabetes diagnosis; and (3) a measured hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) greater than 8% in the past 12 months. Intervention: We randomized eligible patients into opt-in and opt-out arms prior to enrollment. Those in the opt-out arm received a letter stating that they were enrolled into a diabetes research study with the option to opt out, and those in the opt-in arm received a standard recruitment letter. Measures: Main end points include enrollment rate, defined as the proportion of participants who attended the baseline visit, and adherence to daily glycemic monitoring. Analysis: We powered our study to detect a 20% difference in adherence to device usage between arms and account for a 10% attrition rate.\nResults: Of the 569 eligible participants who received a recruitment letter, 496 were randomized to the opt-in arm and 73 to the opt-out arm. Enrollment rates were 38% in the opt-out arm and 13% in the opt-in arm (P < .001).\nConclusions: Opt-out defaults, where clinically appropriate, could be a useful approach for increasing the generalizability of lowrisk trials testing behavioral interventions in clinical settings.",

However, there are no recommendations as to how to achieve this.\nObjective To compare the effectiveness of text-based blood pressure monitoring to in-person visits for women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy in the immediate postpartum period.\nMethods Randomised clinical trial among 206 postpartum women with pregnancy-related hypertension diagnosed during the delivery admission between August 2016 and January 2017. Women were randomised to 2weeks of textbased surveillance using a home blood pressure cuff and previously tested automated platform or usual care blood pressure check at their prenatal clinic 4–6 days following discharge. The primary study outcome was a single recorded blood pressure in the first 10 days post partum. The ability to meet American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines, defined as having a blood pressure recorded on postpartum days 3–4 and 7–10 was evaluated in the text message group. The study was powered to detect a 1.4-fold increase in a single recorded blood pressure using text messaging. All outcomes were analysed as intention to treat.\nResults 206 women were randomised (103 in each arm). Baseline characteristics were similar. There was a statistically significant increase in a single blood pressure obtained in the texting group in the first 10 days post partum as compared with the office group (92.2% vs 43.7%; adjusted OR 58.2 (16.2–208.1), p<0.001). Eighty-four per cent of patients undergoing text-based surveillance met ACOG criteria for blood pressures at both recommended points.\nConclusions Text-based monitoring is more effective in obtaining blood pressures and meeting current clinical guidelines in the immediate postdischarge period in women with pregnancy-related hypertension compared with traditional office-based follow-up.

      "abstract": "Introduction: Despite evidence that regular physical activity confers health beneﬁts, physical activity rates among older adults remain low. Both personal and social goals may enhance older adults’ motivation to become active. This study tested the effects of ﬁnancial incentives, donations to charity, and the combined effects of both interventions on older adults’ uptake and retention of increased levels of walking. Study design: RCT comparing three interventions to control. Data collection occurred from 2012 to 2013. Analyses were conducted in 2013–2016. Participants: Ninety-four adults aged Z65 years from Philadelphia-area retirement communities. Intervention: All participants received digital pedometers, walking goals of a 50% increase in daily steps, and weekly feedback on goal attainment. Participants were randomized to one of four groups: (1) Control: received weekly feedback only; (2) Financial Incentives: received payment of $20 each week walking goals were met; (3) Social Goals: received donation of $20 to a charity of choice each week walking goals were met; and (4) Combined: received $20 each week walking goals were met that could be received by participant, donated to a charity of choice, or divided between the participant and charity. Main outcome measures: Mean proportion of days walking goals were met during the 16-week intervention and 4-week follow-up period.\nResults: After adjusting for baseline walking, the proportion of days step goals were met during the 16-week intervention period was higher in all intervention groups versus controls (relative risk, 3.71; 95% CI¼1.37, 10.01). During the 4-week follow up period, the proportion of days step goals were met did not differ in intervention groups compared to control (relative risk, 2.91; 95% CI¼0.62, 13.64).\nConclusions: Incentive schemes that use donations to a charity of choice, personal ﬁnancial incentives, or a combination of the two can each increase older adults’ initial uptake of increased levels of walking.",

Adherence to these medications, however, is very low.\nMethods\nHeartStrong is a national randomized trial offering 3 innovations. First, the intervention is built on concepts from behavioral economics that we expect to enhance its effectiveness. Second, the implementation of the trial takes advantage of new technology, including wireless pill bottles and remote feedback, to substantially automate procedures. Third, the trial's design includes an enhancement of the standard randomized clinical trial that allows rapid-cycle innovation and ongoing program enhancement.\nResults\nUsing a system involving direct data feeds from 6 insurance partners followed by mail, telephone, and email contact, we enrolled 1,509 patients discharged from the hospital with acute myocardial infarction in a 2:1 ratio of intervention:usual care. The intervention period lasts 1 year; the primary outcome is time to first fatal or nonfatal acute vascular event or revascularization, including acute myocardial infarction, unstable angina, stroke, acute coronary syndrome admission, or death.\nConclusions\nOur randomized controlled trial of the HeartStrong program will provide an evaluation of a state-of-the-art behavioral economic intervention with a number of important pragmatic features. These include a tailored intervention responding to patient activity, streamlining of consent and implementation processes using new technologies, outcomes centrally important to patients, and the ability to implement rapid-cycle innovation.",

Wireless-enabled pill bottles have created the opportunity to monitor medication adherence in real time. Reminders may help patients with poor memory or organization. Provision of adherence data to providers may motivate patients to improve adherence and help providers identify adherence barriers. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting & Participants: Kidney transplant recipients (n 5 120) at a single center. Intervention: Participants were provided wireless pill bottles to store tacrolimus and record bottle openings. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to adherence monitoring with customized reminders (including alarms, texts, telephone calls, and/or e-mails), monitoring with customized reminders plus provider notiﬁcation (every 2 weeks, providers received notiﬁcation if adherence decreased to ,90% during that period), or wireless pill bottle use alone (control). Outcomes: The main outcome was bottle-measured tacrolimus adherence during the last 90 days of the 180-day trial. A secondary outcome was tacrolimus whole-blood concentrations at routine clinical visits.\nMeasurements: Adherence for the primary outcome was assessed via wireless pill bottle openings.\nResults: Mean participant age was 50 years; 60% were men, and 40% were black. Mean adherence was 78%, 88%, and 55% in the reminders, reminders-plus-notiﬁcation, and control arms (P , 0.001 for comparison of each intervention to control). Mean tacrolimus levels were not signiﬁcantly different between groups. Limitations: The study did not assess clinical end points. Participants and study coordinators were not blinded to intervention arm.\nConclusions: Provider notiﬁcation and customized reminders appear promising in helping patients achieve better medication adherence, but these strategies require evaluation in trials powered to detect differences in clinical outcomes.",

Social incentives, the influences that impact individuals to adjust their behaviors based on social ties or connections, are ubiquitous and could be leveraged within gamification interventions to provide a scalable, low-cost approach to increase engagement. Gamification, or the use of game design in non-game situations, is commonly used in the real world, but in most cases has not appropriately leveraged principles from theories of health behavior.\nMethods\nWe are conducting a four-arm, randomized, controlled trial of 602 overweight and obese adults to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification interventions that leverage insights from behavioral economics to enhance either supportive, competitive, or collaborative social incentives. Daily step counts are monitored using wearable devices that transmit data to the study platform. Participants established a baseline step count, selected a step goal increase, and then were randomly assigned to control or one of three interventions for a 24-week intervention and 12-week follow-up period. To understand predictors of strong or poor performance, we had participants complete validated questionnaires on a range of areas including their personality, risk preferences, social network, and habits relating to physical activity, eating, and sleep. Trial enrollment was conducted in partnership with Deloitte Consulting and included employees from 40 states across the US.\nConclusion\nThe STEP UP Trial represents a scalable model and interventions found to be effective could be deployed more broadly to increase physical activity.\nTrial registration\nClinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT03311230",

      "abstract": "Financial incentives shared between physicians and patients were shown to significantly reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in a randomized clinical trial, but it is not known whether these health benefits are worth the added incentive and utilization costs required to achieve them.To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of financial incentives on LDL-C level control.In this economic evaluation, a previously validated microsimulation computer model was parameterized using individual-level data from the randomized clinical trial on financial incentives, National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys for model population inputs, and other published sources. The study was conducted from April 15, 2016, to March 29, 2018.The following interventions were used: (1) usual care, (2) trial control strategy (increased cholesterol level monitoring and use of electronic pill bottles), (3) financial incentives for physicians, (4) financial incentives for patients, and (5) incentives shared between physicians and patients.Discounted costs (2017 US dollars), lifetime cardiovascular disease risk, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs).The model population (n = 1 000 000 [30.7% women]) had similar mean (SD) age (61.5 [11.9] years) and LDL-C level (153.9 mg/dL) as the observed trial population (n = 1503 [42.7% women]; age, 62.0 [8.7] years; and LDL-C level, 160.6 mg/dL). Using base-case assumptions (including a 10-year waning period of LDL-C level reductions), the usual-care strategy was dominated (higher costs and lower QALYs) by all other strategies. Strategies for physician- or patient-only incentives were dominated by the shared-incentives strategy, which had an ICER of $60 000/QALY compared with the trial control strategy. In a sensitivity analysis regarding the duration of LDL-C level reductions, the shared-incentives strategy remained cost-effective (ICERs &lt;$100 000/QALY and &lt;$150 000/QALY) for scenarios with LDL-C level reductions lasting, with linear waning, at least 7 and 5 years, respectively. In the 1-way sensitivity analysis for the time horizon of the analysis, the ICER of the shared-incentives strategy exceeded $100 000/QALY at 11 years and $150 000/QALY at 8 years. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the shared-incentives intervention was cost-effective in 69% to 77% of iterations using cost-effectiveness thresholds of $100 000 to $150 000/QALY. Cost-effectiveness results were also sensitive to the duration of intervention costs.This study suggests that the financial incentives shared between patients and physicians for LDL-C level control meet conventional standards of cost-effectiveness, but these results appeared to be sensitive to assumptions about the durations of LDL-C level reductions and years of intervention costs included, as well as to the choice of time horizon.",

Subjects/methods Participants aged 30–80 years who lost at least 5 kg during the ﬁrst 4–6 months in a nationally available commercial weight loss program were recruited via the internet into a three-arm randomized trial of two types of ﬁnancial incentives versus active control during months 1–6 (Phase I) followed by passive monitoring during months 7–12 (Phase II). Interventions were daily self-weighing and text messaging feedback alone (control) or combined with a lottery-based incentive or a direct incentive. The primary outcome was weight change 6 months after initial weight loss. Secondary outcomes included weight change 12 months after initial weight loss (6 months after cessation of maintenance intervention), and self-reported physical activity and eating behaviors.\nResults Of 191 participants randomized, the mean age was 49.0 (SD = 10.5) years and weight loss prior to randomization was 11.4 (4.7) kg; 92% were women and 89% were White. Mean weight changes during the next 6 months (Phase I) were: lottery −3.0 (5.8) kg; direct −2.8 (5.8) kg; and control −1.4 (5.8) kg (all pairwise comparisons p > 0.1). Weight changes through the end of 12 months post-weight loss (Phase II) were: lottery −1.8 (10.5) kg; direct −0.7 (10.7) kg; and control −0.3 (9.4) kg (all pairwise comparisons p > 0.1). The percentages of participants who maintained their weight loss (deﬁned as gaining ≤1.36 kg) were: lottery 79%, direct 76%, and control 67% at 6 months and lottery 66%, direct 62%, and control 59% at 12 months (all pairwise comparisons p > 0.1). At 6 and 12 months after initial weight loss, changes in self-reported physical activity or eating behaviors did not differ across arms.\nConclusions Compared with the active control of daily texting based on daily home weighing, lottery-based and direct monetary incentives provided no additional beneﬁt for weight loss maintenance.",

DESIGN: Four-arm, randomized clinical trial with a 6month intervention. PARTICIPANTS: A total of 179 CVS health employees or adult dependents with CVS Caremark prescription coverage, a current daily statin prescription, a medication possession ratio less than 80%, and Internet access. INTERVENTIONS: Participants were randomly assigned to control, social support (partner), automated adherence alert messages (alert), or both social support and alerts (partner + alert). Participants in the social support arms were asked to name a medication adherence partner (MAP) to help them take their medication. Participants in the alert arms were sent emails, text messages, or automated phone calls if they had failed to adhere on the previous day and on one or both of the 2 days before that. In partner + alert, both participants and fully enrolled MAPs received alerts. MAIN MEASURES: Adherence measured by wireless pill bottle opening. KEY RESULTS: Compared to 36.0% adherence in control, adherence was significantly greater in the alert arm (52.9%, difference vs. control of 17.0%, 95% CI for difference 6.3 to 27.6%, P = 0.002) and the partner + alert arm (54.5%, difference vs. control of 18.6%, 95% CI for difference 6.6 to 30.5%, P = 0.003). Adherence in the partner arm was not statistically significantly greater than control (43.2%, difference vs. control of 7.2%, 95% CI of difference − 5.2% to 19.5%, P = 0.25). There were no statistically significant differences among the three treatment arms. Fewer participants invited a MAP in the partner + alert arm than the partner arm (P = 0.02).\nCONCLUSIONS: Automated alerts were effective at improving medication adherence. Assigning a medication",

Design Randomized controlled trial with computer generated randomization table to allocate interventions. Setting University of Pennsylvania pigmented lesion clinic. Participants 69 patients aged 18 years or older with an iPhone/iPad, who were already in possession of TBP photographs. Intervention A mobile app loaded with digital TBP photos for all participants, and either (1) the mobile app only, (2) skin examination reminders, (3) an accountability partner, or (4) reminders and an accountability partner. Main Outcome Measure Change in SSE rates as assessed by enrollment and end-of-study surveys 6 months later.\nResults Eighty one patients completed informed consent, however 12 patients did not complete trial enrollment procedures due to device incompatibility, leaving 69 patients who were randomized and analyzed [mean age 54.3 years, standard deviation 13.9). SSE rates increased significantly from 58% at baseline to 83% at 6 months (odds ratio 2.64, 95% confidence interval 1.20–4.09), with no difference among the intervention groups. The group with examination reminders alone had the highest (94%) overall satisfaction, and the group with accountability partners alone accounted for the lowest (71%).\nConclusion A mobile app alone, or with reminders and/or accountability partners, was found to be an effective tool that can help to increase SSE rates.

Disease management programs have shown promise but lack firm evidence of effectiveness and scalability. We describe the motivation, design, and planned analyses of EMPOWER (Electronic Monitoring of Patients Offers Ways to Enhance Recovery), a randomized clinical trial of an innovative intervention incorporating behavioral economic principles with remote monitoring technology embedded within a healthcare system.\nMETHODS AND RESULTS: EMPOWER is an ongoing, pragmatic, randomized clinical trial comparing usual care to an automated hovering intervention that includes patient-level incentives for daily weight monitoring and diuretic adherence combined with automated feedback into the clinical care pathway, enabling real-time response to concerning clinical symptoms. Identification of eligible patients began in May 2016, and implementation of the intervention is feasible. Trial processes are embedded into existing clinical pathways. The primary outcome is time to readmission for any cause. Cost-effectiveness analyses are planned to evaluate the healthcare costs and health outcomes of the approach.\nCONCLUSIONS: The EMPOWER trial incorporates leading-edge approaches in human motivation, derived from behavioral economics, with contemporary technology to provide scale and exception handling at low cost. The trial is also implemented within the naturalized environment of a health system, as much as possible taking advantage of the existing journeys of patients and workflows of clinicians. A goal of this pragmatic design is to limit resource utilization and also to test an intervention that would need minimal modification to be translated from research into a new way of practice.",

Wearable devices paired with social incentives increased daily steps in pilot studies but have not been tested for long-term effectiveness in community settings. This paper describes the study design and baseline participant characteristics of a trial testing these approaches to increase physical activity among families in the Philadelphia area.\nMethods\nThe trial, called STEP Together, is a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation study. Participants enroll on family teams of 2–10 people, including at least one person 60 years old or older. Each participant receives a Fitbit device, establishes a baseline daily step count, and selects a daily step goal 1500 to 3000 steps greater than their baseline. Family teams are stratified based on family size and randomized to Control, Social Incentive Gamification, or Social Goals through Incentives to Charity. Participation is 18-months: a 12-month intervention and 6-month follow up.\nResults\n779 participants on 285 family teams were randomized. Recruitment was more difficult than anticipated due to the COVID-19 pandemic and higher-than expected numbers of participants who were already physically active and therefore ineligible. Changes to the eligibility criteria that did not impact the underlying intent or conceptual basis for the trial improved recruitment feasibility.\nConclusion\nThe results from this study will contribute to the growing body of evidence about scalable, effective strategies to motivate individuals and families to increase their daily physical activity.

PAP data were transmitted daily by wireless modem from the participants' PAP unit to a website where hours of usage were displayed. Participants in the financial incentive group could earn up to $30/day in the first week for objective PAP use ≥ 4 h/day.\nMEASUREMENTS AND RESULTS: Mean hours of daily PAP use in the two groups with access to PAP usage data did not differ from each other but was significantly greater than that in the usual care group in the first week and over 3 mo (P < 0.0001). Average daily use (mean ± standard deviation) during the first week of PAP intervention was 4.7 ± 3.3 h in the usual care group, and 5.9 ± 2.5 h and 6.3 ± 2.5 h in the Web access groups with and without financial incentive respectively. Adherence over the 3-mo intervention decreased at a relatively constant rate in all three groups. Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire change scores at 3 mo improved within each group (P < 0.0001) but change scores of the two groups with Web access to PAP data were not different than those in the control group (P > 0.124).\nCONCLUSIONS: Positive airway pressure adherence is significantly improved by giving patients Web access to information about their use of the treatment. Inclusion of a financial incentive in the first week had no additive effect in improving adherence.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE: \n          To use administrative claims data to evaluate the association of a remote blood pressure monitoring program with adverse postpartum clinical outcomes in patients with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy.\n          METHODS: \n          This was a retrospective cohort study of Independence Blue Cross members with a hypertensive disorder of pregnancy diagnosis across three obstetric hospitals from 2017 to 2021. Patients who were enrolled in twice-daily text-based blood pressure monitoring for 10 days postpartum were compared with two propensity-score matched cohorts of patients who met the program criteria: an asynchronous cohort (cohort A), consisting of patients at any of the three participating hospitals before remote monitoring program implementation, and a contemporaneous cohort (cohort C), consisting of patients at other hospitals during the same time period as clinical use of the program. Patients with less than 16 months of continuous insurance enrollment before delivery were excluded. Claims for adverse clinical outcomes after delivery discharge were evaluated. Health care service utilization and total medical costs were evaluated.\n          RESULTS: \n          The 1,700 patients in remote blood pressure monitoring program were matched to 1,021 patients in cohort A and 1,276 in cohort C. Within the first 6 months after delivery, patients enrolled in remote monitoring were less likely to have the composite adverse outcome than those in cohort A (2.9% vs 4.7%; OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.40–0.98). There was no statistically significant difference relative to cohort C (3.2% vs 4.5%; OR 0.71, 95% CI 0.47–1.07). The remote monitoring group had more cardiology visits and fewer postnatal emergency department (ED) visits and readmissions compared with both comparison cohorts. Reductions in ED visits and readmissions drove overall lower total medical costs for the program cohort.\n          CONCLUSION: \n          Patients enrolled in a remote blood pressure monitoring program were less likely to experience an adverse outcome in the first 6 months after delivery. Reductions in ED visits and readmissions resulted in lower postpartum total medical costs compared with both control cohorts. Broad implementation of evidence-based remote monitoring programs may reduce postpartum adverse outcomes, thereby reducing morbidity and mortality in populations such as the one studied here.",

      "abstract": "Despite public health efforts, breast cancer screening rates remain below national goals.To evaluate whether bulk ordering, text messaging, and clinician endorsement increase breast cancer screening rates.Two concurrent, pragmatic, randomized clinical trials, each with a 2-by-2 factorial design, were conducted between October 25, 2021, and April 25, 2022, in 2 primary care regions of an academic health system. The trials included women aged 40 to 74 years with at least 1 primary care visit in the past 2 years who were eligible for breast cancer screening.Patients in trial A were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a signed bulk order for mammogram or no order; in a factorial design, patients were concurrently randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive or not receive text message reminders. Patients in trial B were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive a message signed by their primary care clinician (clinician endorsement) or from the organization (standard messaging); in a factorial design, patients were concurrently randomized in a 1:1 ratio to receive or not receive text message reminders.The primary outcome was the proportion of patients who completed a screening mammogram within 3 months.Among 24 632 patients included, the mean (SD) age was 60.4 (7.5) years. In trial A, at 3 months, 15.4% (95% CI, 14.6%-16.1%) of patients in the bulk order arm and 12.7% (95% CI, 12.1%-13.4%) in the no order arm completed a mammogram, showing a significant increase (absolute difference, 2.7%; 95% CI, 1.6%-3.6%; P &lt; .001). In the text messaging comparison arms, 15.1% (95% CI, 14.3%-15.8%) of patients receiving a text message completed a mammogram compared with 13.0% (95% CI, 12.4%-13.7%) of those in the no text messaging arm, a significant increase (absolute difference of 2.1%; 95% CI, 1.0%-3.0%; P &lt; .001). In trial B, at 3 months, 12.5% (95% CI, 11.3%-13.7%) of patients in the clinician endorsement arm completed a mammogram compared with 11.4% (95% CI, 10.3%-12.5%) of those in the standard messaging arm, which was not significant (absolute difference, 1.1%; 95% CI, −0.5% to 2.7%; P = .18). In the text messaging comparison arms, 13.2% (95% CI, 12.0%-14.4%) of patients receiving a text message completed a mammogram compared with 10.7% (95% CI, 9.7%-11.8%) of those in the no text messaging arm, a significant increase (absolute difference, 2.5%; 95% CI, 0.8%-4.0%; P = .003).These findings show that text messaging women after initial breast cancer screening outreach via either electronic portal or mailings, as well as bulk ordering with or without text messaging, can increase mammogram completion rates.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05089903",

      "abstract": "Gamification, the application of game design elements such as points and levels in nongame contexts, is often used in digital health interventions, but evidence on its effectiveness is limited.To test the effectiveness of a gamification intervention designed using insights from behavioral economics to enhance social incentives within families to increase physical activity.The Behavioral Economics Framingham Incentive Trial (BE FIT) was a randomized clinical trial with a 12-week intervention period and a 12-week follow-up period. The investigation was a community-based study between December 7, 2015, and August 14, 2016. Participants in the modified intent-to-treat analysis were adults enrolled in the Framingham Heart Study, a long-standing cohort of families.All participants tracked daily step counts using a wearable device or a smartphone, established a baseline, selected a step goal increase, and received daily individual feedback on goal performance by text message or email for 24 weeks. Families in the gamification arm could earn points and progress through levels based on physical activity goal achievement during the 12-week intervention. The game design was meant to enhance collaboration, accountability, and peer support.The primary outcome was the proportion of participant-days that step goals were achieved during the intervention period. Secondary outcomes included the proportion of participant-days that step goals were achieved during the follow-up period and the change in the mean daily steps during the intervention and follow-up periods.Among 200 adults comprising 94 families, the mean age was 55.4 years, and 56.0% (n = 112) were female. During the intervention period, participants in the gamification arm achieved step goals on a significantly greater proportion of participant-days (0.53 vs 0.32; adjusted difference, 0.27; 95% CI, 0.20-0.33; P &lt; .001) and had a significantly greater increase in the mean daily steps compared with baseline (1661 vs 636; adjusted difference, 953; 95% CI, 505-1401; P &lt; .001) than the control arm. During the follow-up period, physical activity in the gamification arm declined but remained significantly greater than that in the control arm for the proportion of participant-days achieving step goals (0.44 vs 0.33; adjusted difference, 0.12; 95% CI, 0.05-0.19; P &lt; .001) and the mean daily steps compared with baseline (1385 vs 798; adjusted difference, 494; 95% CI, 170-818; P &lt; .01).Gamification designed to leverage insights from behavioral economics to enhance social incentives significantly increased physical activity among families in the community.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02531763",

However, the best way to design social incentives in gamification interventions has not been well examined.To assess the effectiveness of support, collaboration, and competition within a behaviorally designed gamification intervention to increase physical activity among overweight and obese adults.This 36-week randomized clinical trial with a 24-week intervention and 12-week follow-up assessed 602 adults from 40 states with body mass indexes (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) of 25 or higher from February 12, 2018, to March 17, 2019.Participants used a wearable device to track daily steps, established a baseline, selected a step goal increase, were randomly assigned to a control (n = 151) or to 1 of 3 gamification interventions (support [n = 151], collaboration [n = 150], and competition [n = 150]), and were remotely monitored. The control group received feedback from the wearable device but no other interventions for 36 weeks. The gamification arms were entered into a 24-week game designed using insights from behavioral economics with points and levels for achieving step goals. No gamification interventions occurred during follow-up.The primary outcome was change in mean daily steps from baseline through the 24-week intervention period.A total of 602 participants (mean [SD] age, 39 [10] years; mean [SD] body mass index, 30 [5]; 427 [70.9%] male) were included in the study. Compared with controls, participants had a significantly greater increase in mean daily steps from baseline during the intervention in the competition arm (adjusted difference, 920; 95% CI, 513-1328; P &lt; .001), support arm (adjusted difference, 689; 95% CI, 267-977; P &lt; .001), and collaboration arm (adjusted difference, 637; 95% CI, 258-1017; P = .001). During follow-up, physical activity remained significantly greater in the competition arm than in the control arm (adjusted difference, 569; 95% CI, 142-996; P = .009) but was not significantly greater in the support (adjusted difference, 428; 95% CI, 19-837; P = .04) and collaboration (adjusted difference, 126; 95% CI, −248 to 468; P = .49) arms than in the control arm.All 3 gamification interventions significantly increased physical activity during the 24-week intervention, and competition was the most effective.

Health systems must continually invest in new and existing technology and analytics platforms to scale initiatives, enable innovation, and achieve interoperability to meet the needs and expectations of patients and clinicians while remaining focused on the organization’s mission and strategic priorities. In this process, decision-makers must determine how to allocate technological resources to platforms that meet clinical and administrative needs while reducing the need for frequent replacement or reconfiguration. Advances in artificial intelligence and its capabilities add urgency and complexity to technology investment decisions. An important consideration during this process is when to build new technology infrastructure and when to partner with existing companies and buy technology solutions. This case study explores a major academic medical center’s approach to that decision, including the factors that influenced it and the outcomes of two solutions that were developed in-house.",

Wireless technology and behavioral economic approaches have shown promise in improving health behaviors.To determine whether a system of medication reminders using financial incentives and social support delays subsequent vascular events in patients following AMI compared with usual care.Two-arm, randomized clinical trial with a 12-month intervention conducted from 2013 through 2016. Investigators were blinded to study group, but participants were not. Design was a health plan–intermediated intervention for members of several health plans. We recruited 1509 participants from 7179 contacted AMI survivors (insured with 5 large US insurers nationally or with Medicare fee-for-service at the University of Pennsylvania Health System). Patients aged 18 to 80 years were eligible if currently prescribed at least 2 of 4 study medications (statin, aspirin, β-blocker, antiplatelet agent), and were hospital inpatients for 1 to 180 days and discharged home with a principal diagnosis of AMI.Patients were randomized 2:1 to an intervention using electronic pill bottles combined with lottery incentives and social support for medication adherence (1003 patients), or to usual care (506 patients).Primary outcome was time to first vascular rehospitalization or death. Secondary outcomes were time to first all-cause rehospitalization, total number of repeated hospitalizations, medication adherence, and total medical costs.A total of 35.5% of participants were female (n = 536); mean (SD) age was 61.0 (10.3) years. There were no statistically significant differences between study arms in time to first rehospitalization for a vascular event or death (hazard ratio, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.71 to 1.52; P = .84), time to first all-cause rehospitalization (hazard ratio, 0.89; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.09; P = .27), or total number of repeated hospitalizations (hazard ratio, 0.94; 95% CI, 0.60 to 1.48; P = .79).

The inability to manage type 1 diabetes effectively during these years is associated with poor glycemic control and complications from diabetes in adult life.To determine the effect of daily financial incentives on glucose monitoring adherence and glycemic control in adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes.The Behavioral Economic Incentives to Improve Glycemic Control Among Adolescents and Young Adults With Type 1 Diabetes (BE IN CONTROL) study was an investigator-blinded, 6-month, 2-arm randomized clinical trial conducted between January 22 and November 2, 2016, with 3-month intervention and follow-up periods. Ninety participants (aged 14-20) with suboptimally controlled type 1 diabetes (hemoglobin A1c [HbA1c] &gt;8.0%) were recruited from the Diabetes Center for Children at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.All participants were given daily blood glucose monitoring goals of 4 or more checks per day with 1 or more level within the goal range (70-180 mg/dL) collected with a wireless glucometer. The 3-month intervention consisted of a $60 monthly incentive in a virtual account, from which $2 was subtracted for every day of nonadherence to the monitoring goals. During a 3-month follow-up period, the intervention was discontinued.The primary outcome was change in HbA1c levels at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included adherence to glucose monitoring and change in HbA1c levels at 6 months. All analyses were by intention to treat.Of the 181 participants screened, 90 (52 [57.8%] girls) were randomized to the intervention (n = 45) or control (n = 45) arms. The mean (SD) age was 16.3 (1.9) years. The intervention group had significantly greater adherence to glucose monitoring goals in the incentive period (50.0% vs 18.9%; adjusted difference, 27.2%; 95% CI, 9.5% to 45.0%; P = .003) but not in the follow-up period (15.3% vs 8.7%; adjusted difference, 3.9%; 95% CI, −2.0% to 9.9%; P = .20). The change in HbA1c levels from baseline did not differ significantly between groups at 3 months (adjusted difference, −0.08%; 95% CI, −0.69% to 0.54%; P = .80) or 6 months (adjusted difference, 0.03%; 95% CI, −0.55% to 0.60%; P = .93).Among adolescents and young adults with type 1 diabetes, daily financial incentives improved glucose monitoring adherence during the incentive period but did not significantly improve glycemic control.clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT02568501",

Strategies to enhance recruitment are often implemented without scientific rigor to evaluate efficacy. Evidence-based, cost-effective behavioral economic strategies designed to influence decision-making may be useful to promote clinical trial enrollment.\nObjective: This study evaluated 2 behavioral economic strategies to improve enrollment and retention rates across 4 clinical trials: information provision (IP) and contingency management (CM; ie, lottery). IP targets descriptive and injunctive norms about participating in research and CM provides participants incentives to reinforce a target behavior.\nMethods: A sample of 212 participants was enrolled across 4 clinical trials focused on tobacco use: 2 focused on HIV and 2 focused on neuroimaging. The CM condition included a lottery: for each study visit completed, participants received 5 “draws” from a bowl containing 500 “chips” valued at US $0, US $1, US $5, or US $100. In the IP condition, text messages that targeted injunctive norms about research (eg, “Many find it a rewarding way to advance science and be part of a community”) were sent through the Way to Health platform before all study visits. Participants were randomized to 1 of 4 conditions: IP, CM, IP+CM, or standard recruitment (SR). We performed logistic regression, controlling for sex and study, with condition as a between-subject predictor. Outcomes were the percentage of participants who attended a final eligibility visit (primary), met intent-to-treat (ITT) criteria (secondary), and completed the study (secondary). Recruitment was evaluated by the percentage of participants who attended a final eligibility visit, enrollment by ITT status, and retention by the percentage of participants who completed the study.\nResults: Rates of attending the eligibility visit and meeting ITT status were 58.9% (33/56) and 33.9% (19/56) for IP+CM; 45.5% (25/55) and 18.2% (10/55) for IP only; 41.5% (22/53) and 18.9% (10/53) for CM only; and 37.5% (18/48) and 12.5% (6/48) for SR, respectively. In the logistic regression, females were more likely to meet ITT status than males (odds ratio [OR] 2.7, 95% CI 1.2-5.7; P=.01). The IP+CM group was twice as likely to attend the final eligibility visit than the SR group (OR 2.4, 95% CI 1.1-5.2; P=.04). The IP+CM group was also significantly more likely to reach ITT status than the SR condition (OR 3.9, 95% CI 1.3-11.1; P=.01). Those who received any active intervention (IP, CM, or IP+CM) had a higher study completion rate (33/53, 63.5%) compared to those who received SR (5/12, 41.7%), but this difference was not significant (P=.26).\nConclusions: Combining IP and CM strategies may motivate participants to participate in research and improve recruitment and retention rates. Evidence from this study provides preliminary support for the utility of behavioral economics strategies to improve enrollment and reduce attrition in clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "A comprehensive lipid panel is recommended by guidelines to evaluate atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease risk, but uptake is low.To evaluate whether direct outreach including bulk orders with and without text messaging increases lipid screening rates.Pragmatic randomized clinical trial conducted from June 6, 2023, to September 6, 2023, at 2 primary care practices at an academic health system among patients aged 20 to 75 years with at least 1 primary care visit in the past 3 years who were overdue for lipid screening. Data analysis was performed from September 2023 to May 2024.Eligible patients were randomized in a 1:2:2 ratio to usual care (group 1), direct outreach and bulk orders (group 2), and bulk order outreach with additional text message reminders for scheduling assistance (group 3). In group 3, participants received an initial, follow-up, and reminder text message. Patients with electronic portal accounts were encouraged to schedule through them, while others received laboratory contact information. Any participant inquiries were answered either with automated responses for common questions or with study team support.Proportion of patients who completed a lipid panel within 3 months.Among the 1000 participants, the median (IQR) age was 38 (28-55) years; 470 (47.0%) were female; and 22 (2.3%) were Asian, 38 (3.9%) were Black, 32 (3.2%) were Hispanic or Latino, and 862 (88.6%) were White (race and ethnicity were based on self-reported data). At 3 months, a lipid panel was completed by 12 of 202 patients (5.9%; 95% CI, 3.4% to 10.1%) receiving usual care (group 1) vs 62 of 394 patients (15.7%; 95% CI, 12.5% to 19.7%) receiving direct outreach and bulk order (group 2), a difference of 9.8 percentage points (95% CI, 4.6 to 15.0; P = .001). The panel was completed by 73 of 404 patients (18.1%; 95% CI, 14.6% to 22.1%) receiving outreach, bulk order, and text message reminders (group 3), for a difference of 2.4 percentage points (95% CI, −3.1 to 7.8; P = .43) vs outreach with bulk order alone (group 2). At 6 months, there were no significant differences in lipid screening between either group 1 vs group 2 or group 2 vs group 3.Lipid screening among participants receiving bulk orders and outreach letters increased significantly compared with usual care at 3 months. However, there was no difference at 6 months. More than 80% of patients did not follow through with lipid screening despite the intervention, and there was no additional increase in lipid testing at 3 months among participants receiving bulk ordering and supplemental text messaging.ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05724615",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To test whether a 30-day automated texting program to support primary care patients after hospital discharge reduces acute care revisits. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A 2-arm randomized clinical trial was conducted from March 29, 2022, through January 5, 2023, at 30 primary care practices within a single academic health system in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Patients were followed up for 60 days after discharge. Investigators were blinded to assignment, but patients and practice staff were not. Participants included established patients of the study practices who were aged 18 years or older, discharged from an acute care hospitalization, and considered medium to high risk for adverse health events by a health system risk score. All analyses were conducted using an intention-to-treat approach. INTERVENTION Patients in the intervention group received automated check-in text messages from their primary care practice on a tapering schedule for 30 days following discharge. Any needs identified by the automated messaging platform were escalated to practice staff for follow-up via an electronic medical record inbox. Patients in the control group received a standard transitional care management telephone call from their practice within 2 business days of discharge. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary study outcome was any acute care revisit (readmission or emergency department visit) within 30 days of discharge.\nRESULTS Of the 4736 participants, 2824 (59.6%) were female; the mean (SD) age was 65.4 (16.5) years. The mean (SD) length of index hospital stay was 5.5 (7.9) days. A total of 2352 patients were randomized to the intervention arm and 2384 were randomized to the control arm. There were 557 (23.4%) acute care revisits in the control group and 561 (23.9%) in the intervention group within 30 days of discharge (risk ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.92-1.13). Among the patients in the intervention arm, 79.5% answered at least 1 message and 41.9% had at least 1 need identified.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this randomized clinical trial of a 30-day postdischarge automated texting program, there was no significant reduction in acute care revisits.",

Pharmacy claims have typically been used to measure medication adherence, but electronic pill bottles may offer additional information. Objective: The main objectives of this study were to compare the association of adherence measured by prescription claims and remote monitoring technologies with cardiovascular events. Research Design: This study was a secondary analysis of a remote monitoring intervention to increase medication adherence in myocardial infarction patients. Subjects: In total, 682 myocardial infarction patients were randomized to the intervention group with both medical and pharmacy beneﬁts. Measures: Pharmacy claims adherence was measured using proportion of days covered (PDC) and GlowCap adherence (GC) was measured as the proportion of days the pill bottle was opened. We compared the association of PDC and GC adherence for statins with time to ﬁrst vascular readmission or death and assessed model ﬁt using Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion and the likelihood ratio test. Results: Higher PDC was signiﬁcantly associated with a lower hazard rate for vascular readmissions or death (hazard ratio = 0.435; P = 0.009). There was also an association between GC adherence and vascular readmissions or death (hazard ratio = 0.313; P ≤ 0.001). Adding the GC adherence variable to the model using only PDC improved the model ﬁt (likelihood ratio test, P = 0.001), as well as vice versa (P = 0.050). Conclusions: Pharmacy claims data provide useful but not complete data for medication adherence monitoring. New wireless technologies have the potential to provide additional data about clinical outcomes.",

DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Evaluation of the Novel Use of Gamification With Alternative Goal-setting Experiences was conducted from January 15, 2019, to June 1, 2020. The 24-week randomized clinical trial included a remotely monitored 8-week introductory intervention period, 8-week maintenance intervention period, and 8-week follow-up period. A total of 500 adults from lower-income neighborhoods in and around Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, who had either an atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) condition or a 10-year ASCVD risk score greater than or equal to 7.5% were enrolled. Participants were paid for enrolling in and completing the trial. INTERVENTIONS All participants used a wearable device to track daily steps, established a baseline level, and were then randomly assigned to an attention control or 1 of 4 gamification interventions that varied only on how daily step goals were set (self-chosen or assigned) and implemented (immediately or gradually). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES The primary outcome was change in mean daily steps from baseline to the 8-week maintenance intervention period. Other outcomes included changes in minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity. All randomly assigned participants were included in the intention-to-treat analysis.\nRESULTS Of the 500 participants, 331 individuals (66.2%) were Black, 114 were White (22.8%), and 348 were women (69.6%). Mean (SD) age was 58.5 (10.8) years and body mass index was 33.2 (7.8). A total of 215 participants (43.0%) had an ASCVD condition. Compared with the control arm, participants with self-chosen and immediate goals had significant increases in the number of daily steps during the maintenance intervention period (1384; 95% CI, 805-1963; P < .001) that were sustained during the 8-week follow-up (1391; 95% CI, 785-1998; P < .001). This group also had significant increases in daily minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity during the maintenance intervention (4.1; 95% CI, 1.8-6.4; P < .001) that were sustained during follow-up (3.5; 95% CI, 1.1-5.8; P = .004). No other gamification arms had consistent increases in physical activity compared with the control arm. No major adverse events were reported.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this trial among economically disadvantaged adults at elevated risk for major adverse cardiovascular events, a gamification intervention led to increases in physical activity that were sustained during 8 weeks of follow-up when goals were self-chosen and implemented immediately.",

Methods: This 4-arm, randomized trial consisted of a 13-week intervention period and 13-week follow-up period. During the intervention, 4-person teams were entered into a weekly lottery valued at about $1.40/day and contingent on the team averaging ≥7000 steps per day. Social comparison feedback on performance was delivered weekly for 26 weeks, and varied by reference point (50th vs 75th percentile) and forgiveness in use of activity data (all 7 d or best 5 of 7 d). The primary outcome was the mean proportion of participant-days achieving the 7000-step goal. Results: During the intervention period, the unadjusted mean proportion of participant-days that the goal was achieved was 0.47 (95% conﬁdence interval [CI]: 0.38 to 0.56) in the 50th percentile arm, 0.38 (95% CI: 0.30 to 0.37) in the 75th percentile arm, 0.40 (95% CI: 0.31 to 0.49) in the 50th percentile with forgiveness arm, and 0.47 (95% CI: 0.38 to 0.55) in the 75th percentile with forgiveness arm.

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Enhanced recovery after surgery (ERAS) protocols address pre-, peri-, and postoperative factors of a patient’s surgical journey. The authors sought to assess the effects of a novel ERAS protocol on clinical outcomes for patients undergoing elective spine or peripheral nerve surgery.\nMETHODS The authors conducted a prospective cohort analysis comparing clinical outcomes of patients undergoing elective spine or peripheral nerve surgery after implementation of the ERAS protocol compared to a historical control cohort in a tertiary care academic medical center. Patients in the historical cohort (September–December 2016) underwent traditional surgical care. Patients in the intervention group (April–June 2017) were enrolled in a unique ERAS protocol created by the Department of Neurosurgery at the University of Pennsylvania. Primary objectives were as follows: opioid and nonopioid pain medication consumption, need for opioid use at 1 month postoperatively, and patient-reported pain scores. Secondary objectives were as follows: mobilization and ambulation status, Foley catheter use, need for straight catheterization, length of stay, need for ICU admission, discharge status, and readmission within 30 days.\nRESULTS A total of 201 patients underwent surgical care via an ERAS protocol and were compared to a total of 74 patients undergoing traditional perioperative care (control group). The 2 groups were similar in baseline demographics. Intravenous opioid medications postoperatively via patient-controlled analgesia was nearly eliminated in the ERAS group (0.5% vs 54.1%, p < 0.001). This change was not associated with an increase in the average or daily pain scores in the ERAS group. At 1 month following surgery, a smaller proportion of patients in the ERAS group were using opioids (38.8% vs 52.7%, p = 0.041). The ERAS group demonstrated greater mobilization on postoperative day 0 (53.4% vs 17.1%, p < 0.001) and postoperative day 1 (84.1% vs 45.7%, p < 0.001) compared to the control group. Postoperative Foley use was decreased in the ERAS group (20.4% vs 47.3%, p < 0.001) without an increase in the rate of straight catheterization (8.1% vs 11.9%, p = 0.51).\nCONCLUSIONS Implementation of this novel ERAS pathway safely reduces patients’ postoperative opioid requirements during hospitalization and 1 month postoperatively. ERAS results in improved postoperative mobilization and ambulation. https://thejns.org/doi/abs/10.3171/2018.9.SPINE18681",

      "abstract": "Background: Type 2 diabetes is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in the United States. Lifestyle modifications including increasing physical activity and losing weight have been demonstrated to improve glycemic control. However, most patients struggle to make these changes. Many stakeholders are interested in using gamification and social incentives to increase engagement in healthy behaviors. However, these approaches often do not appropriately leverage insights from behavioral economics that could be used to address predictable barriers to behavior change.\nObjective: This study aimed to describe the protocol for the Influencing DIabetics to Adapt Behaviors related to Exercise and weighT by Enhancing Social incentives (iDiabetes) trial, which aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of gamification interventions that leverage insights from behavioral economics to enhance supportive, competitive, or collaborative social incentives to improve glycemic control, promote weight loss, and increase physical activity among overweight and obese adults with type 2 diabetes.\nMethods: We are conducting a one-year four-arm randomized controlled trial of 361 overweight and obese patients with type 2 diabetes and a glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) level ≥8.0. Wireless weight scales and wearable devices are provided to remotely monitor weight and physical activity and transmit data to the study team. Patients are recruited by email, following which they establish a baseline measure of weight, daily step count, HbA1c level, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level and then repeat these measures at 6 and 12 months. The control arm receives no other interventions. Patients randomized to one of the three intervention arms are entered into a game designed using insights from behavioral economics to enhance supportive, competitive, or collaborative social incentives. To examine predictors of strong or poor performance, participants completed validated questionnaires on a range of areas including their personality, risk preferences, and social network.\nResults: Enrollment of 361 patients was completed in January 2019. Results are expected in 2020.\nConclusions: The iDiabetes trial represents a scalable model to remotely monitor the daily health behaviors of adults with type 2 diabetes. Results from this trial will help provide insights into how to improve management of patients with type 2 diabetes.

Nudges were delivered via text message to over 650,000 Walmart pharmacy patients in the fall of 2020 and encouraged patients to visit Walmart for a flu vaccine. We demonstrate that behaviorally informed messages increase pharmacy vaccination rates by an average of 6.7% over a roughly three-month follow-up period. The most effective messages in our field experiment matched the tone of typical pharmacy communications and reminded patients that a flu shot was waiting for them.

      "abstract": "Background            Conversational agents, also known as chatbots, are computer programs designed to simulate human text or verbal conversations. They are increasingly used in a range of fields, including health care. By enabling better accessibility, personalization, and efficiency, conversational agents have the potential to improve patient care.                                Objective            This study aimed to review the current applications, gaps, and challenges in the literature on conversational agents in health care and provide recommendations for their future research, design, and application.                                Methods            We performed a scoping review. A broad literature search was performed in MEDLINE (Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online; Ovid), EMBASE (Excerpta Medica database; Ovid), PubMed, Scopus, and Cochrane Central with the search terms “conversational agents,” “conversational AI,” “chatbots,” and associated synonyms. We also searched the gray literature using sources such as the OCLC (Online Computer Library Center) WorldCat database and ResearchGate in April 2019. Reference lists of relevant articles were checked for further articles. Screening and data extraction were performed in parallel by 2 reviewers. The included evidence was analyzed narratively by employing the principles of thematic analysis.                                Results            The literature search yielded 47 study reports (45 articles and 2 ongoing clinical trials) that matched the inclusion criteria. The identified conversational agents were largely delivered via smartphone apps (n=23) and used free text only as the main input (n=19) and output (n=30) modality. Case studies describing chatbot development (n=18) were the most prevalent, and only 11 randomized controlled trials were identified. The 3 most commonly reported conversational agent applications in the literature were treatment and monitoring, health care service support, and patient education.                                Conclusions            The literature on conversational agents in health care is largely descriptive and aimed at treatment and monitoring and health service support. It mostly reports on text-based, artificial intelligence–driven, and smartphone app–delivered conversational agents. There is an urgent need for a robust evaluation of diverse health care conversational agents’ formats, focusing on their acceptability, safety, and effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              It is well known that regular physical exercise has associated benefits; yet, participation remains suboptimal. Mobile health (mHealth) has become an indispensable medium to deliver behavior change interventions, and there is a growing interest in the gamification apps in mHealth to promote physical activity (PA) participation. Gamification could use game design elements (such as points, leaderboards, and progress bars), and it has the potential to increase motivation for PA and engagement. However, mHealth-based gamification interventions are still emerging, and little is known about the application status and efficacy of such interventions.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              This systematic review aims to investigate gamification apps in mHealth for improving PA levels and simultaneously summarize the impact of gamification interventions on PA participation.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We searched PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, Embase, CINAHL (EBSCO host), and IEEE Xplore from inception to December 20, 2020. Original empirical research exploring the effects of gamification interventions on PA participation was included. The papers described at least one outcome regarding exercise or PA participation, which could be subjective self-report or objective indicator measurement. Of note, we excluded studies about serious games or full-fledged games.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Of 2944 studies identified from the database search, 50 (1.69%) were included, and the information was synthesized. The review revealed that gamification of PA had been applied to various population groups and broadly distributed among young people but less distributed among older adults and patients with a disease. Most of the studies (30/50, 60%) combined gamification with wearable devices to improve PA behavior change, and 50% (25/50) of the studies used theories or principles for designing gamified PA interventions. The most frequently used game elements were goal-setting, followed by progress bars, rewards, points, and feedback. This review demonstrated that gamification interventions could increase PA participation; however, the results were mixed, and modest changes were attained, which could be attributed to the heterogeneity across studies.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Overall, this study provides an overview of the existing empirical research in PA gamification interventions and provides evidence for the efficacy of gamification in enhancing PA participation. High-quality empirical studies are needed in the future to assess the efficacy of a combination of gamification and wearable activity devices to promote PA, and further exploration is needed to investigate the optimal implementation of these features of game elements and theories to enhance PA participation.",

      "abstract": "Health care in the 21st century has started undergoing major changes due to the rising number of patients with chronic conditions; increased access to new technologies, medical information, and peer support via the internet; and the ivory tower of medicine breaking down. This marks the beginning of a cultural transformation called digital health. This has also led to a shift in the roles of patients and medical professionals, resulting in a new, equal partnership. When COVID-19 hit, the adoption of digital health technologies skyrocketed. The technological revolution we had been aiming for in health care took place in just months due to the pandemic, but the cultural transition is lagging. This creates a dangerous gap between what is possible technologically through remote care, at-home lab tests, or health sensors and what patients and physicians are actually longing for. If we do it well enough now, we can spare a decade of technological transformations and bring that long-term vision of patients becoming the point of care to the practical reality of today. This is a historic opportunity we might not want to waste.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Nowadays, numerous health-related mobile apps implement gamification in an attempt to draw on the motivational potential of video games and thereby increase user engagement or foster certain health behaviors. However, research on effective gamification is still in its infancy and researchers increasingly recognize methodological shortcomings of existing studies. What we actually know about the phenomenon today stems from fragmented pieces of knowledge, and a variety of different perspectives. Existing research primarily draws on conceptual knowledge that is gained from research prototypes, and isolated from industry best practices. We still lack knowledge on how gamification has been successfully designed and implemented within the industry and whether certain gamification approaches have shown to be particularly suitable for certain health behaviors.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              We address this lack of knowledge concerning best practices in the design and implementation of gamification for health-related mobile apps by identifying archetypes of gamification approaches that have emerged in pertinent health-related mobile apps and analyzing to what extent those gamification approaches are influenced by the underlying desired health-related outcomes.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A 3-step research approach is employed. As a first step, a database of 143 pertinent gamified health-related mobile apps from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store is set up. Second, the gamification approach of each app within the database is classified based on an established taxonomy for gamification in health-related apps. Finally, a 2-step cluster analysis is conducted in order to identify archetypes of the most dominant gamification approaches in pertinent gamified health-related mobile apps.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Eight archetypes of gamification emerged from the analysis of health-related mobile apps: (1) competition and collaboration, (2) pursuing self-set goals without rewards, (3) episodical compliance tracking, (4) inherent gamification for external goals, (5) internal rewards for self-set goals, (6) continuous assistance through positive reinforcement, (7) positive and negative reinforcement without rewards, and (8) progressive gamification for health professionals. The results indicate a close relationship between the identified archetypes and the actual health behavior that is being targeted.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              By unveiling salient best practices and discussing their relationship to targeted health behaviors, this study contributes to a more profound understanding of gamification in mobile health. The results can serve as a foundation for future research that advances the knowledge on how gamification may positively influence health behavior change and guide practitioners in the design and development of highly motivating and effective health-related mobile health apps.",

Studies were included when they used gamified interventions in daily life with an active or inactive control group and when they assessed a PA or sedentary behavior outcome. We conducted meta-analyses using a random-effects model approach. Sensitivity analyses, influence analyses, and publication bias analyses were performed to examine the robustness of our results.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              The main meta-analysis performed on 16 studies and 2407 participants revealed a small to medium summary effect of gamified interventions on PA behavior (Hedges g=0.42, 95% CI 0.14-0.69). No statistical difference among different subgroups (adults vs adolescents and healthy participants vs adults with chronic diseases) and no interaction effects with moderators such as age, gender, or BMI were found, suggesting good generalizability of gamified interventions to different user populations. The effect was statistically significant when gamified interventions were compared with inactive control groups, such as waiting lists (Hedges g=0.58, 95% CI 0.08-1.07), and active control groups that included a nongamified PA intervention (Hedges g=0.23, 95% CI 0.05-0.41). This suggests that gamified interventions are not only efficient in changing behavior but also more effective compared with other behavioral interventions. The long-term effect (measured with follow-up averaging 14 weeks after the end of the intervention) was weaker, with a very small to small effect (Hedges g=0.15, 95% CI 0.07-0.23).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This meta-analysis confirms that gamified interventions are promising for promoting PA in various populations. Additional analyses revealed that this effect persists after the follow-up period, suggesting that it is not just a novelty effect caused by the playful nature of gamification, and that gamified products appear effective compared with equivalent nongamified PA interventions. Future rigorous trials are required to confirm these findings.",

      "abstract": "People often make decisions in health care that are not in their best interest, ranging from failing to enroll in health insurance to which they are entitled, to engaging in extremely harmful behaviors. Traditional economic theory provides a limited tool kit for improving behavior because it assumes that people make decisions in a rational way, have the mental capacity to deal with huge amounts of information and choice, and have tastes endemic to them and not open to manipulation. Melding economics with psychology, behavioral economics acknowledges that people often do not act rationally in the economic sense. It therefore offers a potentially richer set of tools than provided by traditional economic theory to understand and influence behaviors. Only recently, however, has it been applied to health care. This article provides an overview of behavioral economics, reviews some of its contributions, and shows how it can be used in health care to improve people's decisions and health.",

To do so, first, we extract the relevant bibliographic data for our research according to a methodology of data generation structured in six stages and a descriptive analysis oriented to the technical characterization of the data. Then, we codify all the information, identify the main attributes with the collaboration of two independent experts and check their validity using the evaluation of two focus groups of professionals in gamification and health care management. We found seven attributes: (1) health care users, (2) psychology, (3) behavior, (4) activities, (5) health field, (6) technology, and (7) gamification elements. Within each of these seven attributes, there are a series of main elements that are detailed in the following for each of them. (1) Health care users: their age and the role they play in the health system. (2) Psychology: cognition, positive and negative emotions. (3) Behavior: healthy behavior encouragement, such as compliance, collaboration and responsibility. (4) Activities: physical activity and food. (5) Health field: preventive medicine and chronic diseases. (6) Technology: cell phones. (7) Gamification elements: different elements, but the number of articles in which these elements and their interactions are studied in depth is limited.

Behavioral-economic approaches may improve the incentivization effectiveness. This study compares and ranks the effectiveness of standard and behavioral incentivization for healthy diet, weight control, and physical activity promotion.\n            \n            \n              Purpose\n              To investigate whether behavioral-economic insights improve incentivization effectiveness.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A systematic search of Medline and Scopus was performed from database inception to December 2020.

For diet-weight control, standard FI, deposit contract (deposit), lottery-based incentive (lottery), and standard-FI + lottery increased goal achievement compared to no-FI but only deposit was statistically significant with pooled RRs and 95% confidence intervals (CI) of 1.21 (0.94, 1.56), 1.79 (1.04, 3.05), 1.45 (0.99, 2.13), and 1.73 (0.83, 3.63). For physical activity, standard-FI, deposit, and lottery significantly increased goal achievement compared to no-FI, with pooled RRs of 1.38 (1.13, 1.68), 1.63 (1.24, 2.14) and 1.43 (1.14, 1.80), respectively.

      "abstract": "A serious game is a type of game that is designed for a primary purpose other than entertainment. Instead, serious games are intended to achieve specific goals, such as education, training, or health promotion. The goal of serious games is to engage players in a way that is both enjoyable and effective in achieving the intended learning or behavior change outcomes. Recently, several systematic reviews on the development and application of serious games and on the application of gamification techniques have been published, which indicate high activity and ongoing progress in this area of research. Such an extensive body of review papers raises the need to analyze and extract the current state and the prevailing trends of the serious games and gamification (SGG) domain by analyzing and summarizing the systematic review articles. This study presents a systematic meta-review, i.e., a review of the 53 survey papers on the domain of serious games and gamification. The systematic review follows the PRISMA guidelines, while constructive and cross-sectional methods are used to analyze and present the results. Finally, this study identifies the future trends and challenges for the domain. As a result, the meta-review helps the reader to quickly assess the present status of SGG and serves as a reference for finding further information on each technology utilized in SGG. Using the criterion of the citations, the meta-review analysis provides insight into the quantity and academic relevance of the published SGG articles. Moreover, 53 articles published in journals were selected as important surveys in the research field. The study found that serious games and gamification techniques are increasingly being used for a wide range of health conditions and the focus is shifting towards the use of mobile and digital platforms, virtual reality, and machine learning to personalize and adapt interventions. The existing research gaps include the lack of standardization in development and evaluation, insufficient understanding of underlying mechanisms of action, limited understanding of integration into existing healthcare systems, limited understanding of specific game mechanics and design elements for promoting health behaviors, and limited research on scalability, adoption, and long-term effects. These research gaps highlight the need for further research to fully understand the potential and limitations of serious games and gamification for health and how to effectively apply them.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes evidence on the effectiveness of digital peer support interventions for enhancing physical and mental health in healthy individuals rather than those diagnosed with a clinical condition.\t  \t  \t    Methods\t    First, we evaluated the impact of digital peer support interventions on physical and mental health outcomes by attending to sources of peer support (informal, naturally occurring peer support; formal support from trained peers), effectiveness demonstrated through different study designs (pre–post comparison vs. well-controlled experimental conditions) and long-term effects of interventions. Second, we examined whether features of digital peer support interventions – specifically, dosage, uptake and platform affordances – moderated intervention effectiveness. Third, we considered moderating effects of individual differences (age and existing health conditions) and country.\t  \t  \t    Results\t    Using random-effects modelling, which included 47 studies with 76 effect sizes on physical health, and 73 studies with 118 effect sizes on mental health, we found a moderate effect of digital peer support in improving physical health (standardized mean difference (SMD) = 0.35, p < 0.001; 95% CI: 0.30–0.41) and a large effect in enhancing mental health (standardized mean difference(SMD) = 0.53, p < 0.001; 95% CI: 0.46–0.61), which were similar across ages and individuals with varying degree of existing health conditions. Different sources of peer support demonstrated similar effects on physical health, but informal, naturally occurring peer support was more effective in bolstering mental health than formal support from trained peers, producing large effects that were comparable to online professional support. Positive effects on physical health were sustained over follow-up assessments, but weakened for mental health over time. Greater dosages of intervention had decreased effectiveness, but uptake of intervention did not moderate the effects on health. Interventions delivered on platforms that afford greater interactivity (apps, social networking sites and video conferencing) were more effective than those with lower interactivity (forums, websites and emails). Digital peer support interventions had stronger effects on improving physical health in Western countries than Eastern countries, but stronger effects on improving mental health in Eastern than Western countries.\t  \t  \t    Conclusions\t    Our findings contribute to the nascent conceptual models of digital peer support, lend credence to digital peer support as a scalable preventive intervention with real-world benefits in bolstering individuals’ physical and mental health and provide important insights into best practices.",

We challenge the idea that interaction over such interfaces is necessarily “natural” and argue that everyday interaction involves constraints on awareness, control, and availability. These constraints help people interact more smoothly. We draw from social developmental psychology to characterize the design of multi-user interfaces in terms of how constraints on these mechanisms can be best used to promote collaboration. We use this framework of mechanisms and constraints to explain the successes and failures of existing designs, then apply it to three case studies of design, and finally derive from them a set of questions to consider when designing and analysing multi-user interfaces for collaboration.",

However, new system implementation in health-care institutions is often accompanied by a change in clinical workflow and organizational culture. This study examines how well an EHR-integrated PRO system fits clinical workflows and individual needs of different provider groups within 2 clinics.                                                Materials and Methods                  Northwestern Medicine developed and implemented an EHR-integrated PRO system within the orthopedics and oncology departments. We conducted interviews with 11 providers who had interacted with the system. Through thematic analysis, we synthesized themes regarding provider perspectives on clinical workflow, individual needs, and system features.                                                Results                  Our findings show that EHR-integrated PROs facilitate targeted conversation with patients and automated triage for psychosocial care. However, physicians, psychosocial providers, and medical assistants faced different challenges in their use of the PRO system. Barriers mainly stemmed from a lack of actionable data, workflow disruption, technical issues, and a lack of incentives.                                                Discussion                  This study sheds light on the ecosystem around EHR-integrated PRO systems (such as user needs and organizational factors). We present recommendations to address challenges facing PRO implementation, such as optimizing data collection and auto-referral processes, improving data visualizations, designing effective educational materials, and prioritizing the primary user group.                                                Conclusion                  PRO integration into routine care can be beneficial but also require effective technology design and workflow configuration to reach full potential use. This study provides insights into how patient-generated health data can be better integrated into clinical practice and care delivery processes.",

      "abstract": "AbstractMental illness is highly prevalent nowadays, constituting a major cause of distress in people’s life with impact on society’s health and well-being. Mental illness is a complex multi-factorial disease associated with individual risk factors and a variety of socioeconomic, clinical associations. In order to capture these complex associations expressed in a wide variety of textual data, including social media posts, interviews, and clinical notes, natural language processing (NLP) methods demonstrate promising improvements to empower proactive mental healthcare and assist early diagnosis. We provide a narrative review of mental illness detection using NLP in the past decade, to understand methods, trends, challenges and future directions. A total of 399 studies from 10,467 records were included. The review reveals that there is an upward trend in mental illness detection NLP research. Deep learning methods receive more attention and perform better than traditional machine learning methods. We also provide some recommendations for future studies, including the development of novel detection methods, deep learning paradigms and interpretable models.",

      "abstract": "Abstract                      Background            Individuals with chronic diseases commonly engage in a sedentary lifestyle, which may exacerbate poor disease progression and increase the burden of care. Digital health interventions have been broadly used in promoting healthy lifestyles in recent decades, while their effectiveness on sedentary behavior (SB) remains inconsistent and inconclusive.                                Objective            This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of digital health interventions in reducing SB among patients with chronic diseases.                                Methods            PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Library, and ACM Digital Library were searched for randomized controlled trials published from January 2000 to October 2023. Two researchers independently screened studies and evaluated study quality. The revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Mean differences (MDs) were calculated for intervention effect comparison.                                Results            Twenty-six trials were selected and 3800 participants were included. The mean age was 57.32 (SD 9.91) years. The typical chronic diseases reported in the studies included obesity (n=6), arthritis (n=5), coronary artery disease (n=4), cancer (n=4), type 2 diabetes mellitus (n=3), metabolic syndrome (n=2), and stroke (n=2). Phone, web, and activity trackers were 3 digital technologies adopted in the interventions and they were used in combination in most studies (18/26, 69.2%). The functions included facilitating self-monitoring of SB, reminding interruption of long undisturbed sitting, and promoting goal attainment. Approaches targeting SB reduction included standing (n=6), walking (n=9), light physical activity (n=5), moderate to vigorous physical activity (n=4), screen time limitation (n=2), and contextual-related activities based on patients’ preference (n=4). The majority (80.8%) of studies had a low to moderate risk of bias. Meta-analysis revealed significant decreases in overall sitting time (MD −30.80; 95% CI −49.79 to−11.82; I2=65%; P=.001), pre-post sitting time changes (MD −50.28; 95% CI −92.99 to −7.57; I2=92%; P=.02), and SB proportions (MD −4.65%; 95% CI −7.02 to −2.28; I2=20%; P<.001) after digital health interventions, compared with nondigital interventions such as usual care, wait-list, or other active controls, with a small effect size (Cohen d=−0.27 to −0.47). No significant differences in the length of sedentary bouts and breaks were found. Subgroup analyses showed that studies with objective SB measurements and those younger than 65 years had significant reductions in sitting time.                                Conclusions            Digital health interventions significantly reduced the SB among patients with chronic illness. More research with rigorous design to promote a long-term decrease in sitting time, differentiate primary and compensatory SB reductions, and explore the underlying mechanisms is needed.",

      "abstract": "Background            Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) in youth is characterized by behaviors, emotions, physiological reactions, and family interaction patterns. An essential component of therapy involves increasing awareness of the links among thoughts, emotions, behaviors, bodily sensations, and family interactions. An automatic assessment tool using physiological signals from a wearable biosensor may enable continuous symptom monitoring inside and outside of the clinic and support cognitive behavioral therapy for OCD.                                Objective            The primary aim of this study is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptability of using a wearable biosensor to monitor OCD symptoms. The secondary aim is to explore the feasibility of developing clinical and research tools that can detect and predict OCD-relevant internal states and interpersonal processes with the use of speech and behavioral signals.                                Methods            Eligibility criteria for the study include children and adolescents between 8 and 17 years of age diagnosed with OCD, controls with no psychiatric diagnoses, and one parent of the participating youths. Youths and parents wear biosensors on their wrists that measure pulse, electrodermal activity, skin temperature, and acceleration. Patients and their parents mark OCD episodes, while control youths and their parents mark youth fear episodes. Continuous, in-the-wild data collection will last for 8 weeks. Controlled experiments designed to link physiological, speech, behavioral, and biochemical signals to mental states are performed at baseline and after 8 weeks. Interpersonal interactions in the experiments are filmed and coded for behavior. The films are also processed with computer vision and for speech signals. Participants complete clinical interviews and questionnaires at baseline, and at weeks 4, 7, and 8. Feasibility criteria were set for recruitment, retention, biosensor functionality and acceptability, adherence to wearing the biosensor, and safety related to the biosensor. As a first step in learning the associations between signals and OCD-related parameters, we will use paired t tests and mixed effects models with repeated measures to assess associations between oxytocin, individual biosignal features, and outcomes such as stress-rest and case-control comparisons.                                Results            The first participant was enrolled on December 3, 2021, and recruitment closed on December 31, 2022. Nine patient dyads and nine control dyads were recruited. Sixteen participating dyads completed follow-up assessments.                                Conclusions            The results of this study will provide preliminary evidence for the extent to which a wearable biosensor that collects physiological signals can be used to monitor OCD severity and events in youths. If we find the study to be feasible, further studies will be conducted to integrate biosensor signals output into machine learning algorithms that can provide patients, parents, and therapists with actionable insights into OCD symptoms and treatment progress. Future definitive studies will be tasked with testing the accuracy of machine learning models to detect and predict OCD episodes and classify clinical severity.

Good adherence to ART is beneficial to patients and the public. Furthermore, mHealth has shown promise in improving HIV medication adherence globally.                                Objective            The aim of this meta-analysis is to analyze the effectiveness of mHealth on adherence to antiretroviral therapy in patients living with HIV.                                Methods            Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of the association between mHealth and adherence to ART published until December 2021 were searched in electronic databases. Odds ratios (ORs), weighted mean differences, and 95% CIs were calculated. This meta-analysis was performed using the Mantel-Haenszel method or the inverse variance test. We evaluated heterogeneity with the I2 statistic. If I2 was ≤50%, heterogeneity was absent, and a fixed effect model was used. If I2 was >50%, heterogeneity was present, and a random effects model was used.                                Results            A total of 2163 participants in 8 studies were included in this meta-analysis. All included studies were RCTs. The random effects model was used for a meta-analysis of the effects of various intervention measures compared to routine nursing; the outcome was not statistically significant (OR 1.54, 95% CI 0.99-2.38; P=.05). In the subgroups, only short messaging service (SMS)-based interventions significantly increased adherence to ART (OR 1.76, 95% CI 1.07-2.89; P=.03). Further analysis showed that only interactive or bidirectional SMS could significantly increase ART adherence (OR 1.69, 95% CI 1.22-2.34; P=.001). After combining the difference in CD4 cell count before and after the interventions, we concluded that there was no statistical heterogeneity among the studies (I2=0%; tau2=0.37; P=.95).                                Conclusions            Interactive or bidirectional SMS can enhance intervention effects. However, whether mHealth can improve adherence to ART in patients with HIV needs further study. Owing to a lack of the required significant staff time, training, and ongoing supervision, there is still much more to do to apply mHealth to the clinical use of ART for patients living with HIV.

We assigned eligible pregnant women to receive 2-way SMS with a nurse or no SMS, with the option to include male partners. We delivered automated family planning–focused SMS messages weekly until 6 months postpartum. Women and men receiving SMS could interact with nurses via SMS. In intention-to-treat analysis, we compared highly effective contraceptive (HEC) use at 6 months postpartum between groups using the χ2 test. We used Poisson regression in adjusted analysis.  Results. We randomized 260 women to 2-way SMS or control, and we enrolled 103 male partners. At 6 months postpartum, 69.9% women receiving SMS reported HEC use, compared with 57.4% in control (relative risk = 1.22; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.01, 1.47; P = .04). In analysis adjusted for baseline demographic differences, the adjusted relative risk for HEC use in the SMS group was 1.26 (95% CI = 1.04, 1.52; P = .02).  Conclusions. Two-way SMS with a nurse, including optional male participation, increased postpartum contraceptive use.  Trial Registration. ClinicalTrials.gov; identifier: NCT02781714.",

      "abstract": "Methods: We performed a generalized cost-effectiveness analysis in a randomized controlled trial in Bangladesh. Patients with type 2 diabetes were randomized (1:1) to a text messaging intervention plus standard-care or standard-care alone. Intervention participants received a text message daily for 6 months encouraging healthy lifestyles. Costs to users and the health systems were measured. The EQ-5D-3L was used to measure improvements in health-related quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Intervention costs were expressed as average cost-effectiveness ratios (cost-per 1% unit-reduction in glycated haemoglobin HbA1c and cost per QALY gained), based on the World Health Organization cost effectiveness and strategic planning (WHO-CHOICE) method.\nResults: In 236 patients [mean age 48 (SD9.6) years] the adjusted difference in accumulated QALYs between the intervention and the control group over the 6-month period was 0.010 (95%CI: 0.000; 0.021). Additional costs per-patient averaged 24 international dollars (Intl.$), resulting in incremental cost-effectiveness ratios of 38 Intl.$ per % glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) reduction and 2406 Intl.$ per QALY gained. The total intervention costs for the mobile phone text messaging program was 2842 Int.$.\nConclusion: Text messaging might be a valuable addition to standard treatment for diabetes care in lowresource settings and predicted to lead an overall saving in health systems costs. Studies with longer follow-up and larger samples are needed to draw reliable conclusions.",

Setting:            We examined data from a behavioral substudy of a large-scale PrEP implementation trial in New South Wales, Australia.                                Methods:            Trial participants completed optional brief quarterly surveys, reporting the number of pills taken and sexual behavior with male partners for each day of the “last full week” before each survey. Condomless sex (CLS) was defined as “higher risk” for HIV when with HIV-positive men with detectable/unknown viral loads or unknown HIV status men. Adequate PrEP protection was defined as ≥4 pills for participants assigned male sex at birth and ≥6 pills for participants assigned female sex at birth (including transgender men).                                Results:            Of 9596 participants dispensed PrEP, 4401 completed baseline and ≥1 follow-up survey. Participants reported on 12,399 “last full weeks”: 7485 weeks (60.4%) involved CLS and 2521 weeks (33.7% of CLS-weeks) involved higher risk CLS. There were 103 weeks in which participants did not have adequate PrEP protection and had higher risk CLS: 4.1% of higher-risk CLS weeks (n = 103/2521), 1.4% of all CLS weeks (n = 103/7485), and 0.8% of all observed weeks (n = 103/12,399).                                Conclusions:            In a large PrEP trial, prevention-effective adherence to PrEP was very high at 99%. Our findings illustrate the importance of measuring pill-taking and sexual behavior in the same period so that prevention-effective adherence can be better estimated.",

      "abstract": "Background            Nursing home residents are at high risk of complications and death due to COVID-19. Lack of resources, both human and material, amplifies the likelihood of contamination in these facilities where a single employee can contaminate dozens of residents and colleagues. Improving the dissemination of and adhesion to infection prevention and control (IPC) guidelines is therefore essential. Serious games have been shown to be effective in developing knowledge and in increasing engagement, and could motivate nursing home employees to change their IPC practices.                                Objective            Our aim is to assess the impact of “Escape COVID-19,” a serious game designed to enhance knowledge and application of IPC procedures, on the intention of nursing home employees to change their IPC practices.                                Methods            We will carry out a web-based randomized controlled trial following the CONSORT-EHEALTH (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials of Electronic and Mobile Health Applications and Online Telehealth) guidelines and incorporating relevant elements of CHERRIES (Checklist for Reporting Results of Internet E-Surveys). Participants will be randomized to either the control or the serious game (intervention) group. First, both groups will be asked to answer a questionnaire designed to gather demographic data and assess baseline knowledge. The control group will then receive a quick reminder of the current national guidelines and links to IPC guidelines for health care professionals, while the other group will play the game. Both groups will then have to answer a second questionnaire designed to assess their willingness to change their IPC practices after having followed their respective material. After completing this questionnaire, they will be granted access to the material presented to the group they were not assigned to and receive a course completion certificate. The primary outcome will be the proportion of participants willing to change their IPC practices according to group. Secondary outcomes will include the analysis of specific questions detailing the exact changes considered by the participants. Factors associated with participant willingness or reluctance to change behavior will also be assessed. Attrition will also be assessed at each stage of the study.                                Results            The study protocol has been presented to our regional ethics committee (Req-2020-01262), which issued a declaration of no objection as such projects do not fall within the scope of the Swiss federal law on human research. Data collection began on November 5, 2020, and should be completed by December 4, 2020.                                Conclusions            This study should determine whether “Escape COVID-19,” a serious game designed to improve compliance with COVID-19 safe practices, modifies the intention to follow IPC guidelines among nursing home employees.

      "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundElectronic (eHealth) and mobile (mHealth) health interventions can provide a large coverage, and are promising tools to change health behavior (i.e. physical activity, sedentary behavior and healthy eating). However, the determinants of intervention effectiveness in primary prevention has not been explored yet. Therefore, the objectives of this umbrella review were to evaluate intervention effectiveness, to explore the impact of pre-defined determinants of effectiveness (i.e. theoretical foundations, behavior change techniques, social contexts or just-in-time adaptive interventions), and to provide recommendations for future research and practice in the field of primary prevention delivered via e/mHealth technology.MethodsPubMed, Scopus, Web of Science and the Cochrane Library were searched for systematic reviews and meta-analyses (reviews) published between January 1990 and May 2020. Reviews reporting on e/mHealth behavior change interventions in physical activity, sedentary behavior and/or healthy eating for healthy subjects (i.e. subjects without physical or physiological morbidities which would influence the realization of behaviors targeted by the respective interventions) were included if they also investigated respective theoretical foundations, behavior change techniques, social contexts or just-in-time adaptive interventions. Included studies were ranked concerning their methodological quality and qualitatively synthesized.ResultsThe systematic search revealed 11 systematic reviews and meta-analyses of moderate quality. The majority of original research studies within the reviews found e/mHealth interventions to be effective, but the results showed a high heterogeneity concerning assessment methods and outcomes, making them difficult to compare. Whereas theoretical foundation and behavior change techniques were suggested to be potential positive determinants of effective interventions, the impact of social context remains unclear. None of the reviews included just-in-time adaptive interventions.ConclusionFindings of this umbrella review support the use of e/mHealth to enhance physical activity and healthy eating and reduce sedentary behavior. The general lack of precise reporting and comparison of confounding variables in reviews and original research studies as well as the limited number of reviews for each health behavior constrains the generalization and interpretation of results. Further research is needed on study-level to investigate effects of versatile determinants of e/mHealth efficiency, using a theoretical foundation and additionally explore the impact of social contexts and more sophisticated approaches like just-in-time adaptive interventions.Trial registrationThe protocol for this umbrella review was a priori registered with PROSPERO: CRD42020147902.",

      "abstract": "Background            The health care costs for reproductive care have substantially increased with the use of in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. The mobile health (mHealth) coaching program Smarter Pregnancy is an effective intervention to improve nutrition and lifestyle behaviors and pregnancy rates in (sub)fertile couples, including those who undergo IVF treatment. Therefore, we hypothesize that this mHealth program can also reduce health care costs associated with IVF treatment.                                Objective            This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the mHealth coaching program Smarter Pregnancy and compare it to usual care in women of subfertile couples who start their first IVF cycle.                                Methods            This model-based cost-effectiveness analysis was performed on data from couples undergoing IVF treatment at the Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam. A decision tree model was used to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ongoing pregnancies and costs of use of the mHealth program as compared to usual care. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to consider the uncertainty surrounding the point estimates of the input parameters.                                Results            Based on our model including 793 subfertile women undergoing IVF treatment, use of the mHealth program resulted in 86 additional pregnancies and saved €270,000 compared to usual care after two IVF cycles, with an ICER of –€3050 (95% CI –3960 to –540) per additional pregnancy. The largest cost saving was caused by the avoided IVF treatment costs. Sensitivity analyses showed that the mHealth program needs to increase the ongoing pregnancy rate by at least 51% after two IVF cycles for cost saving.                                Conclusions            The mHealth coaching program Smarter Pregnancy is potentially cost saving for subfertile couples preceding their first IVF treatment. Implementation of this mHealth program in routine preconception care for subfertile couples should be seriously considered, given the relatively low costs and promising cost-effectiveness estimates.",

We aim to evaluate the efficacy of a text messaging–based intervention to improve glycemic control in patients with coronary heart disease and diabetes mellitus in China.                                Methods and Results:                          The CHAT-DM study (Cardiovascular Health and Texting-Diabetes Mellitus) was a parallel-group, single-blind, randomized clinical trial that included 502 patients with both coronary heart disease and diabetes mellitus from 34 hospitals in China. The intervention group (n=251) received 6 text messages per week for 6 months in addition to usual care. Messages were theory driven and culturally tailored to provide educational and motivational information on glucose monitoring, blood pressure control, medication adherence, physical activity, and lifestyle. The control group (n=251) received usual care and 2 thank you messages per month. The primary outcome was change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA              1C              [hemoglobin A              1C              ]) from baseline to 6 months. Secondary outcomes were change in proportion of patients achieving HbA              1C              <7%, fasting blood glucose, systolic blood pressure, LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, body mass index, and physical activity from baseline to 6 months. The end points were assessed using analyses of covariance. The follow-up rate was 99%. When compared with control group at 6 months, the intervention group had a greater reduction in HbA              1C              (−0.2% versus 0.1%;              P              =0.003) and a greater proportion of participants who achieved HbA              1C              <7% (69.3% versus 52.6%;              P              =0.004). Change in fasting blood glucose was larger in the intervention group (between-group difference: −0.6 mmol/L; 95% CI, −1.1 to −0.2;              P              =0.011), but no other outcome differences were observed. Nearly all participants reported that messages were easy to understand (97.1%) and useful (94.1%).                                            Conclusions:            A text message intervention resulted in better glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease. While the mechanism of this benefit remains to be determined, the results suggest that a simple, culturally sensitive mobile text messaging program may provide an effective and feasible way to improve disease self-management.

With whole barley there was little variation in rumen pH associated with feeding time, but with pelleted barley the pH decreased from about 7-0 before feeding to about 5-3, 2--3 h after feeding. 2. The rate of disappearance of dried grass during incubation in the rumens of sheep receiving either whole or pelleted barley was studied in a second experiment. After 24 h incubation only 423 mg/g incubated had disappeared in the rumen of sheep receiving pelleted barley while 625 mg/g incubated had disappeared when it was incubated in the rumen of sheep receiving whole barley. 3. The voluntary intake of dried grass of lambs was studied in a third experiment when they received supplements of either 25 or 50 g whole or pelleted barley/kg live weight 0-75. At the high level, pelleted barley reduced intake of dried grass by 534 g/kg but whole barley reduced it by only 352 g/kg. The digestibility of acid-detergent fibre was reduced more by pelleted barley than by whole barley but there was a tendency for a small increase in digestibility of the barley due to processing. 4. The implications of these findings on supplementation of roughages with cereals are discussed.",

The purpose of this review is to summarise the guiding principles, content, context and timing of information and education that is beneficial for supporting people with CHD and potential communication strategies, including digital interventions. We conducted a scoping review involving a search of four databases (Web of Science, PubMed, CINAHL, Medline) for articles published from January 2000 to August 2022. Literature was identified through title and abstract screening by expert reviewers. Evidence was synthesised according to the review aims. Results demonstrated that information-sharing, decision-making, goal-setting, positivity and practicality are important aspects of secondary prevention and should be patient-centred and evidenced based with consideration of patient need and preference. Initiation and duration of education is highly variable between and within people, hence communication and support should be regular and ongoing. In conclusion, text messaging programs, smartphone applications and wearable devices are examples of digital health strategies that facilitate education and support for patients with heart disease. There is no one size fits all approach that suits all patients at all stages, hence flexibility and a suite of resources and strategies is optimal.",

This work aimed to reveal current research trends, hotspots, and future frontiers in PA during pregnancy. Methods: Software CiteSpace was used to perform a bibliometric analysis with 1415 publications in the Web of Science Core Collection. Results: the number of published papers on PA during pregnancy has increased gradually by year. The United States has made the most significant contribution to the research on this topic, ranking first in the world in both the number and centrality of research. A total of 54 articles (3.8%) were published in 2022. A majority of publications were research articles (n = 1176, 78.9%). The authors and institutions of the research published have more inter-country collaborations. Different patterns of PA, prevention, and amelioration of pregnancy complications are major research hotspots. Improvement of sedentary behaviour, lifestyle intervention through leisure-time PA, and preterm care are major research frontiers and have received extensive attention in recent years. Conclusions: The current scientometric study presents an overview of PA during pregnancy research conducted throughout the preceding decades. The conclusions of this work might serve as a reference for researchers who are interested in this field.",

We identified distinct trajectories of SI over time (i.e., classes) using latent class growth analysis and examined demographic and military service predictors of class membership overall and by gender using multinomial logistic regression.ResultsFour SI trajectories that were similar across genders were identified: resilient (90.1%), delayed onset (5.0%), remitting (2.7%), and chronic (2.2%). Younger age, minority race/ethnicity, medical and other (vs. honorable) separation types, and Veterans Health Administration service utilization were associated with increased odds of assignment to a higher‐risk trajectory (delayed onset, remitting, and/or chronic vs. resilient), whereas continued service in the National Guard/Reserves and officer rank was associated with lower odds of assignment to a higher‐risk trajectory.ConclusionsFindings regarding veterans at greatest risk for SI following military separation can inform targeted assessment and early intervention efforts.",

      "abstract": "Background and objective\nBronchodilators (BDs) are the cornerstone of COPD treatment. However, their underuse has been reported in real-life studies. PUMA is a primary-care study from Argentina, Colombia, Venezuela and Uruguay that could help understand the BD use in terms of frequency for long-acting (LA-BD) and short-acting (SA-BD) BDs alone or associated with corticosteroids (CS), and the use as-needed or on regular basis.\nMethods\nThis is a multicentre, multinational, cross-sectional, non-interventional study including no randomised primary-care centres from each country (total 57 centres) without connection with respiratory specialists. Subjects attending routine visits, at-risk for COPD (≥40 years, current or former smokers or exposed to biomass) completed a questionnaire and performed spirometry. COPD was defined as post-BD FEV1/FVC<0.70 and by the lower limit of normal (LLN). Prior physician diagnosis of emphysema, chronic bronchitis or COPD was also determined.\nResults\n1743 patients were interviewed, 1540 completed spirometry, 309 had COPD by post-BD FEV1/FVC<0.70, 226 by LLN, and 102 had prior medical diagnosis. A total of 77/309 COPD patients by spirometry (24.9%) used BD (3.6% LA-BDs), 15.2% used BD + CS (13.6% LA-BD + CS). Among these patients, SA-BDs (monotherapy) were the most commonly used medication both as-needed (4.5%) and on a regular basis (17.5%). Similar findings were observed using the LLN criteria. In those with prior medical diagnosis, 66/102 (64.7%) used BDs (9.8% LA-BD), and 25.6% used BD + CS (13.6% LA-BD + CS); among them SA-BDs were the most commonly medication used as-needed (9%) and on a regular basis (48.1%). Having health insurance with medication coverage increased the use of BDs.\nConclusions\nUp to 60% of COPD patients by spirometry and 10% of those with prior medical diagnosis attending a primary care sample of four Latin American countries did not use BDs. LA-BDs are widely underused on a regular-basis (2.6% and 8.3% of patients with spirometric and medical-diagnosis, respectively) This represents a considerable gap between guideline recommendations and BD prescribing pattern in these centres.",

Core body temperature, subjective sleepiness and waking electroencephalogram (EEG) theta–alpha activity (6.25–9 Hz) were assessed in 18 healthy men (nine morning and nine evening chronotypes, 21.4 ± 1.9 years) during a 36‐h constant routine that followed a week of a normal ‘working’ sleep–wake schedule (bedtime: 23.30 h, wake time: 07.30 h). The phase of the circadian rhythm of temperature and sleepiness occurred respectively, 1.5 h (P = 0.01) and 2 h (P = 0.009) later in evening‐ than in morning‐type subjects. Only morning‐type subjects showed a bimodal rhythm of sleep–wake propensity. The buildup of subjective sleepiness, as quantified by linear regression, was slower in evening than in morning types (P = 0.04). The time course of EEG theta–alpha activity of both chronotypes could be closely fitted by an exponential curve. The time constant of evening types was longer than that of morning types (P = 0.03), indicating a slower increase in sleep pressure during extended wakefulness. These results suggest that both the circadian signal and the kinetics of sleep pressure buildup differ between the two chronotypes even under prior naturalistic conditions mimicking the usual working day.",

      "abstract": "Background: Over the last two decades, a number of imaging studies have evaluated the characteristics and clinical implications of mitral annular disjunction (MAD) among patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP). The present systematic review has been primarily designed to summarize the main findings of these studies and to examine the overall impact of MAD in MVP patients. Methods: All imaging studies assessing the prevalence, pathophysiological role and determinants of MAD in MVP individuals, selected from the PubMed and EMBASE databases, were included. There was no limitation in terms of time period. The risk of bias was assessed by using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Results: The full texts of 23 studies on 7718 MVP individuals were analyzed. The overall pooled prevalence of MAD in MVP individuals was 40% (range 5.4–90%). When considering the different imaging modalities for assessing MAD, the average MAD prevalence was 20% for cardiac computed tomography studies, 31.3% for transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) studies, 44.7% for transesophageal echocardiography studies and 47% for cardiac magnetic resonance studies. MAD presence was more commonly associated with female sex, young age, narrow antero-posterior thoracic diameter, symptoms of palpitations and syncope, T-wave inversion in inferolateral leads and frequent and/or complex ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) on electrocardiogram, myxomatous leaflets, bileaflet prolapse, larger mitral valve annulus and non-severe mitral regurgitation on TTE. A total of 12 studies (52.2%) provided follow-up data. Over a median follow-up time of 3.9 yrs (range 1–10.3 yrs), MVP individuals with MAD showed increased risk of clinical arrhythmic events, no difference in survival rate and good surgical outcomes. Conclusions: MAD was present in more than one-third of MVP patients, with a wide range of variability depending on the specific imaging method used for assessing MAD presence and on a nonunivocal MAD definition, with a possible overestimation due to Pseudo-MAD rather than True-MAD measurement. A multimodality imaging approach comprehensive of noninvasive chest shape assessment might improve MAD detection among MVP individuals. It appears that careful serial monitoring for VAs should be mandatory for MAD patients.",

Single‐item self‐report measures of all constructs of interest were used.ResultsA total of n = 1056 participants indicated hospitalization for either a past suicide attempt (SA) or suicidal ideation (SI). Irrespective of being hospitalized for SI or SA, perceived usefulness of hospital‐based care was low with 50% or more of participants rating their care as some degree of unhelpful. Older age, general trust in mental healthcare providers, and voluntary admission were related to higher perceived helpfulness of care for both SI and SA admissions. Higher pride in TGD identity was positively related to perceived helpfulness of care but only for admissions related to SAs.ConclusionImproving perceived usefulness of hospital‐based care may be important for improving subsequent suicide‐related help‐seeking. Increasing training and provision of care that improves trust with mental healthcare providers and potentially reduces need for involuntary admission may help improve hospital‐based, suicide‐related care in TGD adults.",

      "abstract": "Abstract                      Background            Degenerative cervical myelopathy (DCM), a form of slow-motion and progressive spinal cord injury caused by spinal cord compression secondary to degenerative pathology, leads to high levels of disability and dependence, and may reduce quality of life. Myelopathy.org is the first global scientific and clinical charity for DCM, providing an accessible platform freely disseminating information relevant to the DCM diagnosis and its treatment. Significant transient and long-term change to earnings do occur and can thrust individuals into poverty. People with DCM face many challenges accessing state financial assistance. This can have a cumulative negative financial effect due to the association between DCM and low socioeconomic index. Financial support available to patients under pension age include Universal Credit (UC), a payment that helps with living costs, and Personal Independence Payment (PIP), which helps with extra living costs if someone has both a long-term health condition or disability and difficulty doing certain everyday tasks.                                Objective            This study aimed to assess if delivering workshops centered around access to financial support could assist people with DCM living in the United Kingdom.                                Methods            A series of 2 internet-based workshops was targeted at accessing financial support for English patients under the state pension age, with an anonymized survey delivered to participants after each session. The first session was on UC and the second on PIP. The survey consisted of a mixture of Likert scales, free text and yes or no answers. Survey responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and free text answers underwent inductive thematic analysis.                                Results            The average rating on the use of UC was 9.00/10. Presession self-rated confidence levels were 5.11/10 rising to 8.00/10. The mean score of wanting further similar sessions was 8.67/10 with 56% (5/9) of participants wanting one-to-one sessions. For PIP, the average session use rating was 10/10. Presession self-rated confidence levels were 4.43/10 rising to 9.57/10. The mean score of wanting further similar sessions was 8.71/10, with 43% (3/7) of participants wanting one-to-one sessions . Following inductive thematic analysis, themes regarding the usefulness of such sessions and the challenges to accessing financial support emerged. One participant gave negative feedback, which included the length of the session and perceived problems around confidentiality and data protection.                                Conclusions            The pilot series was largely perceived as a success, with participants finding them useful and increasing their self-rated confidence in navigating the UK financial support system. Given the small sample size, it is hard to predict the success of future sessions. Finally, given that the hurdles in accessing financial support extend beyond DCM, such workshops may be relevant to other organizations.",

      "abstract": "Background Patients who are prescribed medicines take only about half of their doses and many stop treatment entirely. Assisting patients to adhere better to medicines could improve their health, and many studies have tested ways to achieve this. Question We updated our review from 2007 to answer the question: What are the findings of high‐quality studies that tested ways to assist patients with adhering to their medicines? Search strategy We retrieved studies published until 11 January 2013. To find relevant studies we searched six online databases and references in other reviews, and we contacted authors of relevant studies and reviews. Selection criteria We selected studies reporting a randomized controlled trial (RCT) comparing a group receiving an intervention to improve medicine adherence with a group not receiving the intervention. We included trials if they measured both medicine adherence and a clinical outcome (e.g. blood pressure), with at least 80% of patients studied until the end. Main results The studies differed widely regarding included patients, treatments, adherence intervention types, medicine adherence measurement, and clinical outcomes. Therefore, we could not combine the results in statistical analysis to reach general conclusions, as it would be misleading to suggest that they are comparable. Instead, we provide the key features and findings of each study in tables, and we describe intervention effects in studies of the highest quality. The present update included 109 new studies, bringing the total number to 182. In the 17 studies of the highest quality, interventions were generally complex with several different ways to try to improve medicine adherence. These frequently included enhanced support from family, peers, or allied health professionals such as pharmacists, who often delivered education, counseling, or daily treatment support. Only five of these RCTs improved both medicine adherence and clinical outcomes, and no common characteristics for their success could be identified. Overall, even the most effective interventions did not lead to large improvements. Authors' conclusions Characteristics and effects of interventions to improve medicine adherence varied among studies. It is uncertain how medicine adherence can consistently be improved so that the full health benefits of medicines can be realized. We need more advanced methods for researching ways to improve medicine adherence, including better interventions, better ways of measuring adherence, and studies that include sufficient patients to draw conclusions on clinically important effects.",

      "abstract": "Background            Clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) are designed to assist in health care delivery by supporting medical practice with clinical knowledge, patient information, and other relevant types of health information. CDSSs are integral parts of health care technologies assisting in disease management, including diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring. While electronic medical records (EMRs) serve as data repositories, CDSSs are used to assist clinicians in providing personalized, context-specific recommendations derived by comparing individual patient data to evidence-based guidelines.                                Objective            This targeted literature review (TLR) aimed to identify characteristics and features of both stand-alone and EMR-integrated CDSSs that influence their outcomes and benefits based on published scientific literature.                                Methods            A TLR was conducted using the Embase, MEDLINE, and Cochrane databases to identify data on CDSSs published in a 10-year frame (2012-2022). Studies on computerized, guideline-based CDSSs used by health care practitioners with a focus on chronic disease areas and reporting outcomes for CDSS utilization were eligible for inclusion.                                Results            A total of 49 publications were included in the TLR. Studies predominantly reported on EMR-integrated CDSSs (ie, connected to an EMR database; n=32, 65%). The implementation of CDSSs varied globally, with substantial utilization in the United States and within the domain of cardio-renal-metabolic diseases. CDSSs were found to positively impact “quality assurance” (n=35, 69%) and provide “clinical benefits” (n=20, 41%), compared to usual care. Among CDSS features, treatment guidance and flagging were consistently reported as the most frequent elements for enhancing health care, followed by risk level estimation, diagnosis, education, and data export. The effectiveness of a CDSS was evaluated most frequently in primary care settings (n=34, 69%) across cardio-renal-metabolic disease areas (n=32, 65%), especially in diabetes (n=13, 26%). Studies reported CDSSs to be commonly used by a mixed group (n=27, 55%) of users including physicians, specialists, nurses or nurse practitioners, and allied health care professionals.                                Conclusions            Overall, both EMR-integrated and stand-alone CDSSs showed positive results, suggesting their benefits to health care providers and potential for successful adoption. Flagging and treatment recommendation features were commonly used in CDSSs to improve patient care; other features such as risk level estimation, diagnosis, education, and data export were tailored to specific requirements and collectively contributed to the effectiveness of health care delivery. While this TLR demonstrated that both stand-alone and EMR-integrated CDSSs were successful in achieving clinical outcomes, the heterogeneity of included studies reflects the evolving nature of this research area, underscoring the need for further longitudinal studies to elucidate aspects that may impact their adoption in real-world scenarios.",

However, the utility of CDSS in the clinic remains controversial.                                Objective            The aim is to assess the effects of CDSS integrated with British Medical Journal (BMJ) Best Practice–aided diagnosis in real-world research.                                Methods            This was a retrospective, longitudinal observational study using routinely collected clinical diagnosis data from electronic medical records. A total of 34,113 hospitalized patient records were successively selected from December 2016 to February 2019 in six clinical departments. The diagnostic accuracy of the CDSS was verified before its implementation. A self-controlled comparison was then applied to detect the effects of CDSS implementation. Multivariable logistic regression and single-group interrupted time series analysis were used to explore the effects of CDSS. The sensitivity analysis was conducted using the subgroup data from January 2018 to February 2019.                                Results            The total accuracy rates of the recommended diagnosis from CDSS were 75.46% in the first-rank diagnosis, 83.94% in the top-2 diagnosis, and 87.53% in the top-3 diagnosis in the data before CDSS implementation. Higher consistency was observed between admission and discharge diagnoses, shorter confirmed diagnosis times, and shorter hospitalization days after the CDSS implementation (all P<.001). Multivariable logistic regression analysis showed that the consistency rates after CDSS implementation (OR 1.078, 95% CI 1.015-1.144) and the proportion of hospitalization time 7 days or less (OR 1.688, 95% CI 1.592-1.789) both increased. The interrupted time series analysis showed that the consistency rates significantly increased by 6.722% (95% CI 2.433%-11.012%, P=.002) after CDSS implementation. The proportion of hospitalization time 7 days or less significantly increased by 7.837% (95% CI 1.798%-13.876%, P=.01). Similar results were obtained in the subgroup analysis.                                Conclusions            The CDSS integrated with BMJ Best Practice improved the accuracy of clinicians’ diagnoses. Shorter confirmed diagnosis times and hospitalization days were also found to be associated with CDSS implementation in retrospective real-world studies. These findings highlight the utility of artificial intelligence-based CDSS to improve diagnosis efficiency, but these results require confirmation in future randomized controlled trials.",

Objective            The aims of this study are to identify changes within dermatology departments during lockdowns, to evaluate the use of teledermatology during the COVID-19 pandemic, and to find the most frequent cutaneous manifestations associated with COVID-19.                                Methods            All IDS members (approximately 160,000 members) were asked to fill in a questionnaire sent by email. The questionnaire was available in English and was anonymous, with a compiling time of less than 5 minutes. The survey was open for 30 days (from April 24, 2020, to May 24, 2020) and it could only be filled out once.                                Results            Overall, 678 dermatologists responded to the questionnaire; of these, 334 members stated that there had been a reduction of more than 75% in daily work activity during the pandemic, 265 dermatologists worked fewer days per week, and 118 experienced telemedicine for the first time. Acrodermatitis was the most frequently observed skin manifestation (n=80), followed by urticarial rash (n=69), morbilliform rash (n=53), and purpuric manifestation (n=40). Regarding the role of teledermatology, 565 dermatologists reported an increased number of teleconsultations, and the number of melanomas diagnosed during the pandemic was practically 0 for 385 (56.8%) respondents.                                Conclusions            This survey highlights that the outbreak had a negative impact on most dermatology services, with a significant reduction in consultation time spent for patients with chronic conditions, and an increased risk of missed melanoma and nonmelanoma skin cancer diagnosis. Moreover, our study confirms earlier findings of a wide range of skin manifestations associated with COVID-19.                                Conflicts of Interest            None declared.",

      "abstract": "Background            Chronic diseases are the leading causes of death and disability. With the growing patient population and climbing health care expenditures, researchers and policy makers are seeking new approaches to improve the accessibility of health information on chronic diseases while lowering costs. Online health information sources can play a substantial role in effective patient education and health communication. However, some contradictory evidence suggests that patients with chronic conditions may not necessarily seek online health information.                                Objective            This study aims to integrate 2 theories (ie, the health belief model and social support theory) and a critical health literacy perspective to understand online health information seeking (OHIS) among patients with chronic conditions.                                Methods            We used the survey method to collect data from online chronic disease communities and groups on social media platforms. Eligible participants were consumers with at least 1 chronic condition and those who have experience with OHIS. A total of 390 valid questionnaires were collected. The partial least squares approach to structural equation modeling was employed to analyze the data.                                Results            The results suggested that perceived risk (t=3.989, P<.001) and perceived benefits (t=3.632, P<.001) significantly affected patients’ OHIS. Perceived susceptibility (t=7.743, P<.001) and perceived severity (t=8.852, P<.001) were found to influence the perceived risk of chronic diseases significantly. Informational support (t=5.761, P<.001) and emotional support (t=5.748, P<.001) also impacted the perceived benefits of online sources for patients. In addition, moderation analysis showed that critical health literacy significantly moderated the link between perceived risk and OHIS (t=3.097, P=.002) but not the relationship between perceived benefits and OHIS (t=0.288, P=.774).                                Conclusions            This study shows that the health belief model, when combined with social support theory, can predict patients’ OHIS. The perceived susceptibility and severity can effectively explain perceived risk, further predicting patients’ OHIS. Informational support and emotional support can contribute to perceived benefits, thereby positively affecting patients’ OHIS. This study also demonstrated the important negative moderating effects of critical health literacy on the association between perceived risk and OHIS.",

Participants were recruited in outpatient clinics or through advertisements and randomly assigned to a 9 month exercise programme of strength training alone (ST), aerobic training alone (AER) or both interventions combined (COMB). We used stratified block randomisation with a randomly selected block size. Researchers and caregivers were blinded to participants’ treatment group; however, participants themselves were not. Exercise interventions were conducted at community-based fitness centres. The primary outcome was absolute change in HbA1c level within and across the three groups at 3, 6 and 9 months. Secondary outcomes included changes in body composition at 9 months. Per adherence to recommended exercise protocol (PP) analysis included participants who completed at least 50% of the sessions.\nResults Among 186 individuals (ST, n=63; AER, n=58; COMB, n=65) analysed, the median (IQR) age was 59 (53–66) years, 60% were men and 83% were Asian. The mean (SD) HbA1c level at baseline was 59.6 (13.1) mmol/mol (7.6% [1.2%]). In intention-to-treat analysis, the ST group showed a significant decrease in HbA1c levels (mean [95% CI] −0.44 percentage points [−0.78, −0.12], p=0.002), while no significant change was observed in either the COMB group (−0.35 percentage points, p=0.13) or the AER group (−0.24 percentage points, p=0.10). The ST group had a greater improvement in HbA1c levels than the AER group (p=0.01). Appendicular lean mass relative to fat mass increased only in the ST group (p=0.0008), which was an independent predictor of HbA1c change (beta coefficient −7.16, p=0.01). Similar results were observed in PP analysis. Only one adverse event, in the COMB group, was considered to be possibly associated with the exercise intervention.\nConclusions/interpretation In normal-weight type 2 diabetes, strength training was superior to aerobic training alone, while no significant difference was observed between strength training and combination training for HbA1c reduction. Increased lean mass relative to decreased fat mass was an independent predictor of reduction in HbA1c level.",

      "abstract": "Background            COVID-19 vaccine hesitancy reduces vaccination rates, which is detrimental to building herd immunity and halting the spread of COVID-19 and its variations. Most researches have simply identified the reasons affecting COVID-19 vaccination reluctance without delving into its dynamics, which makes forecasting future trends difficult.                                Objective            This study aimed to examine the current COVID-19 vaccine booster hesitancy rate in Chinese adults as well as the dynamics of vaccine hesitancy and its influencing factors. The results of this study will have practical implications for policy responses in mainland China, and effective COVID-19 booster vaccination in specific populations.                                Methods            The web-based survey was completed by creating questionnaires and using a stratified random sampling method to collect information from adults (≥18 years old) among 2556 households in 4 geographical regions of China. We collected sociodemographic information, health status, awareness of COVID-19 and its vaccine, self-perceptions, trust in medical staff and vaccine developers, and so on. The odds ratios and 95% CI for the statistical associations were estimated using logistic regression models.                                Results            Overall, 6659 participants (females: n=3540, 53.2%; males: n=3119, 46.8%) responded. In total, 533 (8%; 95% CI 7.4%-8.7%) participants presented a clear hesitancy in receiving the COVID-19 booster vaccination, while 736 (11.1%; 95% CI 10.3%-11.8%) expressed hesitancy in regular booster vaccination. A higher prevalence of vaccine hesitancy in both booster vaccination and regular booster vaccination was observed among participants with a history of allergies, experiencing chronic disease, lower levels of public health prevention measures or susceptibility or benefits or self-efficiency, higher levels of severity or barriers, and lower trust in both medical staff and vaccine developers (P<.05). The females and participants with higher education levels, higher levels of barriers, lower levels of susceptibility, and lower trust in vaccine developers preferred to have attitudinal changes from acceptance to hesitancy, while people with higher education levels, lower self-report health conditions, experiencing chronic disease, history of allergies, and lower trust in medical staff and developers were all positively associated with constant COVID-19 booster hesitancy.                                Conclusions            The prevalence of COVID-19 vaccine booster hesitancy is not high in mainland China. However, there is a slight increment in hesitancy on regular booster vaccination. Conducting targeted information guidance for people with higher education levels and chronic diseases, as well as improving accessibility to booster vaccination and increasing trust in medical staff and vaccine producers may be highly effective in reducing vaccine hesitancy.",

      "abstract": "Background            Although the association between social isolation and the risk of subsequent cardiovascular disease (CVD) is well documented, most studies have only assessed social isolation at a single time point, and few studies have considered the association using repeatedly measured social isolation.                                Objective            This study aimed to examine the association between social isolation trajectories and incident CVD in a large cohort of middle-aged and older adults.                                Methods            This study used data from 4 waves (wave 1, wave 2, wave 3, and wave 4) of the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study. We defined the exposure period as from June 2011 to September 2015 (from wave 1 to wave 3) and the follow-up period as from September 2015 to March 2019 (wave 4). On the basis of the inclusion and exclusion criteria, our final analytic sample included 8422 individuals who had no CVD in the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study in waves 1 to 3 and were fully followed up in wave 4. Social isolation was ascertained using an extensively used questionnaire at 3 consecutive, biennial time points from waves 1 to 3, and individuals were assigned to 3 predefined social isolation trajectories based on their scores at each wave (consistently low, fluctuating, and consistently high). Incident CVD included self-reported physician-diagnosed heart disease and stroke combined. Cox proportional hazard models estimated the associations of social isolation trajectories with risks of incident CVD, adjusting for demographics, health behaviors, and health conditions.                                Results            Of the 8422 participants (mean age 59.76, SD 10.33 years at baseline), 4219 (50.09%) were male. Most of the participants (5267/8422, 62.54%) had consistently low social isolation over time and 16.62% (1400/8422) of the participants had consistently high social isolation over the exposure period. During the 4-year follow-up, 746 incident CVDs occurred (heart disease: 450 cases and stroke: 336 cases). Compared with individuals with consistently low social isolation, those with fluctuating social isolation (adjusted hazard ratio 1.27, 95% CI 1.01-1.59) and consistently high social isolation (adjusted hazard ratio 1.45, 95% CI 1.13-1.85) had higher risks for incident CVD after adjusting for demographics (ie, age, sex, residence, and educational level), health behaviors (ie, smoking status and drinking status), and health conditions (ie, BMI; history of diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, chronic kidney disease; use of diabetes medications, hypertension medications, and lipid-lowering therapy; and depressive symptoms scores).                                Conclusions            In this cohort study, middle-aged and older adults with fluctuating and consistently high social isolation exposure had higher risks of the onset of CVD than those without the exposure. The findings suggest that routine social isolation screenings and efforts to improve social connectedness merit increased attention for preventing CVD among middle-aged and older adults.",

      "abstract": "This study aimed to evaluate which aspects of moral disengagement (MD), empathy, and representations of the victim’s experience (VER) could be predictors of cyberbullying (CB). One hundred and eight-nine students (11–17 years old) completed 3 self-report questionnaires: An MD scale, an empathy scale, and a CB questionnaire. In relation to the personal experience of CB, four groups were identified: Victim, bully, bully/victim, and no experience with CB. The linear bivariate correlation analysis shows correlations between empathy and VER, between empathy and MD, and between MD and VER. A multinomial logistic regression identified which predictors could increase a subject’s probability of belonging to one of the four groups regarding the personal experience of CB (victim, bully, bully/victim, no experience). Findings highlighted that low cognitive empathy might increase the probability for a student to belong to the bullies’ group, rather than the victims’ group. Furthermore, low perception of the consequences of CB on the victim might increase the probability of belonging to the bully, bully/victim, and no experience groups. Then, a high score in the diffusion of responsibility was a significant predictor of belonging to the victim group rather than the no experience group. Results from this study confirm the need for preventive measures against CB, including the empowerment of cognitive empathy, decreasing the diffusion of responsibility, and increasing the awareness of the consequences of CB on the victim.",

      "abstract": "Background            The COVID-19 pandemic has had the greatest impact in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) by disproportionately harming older adults and heightening social isolation and loneliness (SIL). Living in close quarters with others and in need of around-the-clock assistance, interactions with older adults, which were previously in person, have been replaced by virtual chatting using information and communication technologies (ICTs). ICT applications such as FaceTime, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams video chatting have been overwhelmingly used by families to maintain residents’ social capital and subsequently reduce their SIL.                                Objective            Because of the lack of substantive knowledge on this ever-increasing form of social communication, this systematic review intends to synthesize the effects of ICT interventions to address SIL among residents in LTCFs during the COVID-19 period.                                Methods            We will include studies published in Chinese, English, and French from December 2019 onwards. Beyond the traditional search strategy approach, 4 of the 12 electronic databases to be queried will be in Chinese. We will include quantitative and intervention studies as well as qualitative and mixed methods designs. Using a 2-person approach, the principal investigator and one author will blindly screen eligible articles, extract data, and assess risk of bias. In order to improve the first round of screening, a pilot-tested algorithm will be used. Disagreements will be resolved through discussion with a third author. Results will be presented as structured summaries of the included studies. We plan to conduct a meta-analysis if sufficient data are available.                                Results            A total of 1803 articles have been retrieved to date. Queries of the Chinese databases are ongoing. The systematic review and subsequent manuscript will be completed by the fall of 2022.                                Conclusions            ICT applications have become a promising avenue to reduce SIL by providing a way to maintain communication between LTCF residents and their families and will certainly remain in the post–COVID-19 period. This review will investigate and describe context-pertinent and high-quality programs and initiatives to inform, at the macro level, policy makers and researchers, frontline managers, and families. These methods will remain relevant in the post–COVID-19 era.                                International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID)            DERR1-10.2196/36269",

However, the high prevalence of mental health problems means that the manual review of complex patient records to make proactive care decisions is not feasible in practice. Therefore, we developed a machine learning model that uses electronic health records to continuously monitor patients for risk of a mental health crisis over a period of 28 days. The model achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.797 and an area under the precision-recall curve of 0.159, predicting crises with a sensitivity of 58% at a specificity of 85%. A follow-up 6-month prospective study evaluated our algorithm’s use in clinical practice and observed predictions to be clinically valuable in terms of either managing caseloads or mitigating the risk of crisis in 64% of cases. To our knowledge, this study is the first to continuously predict the risk of a wide range of mental health crises and to explore the added value of such predictions in clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "AbstractIn the era of the Internet of Things (IoT), the transmission of medical reports in the form of scan images for collaborative diagnosis is vital for any telemedicine network. In this context, ensuring secure transmission and communication is necessary to protect medical data to maintain privacy. To address such privacy concerns and secure medical images against cyberattacks, this research presents a robust hybrid encryption framework that integrates quantum, and classical cryptographic methods. The proposed framework not only secure medical data against cyber threats but also protects the secret security keys. Initially, a Quantum Key Distribution (QKD) is employed to generate a shared key, which is then used to secure the symmetric keys via One-Time Pad (OTP) encryption. Next, bit-planes are extracted from each color component. The rows and columns of the extracted bit-planes are scrambled using random sequences which are generated by a 6D hyperchaotic Chen system and the Ikeda map. To further increase confusion in the original data, multiple-step pixel scrambling operations such as pixel shuffling, pixel value shuffling, and rotational and flipping operations are implemented. After the confusion phase, a combination of affine transformations with non-linear functions, Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) with complex modulation, Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT) with random phase modulation, bilinear transformation, and nonlinear polynomial mapping are employed to create diffusion in the scrambled components. These multiple encryption operations aim to maximize randomness in the final ciphertext image. Additionally, to reduce computational complexity, only the Most Significant Bit-Planes (MSBs) are encrypted, as they contain more than 94% of the plaintext information. Several experimental results and analyses are conducted to assess the proposed encryption framework, including entropy analysis, key sensitivity analysis, correlation analysis lossless analysis, and histogram analysis. Furthermore, the framework is tested against various cyberattacks such as brute-force attacks, clipping attacks, and noise attacks on the ciphertext images, to demonstrate its resilience against such threats.",

Interventions with mHealth included have shown a similar efficacy and safety to conventional programs with improvements in access and adherence. However, questions remain regarding the successful wider implementation of digital-supported programs. By applying the Reach-Effectiveness-Adoption-Implementation-Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to a systematic review and meta-analysis, this review aims to evaluate the extent to which these programs report on RE-AIM dimensions and associated indicators.                              Methods                This review extends our previous systematic review and meta-analysis that investigated the effectiveness of digital-supported programs for patients with coronary artery disease. Citation searches were performed on the 27 studies of the systematic review to identify linked publications that reported data for RE-AIM dimensions. All included studies and, where relevant, any additional publications, were coded using an adapted RE-AIM extraction tool. Discrepant codes were discussed amongst reviewers to gain consensus. Data were analysed to assess reporting on indicators related to each of the RE-AIM dimensions, and average overall reporting rates for each dimension were calculated.                              Results                Searches found an additional nine publications. Across 36 publications that were linked to the 27 studies, 24 (89%) of the studies were interventions solely delivered at home. The average reporting rates for RE-AIM dimensions were highest for effectiveness (75%) and reach (67%), followed by adoption (54%), implementation (36%) and maintenance (11%). Eleven (46%) studies did not describe relevant characteristics of their participants or of staff involved in the intervention; most studies did not describe unanticipated consequences of the intervention; the ongoing cost of intervention implementation and maintenance; information on intervention fidelity; long-term follow-up outcomes, or program adaptation in other settings.                              Conclusions                Through the application of the RE-AIM framework to a systematic review we found most studies failed to report on key indicators. Failing to report these indicators inhibits the ability to address the enablers and barriers required to achieve optimal intervention implementation in wider settings and populations. Future studies should consider alternative hybrid trial designs to enable reporting of implementation indicators to improve the translation of research evidence into routine practice, with special consideration given to the long-term sustainability of program effects as well as corresponding ongoing costs.

      "abstract": "Abstract                Background                The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR), introduced in 2009, has the potential to provide a comprehensive understanding of the determinants of implementation-effectiveness of health service innovations. Although the CFIR has been increasingly used in recent years to examine factors influencing telehealth implementation, no comprehensive reviews currently exist on the scope of knowledge gained exclusively from applications of the CFIR to telehealth implementation initiatives. This review sought to address this gap.                              Methods                PRISMA-ScR criteria were used to inform a scoping review of the literature. Five academic databases (PUBMED, PROQUEST, SCIDIRECT, CINAHL, and WoS) were searched for eligible sources of evidence from 01.01.2010 through 12.31.2021. The initial search yielded a total of 18,388 records, of which, 64 peer-reviewed articles met the inclusion criteria for the review. Included articles were reviewed in full to extract data, and data collected were synthesized to address the review questions.                              Results                Most included articles were published during or after 2020 (64%), and a majority (77%) were qualitative or mixed-method studies seeking to understand barriers or facilitators to telehealth implementation using the CFIR. There were few comparative- or implementation-effectiveness studies containing outcome measures (5%). The database search however, revealed a growing number of protocols for implementation-effectiveness studies published since 2020. Most articles (91%) reported the CFIR Inner Setting domain (e.g., leadership engagement) to have a predominant influence over telehealth implementation success. By comparison, few articles (14%) reported the CFIR Outer Setting domain (e.g., telehealth policies) to have notable influence. While more (63%) telehealth initiatives were focused on specialty (vs primary) care, a vast majority (78%) were focused on clinical practice over medical education, healthcare administration, or population health.                              Conclusions                Organized provider groups have historically paid considerable attention to advocating for telehealth policy (Outer Setting) reform. However, results suggest that for effective telehealth implementation, provider groups need to refocus their efforts on educating individual providers on the complex inter-relationships between Inner Setting constructs and telehealth implementation-effectiveness. On a separate note, the growth in implementation-effectiveness study protocols since 2020, suggests that additional outcome measures may soon be available, to provide a more nuanced understanding of the determinants of effective telehealth implementation based on the CFIR domains and constructs.",

      "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundDue to striking disparities in the implementation of healthcare innovations, it is imperative that researchers and practitioners can meaningfully use implementation determinant frameworks to understand why disparities exist in access, receipt, use, quality, or outcomes of healthcare. Our prior work documented and piloted the first published adaptation of an existing implementation determinant framework with health equity domains to create the Health Equity Implementation Framework. We recommended integrating these three health equity domains to existing implementation determinant frameworks: (1) culturally relevant factors of recipients, (2) clinical encounter or patient-provider interaction, and (3) societal context (including but not limited to social determinants of health). This framework was developed for healthcare and clinical practice settings. Some implementation teams have begun using the Health Equity Implementation Framework in their evaluations and asked for more guidance.MethodsWe completed a consensus process with our authorship team to clarify steps to incorporate a health equity lens into an implementation determinant framework.ResultsWe describe steps to integrate health equity domains into implementation determinant frameworks for implementation research and practice. For each step, we compiled examples or practical tools to assist implementation researchers and practitioners in applying those steps. For each domain, we compiled definitions with supporting literature, showcased an illustrative example, and suggested sample quantitative and qualitative measures.ConclusionIncorporating health equity domains within implementation determinant frameworks may optimize the scientific yield and equity of implementation efforts by assessing and ideally addressing implementation and equity barriers simultaneously. These practical guidance and tools provided can assist implementation researchers and practitioners to concretely capture and understand barriers and facilitators to implementation disparities.",

Methods                Microsimulation models were created in R using a synthetic sample based on primary data from 63 subjects enrolled in a pilot study of a smartphone application (App), Diabetes Pal compared to a nurse-based telemedicine strategy (Nurse). For comparability, the SMART and an RCT design were constructed to allow comparison of four (embedded) adaptive interventions (AIs).                              Results                In the base case scenario, the SMART has similar overall mean expected HbA1c and cost per subject compared with RCT, for sample size of n = 100 over 10,000 simulations. SMART has lower (better) standard deviations of the mean expected HbA1c per AI, and higher efficiency of choosing the correct AI across various sample sizes. The differences between SMART and RCT become apparent as sample size decreases. For both trial designs, the threshold value at which a subject was deemed to have been responsive at an intermediate point in the trial had an optimal choice (i.e., the sensitivity curve had a U-shape). SMART design dominates the RCT, in the overall mean HbA1c (lower value) when the threshold value is close to optimal.

      "abstract": "IntroductionTraditional methods for obtaining outcomes for patients after acute stroke are resource-intensive. This study aimed to examine the feasibility, reliability, cost, and acceptability of collecting outcomes after acute stroke with a short message service (SMS)-text messaging program.MethodsPatients were enrolled in an SMS-text messaging program at acute stroke hospitalization discharge. Participants were prompted to complete assessments including the modified Rankin scale (mRS) and Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement (PROM) Information System Global-10 at 30, 60, and 90 days postdischarge via SMS-text. Agreement and cost of SMS-text data collection were compared to those obtained from traditional follow-up methods (via phone or in the clinic). Participant satisfaction was surveyed upon program conclusion.ResultsOf the 350 patients who agreed to receive SMS texts, 40.5% responded to one or more assessments. Assessment responders were more likely to have English listed as their preferred language (p = 0.009), have a shorter length of hospital stay (p = 0.01), lower NIH stroke scale upon admission (p &lt; 0.001), and be discharged home (p &lt; 0.001) as compared to nonresponders. Weighted Cohen’s kappa revealed that the agreement between SMS texting and traditional methods was almost perfect for dichotomized (good vs. poor) (κ = 0.8) and ordinal levels of the mRS score (κ = 0.8). Polychoric correlations revealed a significant association for PROM scores (ρ = 0.4, p &lt; 0.01 and ρ = 0.4, p &lt; 0.01). A cost equation showed that gathering outcomes via SMS texting would be less costly than phone follow-up for cohorts with more than 181 patients. Nearly all participants (91%) found the program acceptable and not burdensome (94%), and most (53%) felt it was helpful. Poststroke outcome data collection via SMS texting is feasible, reliable, low-cost, and acceptable. Reliability was higher for functional outcomes as compared to PROMs.ConclusionsWhile further validation is required, our findings suggest that SMS texting is a feasible method for gathering outcomes after stroke at scale to evaluate the efficacy of acute stroke treatments.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundCOVID-19 pandemic resulted in unprecedented global health challenges. Rwanda identified its first COVID-19 case on March 14, 2020 and subsequently introduced Home-Base Care (HBC) Program in August 2020 following community transmission of the virus and to alleviate logistical and financial strain on the healthcare system. Cases and contacts eligible for HBC were remotely supported by WelTel, an SMS-based mHealth intervention that was successfully implemented before for HIV epidemic in Rwanda. Enrolled cases and contacts were supported and monitored dailyviatheir cell and/or mobile phones until they complete isolation/quarantine period. This study explored the rationale, perspectives, and experiences of key informants (KIs) during the implementation WelTel's mHealth tool for HBC in Rwanda.MethodsSemi-structured one-on-one virtual interviews were conducted with KIs in this qualitative study. The KIs were classified into 2 major categories: (A) Senior staff including policymakers, directors, and senior managers; (B) Technical teams including case managers, and other staff supporting the implementation of WelTel (e.g., IT staff). Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed in NVivo. Thematic analysis was conducted using a hybrid approach. A topic guide was developed using the Modified Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research and feedback from local stakeholders.Results7 KIs were interviewed. Five themes emerged following thematic analysis including: SMS-Based mHealth for Home-Isolation; Facilitators for Intervention Adoption; Barriers for Intervention Adoption; Infection prevention and control for Home-Isolation; and SMS-Based mHealth for Future Pandemics and Epidemics. Based on interviews, strong political commitment and advanced digital infrastructure were major facilitators for adopting WelTel for HBC. A major barrier to adopting WelTel was identified as technical-based issues. This was followed by local communication culture. All participates agreed on the significance of using WelTel to improve access and adherence to infection prevention and control measures, understand transmission dynamics, and inform public health decision-making regarding HBC.ConclusionsRwanda successfully adopted WelTel for supporting and monitoring COVID-19 cases and contacts in home-isolation and the implementation was instrumental to the country's effort to manage the pandemic. Experiences and perspectives of cases and contacts enrolled into WelTel must be explored to understand the appropriateness and effectiveness of the intervention.",

This is partly due to conceptual and methodological shortcomings. In order to overcome these problems and to guide further research, we present a taxonomy of social relationships and a causal process model. Social integration, cognitive social support and behavioral social support are distinguished and related to personality, stress, coping and the pathogenic process. In the causal model we propose that social support is depicted both as mediating the effects of stress on illness as well as directly affecting illness. A meta analysis was conducted that related social support and social integration to morbidity and mortality based on eighty empirical studies, including more than 60,000 subjects. Data subsets revealed disparate patterns of results that give rise to intriguing theoretical questions. Evidently, social support operates in complex ways. Several causal models are specified which represent alternative pathways of social support processes. Where social support was associated with less illness, a direct effect model was proposed. In cases where more support was seemingly paradoxically associated with illness it is assumed that a mobilization of support has taken place. In conclusion, some recent research examples that help illustrate future directions untangling the social support-illness relationship are presented.",

      "abstract": "Objective: The aim of this study was to assess the reach, acceptability, utility, and engagement with the apps that were used in the MEDication reminder APPlications (apps) to improve medication adherence in Coronary Heart Disease (MedApp-CHD) study, a randomised clinical trial to improve medication adherence, using a mixed-methods approach. Methods: The MedApp-CHD study randomised 163 patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) to one of three groups: (i) usual care (n = 56), (ii) a basic medication reminder app (n = 54), or (iii) an advanced medication reminder app (n = 53). For this mixed-methods evaluation, the data sources included patient screening logs, feedback questionnaires collected at three-month follow-up, focus groups discussions, and analytical data from the app software. Results: Ninety-four percent (98/104) of participants who received a medication reminder app completed the three-month feedback questionnaire and 15 participated in the focus group discussions. The themes that were identified included that participants (i) found the medication reminders useful in reminding them to take the medications on the correct time every day, (ii) liked having the medication list as an easily-accessible record of medications’ names and dosages, (iii) reported being likely to continue to use the apps after the study completion, (iv) would be likely to recommend the apps to their family and friends, and (v) those who used the clinical measurements feature found it useful as a tool to track and graph the blood pressure and glucose levels over time (especially those with diabetes and/or hypertension). In addition, analytical data from the app software demonstrated that the participants used the medication-related features more than the clinical measurements feature. Furthermore, data from the patient screening logs showed that the main reason for exclusion, other than not meeting the CHD criteria, was not having a suitable smartphone, and those that were excluded for this reason were older and had a higher proportion of females than those enrolled in the study. Conclusion: This study provides important insights regarding the features that are most useful in apps that aim to improve medication adherence. This mixed-methods evaluation suggests that, currently, young male patients with CHD are more likely to use such apps, that the apps were well-accepted and useful in reminding the patients to take the medications, and that the patients were engaged in regularly using the apps.",

      "abstract": "AbstractDigital health applications (apps) have the potential to improve health behaviors and outcomes. We aimed to examine the effectiveness of a consumer web-based app linked to primary care electronic health records (EHRs). CONNECT was a multicenter randomized controlled trial involving patients with or at risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD) recruited from primary care (Clinical Trial registration ACTRN12613000715774). Intervention participants received an interactive app which was pre-populated and refreshed with EHR risk factor data, diagnoses and, medications. Interactive risk calculators, motivational messages and lifestyle goal tracking were also included. Control group received usual health care. Primary outcome was adherence to guideline-recommended medications (≥80% of days covered for blood pressure (BP) and statin medications). Secondary outcomes included attainment of risk factor targets and eHealth literacy. In total, 934 patients were recruited; mean age 67.6 (±8.1) years. At 12 months, the proportion with >80% days covered with recommended medicines was low overall and there was no difference between the groups (32.8% vs. 29.9%; relative risk [RR] 1.07 [95% CI, 0.88–1.20] p = 0.49). There was borderline improvement in the proportion meeting BP and LDL targets in intervention vs. control (17.1% vs. 12.1% RR 1.40 [95% CI, 0.97–2.03] p = 0.07). The intervention was associated with increased attainment of physical activity targets (87.0% intervention vs. 79.7% control, p = 0.02) and e-health literacy scores (72.6% intervention vs. 64.0% control, p = 0.02). In conclusion, a consumer app integrated with primary health care EHRs was not effective in increasing medication adherence. Borderline improvements in risk factors and modest behavior changes were observed.",

The programme did not have any specific mental health component.OutcomesDepression scores at 6 months measured using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). Treatment effect across subgroups was measured using log-binomial regression model for the binary outcome (depressed/not depressed, where depressed is any score of PHQ-9 ≥5) with treatment, subgroup and treatment by subgroup interaction as fixed effects.ResultsDepression scores at 6 months were lower in the intervention group compared with the control group, mean difference 1.9 (95% CI 1.5 to 2.4, p<0.0001). The frequency of mild or greater depressive symptoms (PHQ-9 scores≥5) at 6 months was 21/333 (6.3%) in the intervention group and 86/350 (24.6%) in the control group (relative risk (RR) 0.26, 95% CI 0.16 to 0.40, p<0.001). This proportional reduction in depressive symptoms was similar across groups defined by age, sex, education, body mass index, physical activity, current smoking, current drinking and history of depression, diabetes and hypertension. In particular, the rates of PHQ-9 ≥5 among people with a history of depression were 4/44 (9.1%) vs 29/62 (46.8%) in intervention vs control (RR 0.19, 95% CI 0.07 to 0.51, p<0.001), and were 17/289 (5.9%) vs 57/288 (19.8%) among others (RR 0.30, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.50, p<0.001).ConclusionsAmong people with CHD, a cardiac support programme delivered via mobile phone text messaging was associated with fewer symptoms of mild-to-moderate depression at 6 months in the treatment group compared with controls.Trial registration numberACTRN12611000161921.",

      "abstract": "Background: COVID-19 pandemic lockdowns led to the closure of most in-person pulmonary rehabilitation programs in Australia. Text message programs are effective for delivering health support to aid the self-management of people with chronic diseases. This study aimed to evaluate the implementation of a six-month pre-post text message support program (Texting for Wellness: Lung Support Service), and the enablers and barriers to its adoption and implementation. Methods: This mixed-methods pre-post study used the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework to evaluate the Texting for Wellness: Lung Support Service, which is an automated six-month text message support program that included evidence-based lifestyle, disease-self management and COVID-19-related information. Reach was measured by the proportion of participant enrolments and demographic characteristics. Adoption enablers and barriers were measured using text message response data and a user feedback survey (five-point Likert scale questions and free-text responses). Implementation was evaluated to determine fidelity including text message delivery data, opt-outs, and intervention costs to promote and deliver the program. Results: In total, 707/1940 (36.4%) participants enrolled and provided e-consent, with a mean age (±standard deviation) of 67.9 (±9.2) years old (range: 23–87 years). Of participants who provided feedback, (326/707) most ‘agreed’ or ‘strongly agreed’ that the text messages were easy to understand (98.5%), helpful them to feel supported (92.3%) and helped them to manage their health (88.0%). Factors influencing engagement included a feeling of support and reducing loneliness, and its usefulness for health self-management. Messages were delivered as planned (93.7% successfully delivered) with minimal participant dropouts (92.2% retention rate) and low cost ($AUD24.48/participant for six months). A total of 2263 text message replies were received from 496 unique participants. There were no reported adverse events. Conclusion: Texting for Wellness: Lung Support Service was implemented quickly, had a broad reach, with high retention and acceptability among participants. The program was low cost and required minimal staff oversight, which may facilitate future implementation. Further research is needed to evaluate the efficacy of text messaging for the improvement of lung health outcomes and strategies for long-term pulmonary rehabilitation program maintenance.",

Many patients report difficulties in tapering opioid medications, necessitating supporting interventions. This protocol describes a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) to investigate the acceptability, feasibility and potential efficacy of a mobile health intervention to improve the opioid tapering self-efficacy of patients with chronic non-cancer pain.Methods and analysisThe trial will be a single-blind (clinician, data collector and statistician-blinded) pilot RCT with two parallel arms. Forty adult patients with chronic non-cancer pain who are voluntarily reducing their prescribed opioid medications under medical guidance will be recruited from two tertiary pain clinics (Start date 25 August 2021). Participants will be randomly assigned to an intervention or control group. Both groups will receive usual care, including multidisciplinary pain management. In addition to usual care, the intervention group will receive a short informational and testimonial video about opioid tapering and will receive two specifically text messages per day for 28 days. The intervention is codesigned with patients and clinicians to provide evidence-based informational, motivational and emotional support to patients with chronic pain to taper opioid medications. Feasibility of the intervention and a future definitive RCT will be evaluated by measuring patient acceptability, delivery of the intervention, rates and reasons of exclusions and drop-outs, completion rates and missing data in the study questionnaires, and obtaining estimates for sample size determination. Potential efficacy will be evaluated by comparing changes in opioid tapering self-efficacy between the two groups.Ethics and disseminationThe study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Northern Sydney Local Health District (Australia).

All participants in the intervention arm identified the tailored text messages as useful in supporting dietary self-management. In the control group, 27 (69%) reported the non-tailored text messages were useful in supporting change. Intervention group participants reported that the telehealth programme delivery methods were practical and able to be integrated into their lifestyle. Participants viewed the intervention as an acceptable, personalised alternative to face-face clinic consultations, and were satisfied with the frequency of contact.ConclusionsThis telehealth-delivered dietary coaching programme is an acceptable intervention which appears feasible for supporting dietary self-management in stage 3–4 CKD. A larger-scale randomised controlled trial is needed to evaluate the efficacy of the coaching programme on clinical and patient-reported outcomes.Trial registration numberACTRN12616001212448; Results.",

      "abstract": "Abstract        Background: Low medication adherence is known to pose a great risk of poor treatment outcomes among patients with chronic diseases. Recently, mobile applications (apps) have been recognized as effective interventions, enabling patients to adhere to their prescriptions. This study aimed to establish the effectiveness of mobile app interventions for medication adherence and the affecting features and dropout rates by focusing on randomized controlled trials (RCTs).Method: This study conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of mobile app interventions targeting medication adherence in patients with chronic diseases. Electronic searches of eight databases were conducted on April 21, 2023. Comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA) software was used to estimate the standardized mean difference (SMD) of pooled outcomes, odds ratios (ORs), and confidence intervals (CIs). Subgroup analysis was applied to investigate and compare the effectiveness of the interventional strategies and their features. The risk of bias of the included RCTs was evaluated by applying the risk of bias (ROB) tool. Publication bias was also examined using the fail-safe N method.Results: Twenty-nine studies with 2,684 participants were included. The meta-analysis findings showed a positive impact of mobile apps on improving medication adherence (SMD = 0.386, OR = 2.34). The subgroup analysis results revealed greater effectiveness of interventions using interactive strategies (SMD=1.367, OR=2.678), context-aware reminders (SMD = 0.664, OR = 2.452), data-sharing (SMD = 0.321, OR = 2.449), and pill dispenser (OR = 2.436).Conclusion: The current study found that mobile interventions had significant effects on medication adherence improvement. Subgroup analysis showed that the roles of stakeholders in health providers’ interactions with patients and developers’ understanding of patients and disease characteristics are critical. Future studies should incorporate advanced technology reflecting acceptability and the needs of the target population.",

The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of using a drug management application on drug adherence and outcomes in polypharmacy older adults.Methods In this randomized clinical trial study conducted in 2022, 192 Iranian older adults with polypharmacy were selected according to the inclusion criteria and allocated to case and control groups using the block randomization method. The data collection tools included a demographic questionnaire, drug outcome questionnaire, and Morisky Medication Adherence Scale. The intervention was done using a drug management application for 8 weeks. The collected data were entered into the SPSS software version 22 and analyzed using descriptive (frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation) and inferential (Chi-square, Fisher’s exact test, independent t-test) statistics.Results The case and control groups were homogeneous in terms of demographic variables and drug adherence level before the intervention. A significant difference was found in the drug adherence level after using the app (p < 0.001). Moreover, a significant difference was found in drug outcomes, including re-hospitalization due to disease aggravation, re-hospitalization due to medication error, falling, hypo or hypertension, and hypo or hyperglycemia, and medication use accuracy between the groups after the intervention (p < 0.05).Conclusion The results showed that using a drug management application that meets the specifications of older adults can improve drug adherence and reduce the adverse outcomes of drug use.",

      "abstract": "Background            Physiological signals such as heart rate and electrodermal activity can provide insight into an individual’s mental state, which are invaluable information for mental health care. Using recordings of physiological signals from wearable devices in the wild can facilitate objective monitoring of symptom severity and evaluation of treatment progress.                                Objective            We designed a study to evaluate the feasibility of predicting obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) events from physiological signals recorded using wrist-worn devices in the wild. Here, we present an analysis plan for the study to document our a priori hypotheses and increase the robustness of the findings of our planned study.                                Methods            In total, 18 children and adolescents aged between 8 and 16 years were included in this study. Nine outpatients with an OCD diagnosis were recruited from a child and adolescent mental health center. Nine youths without a psychiatric diagnosis were recruited from the catchment area. Patients completed a clinical interview to assess OCD severity, types of OCD, and number of OCD symptoms in the clinic. Participants wore a biosensor on their wrist for up to 8 weeks in their everyday lives. Patients were asked to press an event tag button on the biosensor when they were stressed by OCD symptoms. Participants without a psychiatric diagnosis were asked to press this button whenever they felt really scared. Before and after the 8-week observation period, participants wore the biosensor under controlled conditions of rest and stress in the clinic. Features are extracted from 4 different physiological signals within sliding windows to predict the distress event logged by participants during data collection. We will test the prediction models within participants across time and multiple participants. Model selection and estimation using 2-layer cross-validation are outlined for both scenarios.                                Results            Participants were included between December 2021 and December 2022. Participants included 10 female and 8 male participants with an even sex distribution between groups. Patients were aged between 10 and 16 years, and adolescents without a psychiatric diagnosis were between the ages of 8 and 16 years. Most patients had moderate to moderate to severe OCD, except for 1 patient with mild OCD.                                Conclusions            The strength of the planned study is the investigation of predictions of OCD events in the wild. Major challenges of the study are the inherent noise of in-the-wild data and the lack of contextual knowledge associated with the recorded signals. This preregistered analysis plan discusses in detail how we plan to address these challenges and may help reduce interpretation bias of the upcoming results. If the obtained results from this study are promising, we will be closer to automated detection of OCD events outside of clinical experiments. This is an important tool for the assessment and treatment of OCD in youth.

      "abstract": "IntroductionObsessive-compulsive disorders (OCD) are marked by distress, negative emotions, mental processes and behaviors that are reflected in physiological signals such as heart rate, electrodermal activity, and skin temperature. Continuous monitoring of physiological signals associated with OCD symptoms may make measures of OCD more objective and facilitate close monitoring of prodromal symptoms, treatment progress and risk of relapse. Thus, we explored the feasibility of capturing OCD events in the real world using an unobtrusive wrist worn biosensor and machine learning models.MethodsNine adolescents (ages 10–17 years) with mild to moderate-severe OCD were recruited from child and adolescent mental health services. Participants were asked to wear the biosensor in the lab during conditions of rest and exposure to OCD symptom-triggering stimuli and for up to 8 weeks in their everyday lives and register OCD events. We explored the relationships among physiological data, registered OCD events, age, OCD symptom severity and symptom types. In the machine learning models, we considered detection of OCD events as a binary classification problem. A nested cross-validation strategy with either random 10-folds, leave-one-subject-out, or leave-week(s)-out in both layers was used. We compared the performance of four models: logistic regression, random forest (RF), feedforward neural networks, and mixed-effect random forest (MERF). To explore the ability of the models to detect OCD events in new patients, we assessed the performance of participant-based generalized models. To explore the ability of models to detect OCD events in future, unseen data from the same patients, we compared the performance of temporal generalized models trained on multiple patients with personalized models trained on single patients.ResultsEight of the nine participants collected biosensor signals totaling 2, 405 h and registered 1, 639 OCD events. Better performance was obtained when generalizing across time compared to across patients. Generalized temporal models trained on multiple patients were found to perform better than personalized models trained on single patients. RF and MERF models outperformed the other models in terms of accuracy in all cross-validation strategies, reaching 70% accuracy in random and participant cross-validation.ConclusionOur pilot results suggest that it is possible to detect OCD episodes in the everyday lives of adolescents using physiological signals captured with a wearable biosensor. Large scale studies are needed to train and test models capable of detecting and predicting episodes.Clinical trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov: NCT05064527, registered October 1, 2021.",

Methods                  A single-blind (assessor and statistician), randomized controlled trial with economic analysis and process evaluation will be conducted. A total of 304 people with non-specific LBP of less than 12 weeks will be enrolled and randomly allocated either to TEXT4myBACK intervention or control groups. The TEXT4myBACK intervention group will receive 4 semi-personalized text messages per week providing advice, motivation, and information about LBP, physical activity, sleep, mood, use of care, and medication during 12 weeks. The control group will receive 1 text message with a link to a LBP and diet online information package. Outcomes will be assessed at baseline and 3, 6, and 12 months. The primary outcome will be function assessed with the Patient-Specific Functional Scale. Secondary outcomes will include pain intensity, physical activity participation, sedentary behavior, global impression of change, health-related quality of life, and eHealth literacy. Data on demographic characteristics, smallest worthwhile change (ie, smallest function scored needed to be achieved at the end of the intervention to consider it to be worthwhile), health care utilization, and adverse events (ie, any new health issue that occurs during participation in the study) will be collected. An economic and process evaluation will also be conducted.

Of the 1611 participants with polypharmacy, 569 reported at least one fall within the past 2 years (rate: 175 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI 161 to 190), and of the 3602 participants without polypharmacy 875 reported at least one fall (rate: 121 per 1000 person-years, 95% CI 113 to 129). The rate of falls was 21% higher in people with polypharmacy compared with people without polypharmacy (adjusted IRR 1.21, 95% CI 1.11 to 1.31). Using ≥4 drugs threshold the rate of falls was 18% higher in people with polypharmacy compared with people without (adjusted IRR 1.18, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.28), whereas using ≥10 drugs threshold polypharmacy was associated with a 50% higher rate of falls (adjusted IRR 1.50, 95% CI 1.34 to 1.67).ConclusionsWe found almost one-third of the total population using five or more drugs, which was significantly associated with 21% increased rate of falls over a 2-year period. Further exploration of the effects of these complex drug combinations in the real world with a detailed standardised assessment of polypharmacy is greatly required along with pragmatic studies in primary care, which will help inform whether the threshold for a detailed medication review should be lowered.",

The prevailing model of telephone outreach is usually limited in scope and operationally burdensome.ObjectiveTo determine whether a 30-day automated texting program to support primary care patients after hospital discharge is associated with reductions in the use of acute care resources.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsThis cohort study used a difference-in-differences approach at 2 academic primary care practices in Philadelphia from January 27 through August 27, 2021. Established patients of the study practices who were 18 years or older, were discharged from an acute care hospitalization, and received the usual transitional care management telephone call were eligible for the study. At the intervention practice, 604 discharges were eligible and 430 (374 patients, of whom 46 had &amp;gt;1 discharge) were enrolled in the intervention. At the control practice, 953 patients met eligibility criteria. The study period, including before and after the intervention, ran from August 27, 2020, through August 27, 2021.ExposurePatients received automated check-in text messages from their primary care practice on a tapering schedule during the 30 days after discharge. Any needs identified by the automated messaging platform were escalated to practice staff for follow-up via an electronic medical record inbox.Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe primary study outcome was any emergency department (ED) visit or readmission within 30 days of discharge. Secondary outcomes included any ED visit or any readmission within 30 days, analyzed separately, and 30- and 60-day mortality. Analyses were based on intention to treat.ResultsA total of 1885 patients (mean [SD] age, 63.2 [17.3] years; 1101 women [58.4%]) representing 2617 discharges (447 before and 604 after the intervention at the intervention practice; 613 before and 953 after the intervention at the control practice) were included in the analysis. The adjusted odds ratio (aOR) for any use of acute care resources after implementation of the intervention was 0.59 (95% CI, 0.38-0.92). The aOR for an ED visit was 0.77 (95% CI, 0.45-1.30) and for a readmission was 0.45 (95% CI, 0.23-0.86). The aORs for death within 30 and 60 days of discharge at the intervention practice were 0.92 (95% CI, 0.23-3.61) and 0.63 (95% CI, 0.21-1.85), respectively.Conclusions and RelevanceThe findings of this cohort study suggest that an automated texting program to support primary care patients after hospital discharge was associated with significant reductions in use of acute care resources. This patient-centered approach may serve as a model for improving postdischarge care.",

      "abstract": "Background            Telehealth represents an opportunity for Australia to harness the power of technology to redesign the way health care is delivered. The potential benefits of telehealth include increased accessibility to care, productivity gains for health providers and patients through reduced travel, potential for cost savings, and an opportunity to develop culturally appropriate services that are more sensitive to the needs of special populations. The uptake of telehealth has been hindered at times by clinician reluctance and policies that preclude metropolitan populations from accessing telehealth services.                                Objective            This study aims to investigate if telehealth reduces health system costs compared with traditional service models and to identify the scenarios in which cost savings can be realized.                                Methods            A scoping review was undertaken to meet the study aims. Initially, literature searches were conducted using broad terms for telehealth and economics to identify economic evaluation literature in telehealth. The investigators then conducted an expert focus group to identify domains where telehealth could reduce health system costs, followed by targeted literature searches for corresponding evidence.                                Results            The cost analyses reviewed provided evidence that telehealth reduced costs when health system–funded travel was prevented and when telehealth mitigated the need for expensive procedural or specialist follow-up by providing competent care in a more efficient way. The expert focus group identified 4 areas of potential savings from telehealth: productivity gains, reductions in secondary care, alternate funding models, and telementoring. Telehealth demonstrated great potential for productivity gains arising from health system redesign; however, under the Australian activity-based funding, it is unlikely that these gains will result in cost savings. Secondary care use mitigation is an area of promise for telehealth; however, many studies have not demonstrated overall cost savings due to the cost of administering and monitoring telehealth systems. Alternate funding models from telehealth systems have the potential to save the health system money in situations where the consumers pay out of pocket to receive services. Telementoring has had minimal economic evaluation; however, in the long term it is likely to result in inadvertent cost savings through the upskilling of generalist and allied health clinicians.                                Conclusions            Health services considering implementing telehealth should be motivated by benefits other than cost reduction. The available evidence has indicated that although telehealth provides overwhelmingly positive patient benefits and increases productivity for many services, current evidence suggests that it does not routinely reduce the cost of care delivery for the health system.",

      "abstract": "Abstract                Background                Failure to take medicines for diabetes as prescribed contributes to poor outcomes from the condition. Mobile phones are ubiquitous and short message service (SMS) texts have shown promise as a low-cost intervention. We tested the effectiveness of SMS-text messaging in improving outcomes in adults with type 2 diabetes.                              Methods                StAR2D was a 12-month two-arm randomised trial of SMS-text messaging and usual care in Cape Town, South Africa and Lilongwe, Malawi. Messages used behaviour change theory and were developed with patients and staff. The intervention group received four messages each week. The primary outcome was change in HbA1c. Secondary outcomes were the proportion of patients who collected > 80% medication and changes in systolic blood pressure, lipids, cardiovascular risk, and the proportion of the participants reaching treatment goals.                              Results                The trial took place between 1 October, 2016 and 1 October 2018, 1186 participants were randomised to intervention (593) and control (593) groups. 91% of participants completed follow-up. There was a reduction in HbA1c (DCCT) in both groups but not in mean change (95% CI) between groups (− 0.08% (− 0.31 to 0.16) (IFCC − 0.82 mmol/mol (− 3.44 to 1.79). There was a small but not significant increase in the proportions of participants likely to have collected 80% or more of medication (Relative risk 1.11 (0.84 to 1.47; P = 0.47). There was a significant difference between groups in change in systolic blood pressure from baseline of 3.46 mmHg (1.48 to 5.44, P = 0.001) in favour of the intervention group. The between group difference in change in 10-year risk of coronary heart disease was − 0.71% (− 1.46 to 0.04, P = 0.064). The proportion of participants meeting treatment goals in the intervention group was 36.0% and in the control group 26.8% (Relative risk 1.36 (1.13 to 1.63, P = 0.001). Participants reported many challenges to adherence despite finding messages acceptable and useful.                              Conclusions                Whilst SMS text messages do not lead to improved glycaemia in these low-resource settings there appeared to be an impact on blood pressure and achievement of treatment goals but the mechanisms for this are unclear. Text messages alone, may be unsuccessful unless accompanied by health system strengthening and other forms of self-management support for type 2 diabetes.

      "abstract": "Abstract                Background                There is growing urgency to tackle issues of equity and justice in the USA and worldwide. Health equity, a framing that moves away from a deficit mindset of what society is doing poorly (disparities) to one that is positive about what society can achieve, is becoming more prominent in health research that uses implementation science approaches. Equity begins with justice—health differences often reflect societal injustices. Applying the perspectives and tools of implementation science has potential for immediate impact to improve health equity.                              Main text                We propose a vision and set of action steps for making health equity a more prominent and central aim of implementation science, thus committing to conduct implementation science through equity-focused principles to achieve this vision in U.S. research and practice. We identify and discuss challenges in current health disparities approaches that do not fully consider social determinants. Implementation research challenges are outlined in three areas: limitations of the evidence base, underdeveloped measures and methods, and inadequate attention to context. To address these challenges, we offer recommendations that seek to (1) link social determinants with health outcomes, (2) build equity into all policies, (3) use equity-relevant metrics, (4) study what is already happening, (5) integrate equity into implementation models, (6) design and tailor implementation strategies, (7) connect to systems and sectors outside of health, (8) engage organizations in internal and external equity efforts, (9) build capacity for equity in implementation science, and (10) focus on equity in dissemination efforts.                              Conclusions                Every project in implementation science should include an equity focus. For some studies, equity is the main goal of the project and a central feature of all aspects of the project. In other studies, equity is part of a project but not the singular focus. In these studies, we should, at a minimum, ensure that we “leave no one behind” and that existing disparities are not widened. With a stronger commitment to health equity from funders, researchers, practitioners, advocates, evaluators, and policy makers, we can harvest the rewards of the resources being invested in health-related research to eliminate disparities, resulting in health equity.",

Economic problems and inequality are associated with poor mental health in adolescents. This study aimed to identify the relationship between economic damage to families due to COVID-19 and various mental health problems in Korean adolescents and to evaluate the risk factors of mental health.                              Methods                In total, 54,948 Korean adolescent students from 398 middle and 395 high schools were surveyed between August and November 2020. Complex sample logistic regression was performed to calculate odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for depression and suicidal ideation, respectively. A generalized linear model analysis was used to examine the association between mental health (unhappiness, loneliness, and stress) and the economic impact of COVID-19. Analyses were adjusted for age, gender, school grade, perceived academic achievement, perceived family economic status, and economic support.                              Results                The ORs of depression (OR = 1.77, 95% CI:1.57–2.00), suicidal ideation (OR = 2.14, 95% CI:1.84–2.50), unhappiness (OR = 1.51 95% CI 1.42–1.60) and lonely (OR = 1.38 95% CI 1.27–1.49) for the low level of perceived family economic status was higher compared to middle level. Adolescents who experienced economic deterioration in their households as COVID-19 showed a higher risk of depression (OR = 1.42, 95% CI:1.35–1.49), suicide ideation (OR = 1.36, 95% CI:1.28–1.44), unhappiness (OR = 2.23 95% CI 2.19–2.27), lonely (OR = 1.20 95% CI 1.17–1.22), and stress (OR = 1.14 95% CI 1.12–1.16) than those who did not.                              Conclusions                The findings revealed an association between the decline in household economic status due to COVID-19 and mental health problems, such as stress, loneliness, suicidal ideation, depression, and unhappiness.",

      "abstract": "Abstract               Despite population-wide recommendations by the U.S. Dietary Guidelines for Americans and others to encourage health-promoting dietary patterns, the proportion of Americans following dietary recommendations remains low. The gaps in the adoption and integration of evidence-based dietary interventions, practices, programs, and policies (EBIs) into community and clinical settings signal the need to strengthen efforts in implementation science (IS) in nutrition research to understand and alleviate barriers to adopting and sustaining healthy dietary behaviors and practices. Equally important is the translation of this research into practice in a variety of settings and across the diversity of populations. Recognizing this need, the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) 2020–2030 Strategic Plan for NIH Nutrition Research calls for the expansion of IS as a key opportunity to advancing nutrition research. This commentary highlights three scientific opportunities to stimulate IS in nutrition research and provides examples for each opportunity. These include: (a) Advance consideration of implementation and dissemination early in the design of interventions to facilitate opportunities for equitable scale-up and sustainability of EBIs, (b) Develop and test strategies for equitable implementation of nutrition and diet EBIs in health care and community settings, and (c) Build and strengthen the infrastructure, capacity, and expertise needed to increase use of IS in clinical and community nutrition research to swiftly move the research into practice. By advancing the three opportunities identified in this commentary, the scientific community has the potential to advance the field of nutrition research and IS with the ultimate goal of improving public health.",

Clinical measures aimed at assessing functional impairment due to OCD were administered.\nResults: Key findings were 1) that children with OCD reported being most significantly affected by their OC symptomatology within the school domain whereas parents placed emphasis on the impairment within the social domain; 2) scores on the Child Obsessive–Compulsive Impact Scale – Revised and the Children's Global Assessment Scale, were consistent, and 3) clinician-rated symptom severity was positively associated with parental reports on children's impairment due to OCD. Findings show similarities with data from similar studies in a high-income country (HIC) context.\nConclusions: Children with OCD and their parents do not necessarily agree on the ways in which OCD impacts their lives. A comprehensive view of functional impairment in children with OCD, that is, from the viewpoints of the patient, parents, and clinicians, is critical when treatment is planned. Such information may assist with selection of relevant treatment targets, and ultimately improve the quality of life of all affected.",

      "abstract": "Background            Mood disorders are among the most common mental health conditions worldwide. Wearables and consumer-grade personal digital devices create digital traces that can be collected, processed, and analyzed, offering a unique opportunity to quantify and monitor individuals with mental disorders in their natural living environments.                                Objective            This study comprised (1) 3 subcohorts of patients with a major depressive episode, either with major depressive disorder, bipolar disorder, or concurrent borderline personality disorder, and (2) a healthy control group. We investigated whether differences in behavioral patterns could be observed at the group level, that is, patients versus healthy controls. We studied the volume and temporal patterns of smartphone screen and app use, communication, sleep, mobility, and physical activity. We investigated whether patients or controls exhibited more homogenous temporal patterns of activity when compared with other individuals in the same group. We examined which variables were associated with the severity of depression.                                Methods            In total, 188 participants were recruited to complete a 2-phase study. In the first 2 weeks, data from bed sensors, actigraphy, smartphones, and 5 sets of daily questions were collected. In the second phase, which lasted up to 1 year, only passive smartphone data and biweekly 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire data were collected. Survival analysis, statistical tests, and linear mixed models were performed.                                Results            Survival analysis showed no statistically significant difference in adherence. Most participants did not stay in the study for 1 year. Weekday location variance showed lower values for patients (control: mean –10.04, SD 2.73; patient: mean –11.91, SD 2.50; Mann-Whitney U [MWU] test P=.004). Normalized entropy of location was lower among patients (control: mean 2.10, SD 1.38; patient: mean 1.57, SD 1.10; MWU test P=.05). The temporal communication patterns of controls were more diverse compared to those of patients (MWU test P<.001). In contrast, patients exhibited more varied temporal patterns of smartphone use compared to the controls. We found that the duration of incoming calls (β=–0.08, 95% CI –0.12 to –0.04; P<.001) and the SD of activity magnitude (β=–2.05, 95% CI –4.18 to –0.20; P=.02) over the 14 days before the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire records were negatively associated with depression severity. Conversely, the duration of outgoing calls showed a positive association with depression severity (β=0.05, 95% CI 0.00-0.09; P=.02).                                Conclusions            Our work shows the important features for future analyses of behavioral markers of mood disorders. However, among outpatients with mild to moderate depressive disorders, the group-level differences from healthy controls in any single modality remain relatively modest. Therefore, future studies need to combine data from multiple modalities to detect more subtle differences and identify individualized signatures. The high dropout rates for longer study periods remain a challenge and limit the generalizability.",

Assessments were conducted at baseline and post‐treatment. Primary outcomes included scores on the Children’s Yale‐Brown Obsessive‐Compulsive Scale (CY‐BOCS), remission status, and ratings on the Clinical Global Improvement (CGI) and Clinical Global Impression – Severity (CGI‐Severity) scales.Results:  Seventy‐six per cent of study participants (n = 70) were classified as treatment responders. Patients with aggressive/checking symptoms at baseline showed a trend (P = 0.06) toward improved treatment response and exhibited greater pre/post‐treatment CGI‐Severity change than those who endorsed only non‐aggressive/checking symptoms. Step‐wise linear regression analysis indicated higher scores on the aggressive/checking dimension were predictive of treatment‐related change in the CGI‐Severity index. Regression analysis with CY‐BOCS score as the dependent variable showed no difference between OCD subtypes.Conclusion:  Response to CBT in pediatric OCD patients does not differ substantially across subtypes.",

There is a lack of formal guidelines for the design of new digital phenotyping studies so that they are powered to detect both population-level longitudinal associations as well as individual-level change points in multivariate time series. In particular, determining the appropriate balance of sample size relative to the targeted duration of follow-up is a challenge.Materials and MethodsWe used data from 2 prior smartphone-based digital phenotyping studies to provide reasonable ranges of effect size and parameters. We considered likelihood ratio tests for generalized linear mixed models as well as for change point detection of individual-level multivariate time series.ResultsWe propose a joint procedure for sequentially calculating first an appropriate length of follow-up and then a necessary minimum sample size required to provide adequate power. In addition, we developed an accompanying accessible sample size and power calculator.DiscussionThe 2-parameter problem of identifying both an appropriate sample size and duration of follow-up for a longitudinal study requires the simultaneous consideration of 2 analysis methods during study design.ConclusionThe temporally dense longitudinal data collected by digital phenotyping studies may warrant a variety of applicable analysis choices. Our use of generalized linear mixed models as well as change point detection to guide sample size and study duration calculations provide a tool to effectively power new digital phenotyping studies.",

Mobile phone use is becoming widespread across populations and merits further exploration as a strategy to promote wellness and reduce health disparities.Aims: The purpose of this paper is to review the evidence using text messaging as a tool to deliver healthy lifestyle behavior intervention programs in pediatric and adolescent populations. The following question was used to guide the systematic review, “In pediatric and adolescent populations, how does the use of text‐message–based interventions versus control or comparison interventions affect healthy lifestyle behaviors?”Methods: A systematic search for relevant literature was conducted in the following databases: MEDLINE, PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, and PsycINFO, and by hand‐searching bibliographies. Evidence was compiled from experimental studies in peer‐reviewed journals published from 2004 to May 15, 2011. Data were extracted using guidelines set forth by the Centre for Reviews and Dissemination.Results: Thirty‐seven articles were identified from the comprehensive search. Eight articles representing seven studies (two articles were published describing different aspects of the outcomes from one study) met inclusion for this review. Mean age of participants in the study ranged from 8.7 to 17.9 years of age. Differences between groups on healthy lifestyle behaviors were significant in five studies.Conclusions: This review supports previous literature suggesting that mobile phones are uniquely positioned to bridge gaps in health disparities and reach across demographics. Interventions using short messaging service may be most effective as a reminder system to support disease management behaviors. Existing recommendations for tailored, interactive, and family‐centered care are supported with mobile technology recommended to augment clinical practice and health behavior change efforts. However, more rigorous, theory‐based intervention research using mobile technology is warranted in pediatric and adolescent populations.",

      "abstract": "Background            Wearable devices, mobile technologies, and their combination have been accepted into clinical use to better assess the physical fitness and quality of life of patients and as preventive measures. Usability is pivotal for overcoming constraints and gaining users’ acceptance of technology such as wearables and their companion mobile health (mHealth) apps. However, owing to limitations in design and evaluation, interactive wearables and mHealth apps have often been restricted from their full potential.                                Objective            This study aims to identify studies that have incorporated wearable devices and determine their frequency of use in conjunction with mHealth apps or their combination. Specifically, this study aims to understand the attributes and evaluation techniques used to evaluate usability in the health care domain for these technologies and their combinations.                                Methods            We conducted an extensive search across 4 electronic databases, spanning the last 30 years up to December 2021. Studies including the keywords “wearable devices,” “mobile apps,” “mHealth apps,” “physiological data,” “usability,” “user experience,” and “user evaluation” were considered for inclusion. A team of 5 reviewers screened the collected publications and charted the features based on the research questions. Subsequently, we categorized these characteristics following existing usability and wearable taxonomies. We applied a methodological framework for scoping reviews and the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist.                                Results            A total of 382 reports were identified from the search strategy, and 68 articles were included. Most of the studies (57/68, 84%) involved the simultaneous use of wearables and connected mobile apps. Wrist-worn commercial consumer devices such as wristbands were the most prevalent, accounting for 66% (45/68) of the wearables identified in our review. Approximately half of the data from the medical domain (32/68, 47%) focused on studies involving participants with chronic illnesses or disorders. Overall, 29 usability attributes were identified, and 5 attributes were frequently used for evaluation: satisfaction (34/68, 50%), ease of use (27/68, 40%), user experience (16/68, 24%), perceived usefulness (18/68, 26%), and effectiveness (15/68, 22%). Only 10% (7/68) of the studies used a user- or human-centered design paradigm for usability evaluation.                                Conclusions            Our scoping review identified the types and categories of wearable devices and mHealth apps, their frequency of use in studies, and their implementation in the medical context. In addition, we examined the usability evaluation of these technologies: methods, attributes, and frameworks. Within the array of available wearables and mHealth apps, health care providers encounter the challenge of selecting devices and companion apps that are effective, user-friendly, and compatible with user interactions. The current gap in usability and user experience in health care research limits our understanding of the strengths and limitations of wearable technologies and their companion apps. Additional research is necessary to overcome these limitations.",

      "abstract": "The rapidly evolving digital health landscape necessitates updates to existing self-care models in nursing. This viewpoint paper revisits and evaluates prevalent models, recognizing their comprehensive exploration of self-care concepts while also identifying a gap in the incorporation of personal informatics. It underscores the missing link of human-technology interplay, an essential aspect in understanding self-care practices within digital generations. The author delineates the role of personal health tracking in self-care and the achievement of desired health outcomes. Based on these insights, the author proposes a refined, digitized self-care model that incorporates mobile health (mHealth) technologies and self-tracking behaviors. The paper concludes by advocating the application of this model for future mHealth nursing interventions, providing a framework for facilitating patient self-care and improving health and well-being in the era of digital health.",

      "abstract": "Background            Most mobile cessation studies have found that such interventions have a higher quitting rate than interventions providing minimal smoking cessation support. However, why such interventions are effective has been almost unstudied by researchers.                                Objective            This paper describes the principles of the personalized mobile cessation intervention-based WeChat app and used generalized estimated equations to assess why a personalized mobile cessation intervention was more likely to promote smokers from the preparation stage to the action stage than a nonpersonalized intervention.                                Methods            This is a 2-arm, double-blind, randomized controlled trial in five cities in China. The intervention group received a personalized mobile cessation intervention. The control group received a nonpersonalized SMS text message smoking cessation intervention. All information was sent by the WeChat app. The outcomes were the change in protection motivation theory construct scores and the change in transtheoretical model stages.                                Results            A total of 722 participants were randomly assigned to the intervention or control group. Compared with those who received the nonpersonalized SMS text message intervention, smokers who received the personalized intervention presented lower intrinsic rewards, extrinsic rewards, and response costs. Intrinsic rewards were determinants of stage change, thus explaining why the intervention group was more likely to promote smokers from the preparation stage to the action stage (odds ratio 2.65, 95% CI 1.41-4.98).                                Conclusions            This study identified the psychological determinants at different stages to facilitate smokers moving forward to the next stage of quitting behavior and provides a framework to explore why a smoking cessation intervention is effective.

      "abstract": "Objective: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we aimed to quantify the effects of text messaging interventions to reduce depressive symptoms and identify variables that might influence the effectiveness of the intervention. Design: Electronic databases including EMBASE, CENTRAL, MEDLINE, CINAHL, PsycINFO and SCOPUS, as well as Clinicaltrials.gov and the World Health Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP) were searched for randomised controlled trials that sent one or more text messages with health-related content to adults who had been identified by a healthcare provider. Results: Seven trials (nine comparisons), with 1,918 participants, were included in the review, and the pooled analysis revealed a borderline statistically significant reduction in depressive symptom scores between the text messaging intervention and control groups (standardised mean difference [SMD], −0.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], −0.54 to 0.00; p = .00) favouring intervention at the end. Statistically significant reductions were shown in important subgroups, for example, where the primary aim of the messages was to reduce depressive symptoms; in those using the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) or 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) questionnaires; where text message content was targeted at mental well-being, mood improvement and cognitive behavioural therapy information; and when the message frequency was ⩾2 times per week. Conclusion: Text messaging has potential to reduce depressive symptoms. The results of this review should be interpreted with caution, however, due to the methodological limitations of included trials. More research is required before recommendations can be made about the routine use of text messaging for the management of depressive symptoms.",

These can negatively impact their well-being and patient care. Traditional psychological health interventions often encounter limitations such as a lack of accessibility and privacy. Artificial intelligence (AI) chatbots are being explored as potential solutions to these challenges, offering available and immediate support. Therefore, it is necessary to systematically evaluate the characteristics and effectiveness of AI chatbots designed specifically for health professionals.                                Objective            This scoping review aims to evaluate the existing literature on the use of AI chatbots for psychological health support among health professionals.                                Methods            Following Arksey and O’Malley’s framework, a comprehensive literature search was conducted across eight databases, covering studies published before 2024, including backward and forward citation tracking and manual searching from the included studies. Studies were screened for relevance based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, among 2465 studies retrieved, 10 studies met the criteria for review.                                Results            Among the 10 studies, six chatbots were delivered via mobile platforms, and four via web-based platforms, all enabling one-on-one interactions. Natural language processing algorithms were used in six studies and cognitive behavioral therapy techniques were applied to psychological health in four studies. Usability was evaluated in six studies through participant feedback and engagement metrics. Improvements in anxiety, depression, and burnout were observed in four studies, although one reported an increase in depressive symptoms.                                Conclusions            AI chatbots show potential tools to support the psychological health of health professionals by offering personalized and accessible interventions. Nonetheless, further research is required to establish standardized protocols and validate the effectiveness of these interventions. Future studies should focus on refining chatbot designs and assessing their impact on diverse health professionals.",

      "abstract": "Background            Unaddressed early-stage mental health issues, including stress, anxiety, and mild depression, can become a burden for individuals in the long term. Digital phenotyping involves capturing continuous behavioral data via digital smartphone devices to monitor human behavior and can potentially identify milder symptoms before they become serious.                                Objective            This systematic literature review aimed to answer the following questions: (1) what is the evidence of the effectiveness of digital phenotyping using smartphones in identifying behavioral patterns related to stress, anxiety, and mild depression? and (2) in particular, which smartphone sensors are found to be effective, and what are the associated challenges?                                Methods            We used the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) process to identify 36 papers (reporting on 40 studies) to assess the key smartphone sensors related to stress, anxiety, and mild depression. We excluded studies conducted with nonadult participants (eg, teenagers and children) and clinical populations, as well as personality measurement and phobia studies. As we focused on the effectiveness of digital phenotyping using smartphones, results related to wearable devices were excluded.                                Results            We categorized the studies into 3 major groups based on the recruited participants: studies with students enrolled in universities, studies with adults who were unaffiliated to any particular organization, and studies with employees employed in an organization. The study length varied from 10 days to 3 years. A range of passive sensors were used in the studies, including GPS, Bluetooth, accelerometer, microphone, illuminance, gyroscope, and Wi-Fi. These were used to assess locations visited; mobility; speech patterns; phone use, such as screen checking; time spent in bed; physical activity; sleep; and aspects of social interactions, such as the number of interactions and response time. Of the 40 included studies, 31 (78%) used machine learning models for prediction; most others (n=8, 20%) used descriptive statistics. Students and adults who experienced stress, anxiety, or depression visited fewer locations, were more sedentary, had irregular sleep, and accrued increased phone use. In contrast to students and adults, less mobility was seen as positive for employees because less mobility in workplaces was associated with higher performance. Overall, travel, physical activity, sleep, social interaction, and phone use were related to stress, anxiety, and mild depression.                                Conclusions            This study focused on understanding whether smartphone sensors can be effectively used to detect behavioral patterns associated with stress, anxiety, and mild depression in nonclinical participants. The reviewed studies provided evidence that smartphone sensors are effective in identifying behavioral patterns associated with stress, anxiety, and mild depression.",

      "abstract": "ObjectiveThe aim of the MEDication reminder APPs to improve medication adherence in Coronary Heart Disease Study was to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of using publicly available high-quality medication reminder applications (apps) to improve medication adherence compared with usual care in patients with coronary heart disease (CHD). An additional aim was to examine whether an app with additional features improved adherence further.MethodsPatients with CHD (n=163) were randomised to one of three groups: (1) usual care, (2) a basic app or (3) an advanced app with interactive/customisable features. The primary analysis compared usual care versus app use on the primary outcome of the 8-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale (MMAS-8) at 3 months. Secondary outcomes included blood pressure and cholesterol levels.ResultsThe mean age was 57.9 years and 87.7% were male. At 3 months, patients using an app had higher adherence (mean MMAS-8 score 7.11) compared with the usual care group (mean MMAS-8 score 6.63) with a mean difference between groups of 0.47 (95% CI 0.12 to 0.82, p=0.008). There was no significant difference in patients using the basic app versus the advanced app (mean difference −0.16, 95% CI −0.56 to 0.24, p=0.428). There were no significant differences in secondary clinical outcome measures.ConclusionPatients with CHD who used medication reminder apps had better medication adherence compared with usual care, and using apps with additional features did not improve this outcome further. These data suggest medication apps are likely to help patients with chronic health conditions adhere to medicines, but further examination of whether such benefits are sustained is warranted.Clinical trial registration numberACTRN12616000661471; Results.",

A growing body of work suggests message fatigue inhibits persuasion, and a meta-analytic review can help to evaluate the strength and direction of the relationship between message fatigue and persuasive outcomes, explore potential moderators of that relationship, and shed light on productive paths forward. Our results indicated that, on average, increased message fatigue is associated with unintended outcomes such as increased endorsement of message-inconsistent beliefs and reduced intention to enact healthy behaviors ( r = −.25, k = 18, N = 24,236). Substantial heterogeneity was observed and, in general, left unexplained by our coded moderators. We speculate about the drivers of the observed heterogeneity and reflect on paths forward in this area of research.",

The study marks the first-known empirical investigation of compassion fatigue as it relates to media coverage and interpersonal communication about social problems. A telephone survey methodology was used to measure compassion fatigue among a general, adult population toward four social problems: AIDS, homelessness, violent crime, and child abuse. Results indicate the existence of a compassion fatigue phenomenon, in varying degrees of magnitude, for every issue. Compassion fatigue was found to be a situational variable, rather than a personality trait. Cognitive, affective, and behavioral manifestations of compassion fatigue are identified, and significant predictors of compassion fatigue are discussed. The findings support the existence of a mass-mediated compassion fatigue phenomenon and suggest that the nature of contemporary media coverage may contribute to emotional fatigue with society's problems.",

      "abstract": "Background            Tobacco smoking is an important risk factor for disease, but inaccurate smoking history data in the electronic medical record (EMR) limits the reach of lung cancer screening (LCS) and tobacco cessation interventions. Patient-generated health data is a novel approach to documenting smoking history; however, the comparative effectiveness of different approaches is unclear.                                Objective            We designed a quality improvement intervention to evaluate the effectiveness of portal questionnaires compared to SMS text message–based surveys, to compare message frames, and to evaluate the completeness of patient-generated smoking histories.                                Methods            We randomly assigned patients aged between 50 and 80 years with a history of tobacco use who identified English as a preferred language and have never undergone LCS to receive an EMR portal questionnaire or a text survey. The portal questionnaire used a “helpfulness” message, while the text survey tested frame types informed by behavior economics (“gain,” “loss,” and “helpfulness”) and nudge messaging. The primary outcome was the response rate for each modality and framing type. Completeness and consistency with documented structured smoking data were also evaluated.                                Results            Participants were more likely to respond to the text survey (191/1000, 19.1%) compared to the portal questionnaire (35/504, 6.9%). Across all text survey rounds, patients were less responsive to the “helpfulness” frame compared with the “gain” frame (odds ratio [OR] 0.29, 95% CI 0.09-0.91; P<.05) and “loss” frame (OR 0.32, 95% CI 11.8-99.4; P<.05). Compared to the structured data in the EMR, the patient-generated data were significantly more likely to be complete enough to determine LCS eligibility both compared to the portal questionnaire (OR 34.2, 95% CI 3.8-11.1; P<.05) and to the text survey (OR 6.8, 95% CI 3.8-11.1; P<.05).                                Conclusions            We found that an approach using patient-generated data is a feasible way to engage patients and collect complete smoking histories. Patients are likely to respond to a text survey using “gain” or “loss” framing to report detailed smoking histories. Optimizing an SMS text message approach to collect medical information has implications for preventative and follow-up clinical care beyond smoking histories, LCS, and smoking cessation therapy.",

The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of an educational intervention program based on the Health Belief Model (HBM) to increase awareness, perceived sensitivity, perceived severity, perceived benefits, and self-efficacy in adopting neck health-promoting behaviors in school teachers.                              Methods                The present study was a quasi-experimental of the randomized clinical trial that was conducted for 6 months (December 2020 to July 2021). Participants were 146 junior high school teachers were selected from 26 schools through random sampling and divided into two groups of intervention and control. The data collection instrument was the self-design questionnaire and was completed in three points of time (before, immediately, and 3 months after the intervention). The data were analyzed by software version 24 SPSS.                              Results                The results showed that awareness, perceived sensitivity, perceived severity, perceived benefits and barriers, and self-efficacy in adopting neck health-promoting behaviors in the intervention group increased in two points of time (immediately after the intervention and 3 months of follow-up) (P <  0.05).

      "abstract": "BackgroundRapid human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing is an emerging cervical cancer screening strategy in resource-limited countries, yet it requires follow-up of women who test HPV positive.ObjectiveThis study aimed to determine if one-way text messages improved attendance to a 14-month follow-up cervical cancer screening among HPV-positive women.MethodsThis multicenter, parallel-group randomized controlled trial was conducted at 3 hospitals in Tanzania. Eligible participants were aged between 25 and 60 years, had tested positive to a rapid HPV test during a patient-initiated screening, had been informed of their HPV result, and had a private mobile phone with a valid number. Participants were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to the intervention or control group through an incorporated algorithm in the text message system. The intervention group received one-way text messages, and the control group received no text messages. The primary outcome was attendance at a 14-month health provider-initiated follow-up screening. Participants were not blinded, but outcome assessors were. The analysis was based on intention to treat.ResultsBetween August 2015 and July 2017, 4080 women were screened for cervical cancer, of which 705 were included in this trial—358 women were allocated to the intervention group, and 347 women were allocated to the control group. Moreover, 16 women were excluded before the analysis because they developed cervical cancer or died (8 from each group). In the intervention group, 24.0% (84/350) women attended their follow-up screening, and in the control group, 23.8% (80/335) women attended their follow-up screening (risk ratio 1.02, 95% CI 0.79-1.33).ConclusionsAttendance to a health provider-initiated follow-up cervical cancer screening among HPV-positive women was strikingly low, and one-way text messages did not improve the attendance rate. Implementation of rapid HPV testing as a primary screening method at the clinic level entails the challenge of ensuring a proper follow-up of women.Trial RegistrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT02509702; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02509702.International Registered Report Identifier (IRRID)RR2-10.2196/10.2196/15863",

This study evaluated the effectiveness of text messaging interventions (TM) versus telephone counseling (TC) to promote smoking cessation among hospitalized smokers in a middle-income country. Seven-day abstinence was measured during follow-up phone calls one month after discharge.

This paper reviews the role of motivation in the context of the strength, or limited‐resource, model of self‐control in several domains. Sacrificing one desire in order to pursue another is more difficult when the incipient response is strongly motivated, a notion that highlights the struggle between urges and restraints. A reduction in ego resources can be temporarily overcome by strong motivation – nevertheless, ego depletion is not solely a loss of motivation: Recent experiments indicate that regulatory resources are rooted in physical energy stores. Motivational conflicts, especially the clash between selfish motives and behaviors that promote social acceptance, set the stage for the necessity of self‐regulation and the circumstances in which ego depletion is most likely.",

Despite the increasing use of these platforms, there remains a lack of understanding of how they operate in real life, from initial engagement to longer-term impact. We aimed to explore the key inputs, processes, user interactions, assumptions, barriers, facilitators, outcomes, and impacts associated with the use of DMH and peer support platforms by developing a Theory of Change with stakeholders. Stakeholders (n = 77) contributed to the formulation of the Theory of Change through a series of online workshops, focus groups, interviews, and open-ended survey feedback. Workshops were structured to capture information related to aspects of the Theory of Change and to allow stakeholders to provide feedback to improve the diagram. A thematic framework approach was used to analyze transcripts to enable comparisons of factors reported by members, commissioners, and platform staff. Stakeholders identified a variety of factors contributing to initial inputs, processes, outcomes, and impact. Engagement emerged as the most significant barrier to the use of platforms. Motivations for use included filling in gaps in available support, connecting with others and upskilling. Different member types determined how users would interact with the platform which could influence the social response of others. Outcomes were largely positive including provision of a safe online space, improvement in wellbeing, and feeling connected to others. Stakeholders noted impact was harder to identify due to the preventative nature of these platforms but suggested this related to the knowledge of available support, reduction in waiting for support and in referrals, and increasing engagement and uptake of the platforms. Stakeholders identified assumptions regarding internet access as a significant barrier. The Theory of Change illustrated three distinct pathways in digital mental health and peer support. Further research is needed to improve engagement and factors influencing engagement, the member experience and how impact is measured.",

      "abstract": "Background            In resource-poor settings, lack of awareness and low demand for services constitute important barriers to expanding the coverage of effective interventions. In India, childhood immunization is a priority health strategy with suboptimal uptake.                                Objective            To assess study feasibility and key implementation outcomes for the Tika Vaani model, a new approach to educate and empower beneficiaries to improve immunization and child health.                                Methods            A cluster-randomized pilot trial with a 1:1 allocation ratio was conducted in rural Uttar Pradesh, India, from January to September 2018. Villages were randomly assigned to either the intervention or control group. In each participating village, surveyors conducted a complete enumeration to identify eligible households and requested participation before randomization. Interventions were designed through formative research using a social marketing approach and delivered over 3 months using strategies adapted to disadvantaged populations: (1) mobile health (mHealth): entertaining educational audio capsules (edutainment) and voice immunization reminders via mobile phone and (2) face-to-face: community mobilization activities, including 3 small group meetings offered to each participant. The control group received usual services. The main outcomes were prespecified criteria for feasibility of the main study (recruitment, randomization, retention, contamination, and adoption). Secondary endpoints tested equity of coverage and changes in intermediate outcomes. Statistical methods included descriptive statistics to assess feasibility, penalized logistic regression and ordered logistic regression to assess coverage, and generalized estimating equation models to assess changes in intermediate outcomes.                                Results            All villages consented to participate. Gaps in administrative data hampered recruitment; 14.0% (79/565) of recorded households were nonresident. Only 1.4% (8/565) of households did not consent. A total of 387 households (184 intervention and 203 control) with children aged 0 to 12 months in 26 villages (13 intervention and 13 control) were included and randomized. The end line survey occurred during the flood season; 17.6% (68/387) of the households were absent. Contamination was less than 1%. Participation in one or more interventions was 94.0% (173/184), 78.3% (144/184) for the face-to-face strategy, and 67.4% (124/184) for the mHealth strategy. Determinants including place of residence, mobile phone access, education, and female empowerment shaped intervention use; factors operated differently for face-to-face and mHealth strategies. For 11 of 13 intermediate outcomes, regression results showed significantly higher basic health knowledge among the intervention group, supporting hypothesized causal mechanisms.                                Conclusions            A future trial of a new intervention model is feasible. The interventions could strengthen the delivery of immunization and universal primary health care. Social and behavior change communication via mobile phones proved viable and contributed to standardization and scalability. Face-to-face interactions remain necessary to achieve equity and reach, suggesting the need for ongoing health system strengthening to accompany the introduction of communication technologies.

In this article, we present a model of thriving through relationships to provide a theoretical foundation for identifying the specific interpersonal processes that underlie the effects of close relationships on thriving. This model highlights two life contexts through which people may potentially thrive (coping successfully with life’s adversities and actively pursuing life opportunities for growth and development), it proposes two relational support functions that are fundamental to the experience of thriving in each life context, and it identifies mediators through which relational support is likely to have long-term effects on thriving. This perspective highlights the need for researchers to take a new look at social support by conceptualizing it as an interpersonal process with a focus on thriving.",

However, the most effective models and formats of intervention delivery are unknown. We conducted this systematic review and meta-analysis to determine the effectiveness of peer support for improving outcomes for people with lived experience of mental health conditions, when delivered as group interventions.                              Methods                Studies reporting randomised controlled trials of group peer support interventions for people experiencing mental health conditions were identified by searching MEDLINE, PsycINFO, Embase and Cochrane CENTRAL, from inception until July 12th 2019 and undertaking supplementary searches. Included studies were assessed for risk of bias and meta-analyses were conducted if three or more trials provided usable data.                              Results                Eight trials met eligibility criteria, providing data from 2131 participants. Six trials had either high or unclear risk of bias. Interventions were categorised as mutual support groups, or peer support groups, sub-categorised as anti-stigma or self-management interventions.                Meta-analyses were only possible for peer support groups and five outcomes. We found evidence that group peer support may make small improvements to overall recovery but not hope or empowerment individually, or to clinical symptoms. Evidence for effectiveness for outcomes which could not be meta-analysed was mixed.                              Conclusions                Findings from the few eligible trials suggest group peer support interventions may be specifically effective for supporting personal recovery and have a limited impact on other outcomes, though there were some risks of bias to study findings. Interventions were heterogeneous and most social outcomes were absent in the literature, highlighting further limitations to the current evidence-base. There is insufficient evidence available from trials of group peer support torecommend the routine implementation of these interventions across mainstream mental health services at present. More high-quality trials of peer-developed, group peer support interventions are needed in order tomake firm conclusions about intervention effectiveness.",

We discuss the background of peer support, how it has transitioned online, and consider theories and models that may have relevance. We also consider the importance of moderation within online peer support and the development of specific social network–based online interventions. We conclude that for social network sites to be used as peer-to-peer support interventions, more research is needed to understand their effectiveness, the role of moderation in these communities, and the mechanisms that produce the benefits experienced by users.",

      "abstract": "Background            Peer support is recognized globally as an essential recovery service for people with mental health conditions. With the influx of digital mental health services changing the way mental health care is delivered, peer supporters are increasingly using technology to deliver peer support. In light of these technological advances, there is a need to review and synthesize the emergent evidence for peer-supported digital health interventions for adults with mental health conditions.                                Objective            The aim of this study was to identify and review the evidence of digital peer support interventions for people with a lived experience of a serious mental illness.                                Methods            This systematic review was conducted using Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) procedures. The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane Central, CINAHL, and PsycINFO databases were searched for peer-reviewed articles published between 1946 and December 2018 that examined digital peer support interventions for people with a lived experience of a serious mental illness.  Additional articles were found by searching the reference lists from the 27 articles that met the inclusion criteria and a Google Scholar search in June 2019. Participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes, and study design (PICOS) criteria were used to assess study eligibility. Two authors independently screened titles and abstracts, and reviewed all full-text articles meeting the inclusion criteria. Discrepancies were discussed and resolved. All included studies were assessed for methodological quality using the Methodological Quality Rating Scale.                                Results            Thirty studies (11 randomized controlled trials, 2 quasiexperimental, 15 pre-post designs, and 2 qualitative studies) were included that reported on 24 interventions. Most of the studies demonstrated feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary effectiveness of peer-to-peer networks, peer-delivered interventions supported with technology, and asynchronous and synchronous technologies.                                Conclusions            Digital peer support interventions appear to be feasible and acceptable, with strong potential for clinical effectiveness. However, the field is in the early stages of development and requires well-powered efficacy and clinical effectiveness trials.

      "abstract": "Abstract                Background                Spontaneous intracranial hypotension (SIH) is a debilitating disorder caused by non-iatrogenic spinal cerebrospinal fluid leaks. SIH is increasingly recognized as an important treatable cause of secondary headaches. Treatment involves either epidural blood patching or surgery, which have considerable differences in their adverse event rates, recovery times, and cost. The objective of this evidence map is to understand the breadth of studies that investigate SIH treatment efficacy and to identify knowledge gaps to inform future research.                              Methods                This review will consider experimental, observational, and systematic review studies that assess the efficacy of epidural blood patching and surgery for the treatment of patients with SIH. Individual case studies, clinical guidelines, editorials, protocols, and studies that do not assess an intervention will not be included. English language studies will be included without limitation based on the date of publication. Databases to be searched include MEDLINE® (via Ovid), EMBASE (via Elsevier), and Web of Science™ (via Clarivate). Study selection will be performed independently by two investigators with extracted data to include study type, the number of patients included, patient descriptors, intervention characteristics, and outcome measure used.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of educational intervention based on Health Belief Model (HBM) using mobile applications (Telegram messenger) on doing exercise among the health care workers of Ilam university of medical sciences in 2017.                              Methods                In this interventional study, 114 people working in Ilam University of medical sciences participated in two groups of intervention and control (employed at two different cities) after providing the informed consent form. HBM-ISCS questionnaire was used to collect the required data and its reliability was approved using Cronbach’s alpha. Descriptive statistics, chi square, t test, repeated measures ANOVA (RMANOVA) and structural equation model (SEM) were used.                              Results                Half of the participants were men, 58.77% of them were undergraduate. The mean and SD of their age was 37.61 ± 4.88 years. Based on the results of the repeated measures analysis of variance test (before and after the intervention) in the intervention group, there were significant difference in all of the HBM constructs (perceived barriers was excepted), daily and weekly exercises, blood biochemical markers of the participants (P > 0.05). The above changes were not significant in the control group (P ≥ 0.05).                              Conclusion                Exercise is closely related to the beliefs of people, so implementing educational interventions based on Telegram messenger with emphasis on health beliefs and using HBM can lead to have exercise. Therefore, this application can be a suitable tool to deliver trainings, especially when holding in-person classes is difficult.",

      "abstract": "Background            Emerging evidence suggests that positive impacts can be generated when digital health interventions are designed to be responsive to the cultural and socioeconomic context of their intended audiences.                                Objective            This narrative review aims to synthesize the literature about the cultural adaptation of digital health interventions. It examines how concepts of culture and context feature in design and development processes, including the methods, models, and content of these interventions, with the aim of helping researchers to make informed decisions about how to approach cultural adaptation in digital health.                                Methods            Literature searches for this narrative review were conducted across 4 databases. Following full-text article screening by 2 authors, 16 studies of interventions predominantly focused on the self-management of health were selected based on their detailed focus on the process of cultural adaptation. Key considerations for cultural adaptation were identified and synthesized through a qualitative narrative approach, enabling an integrative and in-depth understanding of cultural adaptation.                                Results            The literature demonstrates varying approaches and levels of cultural adaptation across stages of intervention development, involving considerations such as the research ethos orienting researchers, the methodologies and models used, and the resultant content adaptations. In relation to the latter, culturally appropriate and accessible user interface design and translation can be seen as particularly important in shaping the level of adaptation.                                Conclusions            Optimizing cultural adaptation involves linking culture with other contextual factors such as economic conditions and social systems to ensure accessibility and the sustained use of digital health interventions. Culturally humble approaches that use the involvement of a broad range of participants, experts, and other stakeholders are demonstrated to spark vital insights for content development, implementation, and evaluation.",

In an advanced‐stage knee osteoarthritis is treated with total knee arthroplasty, and the demand for primary total knee arthroplasties is expected to grow exponentially. However, total knee arthroplasty in obese patients is associated with more complications, longer hospital stay and higher costs. We aimed to determine the effects of bariatric surgery on knee complaints in (morbidly) obese (body mass index >30 kg m−2) adult patients. The Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, MEDLINE, EMBASE, TRIP, BIOSIS‐Previews and reference lists of retrieved publications were systematically searched from earliest available up to 20 April 2014 for any English, German, French and Dutch studies. There was no restriction on study design. We included studies on the effect of surgically induced weight reduction on knee complaints in (morbidly) obese adult patients, with a minimal follow‐up of 3 months. Studies on the effects of lipectomy or liposuction and studies in which patients had already received a total knee arthroplasty were excluded. Thirteen studies were included in this systematic review with a total of 3,837 patients. Although different assessment tools were used, an overall significant improvement in knee pain was seen in 73% out of the used assessments. All studies measuring intensity of knee pain, knee physical function and knee stiffness showed a significant improvement after bariatric surgery. The quality of evidence was very low or too low for most of the included studies and moderate for one study. Bariatric surgery with subsequent marked weight loss is likely to improve knee pain, physical function and stiffness in (morbidly) obese adult patients. However, with the current available evidence, there is need for high‐quality studies.",

In the current study, we conducted focus groups to obtain feedback about preferences for a text message–based smoking cessation program from potential users. Participants ( N = 21, M age = 25.6 years, age range = 20-33 years) were current or recently quit smokers (M cigarettes/day = 12.8) who used text messaging. Participants completed questionnaires and participated in a 2-hour focus group. Focus groups were conducted using an a priori semistructured interview guide to promote discussion of the content and functionality of the intervention. Major themes from analysis of the focus groups included support for the acceptability of a text-based cessation program, suggestions for a more technologically broad-based program, and adjustments to the program structure. Participants recommended including social networking functions, user control of program output through an online profile, and text message features to promote interaction with the system. Interestingly, many participants suggested the program should begin on individuals’ identified quit day, challenging the procedures used in most cessation programs, which begin by preparing participants for a future quit date. Overall, younger adult smokers appear to be interested in participating in a smoking cessation program that uses text messages and web-based elements. Qualitative feedback regarding the perceived optimal features and structure of a technology-based intervention challenged traditional methods of implementing smoking cessation interventions and will inform the development of future programs.",

      "abstract": "Health and behavior change programs play a crucial role in improving health behaviors at individual and family levels. However, these programs face challenges with engagement and retention and typically show modest efficacy. Cognitive load theory is an established and highly used educational theory that proposes individuals have a finite capacity to process new information (“working memory”). Learning, engagement, and performance are negatively impacted when working memory is exceeded. Cognitive load theory is grounded in an understanding of human cognition and conceptualizes different types of cognitive loads imposed on individuals by a learning experience. Cognitive load theory aims to guide the design of learning experiences, considering how the human mind works, leading to more meaningful and effective learning. Cognitive load theory is increasingly applied to domains outside the classroom, such as designing patient and clinical education. Applying cognitive load theory to the design of health programs, their materials, and interfaces can provide insights. By considering the cognitive demands placed on individuals when interacting with health programs, design can be optimized to reduce cognitive load and better facilitate learning and behavior adoption. This may enhance engagement, retention, and effectiveness of programs. Cognitive load theory may be particularly valuable for individuals with diminished working memory due to high levels of mental load and stress. Design principles are presented to consolidate knowledge from cognitive load theory and existing approaches to guide researchers, policymakers, and health programmers. Further research and interdisciplinary collaboration are needed to realize the potential of cognitive load theory in health.",

      "abstract": "Background            Digital therapeutics, such as interventions provided via smartphones or the internet, have been proposed as promising solutions to support self-management in persons with chronic conditions. However, the evidence supporting self-management interventions through technology in stroke is scarce, and the intervention development processes are often not well described, creating challenges in explaining why and how the intervention would work.                                Objective            This study describes a specific use case of using intervention mapping (IM) and the taxonomy of behavior change techniques (BCTs) in designing a digital intervention to manage chronic symptoms and support daily life participation in people after stroke. IM is an implementation science framework used to bridge the gap between theories and practice to ensure that the intervention can be implemented in real-world settings. The taxonomy of BCTs consists of a set of active ingredients designed to change self-management behaviors.                                Methods            We used the first 4 steps of the IM process to develop a technology-supported self-management intervention, interactive Self-Management Augmented by Rehabilitation Technologies (iSMART), adapted from a face-to-face stroke-focused psychoeducation program. Planning group members were involved in adapting the intervention. They also completed 3 implementation measures to assess the acceptability, appropriateness, and feasibility of iSMART.                                Results            In step 1, we completed a needs assessment consisting of assembling a planning group to codevelop the intervention, conducting telephone surveys of people after stroke (n=125) to identify service needs, and performing a systematic review of randomized controlled trials to examine evidence of the effectiveness of digital self-management interventions to improve patient outcomes. We identified activity scheduling, symptom management, stroke prevention, access to care resources, and cognitive enhancement training as key service needs after a stroke. The review suggested that digital self-management interventions, especially those using cognitive behavioral theory, effectively reduce depression, anxiety, and fatigue and enhance self-efficacy in neurological disorders. Step 2 identified key determinants, objectives, and strategies for self-management in iSMART, including knowledge, behavioral regulation, skills, self-efficacy, motivation, negative and positive affect, and social and environmental support. In step 3, we generated the intervention components underpinned by appropriate BCTs. In step 4, we developed iSMART with the planning group members. Especially, iSMART simplified the original psychoeducation program and added 2 new components: SMS text messaging and behavioral coaching, intending to increase the uptake by people after stroke. iSMART was found to be acceptable (mean score 4.63, SD 0.38 out of 5), appropriate (mean score 4.63, SD 0.38 out of 5), and feasible (mean score 4.58, SD 0.34 out of 5).                                Conclusions            We describe a detailed example of using IM and the taxonomy of BCTs for designing and developing a digital intervention to support people after stroke in managing chronic symptoms and maintaining active participation in daily life.",

We advance a new team motivation model that invokes self‐determination theory (SDT), multilevel theory, emergence processes, and identity construction. Using the conceptualization of motivation offered by SDT, we define team motivation as a collective source of energy driving the direction, intensity, and persistence of team activities. By using SDT to develop the process‐based team motivation emergence model, we describe the role of human psychological needs that are involved in the emergence of this collective construct. An interpersonal feedback loop intertwined with a team process feedback loop predict how team members' individual motivations converge and then transform into team‐level motivation through a process of identity construction. Propositions for testing the model are advanced, as well as suggestions for methodological and analytical considerations.",

Drawing on the ability–motivation model of information processing, this study examined how such an information overabundance hampered individuals’ ability and motivation to process in the era of COVID-19. With a survey conducted from 493 participants, we found that less message elaboration of COVID-19 prevention information was predicted by greater message fatigue, a state of low motivation due to information overabundance. In addition, greater message fatigue was accompanied by greater information overload, a state of low ability due to information overabundance. Moreover, certain motivation-related (i.e. health status, trait reactance and frequency of information seeking) and ability–related factors (i.e. health literacy, health status, trait anxiety and information quality) were found to be associated with message fatigue and information overload, respectively. The theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",

      "abstract": "Background            Digital wearable devices, worn on or close to the body, have potential for passively detecting mental and physical health symptoms among people with severe mental illness (SMI); however, the roles of consumer-grade devices are not well understood.                                Objective            This study aims to examine the utility of data from consumer-grade, digital, wearable devices (including smartphones or wrist-worn devices) for remotely monitoring or predicting changes in mental or physical health among adults with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder. Studies were included that passively collected physiological data (including sleep duration, heart rate, sleep and wake patterns, or physical activity) for at least 3 days. Research-grade actigraphy methods and physically obtrusive devices were excluded.                                Methods            We conducted a systematic review of the following databases: Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, Technology Assessment, AMED (Allied and Complementary Medicine), APA PsycINFO, Embase, MEDLINE(R), and IEEE XPlore. Searches were completed in May 2024. Results were synthesized narratively due to study heterogeneity and divided into the following phenotypes: physical activity, sleep and circadian rhythm, and heart rate.                                Results            Overall, 23 studies were included that reported data from 12 distinct studies, mostly using smartphones and centered on relapse prevention. Only 1 study explicitly aimed to address physical health outcomes among people with SMI. In total, data were included from over 500 participants with SMI, predominantly from high-income countries. Most commonly, papers presented physical activity data (n=18), followed by sleep and circadian rhythm data (n=14) and heart rate data (n=6). The use of smartwatches to support data collection were reported by 8 papers; the rest used only smartphones. There was some evidence that lower levels of activity, higher heart rates, and later and irregular sleep onset times were associated with psychiatric diagnoses or poorer symptoms. However, heterogeneity in devices, measures, sampling and statistical approaches complicated interpretation.                                Conclusions            Consumer-grade wearables show the ability to passively detect digital markers indicative of psychiatric symptoms or mental health status among people with SMI, but few are currently using these to address physical health inequalities. The digital phenotyping field in psychiatry would benefit from moving toward agreed standards regarding data descriptions and outcome measures and ensuring that valuable temporal data provided by wearables are fully exploited.

      "abstract": "Background            Prompts offer a promising strategy to promote client engagement in internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (ICBT). However, if the prompts do not meet the needs of clients, they can potentially be more obtrusive rather than helpful.                                Objective            The aim of this study was to test if prompts tailored based on timing and frequency, aligned with preintervention goal setting, can increase usage and the efficacy of a therapist-supported ICBT stress recovery intervention for health care workers.                                Methods            The 2-arm randomized controlled trial included 87 health care workers (99% female, aged 19-68 years: mean 39.61, SD 11.49): 43 in the standard intervention group and 44 in the tailored prompts group. The primary outcome measure was the Recovery Experiences Questionnaire, and the secondary outcomes were the Perceived Stress Scale-4, the Patient Health Questionnaire-4, and the World Health Organization-5 Well-Being Index. The self-report data were collected before the intervention (September 2022), postintervention (October 2022), and 6-month follow-up (May 2023).                                Results            The results showed that tailored prompts, although appreciated by the majority (39/40, 98%), did not improve intervention usage indicators, such as the number of logins (t85=–0.91; P=.36), modules opened (t83.57=–1.47; P=.15), modules completed (t85=–0.71; P=.48), exercises completed (t85=–1.05; P=.30), or the time spent using the program (χ22=1.1; P=.57). Similarly, tailored prompts did not increase the effects of the intervention in terms of stress recovery skills (Cohen d ranging from 0.31 to 0.85), perceived stress (d=–0.08; –0.70), depression (d=–0.11; –0.38), anxiety (d=–0.32; –0.64), or psychological well-being (d=0.26; 0.46). In addition, the standard intervention group showed greater long-term stress recovery effects than the group using the internet-delivered intervention supplemented by tailored prompts (β=–0.24, P=.03).                                Conclusions            Although the study confirmed the efficacy of the program, the merits of tailored prompts in ICBT for stress recovery were not supported. Future research is needed to test the effects of the stress recovery intervention supplemented by goal setting and tailored prompts.

      "abstract": "Over the past quarter-century, mobile health (mHealth) technologies have experienced significant changes in adoption rates, adaptation strategies, and instances of abandonment. Understanding the underlying factors driving these trends is essential for optimizing the design, implementation, and sustainability of interventions using these technologies. The evolution of mHealth adoption has followed a progressive trajectory, starting with cautious exploration and later accelerating due to technological advancements, increased smartphone penetration, and growing acceptance of digital health solutions by both health care providers and patients. However, alongside widespread adoption, challenges related to usability, interoperability, privacy concerns, and socioeconomic disparities have emerged, necessitating ongoing adaptation efforts. While many mHealth initiatives have successfully adapted to address these challenges, technology abandonment remains common, often due to unsustainable business models, inadequate user engagement, and insufficient evidence of effectiveness. This paper utilizes the Nonadoption, Abandonment, Scale-Up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework to examine the interplay between the academic and industry sectors in patterns of adoption, adaptation, and abandonment, using 3 major mHealth innovations as examples: health-related SMS text messaging, mobile apps and wearables, and social media for health communication. Health SMS text messaging has demonstrated significant potential as a tool for health promotion, disease management, and patient engagement. The proliferation of mobile apps and devices has facilitated a shift from in-person and in-clinic practices to mobile- and wearable-centric solutions, encompassing everything from simple activity trackers to advanced health monitoring devices. Social media, initially characterized by basic text-based interactions in chat rooms and online forums, underwent a paradigm shift with the emergence of platforms such as MySpace and Facebook. This transition ushered in an era of mass communication through social media. The rise of microblogging and visually focused platforms such as Twitter(now X), Instagram, Snapchat, and TikTok, along with the integration of live streaming and augmented reality features, exemplifies the ongoing innovation within the social media landscape. Over the past 25 years, there have been remarkable strides in the adoption and adaptation of mHealth technologies, driven by technological innovation and a growing recognition of their potential to revolutionize health care delivery. Each mobile technology uniquely enhances public health and health care by catering to different user needs. SMS text messaging offers wide accessibility and proven effectiveness, while mobile apps and wearables provide comprehensive functionalities for more in-depth health management. Social media platforms amplify these efforts with their vast reach and community-building potential, making it essential to select the right tool for specific health interventions to maximize impact and engagement. Nevertheless, continued efforts are needed to address persistent challenges and mitigate instances of abandonment, ensuring that mHealth interventions reach their full potential in improving health outcomes and advancing equitable access to care.",

If the culture permits, we move toward perspectives which are more inclusive, discriminating and integrative of experience. We move away from uncritical, organic relationships toward contractual relation ships with others, institutions and society. Perspective transformation refor mulates the criteria for valuing and for taking action. Behavior change is often a function of such transformation.

      "abstract": "Background            Suicide is the third-leading cause of death among US adolescents aged 10-19 years, and about 10% attempt suicide each year. School-based universal prevention may reduce youth suicidal behavior. Sources of Strength uses a peer leader network diffusion model to promote healthy norms across a school population. A key challenge within schoolwide programs is reaching a large and diverse array of students, especially those less engaged with their peers. Motivated by this challenge, we developed and field-tested Text4Strength—a program of automated text messages targeting help-seeking attitudes and norms, social coping resources, and emotion regulation skills.                                Objective            This study conducted a pilot randomized controlled trial of Text4Strength in 1 high school as an extension of an ongoing schoolwide program (Sources of Strength), to test its impact on targets that have the potential to reduce suicidal behavior.                                Methods            Students at an upstate New York high school (N=223) received 1-2 text messages per week for 9 weeks, targeting strategies for coping with difficult feelings and experiences through clarifying emotions and focusing on positive affect concepts, awareness, and strengthening of youth-adult relationships; and positive help-seeking norms, skills, and resources. Surveys were administered at baseline, immediately post intervention and 3 months after texting ended. We measured proximal intervention targets (methods of coping during stressful events, ability to make sense of their own emotions, feelings of powerlessness during emotion management and recovery, relations with trusted adults at school, and help-seeking behaviors), symptoms and suicide ideation, and student replies to messages.                                Results            No significant effects were observed for any outcome at either follow-up time point. Results showed that if there is a true (but undetected) intervention effect, it is small. Students with fewer friend nominations did not interact any more or less with the text messages. Exploratory moderation analyses observed no interaction between the intervention condition and the number of friends or baseline suicide ideation at any time point.                                Conclusions            In contrast to a promising previous field test, these results suggest that Text4Strength is unlikely to have impacted the outcomes of interest and that undetected moderate or large effects can be ruled out with high confidence. Although motivated by the need to reach more isolated students, students with fewer friends did not engage more or show a greater effect than other participants. This study was conducted in a single high school that was already implementing Sources of Strength, so the bar for showing a distinct effect from texting alone was high. Many further channels for reaching youth through private messaging remain unexplored. Alternative delivery systems should be investigated, such as embedding messaging in gaming chat systems and other media. More sophisticated systems drawing on chatbots may also achieve better outcomes.

Hence, this study aimed to evaluate the acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness of a mobile phone messaging-based message-framing intervention. A cross-sectional study was conducted, involving 397 mothers who participated in the mobile phone messaging-based intervention. Multivariate general linear modeling was carried out to identify factors that were associated with the acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness of the intervention. The statistical significance level was declared at a 95% confidence interval and p-value of <0.05. The mean scores of acceptability, feasibility, and appropriateness were 27.9, 23.8, and 22.5, respectively. Acceptability was significantly affected by living in a rural area, being rich, receiving messages at night, self-efficacy, and engagement. Feasibility was affected by living in rural area, educational status, being a merchant, being rich, receiving messages at night, self-efficacy, engagement, and satisfaction. Meanwhile, appropriateness was influenced by living in a rural area, being a merchant, being a government employee, and satisfaction. The mobile phone messaging-based intervention was highly acceptable, feasible, and appropriate. Focusing on self-efficacy, engagement, satisfaction, the timing for sending messages, and sociodemographic factors would facilitate the implementation and utilization of mobile phone messaging-based interventions.",

The relationship of several effectiveness measures with texters' demographic and psychosocial characteristics, frequency of CTL usage, and texters' perceptions of engagement with their CCs was examined using a series of logistic regression analyses.ResultsBy the end of the text‐based conversation, nearly 90% of suicidal texters reported that the conversation was helpful, and nearly half reported being less suicidal.ConclusionsOur study offers evidence for CTL's perceived effectiveness. These findings are of critical importance in light of the launch of a nationwide three‐digit number (988) for suicide prevention and mental health crisis supports in the U.S., which will include texting.",

      "abstract": "Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) represent an intervention design that adapts the provision and type of support over time to an individual’s changing status and contexts, intending to deliver the right support on the right occasion. As a novel strategy for delivering mobile health interventions, JITAIs have the potential to improve access to quality care in underserved communities and, thus, alleviate health disparities, a significant public health concern.  Valid experimental designs and analysis methods are required to inform the development of JITAIs. Here, we briefly review the cutting-edge design of microrandomized trials (MRTs), covering both the classical MRT design and its outcome-adaptive counterpart.  Associated statistical challenges related to the design and analysis of MRTs are also discussed. Two case studies are provided to illustrate the aforementioned concepts and designs throughout the article. We hope our work leads to better design and application of JITAIs, advancing public health research and practice. (Am J Public Health. 2023;113(1):60–69. https://doi.org/10.2105/AJPH.2022.307150 )",

This study seeks to understand the population served by Crisis Text Line (CTL), the largest crisis text service in the United States.MethodsSecondary data analysis was conducted on de‐identified Crisis Counselor reports, texter post‐conversation survey responses, and anonymized text conversation data from 85,877 texters who contacted CTL during a 12‐month period. We examined Crisis Counselor's ratings of suicide ideation severity, texters' reports of race, gender, sexual orientation, recent mental health symptoms, and additional sources of help, and logs of frequency of contact.Results76% of texters were under 25. 79% were female. 48% identified as other than heterosexual/straight. 64% had only one conversation. 79% were above the clinical cutoff for depression and 80% for anxiety, while 23% had thoughts of suicide. 23% received help from a doctor or therapist, and 28% received help only from CTL.ConclusionsCTL reaches a highly distressed, young, mostly female population, including typically underserved minorities and a substantial percentage of individuals who do not receive help elsewhere. These findings support the decision to include texting in the forthcoming national 988 implementation.",

      "abstract": "IntroductionThe growing number of smartphone health applications available in the app stores makes these apps a promising tool to help reduce the global problem of non-adherence to long-term medications. However, to date, there is limited evidence that available medication reminder apps are effective. This study aims to determine the impact of medication reminder apps on adherence to cardiovascular medication when compared with usual care for people with coronary heart disease (CHD) and to determine whether an advanced app compared with a basic app is associated with higher adherence.Methods and analysisRandomised controlled trial with follow-up at 3 months to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of medication reminder apps on medication adherence compared with usual care. An estimated sample size of 156 patients with CHD will be randomised to one of three groups (usual care group, basic medication reminder app group and advanced medication reminder app group). The usual care group will receive standard care for CHD with no access to a medication reminder app. The basic medication reminder app group will have access to a medication reminder app with a basic feature of providing simple daily reminders with no interactivity. The advanced medication reminder app group will have access to a medication reminder app with additional interactive and customisable features. The primary outcome is medication adherence measured by the eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale at 3 months. Secondary outcomes include clinical measurements of blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and medication knowledge. A process evaluation will also be performed to assess the feasibility of the intervention by evaluating the acceptability, utility and engagement with the apps.Ethics and disseminationEthical approval has been obtained from the Western Sydney Local Health Network Human Research Ethics Committee (AU/RED/HREC/1/WMEAD/3).

      "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundCardiovascular medication for secondary prevention has been shown to be effective. However, cardiovascular patients have poor medication adherence, the consequences of which include premature death, recurrence risk, hospitalization, and high financial cost for the healthcare system. Behavioral interventions based on text messaging technology are a promising strategy to improving adherence in medications. In low-middle income settings there is no high-quality evidence of a behavioral program delivered by SMS; hence we describe the development, message content, and the program design of the intervention for improving adherence to cardiovascular medication.MethodsWe used the model reported by Abroms and colleagues’ for developing and evaluating text messages-based interventions. This model describes a process in which the intervention created is based on theory and evidence, the target audience is involved to ensure the intervention is engaging and useful, and there is a focus on implementation from the outset.ResultsOur main result was the design of the program, which consisted of a twelve-month structured intervention based on Transtheoretical Model of Behavior Change. We wrote and validated clusters of texts messages targeting each stage of the model. Each message went through an examination process including the evaluation of former cardiovascular patients, experts and the team research personnel. Another important result was an understanding of patients’ perceptions of their experience of cardiovascular disease, barriers to accessing healthcare in Colombia and the use of mobile technology for health.ConclusionsAn SMS intervention has the potential to be an acceptable and effective way of improving adherence to medication in patients with cardiovascular disease. This paper describes the development and content of one such intervention.",

Telehealth interventions may provide an effective delivery method to facilitate sustained dietary change.                                Design, setting, participants, & measurements            This pilot, randomized, controlled trial evaluated secondary and exploratory outcomes after a dietitian-led telehealth coaching intervention to improve diet quality in people with stage 3–4 CKD. The intervention group received phone calls every 2 weeks for 3 months (with concurrent, tailored text messages for 3 months), followed by 3 months of tailored text messages without telephone coaching, to encourage a diet consistent with CKD guidelines. The control group received usual care for 3 months, followed by nontailored, educational text messages for 3 months.                                Results            Eighty participants (64% male), aged 62±12 years, were randomized to the intervention or control group. Telehealth coaching was safe, with no adverse events or changes to serum biochemistry at any time point. At 3 months, the telehealth intervention, compared with the control, had no detectable effect on overall diet quality on the Alternative Health Eating Index (3.2 points, 95% confidence interval, −1.3 to 7.7), nor at 6 months (0.5 points, 95% confidence interval, −4.6 to 5.5). There was no change in clinic BP at any time point in any group. There were significant improvements in several exploratory diet and clinical outcomes, including core food group consumption, vegetable servings, fiber intake, and body weight.                                Conclusions            Telehealth coaching was safe, but appeared to have no effect on the Alternative Healthy Eating Index or clinic BP. There were clinically significant changes in several exploratory diet and clinical outcomes, which require further investigation.

      "abstract": "Background            The COVID-19 pandemic has largely affected people’s mental health and psychological well-being. Specifically, individuals with a pre-existing mental health disorder seem more impaired by lockdown measures posing as major stress factors. Medical rehabilitation treatment can help people cope with these stressors. The internet and digital apps provide a platform to contribute to regular treatment and to conduct research on this topic.                                Objective            Making use of internet-based assessments, this study investigated individuals from the general population and patients from medical, psychosomatic rehabilitation clinics. Levels of depression, anxiety, loneliness, and perceived stress during the COVID-19 pandemic, common COVID-19–related worries, and the intention to use digital apps were compared. Furthermore, we investigated whether participating in internet-delivered digital trainings prior to and during patients’ rehabilitation stay, as well as the perceived usefulness of digital trainings, were associated with improved mental health after rehabilitation.                                Methods            A large-scale, online, cross-sectional study was conducted among a study sample taken from the general population (N=1812) in Germany from May 2020 to April 2021. Further, a longitudinal study was conducted making use of the internet among a second study sample of psychosomatic rehabilitation patients at two measurement time points—before (N=1719) and after (n=738) rehabilitation—between July 2020 and April 2021. Validated questionnaires and adapted items were used to assess mental health and COVID-19–related worries. Digital trainings were evaluated. Propensity score matching, multivariate analyses of covariance, an exploratory factor analysis, and hierarchical regression analyses were performed.                                Results            Patients from the psychosomatic rehabilitation clinics reported increased symptoms with regard to depression, anxiety, loneliness, and stress (F4,2028=183.74, P<.001, η2p=0.27) compared to the general population. Patients perceived greater satisfaction in communication with health care professionals (F1,837=31.67, P<.001, η2p=0.04), had lower financial worries (F1,837=38.96, P<.001, η2p=0.04), but had higher household-related worries (F1,837=5.34, P=.02, η2p=0.01) compared to the general population. Symptoms of depression, anxiety, loneliness, and perceived stress were lower postrehabilitation (F1,712=23.21, P<.001, η2p=0.04) than prior to rehabilitation. Psychosomatic patients reported a higher intention to use common apps and digital trainings (F3,2021=51.41, P<.001, η2p=0.07) than the general population. With regard to digital trainings offered prior to and during the rehabilitation stay, the perceived usefulness of digital trainings on rehabilitation goals was associated with decreased symptoms of depression (β=–.14, P<.001), anxiety (β=–.12, P<.001), loneliness (β=–.18, P<.001), and stress postrehabilitation (β=–.19, P<.001). Participation in digital group therapy for depression was associated with an overall change in depression (F1,725=4.82, P=.03, η2p=0.01) and anxiety (F1,725=6.22, P=.01, η2p=0.01) from pre- to postrehabilitation.                                Conclusions            This study validated the increased mental health constraints of psychosomatic rehabilitation patients in comparison to the general population and the effects of rehabilitation treatment. Digital rehabilitation components are promising tools that could prepare patients for their rehabilitation stay, could integrate well with face-to-face therapy during rehabilitation treatment, and could support aftercare.

      "abstract": "Background            Adolescents at risk for substance misuse are rarely identified early due to existing barriers to screening that include the lack of time and privacy in clinic settings. Games can be used for screening and thus mitigate these barriers. Performance in a game is influenced by cognitive processes such as working memory and inhibitory control. Deficits in these cognitive processes can increase the risk of substance use. Further, substance misuse affects these cognitive processes and may influence game performance, captured by in-game metrics such as reaction time or time for task completion. Digital biomarkers are measures generated from digital tools that explain underlying health processes and can be used to predict, identify, and monitor health outcomes. As such, in-game performance metrics may represent digital biomarkers of cognitive processes that can offer an objective method for assessing underlying risk for substance misuse.                                Objective            This is a protocol for a proof-of-concept study to investigate the utility of in-game performance metrics as digital biomarkers of cognitive processes implicated in the development of substance misuse.                                Methods            This study has 2 aims. In aim 1, using previously collected data from 166 adolescents aged 11-14 years, we extracted in-game performance metrics from a video game and are using machine learning methods to determine whether these metrics predict substance misuse. The extraction of in-game performance metrics was guided by literature review of in-game performance metrics and gameplay guidebooks provided by the game developers. In aim 2, using data from a new sample of 30 adolescents playing the same video game, we will test if metrics identified in aim 1 correlate with cognitive processes. Our hypothesis is that in-game performance metrics that are predictive of substance misuse in aim 1 will correlate with poor cognitive function in our second sample.                                Results            This study was funded by National Institute on Drug Abuse through the Center for Technology and Behavioral Health Pilot Core in May 2022. To date, we have extracted 285 in-game performance metrics. We obtained institutional review board approval on October 11, 2022. Data collection for aim 2 is ongoing and projected to end in February 2024. Currently, we have enrolled 12 participants. Data analysis for aim 2 will begin once data collection is completed. The results from both aims will be reported in a subsequent publication, expected to be published in late 2024.                                Conclusions            Screening adolescents for substance use is not consistently done due to barriers that include the lack of time. Using games that provide an objective measure to identify adolescents at risk for substance misuse can increase screening rates, early identification, and intervention. The results will inform the utility of in-game performance metrics as digital biomarkers for identifying adolescents at high risk for substance misuse.

      "abstract": "Human behavior shows large interindividual variation in temporal organization. Extreme “larks” wake up when extreme “owls” fall asleep. These chronotypes are attributed to differences in the circadian clock, and in animals, the genetic basis of similar phenotypic differences is well established. To better understand the genetic basis of temporal organization in humans, the authors developed a questionnaire to document individual sleep times, self-reported light exposure, and self-assessed chronotype, considering work and free days separately. This report summarizes the results of 500 questionnaires completed in a pilot study. Individual sleep times show large differences between work and free days, except for extreme early types. During the workweek, late chronotypes accumulate considerable sleep debt, for which they compensate on free days by lengthening their sleep by several hours. For all chronotypes, the amount of time spent outdoors in broad daylight significantly affects the timing of sleep: Increased self-reported light exposure advances sleep. The timing of self-selected sleep is multifactorial, including genetic disposition, sleep debt accumulated on workdays, and light exposure. Thus, accurate assessment of genetic chronotypes has to incorporate all of these parameters. The dependence of human chronotype on light, that is, on the amplitude of the light:dark signal, follows the known characteristics of circadian systems in all other experimental organisms. Our results predict that the timing of sleep has changed during industrialization and that a majority of humans are sleep deprived during the workweek. The implications are far ranging concerning learning, memory, vigilance, performance, and quality of life.",

Participants were, on average, 35 years of age, predominantly female (68%), white (79%), lacked a college degree (70%), had medium nicotine dependence (average Fagerström Nicotine Dependence Score score of 5.2) and more than half (62%) had made a previous quit attempt.InterventionAdult daily smokers browsing the web for smoking cessation support (n = 409; recruited 19 May2011–10 July 2012) were randomized to receive smoking cessation support via Text2Quit versus a smoking cessation material.MeasurementsMediators (i.e. changes in psychosocial constructs of health behavior change, use of extra‐programmatic treatment) were assessed at 1 month using single‐item measures and outcome (i.e. self‐reported 7‐day point prevalence abstinence) at 6‐month follow‐up.FindingsMediators accounted for 35% of the effect of Text2Quit on smoking cessation. Only psychosocial mechanisms had complete mediational paths, with increases in self‐efficacy [b = 0.10 (0.06–0.15)], quitting know‐how [b = 0.07 (0.03–0.11)] and the sense that someone cared [b = 0.06 (0.01–0.11)], partially explaining the conferred benefit of Text2Quit. Use of outside resources, including treatments promoted explicitly by Text2Quit, i.e. medication [b = 0.001 (−0.01 to 0.01), quitline [b = −0.002 (−0.01 to 0.04)], treatments and resources not promoted by Text2Quit, i.e. online forums [b = 0.01 (−0.01 to 0.04)] and self‐help materials [b = −0.01 (−0.04 to 0.02)], did not have complete mediational paths. An interaction effect existed for medication use that suggested that for participants not using medication, Text2Quit conferred substantial benefit, but not for participants using medication.ConclusionsText‐messaging programs for smoking cessation appear primarily to confer benefit by promoting improvements in the psychosocial processes related to quitting rather than through the use of extra‐programmatic smoking cessation treatments and services.",

      "abstract": "AbstractAn unresolved question for the understanding of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathophysiology is why a significant percentage of amyloid-β (Aβ)-positive cognitively unimpaired (CU) individuals do not develop detectable downstream tau pathology and, consequently, clinical deterioration. In vitro evidence suggests that reactive astrocytes unleash Aβ effects in pathological tau phosphorylation. Here, in a biomarker study across three cohorts (n = 1,016), we tested whether astrocyte reactivity modulates the association of Aβ with tau phosphorylation in CU individuals. We found that Aβ was associated with increased plasma phosphorylated tau only in individuals positive for astrocyte reactivity (Ast+). Cross-sectional and longitudinal tau–positron emission tomography analyses revealed an AD-like pattern of tau tangle accumulation as a function of Aβ only in CU Ast+individuals. Our findings suggest astrocyte reactivity as an important upstream event linking Aβ with initial tau pathology, which may have implications for the biological definition of preclinical AD and for selecting CU individuals for clinical trials.",

      "abstract": "Background            Coronary heart disease (CHD) is the leading cause of death and disability among American women. The prevalence of CHD is expected to increase by more than 40% by 2035. In 2015, the estimated cost of caring for patients with CHD was US $182 billion in the United States; hospitalizations accounted for more than half of the costs. Compared with men, women with CHD or those who have undergone coronary revascularization have up to 30% more rehospitalizations within 30 days and up to 1 year. Center-based cardiac rehabilitation is the gold standard of care after an acute coronary event, but few women attend these valuable programs. Effective home-based interventions for improving cardiovascular health among women with CHD are vital for addressing this gap in care.                                Objective            The ubiquity of mobile phones has made mobile health (mHealth) behavioral interventions a viable option to improve healthy behaviors of both women and men with CHD. First, this study aimed to examine the usability of a prototypic mHealth intervention designed specifically for women with CHD (herein referred to as HerBeat). Second, we examined the influence of HerBeat on selected health behaviors (self-efficacy for diet, exercise, and managing chronic illness) and psychological (perceived stress and depressive symptoms) characteristics of the participants.                                Methods            Using a single-group, pretest, posttest design, 10 women participated in the 12-week usability study. Participants were provided a smartphone and a smartwatch on which the HerBeat app was installed. Using a web portal dashboard, a health coach monitored participants’ ecological momentary assessment data, their behavioral data, and their heart rate and step count. Participants then completed a 12-week follow-up assessment.                                Results            All 10 women (age: mean 64.4 years, SD 6.3 years) completed the study. The usability and acceptability of HerBeat were good, with a mean system usability score of 83.60 (SD 16.3). The participants demonstrated statistically significant improvements in waist circumference (P=.048), weight (P=.02), and BMI (P=.01). Furthermore, depressive symptoms, measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire-9, significantly improved from baseline (P=.04).                                Conclusions            The mHealth prototype was feasible and usable for women with CHD. Participants provided data that were useful for further development of HerBeat. The mHealth intervention is expected to help women with CHD self-manage their health behaviors. A randomized controlled trial is needed to further verify the findings.",

      "abstract": "SummaryDespite rising mental health problems worldwide, engaging men to seek mental health support is challenging. Male‐only lifestyle interventions have shown promise for improving men's physical health, but the overall impact of these programs on psychological outcomes is unclear. This review aimed to evaluate the impact of male‐only lifestyle interventions on men's mental health and to identify if any study or intervention features were associated with effectiveness. A systematic literature search with no date restrictions was conducted across four databases and returned 15 946 citations. Nine studies were eligible for inclusion, representing 1427 participants. Risk of bias was generally low across studies, although none were specifically powered to detect changes in mental health. Overall, significant group‐by‐time effects were reported for 26% of mental health outcomes examined. In the fixed‐effects meta‐analyses, small‐to‐medium intervention effects were observed for mental health–related quality of life (SMD = 0.24), self‐esteem (SMD = 0.51), and positive affect (SMD = 0.58). Insights into effective study or intervention features were limited because of the low number of heterogeneous studies. Although male‐only lifestyle interventions have improved men's mental health in some circumstances, studies that are specifically powered to detect long‐term changes are urgently required, particularly in groups with pre‐existing mental health concerns.",

To examine this idea, we identified 184 independent data sets from studies that utilized self-determination theory (SDT; Deci & Ryan, 2000) in health care and health promotion contexts. A meta-analysis evaluated relations between the SDT-based constructs of practitioner support for patient autonomy and patients’ experience of psychological need satisfaction, as well as relations between these SDT constructs and indices of mental and physical health. Results showed the expected relations among the SDT variables, as well as positive relations of psychological need satisfaction and autonomous motivation to beneficial health outcomes. Several variables (e.g., participants’ age, study design) were tested as potential moderators when effect sizes were heterogeneous. Finally, we used path analyses of the meta-analyzed correlations to test the interrelations among the SDT variables. Results suggested that SDT is a viable conceptual framework to study antecedents and outcomes of motivation for health-related behaviors.",

The present research explored the consequences of this mode of representation for social inferences. In two sets of studies, participants learned (a) that they were similar to a member of the other gender on a novel attribute, (b) that they were different from a member of the other gender on a novel attribute, or (c) just their own standing on a novel attribute. Results showed that participants made stronger inductive inferences about the attribute in question when they learned that it distinguished them from a member of the other gender than in the other conditions. We consider the implications of these results for the representation of social categories and for everyday social inference processes.",

I describe seven possible mechanisms: social influence/social comparison, social control, role-based purpose and meaning (mattering), self-esteem, sense of control, belonging and companionship, and perceived support availability. Stress-buffering processes also involve these mechanisms. I argue that there are two broad types of support, emotional sustenance and active coping assistance, and two broad categories of supporters, significant others and experientially similar others, who specialize in supplying different types of support to distressed individuals. Emotionally sustaining behaviors and instrumental aid from significant others and empathy, active coping assistance, and role modeling from similar others should be most efficacious in alleviating the physical and emotional impacts of stressors.",

      "abstract": "AbstractObjectiveRecognition that patients and partners are both affected by a cancer diagnosis has led to increased interest in couple‐based interventions. Although these interventions show promise for enhancing both patients' and partners' illness adjustment, couples' acceptance of these interventions is not well documented. This review explores these issues as reflected in uptake and attrition rates in published trials.MethodsA literature search identified 17 manuscripts reporting the uptake and attrition rates of couple‐based interventions for couples facing cancer. The uptake (percentage of eligible couples randomised into a trial) and the attrition (percentage of couples who dropped out of a trial) rates were extracted by cancer type, cancer stage, intervention type, intervention focus and intervention delivery method.ResultsUptake and attrition rates ranged from 13.6% to 94.2% and 0% to 49.4%, respectively. Low uptake rates were noted for communication‐focused interventions and those requiring both the patient and the partner to participate in the intervention simultaneously. Attrition was also high in the latter group. Uptake rates appeared slightly lower than individual‐based interventions (58%–76%), as were attrition rates, although only for late stage cancer (~30% couple‐based vs. ~69% individual‐based). Common barriers to uptake included accessibility, competing priorities and illness severity.ConclusionsThe couple‐based interventions had slightly lower uptake rates than what has been previously reported for individual‐based interventions; however, lower attrition suggests patients and partners may be more inclined to complete an intervention when they participate together. The findings support the need to develop strategies to improve the delivery and acceptability of couple‐based interventions in clinical practice. Copyright © 2013 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",

      "abstract": "Background Understanding human behaviors has been the subject of several studies. Their main goal was to inform behavior change interventions aimed at promoting positive behaviors and improving negative ones. However, as a non-expert in behavioral science, it is extremely difficult for researchers from other disciplines to design and develop evidence-based behavior change interventions. Moreover, all existing frameworks stop at the conceptual stage and do not provide instructions for developing digital-based behavior change interventions. Objective We present an end-to-end framework for the design and development of mHealth-based behavior change interventions by drawing on the synergy of theory, practices, and evidence from previous research. Methods We reconcile the frameworks most used in the literature for the design of behavior change interventions. Therefore, the authors examined the steps of each framework, and the mapping between these steps was carried out through several iterations to obtain five common steps. Results The proposed framework includes five steps: (1) Definition of the scope of the intervention. (2) Understanding and explanation of behavior. (3) Definition of the intervention content and strategies. (4) Implementation of the intervention. (5) Evaluation of the intervention. Each step is explained in detail, while providing researchers with examples and the necessary materials that will boost the success of their interventions. Conclusion This work provides a framework that will guide researchers in the design and implementation of mHealth-based behavior change interventions. It differs from its predecessors in that it goes beyond the conceptual level of intervention design by providing details about the technical implementation of mHealth solutions. Also, explanations and examples for different steps are provided to help researchers and practitioners and design, implement, and evaluate their mHealth-based behavior change interventions.",

Our independent variable was “switching doctors because I felt treated differently because of my weight.” Logistic regression models to examine the association of prior doctor shopping with characteristics of current primary care relationships: duration, trust in primary care provider (PCP), and perceived PCP weight‐related judgment, adjusted for patient factors were used.ResultsOverall, 13% of adults with overweight/obesity reported previously doctor shopping resulting from differential treatment. Prior shoppers were more likely to report shorter durations of their current relationships [73% vs. 52%; p = 0.01] or perceive that their current PCP judged them because of their weight [74% vs. 11%; p < 0.01] than nonshoppers. No significant differences in reporting high trust in current PCPs were found.ConclusionsA subset of patients with overweight/obesity doctor shop resulting from perceived differential treatment. These prior negative experiences have no association with trust in current relationships, but our results suggest that patients may remain sensitive to provider weight bias.",

The aim of the survey programme was to make the National Health Service (NHS) more \"patient centred\" and more responsive to patient feedback. The national inpatient survey has now been running in England annually since 2002 gathering data from over 600,000 patients. The aim of this study is to investigate how the data have been used and to summarise what has been learned about patients' evaluation of care as a result.                                Methods            Two independent researchers systematically gathered all research that included analyses of the English national adult inpatient survey data. Journals, databases and relevant websites were searched. Publications prior to 2002 were excluded. Articles were also identified following consultation with experts. All documents were then critically appraised by two co-authors both of whom have a background in statistical analysis.                                Results            We found that the majority of the studies identified were reports produced by organisations contracted to gather the data or co-ordinate the data collection and used mainly descriptive statistics. A few articles used the survey data for evidence based reporting or linked the survey to other healthcare data. The patient's socio-demographic characteristics appeared to influence their evaluation of their care but characteristics of the workforce and the. At a national level, the results of the survey have been remarkably stable over time. Only in those areas where there have been co-ordinated government-led campaigns, targets and incentives, have improvements been shown. The main findings of the review are that while the survey data have been used for different purposes they seem to have incited little academic interest.                                Conclusions            The national inpatient survey has been a useful resource for many authors and organisations but the full potential inherent in this large, longitudinal publicly available dataset about patients' experiences has not as yet been fully exploited.            This review suggests that the presence of survey results alone is not enough to improve patients' experiences and further research is required to understand whether and how the survey can be best used to improve standards of care in the NHS.",

      "abstract": "Background—            The radial artery is often used as the second arterial graft for coronary artery bypass grafting. Little is known about the differences in long-term patency between radial free and T grafts. This study was performed to determine long-term radial artery patency over a 15-year period.                                Methods and Results—                          Radial arteries were used as free grafts or T grafts for coronary artery bypass grafting over a 15-year period. Patients were contacted to determine if postoperative cardiac catheterization was performed and examination of any reports and films was performed. Grafts were graded as patent, luminal irregularity, or occluded. Each sequential graft was counted separately. Between September 1993 and December 2008, 13 926 patients underwent isolated coronary artery bypass grafting and 3248 patients had at least one radial artery graft used as a conduit. Catheterizations were performed at a mean of 7.4±3.8 years (range, 3 days to 14.4 years) on 372 radial artery grafts (103 free and 269 T) in 215 patients. Kaplan-Meier freedom from occlusion for radial free and T grafts at 1 and 10 years was 97.1% and 75.4% and 99.6% and 62.9%, respectively (              P              =0.146 free versus T). Kaplan-Meier survival to 15 years was not statistically different between free and T graft patients (              P              =0.5).                                            Conclusions—            In 215 patients with postoperative catheterization after coronary artery bypass grafting with a radial artery graft, radial free and T grafts had similar and acceptable long-term patency to support their use as a coronary artery bypass graft conduit.",

Fifty‐one subjects (age: 44.2 ± 8.7 years, BMI: 33.7 ± 3.6 kg/m2) participated in a 6‐month behavioral weight loss program and were randomized to one of three groups: standard behavioral weight loss (SBWL), SBWL plus technology‐based system (SBWL+TECH), or technology‐based system only (TECH). All groups reduced caloric intake and progressively increased moderate intensity physical activity. SBWL and SBWL+TECH attended weekly meetings. SBWL+TECH also received a TECH that included an energy monitoring armband and website to monitor energy intake and expenditure. TECH used the technology system and received monthly telephone calls. Body weight and physical activity were assessed at 0 and 6 months. Retention at 6 months was significantly different (P = 0.005) between groups (SBWL: 53%, SBWL+TECH: 100%, and TECH: 77%). Intent‐to‐treat (ITT) analysis revealed significant weight losses at 6 months in SBWL+TECH (−8.8 ± 5.0 kg, −8.7 ± 4.7%), SBWL (−3.7 ± 5.7 kg, −4.1 ± 6.3%), and TECH (−5.8 ± 6.6 kg, −6.3 ± 7.1%) (P < 0.001). Self‐report physical activity increased significantly in SBWL (473.9 ± 800.7 kcal/week), SBWL+TECH (713.9 ± 1,278.8 kcal/week), and TECH (1,066.2 ± 1,371 kcal/week) (P < 0.001), with no differences between groups (P = 0.25). The TECH used in conjunction with monthly telephone calls, produced similar, if not greater weight losses and changes in physical activity than the standard in‐person behavioral program at 6 months. The use of this technology may provide an effective short‐term clinical alternative to standard in‐person behavioral weight loss interventions, with the longer term effects warranting investigation.",

In this article, we present a novel smartphone approach to address the limitations of self-report in bipolar disorder where mood and activity are key constructs. We describe the development of MoodRhythm, a smartphone application that incorporates existing self-report elements from interpersonal and social rhythm therapy, a clinically validated treatment, and combines them with novel inputs from smartphone sensors. We reflect on lessons learned in transitioning from an existing self-report instrument to one that involves smartphone sensors and discuss the potential impact of these changes on the future of psychological assessment.",

Through an extensive, critical multidisciplinary literature review and exploratory study of users of Web searching, online shopping, Webcasting, and gaming applications, we conceptually and operationally defined engagement. Building on past research, we conducted semistructured interviews with the users of four applications to explore their perception of being engaged with the technology. Results indicate that engagement is a process comprised of four distinct stages: point of engagement, period of sustained engagement, disengagement, and reengagement. Furthermore, the process is characterized by attributes of engagement that pertain to the user, the system, and user‐system interaction. We also found evidence of the factors that contribute to nonengagement. Emerging from this research is a definition of engagement—a term not defined consistently in past work—as a quality of user experience characterized by attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, aesthetic and sensory appeal, attention, feedback, variety/novelty, interactivity, and perceived user control. This exploratory work provides the foundation for future work to test the conceptual model in various application areas, and to develop methods to measure engaging user experiences.",

We use a machine-learning approach to detect and predict anxiety scores in organizational crisis announcements on social media and the public’s responses to these posts. We also control for emotional and language tones in organizational crisis responses using a separate machine learning algorithm. Perceived organizational anxiety positively influences public anxiety, confirming the occurrence of emotional contagion from the organization to the public. Crisis response strategies moderated this relationship, so that responsibility acknowledgment lowered public anxiety the most. We argue that by accounting for emotions expressed in organizational crisis responses, organizations may be able to better predict and manage public emotions.",

We investigated the relationship of the ESA resistance index (ERI) and the geriatric nutritional risk index (GNRI) for cardiovascular mortality in hemodialysis (HD) patients.MethodsA total of 180 maintenance HD patients were enrolled. The patients were stratified by the GNRI of 91.2, a previously reported cut-off value, and the ERI of 13.7 (IU/week/kg/g/dL), a cut-off value for predicting cardiovascular-specific mortality, and they were classified into four groups (group 1[G1]: higher GNRI and lower ERI, G2: higher GNRI and higher ERI, G3: lower GNRI and lower ERI, G4: lower GNRI and higher ERI).ResultsThe ERI was independently associated with the GNRI (β = −0.271, p = 0.0005). During a median follow-up of 4.6 years, higher ERI and lower GNRI were independently associated with cardiovascular mortality, respectively (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR], 3.10; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.31–7.34, and aHR, 6.64; 95%CI, 2.60–16.93, respectively). The 7-year survival rates were 96.1%, 70.3%, 77.3%, and 50.1% in G1, G2, G3, and G4, respectively. The aHR values for G4 versus G1 were 12.63 (95%CI, 3.58–44.59). With regards to model discrimination, adding the GNRI alone, the ERI alone, and both to the traditional risk model significantly improved the net reclassification improvement by 0.421, 0.662, and 0.671, respectively. Similar results were obtained for all-cause mortality.ConclusionThe ERI was independently associated with the GNRI, and could predict cardiovascular mortality in HD patients. Moreover, the combination of GNRI and ERI could improve the predictability for cardiovascular mortality.",

To develop and test the Four Domain Food Insecurity Scale (4D-FIS), a complementary measure designed to assess all four domains of the food access dimension of food insecurity (quantitative, qualitative, psychological, and social).Low-income Black, Latina, and White women (n = 109) completed semi-structured (qualitative) and structured (quantitative) interviews. Interviewers separately administered two food insecurity scales, including the 4D-FIS and the USDA FSSM adult scale. A scoring protocol was developed to determine food insecurity status with the 4D-FIS. Analyses included a confirmatory factor analysis to examine the hypothesized structure of the 4D-FIS and an initial evaluation of reliability and validity. A four-factor model fit the data reasonably well as judged with fit indices. Results showed relatively high factor loadings and inter-factor correlations indicated that factors were distinct. Cronbach’s alpha (ɑ) for the overall scale was 0.90 (subscale ɑ ranged from 0.69 to 0.91) and provided support for the scale’s internal consistency reliability. There was fair overall agreement between the 4D-FIS and USDA FSSM adult scale, but agreement varied by category. Findings provide preliminary support for the 4D-FIS as a complementary measure of food insecurity, with implications for researchers, practitioners, and policymakers working in U.S. communities.",

      "abstract": "AbstractYouth-specific digital mental health interventions (DMHI) represent an emerging field of study, and aim to increase access, improve socioemotional outcomes, and, where required, support triage to targeted interventions. However, prior reviews have reported inconsistent findings on the clinical effectiveness of such interventions in young adults (12–25 years). Further, shortfalls remain for the impact of guided interventions based on the mode of delivery and the type of human support personnel (e.g., professional or peer) guiding the intervention. In response, this systematic review, co-designed with Australia’s leading mental health organization, aims to assess the effectiveness of guided digital programs in improving youth socioemotional outcomes. Included studies involve young people experiencing mental ill-health, receiving brief (i.e., 1–12 sessions), digitally delivered (at least partially) psychological interventions that were guided or partially guided, tested in a type of experimental study, with a socioemotional outcome. Specific socioemotional outcomes examined were depression, anxiety, stress, wellbeing, mindfulness, and quality of life. A systematic search of the contemporary published and grey literature identified 22,482 records with 32 relevant records published between 2018 and 2023. A narrative synthesis guided integration of findings. Results demonstrated strong evidence for the effectiveness of guided interventions on socioemotional outcomes (i.e., depression, anxiety, stress) yet these effects were short-lived. When factoring in the use of different control groups (i.e., active vs. inactive), inconsistent effects were observed for the socioemotional outcomes of depression, anxiety, and stress. The mode of delivery (i.e., asynchronous, synchronous, combined) and the type of human support personnel did not appear to impact socioemotional outcomes. Results indicate efficacious brief digital interventions for depression and anxiety include refresher/follow-up content, goal setting content, and relapse prevention content. In contrast, poor efficacy is associated with interventions that include homework tasks, self-monitoring, and log-keeping content.PROSPERO, ID CRD42023405812.",

      "abstract": "Adult mental health challenges frequently stem from undiagnosed poor mental health earlier in life. With increasing levels of poor adolescent mental health and insufficient health care resources in low- and middle-income countries, mobile mental health may offer expanded service access. Little is known about mobile mental health interventions for adolescents in low- and middle-income countries. Our aim was to review the literature on mobile mental health intervention, development and use for low- and middle-income country adolescents. We searched APA PsycInfo, Web of Science, Psychiatry online, and Ebscohost databases using keywords and phrases. Screening of the 6953 retrieved articles, generated 6 articles that met the inclusion criteria. Arksey and O’Malley’s adapted framework was followed using rigorous inclusion criteria and screening by two reviewers. Studies showed high heterogeneity. Two studies used short message service text messaging platforms, one used phone call reminders, two used smartphone applications (WhatsApp or game-based), and one study compared different short message service, web-based and smartphone app offerings. Generally, adolescents had a positive perception of mobile mental health interventions. Helpline messages, peer group sessions, access to a counsellor and games set in real-life environments were some of the preferred contents of mobile mental health interventions. Noted barriers include low personal mobile phone ownership, leading to lack of confidentiality, data costs and limited internet access. While adolescents in low- and middle-income countries find mobile mental health interventions acceptable and supportive, challenges remain. Mobile mental health interventions can potentially overcome barriers associated with face-to-face care, such as high cost and stigma. However, more research is needed to overcome these challenges and build the evidence-base in low- and middle-income countries for this field to grow.",

We aimed to compare self-reported and objectively measured PA levels in a large sample of participants with and without HF.MethodsA validated PA questionnaire was used to estimate self-reported weekly PA among 1600 participants with HF and 387 580 participants without HF. Accelerometer data were studied in 596 participants with HF and 96 105 participants without HF for a period of 7 days. Using multivariable linear regression models, we compared the PA levels between participants with HF and without HF, focusing on both the average daily PA levels and the intensity of PAs throughout the day.ResultsPA levels were significantly lower in participants with HF using both self-report (excess metabolic equivalent of task hours per week of 26.5 (95% CI 24.7 to 28.4) vs 34.7 (95% CI 34.5 to 34.9), respectively (p<0.001)) and accelerometer measures (mean accelerations of 23.7 milligravity (95% CI 23.1 to 24.4) vs 28.1 milligravity (95% CI 28.0 to 28.1), respectively (p<0.001)). Findings were consistent across different PA intensities. Hour-by-hour comparisons showed that accelerometer-derived PA levels of patients with HF were reduced throughout the day.ConclusionPerceived and objectively recorded PA levels of patients with chronic HF are significantly lower than those of individuals without HF. This difference is continuous throughout the different hours of the day, with individuals with HF being on average 16% less active than individuals without HF. In patients with HF, increases in everyday activity may be a potential alternative to structured exercise programmes.",

      "abstract": "Background            The Internet has the potential to help young people by reducing the stigma associated with mental health and enabling young people to access services and professionals which they may not otherwise access. Online support can empower young people, help them develop new online friendships, share personal experiences, communicate with others who understand, provide information and emotional support, and most importantly help them feel less alone and normalize their experiences in the world.                                Objective            The aim of the research was to gain an understanding of how young people use an online forum for emotional and mental health issues. Specifically, the project examined what young people discuss and how they seek support on the forum (objective 1). Furthermore, it looked at how the young service users responded to posts to gain an understanding of how young people provided each other with peer-to-peer support (objective 2).                                Methods            Kooth is an online counseling service for young people aged 11-25 years and experiencing emotional and mental health problems. It is based in the United Kingdom and provides support that is anonymous, confidential, and free at the point of delivery. Kooth provided the researchers with all the online forum posts between a 2-year period, which resulted in a dataset of 622 initial posts and 3657 initial posts with responses. Thematic analysis was employed to elicit key themes from the dataset.                                Results            The findings support the literature that online forums provide young people with both informational and emotional support around a wide array of topics. The findings from this large dataset also reveal that this informational or emotional support can be viewed as directive or nondirective. The nondirective approach refers to when young people provide others with support by sharing their own experiences. These posts do not include explicit advice to act in a particular way, but the sharing process is hoped to be of use to the poster. The directive approach, in contrast, involves individuals making an explicit suggestion of what they believe the poster should do.                                Conclusions            This study adds to the research exploring what young people discuss within online forums and provides insights into how these communications take place. Furthermore, it highlights the challenge that organizations may encounter in mediating support that is multidimensional in nature (informational-emotional, directive-nondirective).",

These ecological momentary interventions (EMIs) are treatments that are provided to people during their everyday lives (i.e. in real time) and in natural settings (i.e. real world). The goal of the present review is to synthesize and critique mobile technology‐based EMI aimed at improving health behaviours and psychological and physical symptoms.MethodsTwenty‐seven interventions using palmtop computers or mobile phones to deliver ambulatory treatment for smoking cessation, weight loss, anxiety, diabetes management, eating disorders, alcohol use, and healthy eating and physical activity were identified.ResultsThere is evidence that EMI can be successfully delivered, are accepted by patients, and are efficacious for treating a variety of health behaviours and physical and psychological symptoms. Limitations of the existing literature were identified and recommendations and considerations for research design, sample characteristics, measurement, statistical analyses, and clinical implementation are discussed.ConclusionsMobile technology‐based EMI can be effectively implemented as interventions for a variety of health behaviours and psychological and physical symptoms. Future research should integrate the assessment and intervention capabilities of mobile technology to create dynamically and individually tailored EMI that are ecologically sensitive.",

Physical activity and sleep were assessed by a monitor combining heart rate and accelerometry measurements. Screen time was reported by the parents. Body fat percentage, waist circumference, blood glucose, serum insulin, plasma lipids, and blood pressure were assessed, and a cardiometabolic risk score was calculated using z‐scores. Children were classified as meeting the guidelines if they had on average ≥60 min/day of moderate‐to‐vigorous physical activity during the valid days; ≤120 min/day of screen time; and 9–11 h/day of sleep. In total, 485 children had valid data at baseline or at 2 years follow‐up. Analyses were conducted using adjusted logistic and linear regression models. Most children adhered to the 24 h movement guidelines at baseline, but the adherence decreased over the 2 years follow‐up. Meeting physical activity guidelines individually, or in combination with screen time and/or sleep, was longitudinally associated with a lower cardiometabolic risk score, insulin and waist circumference, and cross‐sectionally additionally with lower diastolic blood pressure and higher high‐density lipoprotein cholesterol. However, these associations became statistically non‐significant after adjustment for body fat. In conclusion, meeting 24 h movement guidelines at baseline increases the odds of meeting them at 2 years follow‐up in school‐aged children. Furthermore, meeting 24 h movement guidelines is associated with lower levels of cardiometabolic risk factors, but these associations are partly explained by lower body fat. Thus, promoting movement behaviors, especially physical activity, and healthy weight in early childhood is important in supporting cardiometabolic health in children.",

Text messaging reminders, as electronic reminders, provide an opportunity to improve medication adherence. In this study, we aimed to provide evidence addressing the question of whether text message reminders were effective in improving patients' adherence to medication.\nEVIDENCE ACQUISITION: We carried out a systematic literature search, using the five electronic bibliographic databases: PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, CINAHL, and the Cochrane central register of controlled trials. Studies were included on the basis of whether they examined the benefits and effects of short-message service (SMS) interventions on medication adherence.\nRESULTS: The results of this systematic review indicated that text messaging interventions have improved patients' medication adherence rate (85%, 29.34). Included in the review, those who had problems with adherence, or those whom text messaging was most helpful had HIV, asthma, diabetes, schizophrenia and heart disease (73.5%). The period of intervention varied from 1 week to 14 months. The most common study design was randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (66%) carried out in the developed countries.\nCONCLUSIONS: This study demonstrated the potential of mobile phone text messaging for medication non-adherence problem solving.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Goal setting is an effective strategy in altering fitness and dietary behaviours. The goal attainment scale (GAS) is a patient-reported outcome measure that can be used to quantify goal achievement. The GAS has not been extensively assessed in lifestyle intervention trials. This study aimed to describe the goal setting process and assess the impact of a digital exercise and diet service and self-efficacy on goal attainment in people with chronic disease and at increased cardiometabolic risk. Methods: This study presents a single-centre, 26-week, randomised controlled trial (RCT) comparing standard care to digital health technologies (text messages, nutrition/exercise app, video consultations with dietitian and/or exercise physiologist). The comparator group was offered dietitian review (per standard care), and both groups received a wearable activity monitor. Individualised goal setting was facilitated prior to randomisation. Goal importance, performance measures, and self-efficacy were determined by participants. Goal outcome and ‘Change in GAS’ scores, reflecting the difference between baseline and follow-up performance, were calculated using validated formulae. Results: Goal setting was completed and reviewed by 66 participants, with a median age of 51 years and 56% being male. The most common goals related to weight loss (46%), fitness (29%), and diet (15%). Most participants (62%) reported improvements in their goals, with most improvements in dietary (71%), fitness (52%), and weight loss (39%) goals. There was no significant difference in goal outcomes between intervention and comparator groups (p = 0.99). There was, however, a significant correlation between nutrition self-efficacy and dietary goal achievement (p = 0.04). Conclusions: The novelty and feasibility of goal setting and attainment were demonstrated in this RCT of lifestyle interventions in people with chronic disease. Though the intervention did not significantly improve goal attainment, most participants reported improvements in their lifestyle goals. There were greater improvements in dietary goals than in fitness or weight loss goals. Participant-led goal setting with GAS and participant self-efficacy has potentially important applications in future lifestyle modification research and clinical implementation endeavours.",

      "abstract": "Background            The use of mobile health (mHealth) technologies to improve population-level health outcomes around the world has surged in the last decade. Research supports the use of mHealth apps to improve health outcomes such as maternal and infant mortality, treatment adherence, immunization rates, and prevention of communicable diseases. However, developing countries face significant barriers to successfully implement, sustain, and expand mHealth initiatives to improve the health of vulnerable populations.                                Objective            We aimed to identify and synthesize barriers to the use of mHealth technologies such as text messaging (short message service [SMS]), calls, and apps to change and, where possible, improve the health behaviors and health outcomes of populations in developing countries.                                Methods            We followed the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses checklist. Deriving search criteria from the review’s primary objective, we searched PubMed and CINAHL using an exhaustive terms search (eg, mHealth, text messaging, and developing countries, with their respective Medical Subject Headings) limited by publication date, English language, and full text. At least two authors thoroughly reviewed each article’s abstract to verify the articles were germane to our objective. We then applied filters and conducted consensus meetings to confirm that the articles met the study criteria.                                Results            Review of 2224 studies resulted in a final group of 30 articles for analysis. mHealth initiatives were used extensively worldwide for applications such as maternal health, prenatal care, infant care, HIV/AIDS prevention, treatment adherence, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and health education. Studies were conducted in several developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. From each article, we recorded the specific health outcome that was improved, mHealth technology used, and barriers to the successful implementation of the intervention in a developing country. The most prominent health outcomes improved with mHealth were infectious diseases and maternal health, accounting for a combined 20/30 (67%) of the total studies in the analysis. The most frequent mHealth technology used was SMS, accounting for 18/30 (60%) of the studies. We identified 73 individual barriers and grouped them into 14 main categories. The top 3 barrier categories were infrastructure, lack of equipment, and technology gap, which together accounted for 28 individual barriers.                                Conclusions            This systematic review shed light on the most prominent health outcomes that can be improved using mHealth technology interventions in developing countries. The barriers identified will provide leaders of future intervention projects a solid foundation for their design, thus increasing the chances for long-term success. We suggest that, to overcome the top three barriers, project leaders who wish to implement mHealth interventions must establish partnerships with local governments and nongovernmental organizations to secure funding, leadership, and the required infrastructure.",

      "abstract": "Abstract                Background                Implementation research may play an important role in reducing research waste by identifying strategies that support translation of evidence into practice. Implementation of healthcare interventions is influenced by multiple factors including the organisational context, implementation strategies and features of the intervention as perceived by people delivering and receiving the intervention. Recently, concepts relating to perceived features of interventions have been gaining traction in published literature, namely, acceptability, fidelity, feasibility, scalability and sustainability. These concepts may influence uptake of healthcare interventions, yet there seems to be little consensus about their nature and impact. The aim of this paper is to develop a testable conceptual framework of implementability of healthcare interventions that includes these five concepts.                              Methods                A multifaceted approach was used to develop and refine a conceptual framework of implementability of healthcare interventions. An overview of reviews identified reviews published between January 2000 and March 2021 that focused on at least one of the five concepts in relation to a healthcare intervention. These findings informed the development of a preliminary framework of implementability of healthcare interventions which was presented to a panel of experts. A nominal group process was used to critique, refine and agree on a final framework.                              Results                A total of 252 publications were included in the overview of reviews. Of these, 32% were found to be feasible, 4% reported sustainable changes in practice and 9% were scaled up to other populations and/or settings. The expert panel proposed that scalability and sustainability of a healthcare intervention are dependent on its acceptability, fidelity and feasibility. Furthermore, acceptability, fidelity and feasibility require re-evaluation over time and as the intervention is developed and then implemented in different settings or with different populations. The final agreed framework of implementability provides the basis for a chronological, iterative approach to planning for wide-scale, long-term implementation of healthcare interventions.                              Conclusions                We recommend that researchers consider the factors acceptability, fidelity and feasibility (proposed to influence sustainability and scalability) during the preliminary phases of intervention development, evaluation and implementation, and iteratively check these factors in different settings and over time.",

Mhealth appears particularly advantageous for conditions that require intense and ongoing monitoring, such as diabetes, and where people are of working age and not disabled. This review aims to evaluate the evidence for the effectiveness of mhealth interventions in diabetes management on glycosylated hemoglobin. Method: A comprehensive search strategy was developed and applied to eight electronic databases to identify studies that investigated the clinical effectiveness of mobile-based applications that allowed patients to record and send their blood glucose readings to a central server. The eligibility of 8543 papers was assessed against the selection criteria, and 24 papers were reviewed. All studies reviewed were assessed for quality using a standardized quality assessment tool. Results: Results for patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes were examined separately. Study variability and poor reporting made comparison difficult, and most studies had important methodological weaknesses. Evidence on the effectiveness of mhealth interventions for diabetes was inconsistent for both types of diabetes and remains weak.",

Health management, however, even when self-driven, is inherently social and depends on a person's direct relationships and broader sociocultural contexts, as an emerging line of research is coming to recognize, study, and support. This is particularly true in the case of mental health. In this paper, we engage with individuals managing the serious mental illness bipolar disorder and members of their support circles to (a) identify key social relations and the roles they play in condition management, (b) characterize patients' complex interactions with these relations (e.g., positive or negative, direct or peripheral, steady or unstable), and (c) understand how personal informatics mediates these recovery relations. Based on these insights, we offer a model of this social ecology, along with design implications for personal informatics systems that are sensitive to these interpersonal contexts.",

      "abstract": "Abstract                Background                The challenges of implementing evidence-based innovations (EBIs) are widely recognized among practitioners and researchers. Context, broadly defined as everything outside the EBI, includes the dynamic and diverse array of forces working for or against implementation efforts. The Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) is one of the most widely used frameworks to guide assessment of contextual determinants of implementation. The original 2009 article invited critique in recognition for the need for the framework to evolve. As implementation science has matured, gaps in the CFIR have been identified and updates are needed. Our team is developing the CFIR 2.0 based on a literature review and follow-up survey with authors. We propose an Outcomes Addendum to the CFIR to address recommendations from these sources to include outcomes in the framework.                              Main text                We conducted a literature review and surveyed corresponding authors of included articles to identify recommendations for the CFIR. There were recommendations to add both implementation and innovation outcomes from these sources. Based on these recommendations, we make conceptual distinctions between (1) anticipated implementation outcomes and actual implementation outcomes, (2) implementation outcomes and innovation outcomes, and (3) CFIR-based implementation determinants and innovation determinants.                              Conclusion                An Outcomes Addendum to the CFIR is proposed. Our goal is to offer clear conceptual distinctions between types of outcomes for use with the CFIR, and perhaps other determinant implementation frameworks as well. These distinctions can help bring clarity as researchers consider which outcomes are most appropriate to evaluate in their research. We hope that sharing this in advance will generate feedback and debate about the merits of our proposed addendum.",

Differences in access and use of DHTs across different demographic groups can contribute to inequities. Academics and policy makers have acknowledged this issue and called for inclusive digital health strategies. This systematic review synthesizes literature on these strategies and assesses facilitators and barriers to their implementation. We searched four large databases for qualitative studies using terms relevant to digital technology, health inequities, and socio-demographic factors associated with digital exclusion summarised by the CLEARS framework (Culture, Limiting conditions, Education, Age, Residence, Socioeconomic status). Following the PRISMA guidelines, 10,401 articles were screened independently by two reviewers, with ten articles meeting our inclusion criteria. Strategies were grouped into either outreach programmes or co-design approaches. Narrative synthesis of these strategies highlighted three key themes: firstly, using user-friendly designs, which included software and website interfaces that were easy to navigate and compatible with existing devices, culturally appropriate content, and engaging features. Secondly, providing supportive infrastructure to users, which included devices, free connectivity, and non-digital options to help access healthcare. Thirdly, providing educational support from family, friends, or professionals to help individuals develop their digital literacy skills to support the use of DHTs. Recommendations for advancing digital health equity include adopting a collaborative working approach to meet users’ needs, and using effective advertising to raise awareness of the available support. Further research is needed to assess the feasibility and impact of these recommendations in practice.",

      "abstract": "Background            Health care delivery continues to evolve, with an effort being made to create patient-centered care models using patient-reported outcomes (PROs) data. Collecting PROs has remained challenging and an expanding landscape of digital health offers a variety of methods to engage patients.                                Objective            The aim of this study is to prospectively investigate two common methods of remote PRO data collection. The study sought to compare response and engagement rates for bidirectional SMS text messaging and mobile surveys following orthopedic surgery.                                Methods            The study was a prospective, block randomized trial of adults undergoing elective orthopedic procedures over 6 weeks. The primary objective was to determine if the method of digital patient engagement would impact response and completion rates. The primary outcome was response rate and total completion of PRO questionnaires.                                Results            A total of 127 participants were block randomized into receiving a mobile survey (n=63) delivered as a hyperlink or responding to the same questions through an automated bidirectional SMS text messaging system (n=64). Gender, age, number of comorbidities, and opioid prescriptions were similar across messaging arms. Patients receiving the mobile survey were more likely to have had a knee-related surgery (n=50, 83.3% vs n=40, 62.5%; P=.02) but less likely to have had an invasive procedure (n=26, 41.3% vs n=39, 60.9%; P=.03). Overall engagement over the immediate postoperative period was similar. Prolonged engagement for patients taking opioids past postoperative day 4 was higher in the mobile survey arm at day 7 (18/19, 94.7% vs 9/16, 56.3%). Patients with more invasive procedures showed a trend toward being responsive at day 4 as compared to not responding (n=41, 59.4% vs n=24, 41.4%; P=.05).                                Conclusions            As mobile patient engagement becomes more common in health care, testing the various options to engage patients to gather data is crucial to inform future care and research. We found that bidirectional SMS text messaging and mobile surveys were comparable in response and engagement rates; however, mobile surveys may trend toward higher response rates over longer periods of time.

      "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundThe last decade has seen growing interest in scaling up of innovations to strengthen healthcare systems. However, the lack of appropriate methods for determining their potential for scale-up is an unfortunate global handicap. Thus, we aimed to review tools proposed for assessing the scalability of innovations in health.MethodsWe conducted a systematic review following the COSMIN methodology. We included any empirical research which aimed to investigate the creation, validation or interpretability of a scalability assessment tool in health. We searched Embase, MEDLINE, CINAHL, Web of Science, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library and ERIC from their inception to 20 March 2019. We also searched relevant websites, screened the reference lists of relevant reports and consulted experts in the field. Two reviewers independently selected and extracted eligible reports and assessed the methodological quality of tools. We summarized data using a narrative approach involving thematic syntheses and descriptive statistics.ResultsWe identified 31 reports describing 21 tools. Types of tools included criteria (47.6%), scales (33.3%) and checklists (19.0%). Most tools were published from 2010 onwards (90.5%), in open-access sources (85.7%) and funded by governmental or nongovernmental organizations (76.2%). All tools were in English; four were translated into French or Spanish (19.0%). Tool creation involved single (23.8%) or multiple (19.0%) types of stakeholders, or stakeholder involvement was not reported (57.1%). No studies reported involving patients or the public, or reported the sex of tool creators. Tools were created for use in high-income countries (28.6%), low- or middle-income countries (19.0%), or both (9.5%), or for transferring innovations from low- or middle-income countries to high-income countries (4.8%). Healthcare levels included public or population health (47.6%), primary healthcare (33.3%) and home care (4.8%). Most tools provided limited information on content validity (85.7%), and none reported on other measurement properties. The methodological quality of tools was deemed inadequate (61.9%) or doubtful (38.1%).ConclusionsWe inventoried tools for assessing the scalability of innovations in health. Existing tools are as yet of limited utility for assessing scalability in health. More work needs to be done to establish key psychometric properties of these tools.Trial registrationWe registered this review with PROSPERO (identifier: CRD42019107095)",

      "abstract": "Background            Mobile health (mHealth) approaches offer potentially affordable ways to support the care of HIV-infected patients in overstretched health care systems. However, only few studies have analyzed the costs associated with mHealth solutions for HIV care.                                Objective            The aim of this study was to estimate the total incremental costs and incremental cost per beneficiary of an interactive SMS text messaging support intervention within a clinical trial.                                Methods            The Mobile WAChX trial (NCT02400671) evaluates an interactive semiautomated SMS text messaging intervention to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy and retention in care among peripartum women infected with HIV in Kenya to reduce the mother-to-child transmission of HIV. Women were randomized to receive one-way versus two-way SMS text messages. Messages were sent weekly, and these messages included motivational and educational content and visit reminders; two-way messaging enabled prompt consultation with the nurse as needed. Microcosting methods were used to collect resource-use data related to implementing the Mobile WAChX SMS text messaging intervention. At 2 sites (Nairobi and Western Kenya), we conducted semistructured interviews with health personnel to identify startup and recurrent activities by obtaining information on the personnel, supplies, and equipment. Data on expenditures and prices from project expense reports, administrative records, and published government salary data were included to estimate the total incremental costs. Using a public provider perspective, we estimated incremental unit costs per beneficiary and per contact during 2017.                                Results            The weighted average annual incremental costs for the two-way SMS text messaging group were US $3725 per facility, US $62 per beneficiary, and US $0.85 per contact to reach 115 beneficiaries. For the one-way SMS text messaging group, the weighted average annual incremental costs were US $2542 per facility, US $41 per beneficiary, and US $0.66 per contact to reach 117 beneficiaries. The largest cost shares were for the personnel: 48.2% (US $1794/US $3725) in two-way and 32.4% (US $825/US $2542) in one-way SMS text messaging groups. Costs associated with software development and communication accounted for 29.9% (US $1872/US $6267) of the costs in both intervention arms (US $1042 vs US $830, respectively).                                Conclusions            Cost information for budgeting and financial planning is relevant for implementing mHealth interventions in national health plans. Given the proportion of costs related to systems development, it is likely that costs per beneficiary will decline with the scale-up of the interventions.",

      "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundObesity prevalence continues to increase worldwide, with significant associated chronic disease and health cost implications. Among more recent innovations in health service provision is the use of text messaging for health behaviour change interventions including weight management. This review investigates the efficacy of weight management programmes incorporating text messaging.MethodsMedical and scientific databases were searched from January 1993 to October 2013. Eligibility criteria included randomised controlled trials (RCTs), pseudoRCTs and before and after studies of weight management, among healthy children and adults, that used text messaging and included a nutrition component. Data extraction and quality assessment followed guidelines from PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta‐Analyses) and the Evidence Analysis Manual of the American Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.ResultsFrom 512 manuscripts retrieved, 14 met the inclusion criteria (five manuscripts in children and nine in adults). Duration of interventions ranged from 1 to 24 months. Frequency of text messaging was from daily to fortnightly. Six studies in adults were included in a meta‐analysis with mean body weight change as the primary outcome. The weighted mean change in body weight in intervention participants was −2.56 kg (95% confidence interval =  −3.46 to −1.65) and in controls −0.37 kg (95% confidence interval = −1.22 to 0.48).ConclusionsThe small body of evidence indicates that text messaging interventions can promote weight loss. However, lack of long‐term results indicate that further efficacy studies are required. Future investigations should elucidate the determinants, such as intervention duration, text message frequency and level of interactivity that maximise the success and cost effectiveness of the delivery medium.",

Methods We searched the databases PubMed, Embase, Informit, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO and Scopus for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published between January 2000 and April 2019. Studies comparing text messaging interventions to a comparator group for patients with depression were included in the review. Articles were assessed for quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist for RCTs. Results Nine RCTs (945 patients: 764 adults and 181 adolescents) were included in the systematic review. Five studies used text messaging as the only intervention, whilst the remaining combined text messaging with other treatment modalities such as behavioural activation or cognitive behavioural therapy. A meta-analysis was conducted on seven selected RCTs (845 patients: 664 adults and 181 adolescents). The standardised mean reduction in depression due to text messaging interventions was 0.23 (95% confidence interval: –0.02 to 0.48). There was evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effect between studies. Discussion There is marginal evidence supporting text messaging interventions as an effective treatment modality for people living with clinical depression. However, further research is needed to determine how best to utilise text-message interventions alongside other conventional forms of health services delivery.",

Design: Single-group repeated measures design. Setting: Post-secondary institution in British Columbia, Canada.\nMethods: Data concerning students’ sedentary behaviour were collected via online survey completed at three time points over the course of one university semester: baseline (T1), post-intervention (T2) and 2-week follow-up (T3). The 6-week intervention comprised four weekly text messages delivered to participants’ mobile devices. Participants’ attitudes regarding the intervention were evaluated together with other measures including constructs in the Health Action Process Approach (HAPA). Sedentary behaviour and physical activity were measured using the Physical Activity and Sedentary Behaviour Questionnaire (PASB-Q).\nResults: The intervention was generally well received by participants. Preliminary, observational data suggest some indices of user experience were statistically associated with behavioural outcomes and may inform future work. Hours per week of sedentary behaviour did not change across time points, whereas minutes per week of physical activity decreased significantly from baseline to follow-up.\nConclusion: While study findings suggest minor modifications to the intervention may improve participants’ engagement, we demonstrated overall that a theory-grounded, text message–based intervention to reduce sedentary behaviour can be feasibly implemented. The efficacy of this intervention should be tested through a randomised control trial with a representative sample of the student population.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Patient-reported outcome (PRO) instruments measure health status in a variety of domains. With the proliferation of mobile phones, delivering PROs across patient-friendly platforms (eg, apps, text messaging) may increase completion rates, particularly among children. The purpose of this study was to validate the collection of common knee PROs in sports medicine with text messaging by correlating text-messaging responses with paper delivery in adolescents. METHODS: Patients presenting to a hospital-based pediatric orthopaedic sports medicine clinic with a knee injury were enrolled prospectively. Paper versions of the Pediatric International Knee Documentation Committee (Pedi-IKDC) Subjective Knee Evaluation Form and the Pediatric Functional Activity Brief Scale (Pedi-Fab Scale) were completed during initial clinic visits. Over the next 72 hours, patients completed the text message delivery of the Pedi-IKDC and Pedi-Fab Scale. Correlations between paper and text message delivery of the 2 PROs were assessed. RESULTS: Ninety-one patients (mean age: 16.0+/-2.0 y; 48% females) enrolled in the text-messaging study, with 55 (60.4%) completing the Pedi-Fab Scale, 48 (52.7%) completing the Pedi-IKDC, and 39 (42.9%) completing both PROs. The intraclass correlation coefficient between the paper and mobile phone delivery of the Pedi-Fab Scale was 0.95 (P<0.001; 95% confidence interval, 0.91-0.97). The intraclass correlation coefficient between the paper and mobile phone delivery of the Pedi-IKDC was 0.96 (P<0.001; 95% confidence interval, 0.93-0.98). Average Pedi-Fab scores on paper (M=12.7) and mobile phone (M=12.3) were not significantly different (P=0.52). Similarly, average Pedi-IKDC scores on paper (M=68.8) and mobile phone (M=67.7) were not significantly different (P=0.41). Average completion time for the text delivered Pedi-Fab and Pedi-IKDC were 102+/-224 and 159+/-155 minutes, respectively. High school enrollment (P=0.025), female sex (P=0.036), and race (P=0.002) were significantly associated with text completion of Pedi-IKDC. CONCLUSIONS: Text message delivery using mobile phones permits valid assessment of Pedi-IKDC and Pedi-Fab scores in adolescents. Questionnaire delivery by automated text messaging allows asynchronous response and may increase compliance and reduce the labor cost of collecting PROs.

DESIGN:: This prospective cohort study used a text-messaging robot to survey concussed athletes using the CSSS 5-times daily while they remained symptomatic. SETTING:: Academic sports concussion clinic at a large tertiary care medical center. PARTICIPANTS:: Fourteen 14- to 22-year-old athletes with clinically diagnosed concussions were enrolled. All were injured in sport, still in season, English speaking, and used a cellular telephone to text message on a regular basis. ASSESSMENT OF RISK FACTORS:: This study did not collect any demographic or other information about the subjects. The only data collected were the individual responses to the questions in the Post Concussion Symptom Score (PCSS). The only aim of this study was to evaluate the variability in responses to the CSSS, which is calculated from the PCSS. MAIN OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS:: The primary outcome measure was a repeatability coefficient from a random-effects model. Concussion Symptom Severity Score, mean daily CSSS, and standard deviation of CSSS differences from the mean were also calculated. RESULTS:: Mean follow-up was 23.9 days. A total of 24 180 text messages were received from subjects. Eight hundred four complete surveys were analyzed. Repeatability coefficient was ±23.1. CONCLUSIONS:: When surveyed frequently by a text-messaging robot, concussed athletes report poorly repeatable Sport Concussion Assessment Tool 2 (SCAT2) Symptom Severity Scores. CLINICAL RELEVANCE:: The SCAT2 Symptom Severity Score may be an invalid method of tracking concussion severity and resolution over time. Language: en",

Descriptive and comparative analyses were performed.ResultsOne thousand three hundred and eighty‐two FFA members aged 13‐18 years participated. The vast majority (85%) had fired a rifle/shotgun; 58% reported firing them >20 times. Of those who had fired rifles/shotguns, 32% had done so before 9 years old; 79% before 13 years. Most had also fired a handgun (62%), with 30% having fired handguns >20 times. Of those who had fired handguns, 34% had done so before 11 years old. The average age for first firing rifles/shotguns was 10.1 (SD 2.9) years, and 11.9 (SD 2.8) years for handguns. Males, older teenagers, and those living on farms or in the country had significantly greater percentages that had fired a rifle/shotgun or a handgun. Greater proportions of males had used firearms >20 times and started firing them at younger ages. Over half (55%) reported having gone hunting. Of those, 24% first hunted before 9 years old; 48% before 11 years. Of those who had used a firearm, 61% had completed a firearm safety training course. For hunters, 80% had taken a course.ConclusionsMost participants had used firearms, and many did so at very young ages. Substantial numbers had not received formal training. The authors believe that families should be counseled when it is developmentally appropriate to introduce youth to firearms, and all should take firearm safety training before using them.",

At baseline, participants were classified into five PA levels: inactive’ (0 metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-h/week), ’lower insufficiently active’ (0.1–3.75 MET-h/week), ’upper insufficiently active’ (3.75–7.49 MET-h/week), ’active’ (7.5–14.99 MET-h/week) and ’highly active’ (≥15 MET-h/week]. CVD risk factors were assessed at baseline and at follow-up by physical examination and laboratory tests. Analyses were performed with Cox regression and adjusted for the main confounders. results During a mean follow-up of 6.0±4.5 years (range 0.5–19 years), 20 447 individuals developed obesity, 19 619 hypertension, 21 592 hypercholesterolaemia, 14 164 atherogenic dyslipidaemia, 24 275 metabolic syndrome and 8548 type 2 diabetes. Compared with inactive participants, those in the upper insufficiently active (but not active) category had a lower risk of obesity (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.88 to 0.95), atherogenic dyslipidaemia (0.96; 0.90 to 0.99), metabolic syndrome (0.95; 0.92 to 0.99) and type 2 diabetes (0.91; 0.86 to 0.97). Only highly active individuals showed a lower incidence of CVD risk factors than their upper insufficiently active counterparts.\nConclusion Compared with being inactive, doing half the recommended amount of PA is associated with a lower incidence of several common biological CVD risk factors. Given these benefits, half the recommended amount of PA is an evidence based target for inactive adults.",

Technical limitations, low compliance, and complex procedures limit their use. The aim of the present study was to test the accuracy of a new photoplethysmography-based, wearable device (Wrist-monitor) as compared with the standard cuff-based ABPM device.\nMETHODS: Twenty-four-hour (24H) ABPM was performed in parallel for both devices on volunteers aged 18-65 years, while documenting their daily activities. Level of comfort and activity disturbance of both devices were recorded. Linear regression and Bland-Altman were used to evaluate the agreement between devices. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to classify hypertension based on the average Wrist-monitor measurements as compared with a cuff-based ABPM device.\nRESULTS: The study included 28 subjects (18 men) mean age 41.5 ± 16.2 years. Bland-Altman analysis resulted in 24H bias of -1.1 mm Hg for both diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Mean daytime bias was -1.9 mm Hg for DBP and SBP, while nighttime bias was smaller (0.7 and 0.4 mm Hg for DBP and SBP, respectively). ROC curve analysis yielded a mean area under the curve (AUC) of 1 for SBP and 24H blood pressure measurements. AUCs of 0.994 and 0.955 were found for the daytime DBP and night DBP, respectively. 24H ABPM with the Wrist-monitor caused significantly less inconvenience compared with the cuff-based device (P < 0.001).\nCONCLUSIONS: The cuffless device provides comparable measurements to those obtained with the currently used cuff-based ABPM device, with significantly less inconvenience to the subject.\nCLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: Trial Number NCT03810586.",

The aim of this study was to document the effect of add-on treatment with structured physical exercise in a clinical population of adolescents hospitalized for depression and anxiety in a psychiatric hospital.\nMethods: A group of 52 adolescent inpatients was randomly assigned to a physical exercise or control program three to four times per week over a six-week period (20 hours in total). The primary outcome was the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS) for evaluation of depression and anxiety symptoms. Secondary outcomes were psychological self-assessments, diagnostic interviews, and physical examinations.\nResults: Six participants were lost in each group, leaving 20 inpatients each in the intervention and control groups. A linear mixed model with F-test revealed a significant interaction in favor of physical exercise in reducing the mean depression score (HADS-D) by 3.8 points [95% (CI), range 1.8 to 5.7], compared to a mean reduction score of 0.7 [95% (CI), range -0,7 to 2.0] in the control group. No significant interaction was found for anxiety symptoms (HADS-A). Limitations: The investigation was limited to the six-week hospital window and the small sample size prevented exploring differences in social characteristics.\nConclusion: Structured physical exercise add-on therapy integrated into the psychiatric hospitalization of adolescents has led to a reduction in their depressive symptoms, demonstrating its effectiveness in the care of adolescent inpatients with depression.",

      "abstract": "Background Adolescence presents a window of opportunity to establish good nutrition and physical activity behaviours to carry throughout the life course. Adolescents are at risk of developing cardiovascular and other chronic diseases due to poor the complex interplay of physical and mental health lifestyle risk factors. Text messaging is adolescents main form of everyday communication and text message programs offer a potential solution for support and improvement of lifestyle health behaviours. The primary aim of this study is to determine effectiveness of the Health4Me text message program to improve adolescent’s physical activity or nutrition behaviours among adolescents over 6-months, compared to usual care. Methods Health4Me is a virtual, two-arm, single-blind randomised controlled trial, delivering a 6-month healthy lifestyle text message program with optional health counselling. Recruitment will be through digital advertising and primary care services. In total, 390 adolescents will be randomised 1:1 to intervention or control (usual care) groups. The intervention group will receive 4–5 text messages per week for 6-months. All text messages have been co-designed with adolescents. Messages promote a healthy lifestyle by providing practical information, health tips, motivation and support for behaviour change for physical activity, nutrition, mental health, body image, popular digital media and climate and planetary health. Virtual assessments will occur at baseline and 6-months assessing physical health (physical activity, nutrition, body mass index, sleep), mental health (quality of life, self-efficacy, psychological distress, anxiety, depression, eating disorder risk) and lifestyle outcomes (food insecurity and eHealth literacy). Discussion This study will determine the effectiveness of a 6-month healthy lifestyle text message intervention to improve physical activity and nutrition outcomes in adolescents.

This study tested the impact on glycemic control of a two-way text messaging program that provided behavioral coaching, education, and testing reminders to enrolled individuals with type 2 diabetes in the context of a clinic-based quality improvement initiative. The secondary aim examined patient interaction and satisfaction with the program.               Methods. Ninety-three adult patients with poorly controlled type 2 diabetes (A1C &gt;8%) were recruited from 18 primary care clinics in three counties for a 6-month study. Patients were randomized by a computer to one of two arms. Patients in both groups continued with their usual care; patients assigned to the intervention arm also received from one to seven diabetes-related text messages per day depending on the choices they made at enrollment. At 90 and 180 days, A1C data were obtained from the electronic health record and analyzed to determine changes from baseline for both groups. An exit survey was used to assess satisfaction. Enrollment behavior and interaction data were pulled from a Web-based administrative portal maintained by the technology vendor.               Results. Patients used the program in a variety of ways. Twenty-nine percent of program users demonstrated frequent engagement (texting responses at least three times per week) for a period of ≥90 days. Survey results indicate very high satisfaction with the program. Both groups’ average A1C decreased from baseline, possibly reflecting a broader quality improvement effort underway in participating clinics. At 90 and 180 days, there was no statistically significant difference between the intervention and control groups in terms of change in A1C (P &gt;0.05).               Conclusions. This study demonstrated a practical approach to implementing and monitoring a mobile health intervention for self-management support across a wide range of independent clinic practices.",

      "abstract": "The essential oil (EO) of plants of the Poaceae family has diverse chemical constituents with several biological properties. But, data on the chemical constituents and toxicity are still unavailable for some species belonging to this family, such as Euclasta condylotricha Steud (Eu. condylotricha). In this study, the chemical composition of the EOs of Eu. condylotricha flowers was evaluated by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC–MS). The EOs larvicidal property was assessed against third instar larvae of three Anopheles gambiae laboratory strains (Kisumu, Acerkis and Kiskdr) according to the WHO standard protocol. The percentage yields of the EOs obtained from hydro distillation of Eu. condylotricha flowers varied 0.070 to 0.097%. Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (GC-MS) applied to the EOs revealed fifty-five (55) chemical constituents, representing 94.95% to 97.78% of the total essential oils. Although different chemical profiles of the dominant terpenes were observed for each sample, EOs were generally dominated by sesquiterpenoids with juvenile hormones as the major compounds. The primary compounds were juvenile hormone C16 (JH III) (35.97–48.72%), Methyl farnesoate 10,11-diol (18.56–28.73%), tau-Cadinol (18.54%), and β-Eudesmene (12.75–13.46%). Eu. condylotricha EOs showed a strong larvicidal activity with LC50 values ranging from 35.21 to 52.34 ppm after 24 hours of exposition. This study showed that Eu. Condylotricha flowers essential oils are potent sources of juvenile hormones that could be a promising tool for developing an eco-friendly malaria vector control strategy.",

      "abstract": "ObjectiveHuman gait requires complex somatosensory processing of various inputs such as proprioception. Proprioception can be altered in the presence of pain. This has been shown mostly during controlled tasks, thereby limiting the influence of external perturbations. While controlling the environment is sometimes warranted, it limits the ecological validity of the data. Using robotic orthoses to apply perturbations during movements seems a promising tool to functionally assess proprioception, where the complex somatosensory processing required in real-life situations is at play. The main objective of this study was to compare the proprioceptive threshold of healthy participants during gait in the presence and absence of an acute experimental pain.Methods36 healthy participants walked on a treadmill while wearing a robotized ankle–foot orthosis (rAFO) around their right ankle. The rAFO applied torque perturbations of graded magnitudes during the swing phase of gait. Participants had to report the presence/absence of such perturbations, as a measure of proprioceptive threshold. Following initial assessment, they were randomly assigned to one of three experimental groups: Control (no stimulation), Painless (non-nociceptive stimulation) and Painful (nociceptive stimulation). Electrodes placed on the right lateral malleolus delivered an electrical stimulation during the second assessment for Painless and Painful groups. A Kruskal-Wallis was used to compare the percentage of change of the three groups between the two assessments.ResultsA 31.80±32.94% increase in proprioceptive threshold, representing an increase of 1.3±1.2 Nm in the detection threshold, was observed for the Painful group only (p<0.005), with an effect size of 1.6.ConclusionFindings show that the presence of pain at the ankle can alter participants’ proprioceptive threshold during gait. Clinical assessment of proprioception should therefore carefully consider the presence of pain when evaluating a patient’s performance using clinical proprioceptive test and consider the negative effect of pain on proprioceptive threshold for test interpretation.",

Smokers and nonsmokers rated up to six brief messages about the chemicals in cigarette smoke on two PME scales. The first was the new three-item University of North Carolina (UNC) PME Scale that assessed effects perceptions. The second was an established six-item PME scale that assessed message perceptions. We examined the UNC PME Scale’s psychometric properties and compared both scales using item factor analysis.ResultsThe UNC PME Scale measured the same construct across multiple chemical messages (all factor loadings ≥ 0.86). It exhibited high reliability (>0.85) over very low to moderate levels of PME (z = −2.5 to 0.2), a range that is useful for identifying more promising messages. Samples of adults and adolescents showed a similar pattern of results. As expected, the UNC PME Scale was strongly positively correlated with message perceptions (r = .84). It also exhibited strong psychometric properties among participants regardless of education, reactance, sex, and smoking status.DiscussionThe UNC PME Scale reliably and validly measured PME among adults and adolescents from diverse groups. This brief scale may be used to efficiently evaluate candidate antismoking messages and may be suitable for adaptation to other health risk behaviors.",

      "abstract": "This review provides a detailed overview of how digital health can be utilized in the management of Interstitial Lung Disease (ILD), and Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD). ILD encompasses a diverse range of lung disorders characterized by inflammation and scarring of lung tissue, leading to restrictive lung physiology and impaired gas exchange, with symptoms including progressive dyspnoea, cough, and hypoxia. COPD which ranks as the third leading cause of death globally, is characterized by chronic lung inflammation causing irreversible airflow obstruction, recurrent exacerbations. While recent advances in digital health have shown promise, predicting disease progression in patients with ILD and exacerbation in patients with COPD remains challenging. This review explores the role of digital health in managing ILD and COPD, particularly focusing on telehealth and digital health technologies. Telehealth, defined broadly as the use of electronic information and telecommunications technologies in healthcare, has become increasingly relevant, especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. This review examines the role of digital health technologies in the management of ILD and COPD, with particular focus on telemedicine, and digital health tools. Remote monitoring technologies, including home spirometry and wearable devices, have demonstrated feasibility in managing respiratory diseases. However, challenges such as evidence, data reliability, varying adherence, education, and the high costs of data collection and lack of qualified clinicians present barriers for many national health systems.",

      "abstract": "Background            Mobile health (mHealth) apps have great potential to support the management of chronic conditions. Despite widespread acceptance of mHealth apps by the public, health care providers (HCPs) are reluctant to prescribe or recommend such apps to their patients.                                Objective            This study aimed to classify and evaluate interventions aimed at encouraging HCPs to prescribe mHealth apps.                                Methods            A systematic literature search was conducted to identify studies published from January 1, 2008, to August 5, 2022, using 4 electronic databases: MEDLINE, Scopus, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. We included studies that evaluated interventions encouraging HCPs to prescribe mHealth apps. Two review authors independently assessed the eligibility of the studies. The “National Institute of Health’s quality assessment tool for before-and-after (pretest-posttest design) studies with no control group” and “the mixed methods appraisal tool (MMAT)” were used to assess the methodological quality. Owing to high levels of heterogeneity between interventions, measures of practice change, specialties of HCPs, and modes of delivery, we conducted a qualitative analysis. We adopted the behavior change wheel as a framework for classifying the included interventions according to intervention functions.                                Results            In total, 11 studies were included in this review. Most of the studies reported positive findings, with improvements in a number of outcomes, including increased knowledge of mHealth apps among clinicians, improved self-efficacy or confidence in prescribing, and an increased number of mHealth app prescriptions. On the basis of the behavior change wheel, 9 studies reported elements of environmental restructuring such as providing HCPs with lists of apps, technological systems, time, and resources. Furthermore, 9 studies included elements of education, particularly workshops, class lectures, individual sessions with HCPs, videos, or toolkits. Furthermore, training was incorporated in 8 studies using case studies or scenarios or app appraisal tools. Coercion and restriction were not reported in any of the interventions included. The quality of the studies was high in relation to the clarity of aims, interventions, and outcomes but weaker in terms of sample size, power calculations, and duration of follow-up.                                Conclusions            This study identified interventions to encourage app prescriptions by HCPs. Recommendations for future research should consider previously unexplored intervention functions such as restrictions and coercion. The findings of this review can help inform mHealth providers and policy makers regarding the key intervention strategies impacting mHealth prescriptions and assist them in making informed decisions to encourage this adoption.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundAdherence rates of preventative medication for cardiovascular disease (CVD) have been reported as 57%, and approximately 9% of all CVD events in Europe are attributable to poor medication adherence. Mobile health technologies, particularly mobile apps, have the potential to improve medication adherence and clinical outcomes.ObjectiveThe objective of this study is to assess the effects of mobile health care apps on medication adherence and health-related outcomes in patients with CVD. This study also evaluates apps’ functionality and usability and the involvement of health care professionals in their use.MethodsElectronic databases (MEDLINE [Ovid], PubMed Central, Cochrane Library, CINAHL Plus, PsycINFO [Ovid], Embase [Ovid], and Google Scholar) were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to investigate app-based interventions aimed at improving medication adherence in patients with CVD. RCTs published in English from inception to January 2020 were reviewed. The Cochrane risk of bias tool was used to assess the included studies. Meta-analysis was performed for clinical outcomes and medication adherence, with meta-regression analysis used to evaluate the impact of app intervention duration on medication adherence.ResultsThis study included 16 RCTs published within the last 6 years. In total, 12 RCTs reported medication adherence as the primary outcome, which is the most commonly self-reported adherence. The duration of the interventions ranged from 1 to 12 months, and sample sizes ranged from 24 to 412. Medication adherence rates showed statistically significant improvements in 9 RCTs when compared with the control, and meta-analysis of the 6 RCTs reporting continuous data showed a significant overall effect in favor of the app intervention (mean difference 0.90, 95% CI 0.03-1.78) with a high statistical heterogeneity (I2=93.32%). Moreover, 9 RCTs assessed clinical outcomes and reported an improvement in systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels in the intervention arm. Meta-analysis of these clinical outcomes from 6 RCTs favored app interventions, but none were significant. In the 7 trials evaluating app usability, all were found to be acceptable. There was a great variation in the app characteristics. A total of 10 RCTs involved health care professionals, mainly physicians and nurses, in the app-based interventions. The apps had mixed functionality: 2 used education, 7 delivered reminders, and 7 provided reminders in combination with educational support.ConclusionsApps tended to increase medication adherence, but interventions varied widely in design, content, and delivery. Apps have an acceptable degree of usability; yet the app characteristics conferring usability and effectiveness are ill-defined. Future large-scale studies should focus on identifying the essential active components of successful apps.Trial RegistrationPROSPERO International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews CRD42019121385; https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=121385",

CDMs unite data from disparate sources and ease collaborations across institutions, resulting in the generation of large standardized data repositories across different entities. An overview of existing CDMs and methods used to develop these data sets may assist in the development process of future models for the health domain, such as for decision support systems.                                Objective            This scoping review investigates methods used in the development of CDMs for health data. We aim to provide a broad overview of approaches and guidelines that are used in the development of CDMs (ie, common data elements or common data sets) for different health domains on an international level.                                Methods            This scoping review followed the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist. We conducted the literature search in prominent databases, namely, PubMed, Web of Science, Science Direct, and Scopus, starting from January 2000 until March 2022. We identified and screened 1309 articles. The included articles were evaluated based on the type of adopted method, which was used in the conception, users’ needs collection, implementation, and evaluation phases of CDMs, and whether stakeholders (such as medical experts, patients’ representatives, and IT staff) were involved during the process. Moreover, the models were grouped into iterative or linear types based on the imperativeness of the stages during development.                                Results            We finally identified 59 articles that fit our eligibility criteria. Of these articles, 45 specifically focused on common medical conditions, 10 focused on rare medical conditions, and the remaining 4 focused on both conditions. The development process usually involved stakeholders but in different ways (eg, working group meetings, Delphi approaches, interviews, and questionnaires). Twenty-two models followed an iterative process.                                Conclusions            The included articles showed the diversity of methods used to develop a CDM in different domains of health. We highlight the need for more specialized CDM development methods in the health domain and propose a suggestive development process that might ease the development of CDMs in the health domain in the future.",

      "abstract": "Objective To conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis of the facilitators of and barriers to the acceptance and use of digital health technology by health workers in low- and middle-income countries.\nMethods We searched several databases for relevant articles published until 25 April 2024. We extracted data on four unified theories of acceptance and use of technology factors (performance expectancy, effort expectancy, social influence and facilitating conditions) and six additional factors (attitude, habit, incentive, risk, trust and self-efficacy); how these affected the outcomes of behavioural intention and actual use; and the strength of association if reported. We conducted a meta-analysis of the quantitative studies. Findings We reviewed 36 publications, 20 of which were included in our meta-analysis. We observed that performance expectancy was the most frequently reported facilitator (in 21 studies; 58.3%) and that lack of facilitating conditions was the most cited barrier (10; 27.8%). From our meta-analysis, trust (r = 0.53; 95% confidence interval, CI: 0.18 to 0.76) and facilitating conditions (r = 0.42; 95% CI: 0.27 to 0.55) were the leading facilitators of behavioural intention and actual use, respectively. We identified concerns with performance expectancy (r = −0.14, 95% CI: −0.29 to 0.01) as the primary barrier to both outcomes.\nConclusion Our approach of clustering the facilitators of and barriers to the acceptance and use of digital health technology from the perspective of health workers highlighted the importance of creating an enabling ecosystem. Supportive infrastructure, tailored training programmes and incentive policies should be incorporated in the implementation of digital health programmes in low- and middle-income countries.",

Even when these systems are usable, people encounter barriers while engaging with them in ways designers cannot anticipate, which impacts the system's effectiveness. Although PI literature extensively reports such barriers, the volume of this information can be overwhelming. Researchers and practitioners often find themselves repeatedly addressing the same challenges since sifting through this enormous volume of knowledge looking for relevant insights is often infeasible. We contribute to alleviating this issue by conducting a meta-synthesis of the PI literature and categorizing people's barriers and facilitators to engagement with PI systems into eight themes. Based on the synthesized knowledge, we discuss specific generalizable barriers and paths for further investigations. This synthesis can serve as an index to identify barriers pertinent to each application domain and possibly to identify barriers from one domain that might apply to a different domain. Finally, to ensure the sustainability of the syntheses, we propose a Design Statements (DS) block for research articles.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Parents of children in the pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) experience substantial stress; a parent’s perception of their child’s illness severity, more than objective measures, predicts psychological outcomes. No tools exist to assess parents’ real-time experiences. This pilot study evaluated the feasibility and acceptability of a text-based tool to measure parental experience.\nMethods: Inclusion criteria included PICU stay >48 h, physician approval, smartphone access, and English-speaking caregiver. Eligible parents received a text-based baseline survey and surveys every other day while hospitalized regarding their mood/experiences and optional open-ended questions regarding stressors. They received post-discharge follow-up surveys at 1 week and 1, 3, and 6 months. Follow-up surveys assessed mood and symptoms of depression, anxiety, and post-traumatic stress. Interviews and surveys about the interface were conducted 1 week and 3 months following discharge. Feasibility was assessed by descriptive statistics (eg, response rates), and acceptability was assessed by descriptive statistics (survey results) and thematic analyses of interviews.\nResults: Of 20 enrolled participants, the ﬁrst 5 were excluded due to technical issues. Of the 15 included, results demonstrated feasibility and acceptability. Most participants (86%) completed all surveys during the PICU stay and continued to complete surveys at a high rate: 79%–94% 3 months post-discharge. All participants agreed that the system was easy to use and were satisﬁed with the system at discharge, and 91% remained satisﬁed 3 months post-discharge. Additionally, 76% reported comfort, and 69% reported beneﬁt. From the interviews, participants lauded the system’s convenience and applicability of content. Some proposed changes to improve ergonomics. Many suggested this interface could help teams better support families.\nConclusions: A text-based interface for measuring experience in the PICU is feasible and acceptable to parents. Further research can explore how this could identify parents most at risk of adverse psychological sequelae and lead to earlier supportive interventions.",

Evidence for the content validity and other measurement properties of these PROMs is critical to determine which HRQL PROMs could be recommended for use.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              To systematically review the validity of HRQL-focused PROMs used in patients with psoriasis.\n            \n            \n              Evidence Review\n              Using PubMed and Embase, full-text articles published in English or Spanish on development or validation studies for psoriasis-specific, dermatology-specific, or generic HRQL PROMs were included. Development studies included original development studies, even if not studied in psoriasis patients per Consensus-Based Standards for the Selection of Health Measurement Instruments (COSMIN) recommendations. If a study included multiple diagnoses, more than 50% of patients had to have psoriasis or psoriasis-specific subgroup analyses available. Data extraction and analysis followed the COSMIN guidelines. Two independent reviewers extracted and analyzed the data, including PROM characteristics, quality of measurement properties (structural validity, internal consistency, cross-cultural validity, reliability, measurement error, criterion validity, construct validity, and responsiveness), and level of evidence. PROMs were classified into 3 levels of recommendations: (1) PROM recommended for use; (2) PROM requires further validation; and (3) PROM not recommended for use.\n            \n            \n              Findings\n              Overall, 97 articles were identified for extraction. This included 19 psoriasis-specific, 8 skin-specific, and 6 generic PROMs. According to COSMIN standards, most measures identified received a B recommendation for use, indicating their potential but requiring further validation. Only the Rasch reduced version of the Impact of Psoriasis Questionnaire (IPSO-11 Rasch) received an A recommendation for use given that it had sufficient content validity, structural validity, and internal consistency.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions and Relevance\n              This study identified a significant lack of information concerning the quality of HRQL measures in psoriasis. This gap in knowledge can be attributed to the fact that traditional measures were developed using validation criteria that differ from the current standards in use. Consequently, additional validation studies in accordance with contemporary standards will be useful in aiding researchers and clinicians in determining the most suitable measure for assessing HRQL in patients with psoriasis.",

The research comprised two sub-studies, a pilot randomised controlled trial testing the intervention (10 intervention, n = 79 and 10 control schools, n = 58), and an investigation of the perceptions of participating educators and principals. Feasibility outcomes included reach, applicability, acceptability, implementation integrity, and a hypothesis-generating signal of effect on lifestyle factors and weight. The intervention consisted of a wellness day, weight loss manual, and text messages. Results indicated acceptable reach, with positive feedback on intervention components from principals and educators. Implementation was largely successful, though three schools dropped out due to scheduling issues. Barriers included interruption of teaching time and busy school schedules. The intervention group (n = 42) showed favourable shifts in belief patterns, stages of change, and lifestyle behaviours, with a trend towards weight loss. Control group (n = 43) changes were limited to dietary intake. The triangulation of results supported the intervention’s feasibility in terms of primary and secondary outcomes. Recommendations for enhancement include adding in-person follow-up sessions and an app-based element to potentially increase impact on lifestyle indicators and weight loss.",

      "abstract": "Background Inadequate pain relief with moderate to severe pain remains a challenge after cesarean section and may significantly impair postoperative recovery. However, detailed assessment on the timing of severe pain, opioid consumption, influence on activities such as mobilization, breastfeeding, and caring for the infant are difficult to conduct, especially after discharge. Short message services (SMS)-based questionnaires may offer a low-cost way of providing such data but with the risk of insufficient response rates. We assessed the feasibility of collecting detailed, prospective data on postoperative pain and recovery during the initial hours and days following cesarean section using SMS-based questionnaires. Methods Prospective Danish single-center cohort study involving elective cesarean sections under spinal anesthesia with fentanyl and bupivacaine. The postoperative pain regimen consisted of paracetamol, NSAID and oral morphine by request. Patients received an SMS-based questionnaire at 6, 12, 18, 24, and 48 h postoperatively, as well as on days 7 and 30. Primary outcome: Response rate and time from receiving the SMS to completion of the questionnaires. Secondary outcomes: Opioid consumption and Patient Reported Outcomes Measures on pain and recovery. Results From December 2022 to June 2023; 100 patients were included. The response rate was 78% at 6 h postoperatively, decreasing to 63% at 24 h. The median response time from receiving to answering the SMS-based questionnaire at 6 h after cesarean section was 23 min (IQR 2–72), decreasing to 20 min (IQR 2–78) after 24 h. Severe pain, corresponding to a Numeric Rating Scale (NRS) score >6, was reported by 57% (95% CI 65–84) at 6 h, decreasing to 28% (95% CI 34–58) at 24 h. Median opioid consumption within the first 24 h was 30 mg (IQR 20–50). Conclusion SMS-based questionnaires on Patient Reported Outcome Measures are a feasible and cost-effective way of prospectively collecting frequent data with acceptable response rates, even shortly after cesarean section. Secondarily 66% of patients reported severe pain during the first 24 h following cesarean section, with the highest pain scores within the initial 12 h. Future studies should focus on optimizing pain-management within this timeframe.",

The intervention group received four text messages per week for six months. Self-reported measures of lifestyle habits were collected through a questionnaire at baseline and after six months.

      "abstract": "Background            As the optimal treatment for end-stage renal disease, kidney transplantation has proven instrumental in enhancing patient survival and quality of life. Suboptimal medication adherence is recognized as an independent risk factor for poor prognosis, graft rejection, and graft loss. In recent years, the advancement of IT has facilitated the integration of eHealth technologies into medical medication management, offering potential solutions to improve patient adherence. However, their efficacy in kidney transplant recipients remains inconclusive.                                Objective            This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of eHealth interventions in improving medication adherence among kidney transplant recipients and identify potential influencing factors.                                Methods            We systematically searched PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, Embase, CINAHL, Scopus, and Ovid databases for randomized controlled trials evaluating eHealth interventions targeting immunosuppressant medication adherence in kidney transplant recipients. The search time frame spanned from database inception to November 2024. Two investigators independently screened studies, extracted data, and assessed outcomes. Primary outcomes included adherence measured by self-reported questionnaires, electronic monitoring devices, tacrolimus trough levels, intrapatient variability of tacrolimus concentrations, and the proportion of patients achieving a tacrolimus coefficient of variation <40%. Meta-analyses were performed for dichotomous data and continuous data, while narrative synthesis was applied to single studies or data unsuitable for meta-analysis. Subgroup analyses were conducted to determine whether results differed based on adherence assessment methods, follow-up duration, eHealth functionalities, delivery modes, and intervention designs. Risk of bias and evidence quality were evaluated using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 tool and the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach, respectively.                                Results            A total of 12 studies involving 1234 kidney transplant recipients were included. Significant between-group differences in adherence were observed only when assessed via electronic monitoring devices (risk ratio=1.46, P=.006; mean difference=0.37, P<.001). However, sensitivity analyses using the leave-one-out method demonstrated instability in these findings. Conflicting results or nonsignificant differences (P>.05) were identified across other outcome measures and subgroup analyses.                                Conclusions            No definitive conclusions can be drawn regarding the efficacy of eHealth interventions in improving medication adherence among kidney transplant recipients, potentially due to heterogeneity in trial designs, intervention characteristics, user preferences, and variations in adherence definitions and measurement methodologies. These uncertainties are underscored by the low or very low quality of evidence, as assessed using the Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. While eHealth holds promise, methodological refinements in study design and implementation remain critical. Future research should prioritize high-quality, large-scale evidence to validate its clinical efficacy.

We will additionally assess the impact of EndoSMS on self-efficacy for managing endometriosis. A two-arm parallel pilot randomised controlled trial with waitlist control was conducted. Baseline assessments included QoL, psychological distress, self-efficacy, demographic and medical variables. Following baseline survey completion, participants were randomised to either the Intervention (EndoSMS: 3-months of text messaging) or Control condition. At 3-month follow-up, all participants completed an online survey reassessing outcomes, and Intervention participants provided quantitative and qualitative user feedback on EndoSMS. Data collection commenced on 18 November 2021 and was completed on 30 March 2022. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyse feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Preliminary efficacy analyses will be conducted using linear mixed models for QoL, psychological distress and self-efficacy outcomes. Subgroup analyses will also be conducted for typically underserved populations (e.g., rural/regional). This pilot will provide acceptability, feasibility and preliminary efficacy evidence for the impact of a supportive text messaging program for endometriosis. It will contribute to understanding how to optimally support individuals in living with and managing their endometriosis. Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry.",

      "abstract": "Background COVID-19 lockdowns caused widespread closures of supportive care services for breast cancer survivors in Australia. In a randomized controlled trial, our team’s lifestyle-focused, evidence-based SMS text message support program (EMPOWER-SMS COVID-19) was found to be acceptable and useful for breast cancer survivors, and it was ready for rapid widespread delivery. Objective This study aims to evaluate the reach (uptake) of an adapted 3-month lifestyle-focused SMS text message program (EMPOWER-SMS COVID-19) and barriers and enablers to implementation using the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) framework. Methods A mixed methods pre-post study was conducted to evaluate the EMPOWER-SMS COVID-19 program. The study evaluated the following aspects: (1) reach/representativeness, which refers to the proportion of participant enrollment (ie, number enrolled/number that visited the study website) and demographics (eg, age, sex, ethnicity, time since completing treatment, Index of Relative Socio-economic Advantage and Disadvantage [IRSAD; quintile 1, which refers to most disadvantaged areas, to quintile 5, which refers to least disadvantaged areas, and remoteness); (2) effectiveness, in which participant engagement and acceptability were evaluated using SMS text message reply data and a feedback survey (5-point Likert scale and free-text responses); (3) adoption, which corresponds to the proportion of organizations or health professionals who agreed to promote the program; (4) implementation fidelity and maintenance, which evaluated SMS text message delivery data, opt-outs, costs, and adaptations. Quantitative data were summarized using means and SDs or frequencies and percentages, while qualitative data were analyzed thematically. Results With regard to the reach/representativeness of the program, 841/1340 (62.8%) participants enrolled and provided electronic consent. Participants had a mean age of 58.8 (SD 9.8; range 30-87) years. According to the data collected, most participants identified as female (837/840, 99.6%) and White (736/840, 87.6%) and nearly half (418/841, 49.7%) finished treatment ≤18 months ago. Most resided in major cities (574/838, 68.5%) and 30% (251/838) in IRSAD quintile 1 or 2. In terms of effectiveness, 852 replies were received from 511 unique participants (median 1; range 1-26). The most common replies were participants stating how they heard about the program (467/852, 54.8%) or “thank you” (131/852, 15.4%). None of the replies contained urgent safety concerns. Among participants who provided feedback (449/841, 53.4%), most “(strongly) agreed” the SMS text messages were easy to understand (445/448, 99.3%), useful (373/440, 84.8%), helped participants feel supported (388/448, 86.6%), and motivated participants to be physically active (312/445, 70.1%) and eat healthier (313/457, 68.5%). Free-text responses revealed 5 factors influencing engagement: (1) feeling supported and less alone, (2) motivation and reassurance for health self-management, (3) the variety of information, (4) weblinks to information and resources, and (5) the option to save the SMS text messages. Concerning adoption, 50% (18/36) of organizations/health professionals agreed to promote the program. With regard to implementation/maintenance, SMS text messages were delivered as planned (97.43% [41,257/42,344] of SMS text messages were successfully delivered) with minimal opt-outs (62/838, 7.4%) and low cost (Aus $15.40/participant; Aus $1=US $0.67). No adaptations were made during the intervention period. Postintervention adaptations included adding weblinks and participant-selected customizations. Conclusions EMPOWER-SMS COVID-19 was implemented quickly, had a broad reach, and had high engagement and acceptability among socioeconomically diverse participants. The program had high fidelity, low cost, and required minimal staff oversight, which may facilitate future implementation. However, further research is needed to evaluate barriers and enablers to adoption and implementation for health professionals and strategies for long-term maintenance.",

      "abstract": "Epilepsy is the most common chronic neurologic disease which is characterized by recurrent attacks of headache after seizure. Researches show that self-management is an important factor in improving the quality of life and quality of care of people affected by epilepsy. Mobile phone technologies play a potential role in patient care assistance and treatment of epilepsy. This systematic review was conducted with an aim to study the role of mobile health in the management of epilepsy. This study was conducted by searching databases such as PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, and Google scholar search engines using the following keywords: “m-health,” “mobile health,” “Telemedicine,” “Mobile Application,” “Smartphone,” “epilepsy,” and “epilepsy management.” Articles published from January 1, 1990 to September 1, 2021 were searched. Inclusion criteria included all articles published in English with a focus on the role of mHealth in the management of epilepsy. Review articles and studies that were not about patients were omitted. In this study, of a total of 4225 retrieved articles, 10 studies met the full-text inclusion criteria. Three types of researches (30%) were done in the USA, five studies (50%) were conducted as randomized controlled trials, and eight articles (80%) had the highest quality. Among the considered articles, three articles (30%) were engaged in training users in epilepsy management. Five articles (50%) reported improvement in seizure control in patients with epilepsy and two articles (20%) did not report any significant improvement. Mobile technologies have a promising role in providing health assessment, education, and other services for patients, and they also help in controlling seizures attack and improvement of epilepsy management. These technologies enjoy great attractiveness, and utilizing them will lead to patient satisfaction.",

Objective                This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to determine the effectiveness of mobile applications on medication adherence, functional outcomes, cardiovascular risk factors, quality of life and knowledge on stroke in stroke survivors.                              Methods                A review of the literature was conducted using key search terms in PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane and Web of Science databases until 16 March 2023 to identify eligible randomized controlled trials (RCTs) or controlled clinical trial (CCTs) of mobile application interventions among stroke survivors. Two reviewers independently screened the literature in accordance with the eligibility criteria and collected data from the articles included. Outcomes included medication adherence,functional outcomes,cardiovascular risk factors, quality of life,and knowledge of stroke.                              Results                Twenty-three studies involving 2983 participants across nine countries were included in this review. Sixteen trials involved health care professionals in app use, and seven trials reported measures to ensure app-based intervention adherence. Mobile applications targeting stroke survivors primarily encompassed three areas: rehabilitation, education and self-care. The participants in the studies primarily included young and middle-aged stroke survivors. Meta-analysis results demonstrated that mobile application intervention significantly improved trunk control ability (mean differences [MD] 3.00, 95% CI [1.80 to 4.20]; P < 0.00001), Fugl–Meyer assessment of upper extremity (MD 9.81, 95% CI [8.72 to 10.90]; P < 0.00001), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (MD − 0.33, 95% CI [− 0.54 to − 0.11]; P = 0.003) and glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c)<7 levels (MD 1.95, 95% CI [1.17 to 3.25]; P = 0.01). However, the mobile application intervention did not differ significantly in medication adherence, 10-min walk test (10 MWT), Barthel index, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, body mass index, smoking, health-related quality of life and knowledge of stroke.                              Conclusion                Our study suggested that mobile application interventions may have a potential benefit to stroke survivors, but clinical effectiveness should be established. More studies using rigorous designs are warranted to understand their usefulness. Future research should also involve more older adult stroke survivors.",

      "abstract": "Emerging evidence suggests that the addition of text messages to standard healthy lifestyle interventions may improve the outcomes of diabetes prevention programs (DPP). This paper describes the process of developing text messages targeting behavior change in people at risk of developing diabetes in low-resourced communities as part of the South African DPP (SA-DPP). The development comprised multiple steps led by nutrition and physical activity experts. The steps included the following: (1) text message development based on the existing SA-DPP curriculum and its formative research; (2) text message evaluation for readability/understandability in terms of content, language, and quality, with 75 participants from two low-resourced areas in Cape Town; (3) text message reﬁnement by the expert panel; (4) evaluation of the reﬁned text messages by participants from Step 2; and (5) text bank ﬁnalization. Based on the readability survey, 37 of the 67 formulated text messages [24 of the 44 encouraged healthy eating, and 13 of the 23 promoted physical activity] were reﬁned. Based on focused discussions with participants, seven more messages were reﬁned to consider alternative terminology. The ﬁnal text bank includes a total of 67 messages comprising topics related to fruit and vegetable consumption as well as the importance of having variety in the diet (n = 15), limiting fat intake (n = 10), avoiding sugar (n = 11), avoiding salt (n = 5), promoting ﬁber-rich foods (n = 1), messages promoting physical activity (n = 21), and general check-in messages (n = 4). Most of the text messages were acceptable, understandable, and largely feasible to all participants, with some of the nutrition-related messages being less feasible for participants due to their socioeconomic position. The next step is to assess the text messages in the SA-DPP intervention trial.",

      "abstract": "Background: Current evidence reveals a growing pattern of hypertension among young adults, significantly increasing their risk for cardiovascular disease later in life. Young adults, particularly those of college age, often develop risk factors related to lifestyle choices in diet, exercise, and alcohol consumption. Developing useful interventions that can assist with screening and possible behavioral modifications that are suitable and appealing to college-aged young adults could help with early identification and intervention for hypertension. Recent studies indicate mobile health (mHealth) apps are acceptable and effective for communication and message delivery among this population.\nObjective: The purpose of this study was to examine the feasibility of using a mobile smartphone delivery system that provides tailored messages based on participant self-measured blood pressure (BP) with college-aged young adults.\nMethods: Using a single-arm intervention, pilot study design, the mHealth to Optimize BP Improvement (MOBILE) intervention was implemented with college students aged 18 years to 39 years who had systolic BP >120 mm Hg and diastolic BP ≥80 mm Hg. Participants were required to measure their BP daily for 28 days, submit the readings to the app, and receive preset educational text messages tailored to their BP value and related to encouraging healthy lifestyle modifications. Changes in a participant’s BP was evaluated using a mixed regression model, and a postintervention survey evaluated their perspectives on the mHealth intervention.\nResults: The participants’ (N=9) mean age was 22.64 (SD 4.54) years; 56% (5/9) were overweight, and 11% (1/9) were obese. The average daily participation rate was 86%. Of the 9 participants, 8 completed the survey, and all indicated the intervention was easy to use, found it increased awareness of their individual BP levels, indicated the text messages were helpful, and reported making lifestyle changes based on the study intervention. They also provided suggestions for future implementation of the intervention and program. Overall, no significant changes were noted in BP over the 28 days.\nConclusions: The mHealth-supported MOBILE intervention for BP monitoring and tailored text messaging was feasible to implement, as our study indicated high rates of participation and acceptability. These encouraging findings support further development and testing in a larger sample over a longer time frame and hold the potential for early identification and intervention among college-aged adults, filling a gap in current research.",

      "abstract": "Background: Chronic diseases significantly impact global morbidity and mortality, affecting millions. Self-management interventions are crucial for improving patient health outcomes. This study explores the effects of self-management interventions on the quality of life (QOL), self-efficacy, depression, and anxiety of patients with chronic diseases. Methods: Relevant studies were searched from PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science. Two reviewers independently screened the literature, evaluated the risk of bias assessment, and extracted characteristics and outcomes among patients with chronic diseases. For each included study, we calculated the standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the main outcomes. When deemed feasible, the heterogeneity of the study was explored by meta-analysis and subgroup analysis. Results: Thirty-four studies involving a total of 7603 patients with chronic diseases were included. Self-management interventions significantly improved quality of life (Higher-better QOL and Lower-better QOL), self-efficacy, and reduced depression symptoms compared to usual care (95%CI 0.01 to 0.15, p = 0.03; 95%CI −0.49 to −0.08, p = 0.006; 95%CI 0.19 to 0.62, p < 0.001; 95%CI −0.23 to −0.07, p < 0.001). However, no significant effect was found for anxiety (95%CI −0.18 to 0.03, p = 0.18). In the heterogeneity analysis, Lower-better QOL and self-efficacy were all higher than 50% (I2 = 80%, 87%). After the subgroup analysis, the heterogeneity of Lower-better QOL and self-efficacy was less than 50% (I2 = 0%, 16.1%). Subgroup analyses revealed that studies with mean age greater than 60 years old and follow-up times greater than 6 months were more effective in improving patients’ Lower-better QOL (p = 0.03, p = 0.004), whereas follow-up times less than 6 months were better at reducing patients’ anxiety symptoms (p = 0.03). Conclusions: Self-management interventions are more effective than routine care in managing chronic diseases, significantly improving patients’ quality of life, self-efficacy, and reducing depressive symptoms, but they did not show significant improvements in anxiety symptoms. Overall, self-management interventions for chronic diseases can help patients adapt to the changes brought about by the disease and self-manage diseases to prevent disease progression.",

We performed a randomized controlled trial (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03005470) where all participants received lifestyle counseling at baseline and were randomly allocated to receive (1) an automatic oscillometric device to measure and register blood pressure (BP) via a mobile application, (2) personalized text messages to stimulate lifestyle changes, (3) both mHealth interventions, or (4) usual clinical treatment (UCT) without technology (control). The outcomes were achieved for at least four of ﬁve lifestyle goals (weight loss, not smoking, physical activity, moderate or stopping alcohol consumption, and improving diet quality) and improved anthropometric characteristics at six months. mHealth groups were pooled for the analysis. Among 231 randomized participants (187 in the mHealth group and 45 in the control group), the mean age was 55.4 ± 9.5 years, and 51.9% were men. At six months, achieving at least four of ﬁve lifestyle goals was 2.51 times more likely (95% CI: 1.26; 5.00, p = 0.009) to be achieved among participants receiving mHealth interventions. The between-group difference reached clinically relevant, but marginally signiﬁcant, reduction in body fat (−4.05 kg 95% CI: −8.14; 0.03, p = 0.052), segmental trunk fat (−1.69 kg 95% CI: −3.50; 0.12, p = 0.067), and WC (−4.36 cm 95% CI: −8.81; 0.082, p = 0.054), favoring the intervention group. In conclusion, a six-month lifestyle intervention supported by application-based BP monitoring and text messages signiﬁcantly improves adherence to lifestyle goals and is likely to reduce some anthropometric characteristics in comparison with the control without technology support.",

      "abstract": "Background Adolescents are navigating a period of rapid growth and development within an era of digitalization. Mobile phone ownership among adolescents is nearly ubiquitous, and this provides an opportunity to harness text messaging to promote a healthy lifestyle and reduce chronic disease risk factors. Inclusion of adolescents throughout the design process has been recognized as essential for engagement and future implementation of such interventions. This study aimed to co-design a bank of text messages to promote a healthy lifestyle which are useful, acceptable, and engaging for adolescents aged 12–18 years old.\nMethods Iterative, mixed-methods design with consumer partnership. Co-design occurred over three stages: text message development, text message review and final refinement and testing. The text message development included literature searches and consumer partnership with an established youth advisory group (n = 16). Participants who gave e-consent participated in text message review. Demographic characteristics were collected, and quantitative surveys were distributed to adolescents (n = up to 50) and health professionals (n = up to 30), who rated text message content for understanding, usefulness and appropriateness (total score out of 15). Final refinement was completed by the research team to edit or remove messages which had low scores and to assess readability and interactivity of the text messages.\nResults The Heath Advisory Panel for Youth at the University of Sydney (HAPYUS) identified the top six lifestyle health issues for young people today in relation to chronic disease prevention, which became the key content areas for the text message bank and drafted new text messages. Following text message development, 218 messages were available for review. Adolescents (n = 18, mean age 16.3 [SD 1.4]) and healthcare professionals (n = 16) reviewed the text messages. On average, all reviewers found that the text messages were easy to understand (mean = 13.4/15) and useful (mean = 12.7/15). Based on scoring and open ended-feedback, 91 text messages were edited and 42 deleted. The final text message bank included 131 text messages. The overall program is suitable for a seventh-grade reading level, and interactive.\nConclusions This study describes the process of effectively engaging adolescents to co-design a text message bank intervention, which are useful, acceptable and engaging for an adolescent audience. The effectiveness of the codesigned text message bank is currently being tested in the Health4Me RCT.",

      "abstract": "AbstractIt is estimated 1.5 billion of the global population suffer from chronic pain with prevalence increasing with demographics including age. It is suggested long-term exposure to chronic could cause further health challenges reducing people’s quality of life. Therefore, it is imperative to use effective treatment options. We explored the current pharmaceutical treatments available for chronic pain management to better understand drug efficacy and pain reduction. A systematic methodology was developed and published in PROSPERO (CRD42021235384). Keywords of opioids, acute pain, pain management, chronic pain, opiods, NSAIDs, and analgesics were used across PubMed, Science direct, ProQuest, Web of science, Ovid Psych INFO, PROSPERO, EBSCOhost, MEDLINE, ClinicalTrials.gov and EMBASE. All randomised controlled clinical trials (RCTs), epidemiology and mixed-methods studies published in English between the 1st of January 1990 and 30th of April 2022 were included. A total of 119 studies were included. The data was synthesised using a tri-partied statistical methodology of a meta-analysis (24), pairwise meta-analysis (24) and network meta-analysis (34). Mean, median, standard deviation and confidence intervals for various pain assessments were used as the main outcomes for pre-treatment pain scores at baseline, post-treatment pain scores and pain score changes of each group. Our meta-analysis revealed the significant reduction in chronic pain scores of patients taking NSAID versus non-steroidal opioid drugs was comparative to patients given placebo under a random effects model. Pooled evidence also indicated significant drug efficiency with Botulinum Toxin Type-A (BTX-A) and Ketamine. Chronic pain is a public health problem that requires far more effective pharmaceutical interventions with minimal better side-effect profiles which will aid to develop better clinical guidelines. The importance of understanding ubiquity of pain by clinicians, policy makers, researchers and academic scholars is vital to prevent social determinant which aggravates issue.",

      "abstract": "ImportanceEffective weight loss interventions are needed for men with obesity.ObjectiveTo determine whether an intervention that combined text messaging with financial incentives attained significant weight loss at the 12-month follow-up compared with the control group and whether an intervention of text messaging alone attained significant weight loss at the 12-month follow-up compared with the control group.Design, Setting, and ParticipantsAn assessor-blinded randomized clinical trial conducted in Belfast, Bristol, and Glasgow areas in the UK. A total of 585 men with body mass index (BMI) of 30 or more were enrolled between July 2021 and May 2022. Final follow-up occurred June 2023.InterventionsParticipants were randomly assigned to 12 months of behavioral focused text messages combined with financial incentives (n = 196), 12 months of behavioral focused text messages alone (n= 194), or a waiting list (control group; n= 195). The financial incentive consisted of a monetary reward that was lost if weight loss targets were not met. All participants received weight management information and a pedometer at baseline.Main Outcomes and MeasuresThe 2 primary comparisons were the 12-month comparison of within-participant weight change between the text messaging with financial incentive group and the control group and the comparison between the text messaging alone group and the control group (minimum clinically important difference, 3%). The P value defined for statistical significance was P &amp;lt; .025 for each comparison.ResultsOf the 585 men (mean [SD] age, 50.7 [13.3] years; mean weight, 118.5 [19.9] kg; mean BMI, 37.7 [5.7]; 525 [90%] White), 227 (39%) lived in postal code areas with lower socioeconomic status, and 426 (73%) completed the 12-month follow-up. At the 12-month follow-up, compared with the control group, the mean percent weight change was significantly greater in the text messaging with financial incentive group (mean difference, −3.2%; 97.5% CI, −4.6% to −1.9%; P &amp;lt; .001) but was not significantly greater in the text messaging alone group (mean difference, −1.4%; 97.5% CI, −2.9% to 0.0, P = .05). The mean (SD) weight changes were −5.7 (7.4) kg for the text messaging with financial incentives group, −3.0 (7.5) kg for the text messaging alone group, and −1.5 (6.6) kg for the control group. The 12-month mean (SD) percentage weight changes from baseline were −4.8% (6.1%) for the text messaging with financial incentives group, −2.7% (6.3%) for text messaging alone group, and −1.3% (5.5%) for the control group. Of 366 adverse events reported, the most common were infections (83 [23%]). Of the 23 serious adverse events (6.3%), 12 (52%) occurred in the text messaging with financial incentives group, 5 (22%) in the texts messaging alone group, and 6 (26%) in the control group. None were considered related to participating in a trial group.Conclusion and RelevanceAmong men with obesity, an intervention with text messaging with financial incentive significantly improved weight loss compared with a control group, whereas text messaging alone was not significantly better than the control condition. These findings support text messaging combined with financial incentives to attain weight loss in men with obesity.Trial Registrationisrctn.org Identifier: ISRCTN91974895",

      "abstract": "Background            Cancer is the leading cause of death in Canada, and living with cancer generates psychological demands, including depression and anxiety among cancer survivors and caregivers. Text4Hope-Cancer Care SMS text messaging–based service was provided to people with cancer and caregivers during the COVID-19 pandemic to support their mental health.                                Objective            The aim of this study is to examine the clinical effectiveness of and satisfaction with Text4Hope-Cancer Care in addressing mental health conditions among people living with cancer and caregivers.                                Methods            The study was conducted in Alberta, Canada. People who were diagnosed or receiving cancer treatment and caregivers self-subscribed to receive 3-months daily supportive cognitive behavioral therapy–based SMS text messages and a web-based survey was sent at designated time points to collect clinical and nonclinical data. The Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HADS) was used to examine changes in anxiety and depression symptoms after receiving the service. Satisfaction with the service was assessed using a survey with a Likert scale. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used, and test significance was considered with P≤.05.                                Results            Overall, 107 individuals subscribed to the service, and 93 completed the program (completion rate 93/107, 86.9%). A significant improvement in the anxiety symptoms (HADS-Anxiety [HADS-A] subscale) was reported after 3 months of Text4Hope-Cancer Care (t11=2.62; P=.02), with medium effect size (Hedges g=0.7), but not depression symptoms (HADS-Depression [HADS-D] subscale). Subscribers expressed high satisfaction and agreed that the service has helped them to cope with mental health symptoms and improve their quality of life. Most subscribers read the SMS text messages more than once (30/30, 100%); took time to reflect or took a beneficial action after reading the messages (27/30, 90%); and highly agreed (27/30, >80%) with the value of the received supportive SMS text messages as being relevant, succinct, affirmative, and positive. All subscribers recommended SMS text messaging for stress, anxiety, and depression and for cancer care support (30/30, 100%).                                Conclusions            Text4Hope-Cancer Care was well-perceived and effectively addressed anxiety symptoms among people living with cancer and caregivers during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic. This study provides evidence-based support and insight for policy and stakeholders to implement similar convenient, economic, and accessible mental health services that support vulnerable populations during crises.

The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of using a mobile drug management application on medication adherence and hospital readmission among polypharmacy older adults.                              Methods                In this randomized controlled trial study conducted in 2022, with Trial Registration Number (IRCT20191231045966N1) (18/07/2021), 192 Iranian older adults with polypharmacy were selected according to the inclusion criteria and allocated to case and control groups using the block randomization method. The data collection tools included a demographic questionnaire, case report form, and Morisky Medication Adherence Scale. The intervention was done using a mobile drug management application. Drug adherence was measured at baseline and both with hospital readmission were measured after 8 weeks. The collected data were entered into the SPSS software version 22 and analyzed using descriptive (frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation) and inferential (Chi-square, Fisher’s exact test, independent t-test) statistics.                              Results                The case and control groups were homogeneous in terms of demographic variables and drug adherence level before the intervention. A significant difference was found in the drug adherence level after using the app (p < 0.001). Moreover, a significant difference was found in adverse events, including re-hospitalization due to disease aggravation, re-hospitalization due to error in medication consumption, falling, hypo or hypertension, and hypo or hyperglycemia, and medication use accuracy between the groups after the intervention (p < 0.05).                              Conclusion                The results showed that using a mobile drug management application that meets the specifications of older adults can improve drug adherence, reduce the adverse events and pave the way for a better disease period management.",

Advances in web and mobile technologies hold potential in supporting HIV treatment management.                                Objective            The aim of this study was to evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of a theory-based mobile health (mHealth) intervention on health behaviors and HIV treatment adherence among patients with HIV/AIDS in Vietnam.                                Methods            We performed a randomized controlled trial on 425 HIV patients in two of the largest HIV clinics in Hanoi, Vietnam. Both the intervention group (238 patients) and the control group (187 patients) received regular consultations with doctors and then participated in 1-month and 3-month follow-up visits. Patients in the intervention group received a theory-driven smartphone app to facilitate medication adherence and self-efficacy in HIV patients. Measurements were developed based on the Health Belief Model, which included the visual analog scale of ART Adherence, HIV Treatment Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale, and HIV Symptom Management Self-Efficacy Scale. We also included the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9) to assess patients’ mental health throughout treatment.                                Results            In the intervention group, the adherence score increased significantly (β=1.07, 95% CI .24-1.90) after 1 month, whereas the HIV adherence self-efficacy was significantly higher after 3 months (β=2.17, 95% CI 2.07-2.27) compared to the control group. There was a positive but low level of change in risk behaviors such as drinking, smoking, and drug use. Factors related to positive change in adherence were being employed and having stable mental well-being (lower PHQ-9 scores). Factors associated with self-efficacy in treatment adherence and symptom management were gender, occupation, younger age, and having no other underlying conditions. A longer duration of ART increased treatment adherence but decreased self-efficacy in symptom management.                                Conclusions            Our study demonstrated that the mHealth app could improve the overall ART adherence self-efficacy of patients. Further studies with larger sample sizes and longer follow-up periods are needed to support our findings.

      "abstract": "Abstract                Introduction                Adolescents and young adults (AYA) living with chronic medical conditions often struggle to develop medication adherence skills. This pilot trial evaluated the impact of a mobile health coaching intervention, Cell Phone Support (CPS), on medication adherence.                              Methods                Interventions in this randomized trial were CPS delivered by phone calls (CPS-C), CPS delivered by text messages (CPS-T), or automated text message reminders (ATR). Participants were AYA with different chronic medical conditions (i.e., sickle cell disease, solid organ transplant, type 2 diabetes), aged 15–20 years (N = 34). We examined the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of each intervention.                              Results                We examined the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of both CPS interventions. CPS was feasible and acceptable. There was evidence that participants found CPS to be more useful than ATR. In this pilot trial, participants receiving CPS reported relatively stronger increases in adherence, compared to those assigned to ATR. CPS-C slightly outperformed CPS-T.                              Conclusions                Providing coaching to AYA struggling with illness self-management via their cell phones may promote their acquisition of medication adherence skills. Although larger studies are needed to confirm the results of this pilot study, phone calls and text messages are both promising modalities for delivering human cell phone support.                              Trial registration                This trial was registered prospectively at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04241627) on 1/27/2020.",

      "abstract": "Elderly medication adherence is a challenge in health care. The elderly are often at higher risk for non-adherence, and more likely to be on multiple prescription medications for many comorbidities. This systematic review aimed to explore the current strategies for maintaining older adults’ medication adherence with compensation and technology-mediated strategies. We conducted a systematic review to examine related articles published in the PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus databases, as well as Google Scholar for additional reference sources by cross-reference review. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines were used to guide this review. A total of 217 articles were screened, and 27 studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Older adults applied a variety of methods to maintain or enhance their medication adherence. Three studies indicated compensation strategies, 19 studies reported technological assistance, two studies used other strategies (community-offered help or caregivers help), and three studies used a combination of compensation with another strategy or technology. Studies identified various compensation- and technology-based strategies carried out by older adults to help remind them to take medication. This review identified potential benefits of technology and compensation strategy implementation in older adults to increase medication adherence. Although we are conscious of the heterogeneity of the included studies, it remains challenging to determine which elements underpin the most effective approaches.",

      "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundSuboptimal tuberculosis (TB) treatment adherence may lead to unsuccessful treatment and relapse. Digital adherence technologies (DATs) may allow more person-centric approaches for supporting treatment. We conducted a systematic review (PROSPERO-CRD42022313166) to evaluate the impact of DATs on health outcomes in TB.MethodsWe searched MEDLINE, Embase, CENTRAL, CINAHL, Web of Science and preprints from medRxiv, Europe PMC, andclinicaltrials.govfor relevant literature from January 2000 to April 2023. We considered experimental or cohort studies reporting quantitative comparisons of clinical outcomes between a DAT and the standard of care in each setting.ResultsSeventy studies (total 58,950 participants) met inclusion criteria. They reported SMS-based interventions (k=18 studies), feature phone-based interventions (k=7), medication sleeves with phone calls (branded as “99DOTS,” k=5), video-observed therapy (VOT; k=17), smartphone-based interventions (k=5), digital pillboxes (k=18), ingestible sensors (k=1), and interventions combining 2 DATs (k=1). Overall, the use of DATs was associated with more frequent treatment success in TB disease (OR = 1.18 [1.06, 1.33]; I2= 66%, k = 46), a decrease in loss to follow up (OR = 0.71 [0.53, 0.94]; I2= 80%, k = 36) and an increase in adverse event reporting (OR = 1.53 [1.26, 1.86]; I2= 0%, k = 9). VOT was associated with an increased likelihood of treatment success in TB disease (OR 1.54 [1.09; 2.19]; I2= 0%, k = 8) and treatment completion in TB infection (OR 4.69 [2.08; 10.55]; I2= 0%, k = 2) as well as an increased frequency of adverse event reporting (OR = 1.79 [1.27; 2.52]; I2= 34%, k = 4). Other interventions involving smartphone technologies were associated with increased treatment success in TB disease (OR 1.98 [1.07; 3.65]; I2=56%, k = 5) and a decreased frequency of loss to follow up (OR = 0.31 [0.13; 0.77]; I2= 36%, k = 5). Digital pillboxes were also associated with an improvement in treatment success (OR = 1.32 [1.00; 1.73]; I2= 71%, k = 11). However, improved treatment success was only seen in high- and upper middle-income countries. SMS-based interventions, feature-phone interventions and 99DOTS were not associated with improvements in short-term clinical outcomes.ConclusionCertain DATs--notably VOT and smartphone-based interventions, in higher income settings and sometimes combined with other supportive measures—may be associated with improvements in treatment success and losses to follow-up, compared to standard care. However, evidence remains highly variable, and generalizability limited. Higher quality data are needed.",

These technologies are developed to manage chronic diseases and infectious bacterial diseases, including tuberculosis (TB).                                Objective            This study aims to comprehensively review the literature on the use of digital health interventions (DHIs) for enhancing TB treatment adherence and identify major strategies for their adoption.                                Methods            We conducted a literature search in the PubMed, Cochrane Library, Ovid Embase, and Scopus databases for relevant studies published between January 2012 and March 2022. Studies that focused on web-based or mobile phone–based interventions, medication adherence, digital health, randomized controlled trials, digital interventions, or mobile health and ubiquitous health technology for TB treatment and related health outcomes were included.                                Results            We identified 27 relevant studies and classified them according to the intervention method, a significant difference in treatment success, and health outcomes. The following interventions were emphasized: SMS text messaging interventions (8/27, 30%), medicine reminders (6/27, 22%), and web-based direct observation therapy (9/27, 33%). Digital health technology significantly promoted disease management among individuals and health care professionals. However, only a few studies addressed 2-way communication therapies, such as interactive SMS text messaging and feedback systems.                                Conclusions            This scoping review classified studies on DHIs for patients with TB and demonstrated their potential for the self-management of TB. DHIs are still being developed, and evidence on the impact of digital technologies on enhancing TB treatment adherence remains limited. However, it is necessary to encourage patients’ participation in TB treatment and self-management through bidirectional communication. We emphasize the importance of developing a communication system.",

Its adjuvant activity has previously been proven to be strictly dependent on its spatial co-localization with antigens, highlighting the role of local innate immunity in its mechanisms. However, its potential targets and pathways remain unclear. Here, its intracellular molecular mechanisms of innate immune response were explored using mouse C2C12 myoblast by integrative analysis of the in vivo and in vitro transcriptome in combination with experimental validations. AJSAF elicited a temporary cytotoxicity and inflammation towards C2C12 cells. Gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated that AJSAF regulated similar cell death- and inflammatory response-related genes in vitro and in vivo through activating second messenger–MAPK–CREB pathways. AJSAF markedly enhanced the Ca2+, cAMP, and reactive oxygen species levels and accelerated MAPK and CREB phosphorylation in C2C12 cells. Furthermore, Ca2+ chelator, CREB inhibitor, and MAPK inhibitors dramatically blocked the up-regulation of IL-6, CXCL1, and COX2 in AJSAF-treated C2C12 cells. Collectively, these results demonstrated that AJSAF induced innate immunity via Ca2+–MAPK–CREB pathways. This study is beneficial for insights into the molecular mechanisms of saponin adjuvants.",

      "abstract": "Abstract                Background                Finding innovative methods to enhance Tuberculosis treatment adherence in Malaysia is imperative, given the rising trend of non-adhere TB patients. Direct Observed Therapy (DOTS) has been used to ensure Tuberculosis (TB) drug compliance worldwide. However, due to its inconvenience, digitalizing this system into a virtual monitoring system via a mobile app can help deliver a more efficient tuberculosis management system. A gamified video-observed therapy is developed that connects three users the patient, supervisor, and administrator, allowing drug monitoring and patient loss to follow up with the patient tracking system. Thus, the objective of this study is to determine the impact of Gamified Real-time Video Observed Therapy (GRVOTS) mobile apps on patient medication adherence rates and motivation.                              Methods                71 patients from 18 facilities participated in the 8-week single-arm intervention study. GRVOTS mobile apps were installed in their mobile apps, and patients were expected to fulfill tasks such as providing Video Direct Observe Therapy (VDOTS) daily as well as side effect reporting. At 3-time intervals of baseline,1-month, and 2-month intervals, the number of VDOT taken, the Malaysian Medication Adherence Assessment Tool (MyMAAT), and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) questionnaire were collected. One-sample t-test was conducted comparing the VDOT video adherence to the standard rate of 80%. RM ANOVA was used to analyze any significant differences in MyMAAT and IMI scores across three-time intervals.                              Results                This study involved 71 numbers of patients from 18 healthcare facilities who showed a significantly higher treatment adherence score of 90.87% than a standard score of 80% with a mean difference of 10.87(95% CI: 7.29,14.46; p < 0.001). The participants’ MyMAAT and IMI scores significantly increased over 3-time intervals with the IMI Interest domain showing the highest mean difference 19.76 (95% CI: 16.37, 21.152: p < 0.001).                              Conclusions                By utilizing GRVOTS, a mobile application based on gamification and real-time features, we can enhance motivation and medication adherence among TB patients, while also addressing the limitations of physical DOTS.

      "abstract": "A key challenge in monitoring, managing, and mitigating global health crises is the need to coordinate clinical decision-making with systems outside of healthcare. In the 21st century, human engagement with Internet-connected ubiquitous devices generates an enormous amount of big data, which can be used to address complex, intersectoral problems via participatory epidemiology and mHealth approaches that can be operationalized with digital citizen science. These big data – which traditionally exist outside of health systems – are underutilized even though their usage can have significant implications for prediction and prevention of communicable and non-communicable diseases. To address critical challenges and gaps in big data utilization across sectors, a Digital Citizen Science Observatory (DiScO) is being developed by the Digital Epidemiology and Population Health Laboratory by scaling up existing digital health infrastructure. DiScO's development is informed by the Smart Framework, which leverages ubiquitous devices for ethical surveillance. The Observatory will be operationalized by implementing a rapidly adaptable, replicable, and scalable progressive web application that repurposes jurisdiction-specific cloud infrastructure to address crises across jurisdictions. The Observatory is designed to be highly adaptable for both rapid data collection as well as rapid responses to emerging and existing crises. Data sovereignty and decentralization of technology are core aspects of the observatory, where citizens can own the data they generate, and researchers and decision-makers can re-purpose digital health infrastructure. The ultimate aim of DiScO is to transform health systems by breaking existing jurisdictional silos in addressing global health crises.",

Living with HIV is life-altering and poses substantial challenges for both PLWHs and their partners, so identifying how HIV serodiscordant couples cope with HIV together is crucial. Here, Bodenmann’s Systemic Transaction Model highlights common dyadic coping (CDC), which refers to both partners working together to alleviate the negative effects of stress.                                                Purpose                  We examined the mediating role of CDC in linking we-disease appraisal with relationship satisfaction and QoL.                                                Methods                  We recruited a convenience sample of 231 HIV serodiscordant couples via local grassroots organizations between June and October 2022. Participants completed measures of we-disease appraisal, CDC, relationship satisfaction, and QoL. We examined the mediation effect of CDC on the association between we-disease appraisal and outcomes using the common fate mediation model.                                                Results                  The mean age of PLWHs was 32.18 years (standard deviation = 8.61 years), and that of their partners was 32.55 years (standard deviation = 9.24 years). The average time since HIV diagnosis was 4.18 years. Most couples were same-sex male couples. We found that CDC mediated the effect of we-disease appraisal on relationship satisfaction. Moreover, CDC significantly mediated the effect of we-disease appraisal on the QoL of PLWHs and their partners.

      "abstract": "Abstract                Background                Artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI, has emerged as a transformative tool in healthcare, with the potential to revolutionize clinical decision-making and improve health outcomes. Generative AI, capable of generating new data such as text and images, holds promise in enhancing patient care, revolutionizing disease diagnosis and expanding treatment options. However, the utility and impact of generative AI in healthcare remain poorly understood, with concerns around ethical and medico-legal implications, integration into healthcare service delivery and workforce utilisation. Also, there is not a clear pathway to implement and integrate generative AI in healthcare delivery.                              Methods                This article aims to provide a comprehensive overview of the use of generative AI in healthcare, focusing on the utility of the technology in healthcare and its translational application highlighting the need for careful planning, execution and management of expectations in adopting generative AI in clinical medicine. Key considerations include factors such as data privacy, security and the irreplaceable role of clinicians’ expertise. Frameworks like the technology acceptance model (TAM) and the Non-Adoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread and Sustainability (NASSS) model are considered to promote responsible integration. These frameworks allow anticipating and proactively addressing barriers to adoption, facilitating stakeholder participation and responsibly transitioning care systems to harness generative AI’s potential.                              Results                Generative AI has the potential to transform healthcare through automated systems, enhanced clinical decision-making and democratization of expertise with diagnostic support tools providing timely, personalized suggestions. Generative AI applications across billing, diagnosis, treatment and research can also make healthcare delivery more efficient, equitable and effective. However, integration of generative AI necessitates meticulous change management and risk mitigation strategies. Technological capabilities alone cannot shift complex care ecosystems overnight; rather, structured adoption programs grounded in implementation science are imperative.                              Conclusions                It is strongly argued in this article that generative AI can usher in tremendous healthcare progress, if introduced responsibly. Strategic adoption based on implementation science, incremental deployment and balanced messaging around opportunities versus limitations helps promote safe, ethical generative AI integration. Extensive real-world piloting and iteration aligned to clinical priorities should drive development. With conscientious governance centred on human wellbeing over technological novelty, generative AI can enhance accessibility, affordability and quality of care. As these models continue advancing rapidly, ongoing reassessment and transparent communication around their strengths and weaknesses remain vital to restoring trust, realizing positive potential and, most importantly, improving patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "The recent SARS-CoV-2 pandemic underscored the effectiveness and rapid deployment of digital public health interventions, notably the digital proximity tracing apps, leveraging Bluetooth capabilities to trace and notify users about potential infection exposures. Backed by renowned organizations such as the World Health Organization and the European Union, digital proximity tracings showcased the promise of digital public health. As the world pivots from pandemic responses, it becomes imperative to address noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) that account for a vast majority of health care expenses and premature disability-adjusted life years lost. The narrative of digital transformation in the realm of NCD public health is distinct from infectious diseases. Public health, with its multifaceted approach from disciplines such as medicine, epidemiology, and psychology, focuses on promoting healthy living and choices through functions categorized as “Assessment,” “Policy Development,” “Resource Allocation,” “Assurance,” and “Access.” The power of artificial intelligence (AI) in this digital transformation is noteworthy. AI can automate repetitive tasks, facilitating health care providers to prioritize personal interactions, especially those that cannot be digitalized like emotional support. Moreover, AI presents tools for individuals to be proactive in their health management. However, the human touch remains irreplaceable; AI serves as a companion guiding through the health care landscape. Digital evolution, while revolutionary, poses its own set of challenges. Issues of equity and access are at the forefront. Vulnerable populations, whether due to economic constraints, geographical barriers, or digital illiteracy, face the threat of being marginalized further. This transformation mandates an inclusive strategy, focusing on not amplifying existing health disparities but eliminating them. Population-level digital interventions in NCD prevention demand societal agreement. Policies, like smoking bans or sugar taxes, though effective, might affect those not directly benefiting. Hence, all involved parties, from policy makers to the public, should have a balanced perspective on the advantages, risks, and expenses of these digital shifts. For a successful digital shift in public health, especially concerning NCDs, AI’s potential to enhance efficiency, effectiveness, user experience, and equity—the “quadruple aim”—is undeniable. However, it is vital that AI-driven initiatives in public health domains remain purposeful, offering improvements without compromising other objectives. The broader success of digital public health hinges on transparent benchmarks and criteria, ensuring maximum benefits without sidelining minorities or vulnerable groups. Especially in population-centric decisions, like resource allocation, AI’s ability to avoid bias is paramount. Therefore, the continuous involvement of stakeholders, including patients and minority groups, remains pivotal in the progression of AI-integrated digital public health.",

      "abstract": "AbstractSmartwatches have become increasingly popular in recent times because of their capacity to track different health indicators, including heart rate, patterns of sleep, and physical movements. This scoping review aims to explore the utilisation of smartwatches within the healthcare sector. According to Arksey and O'Malley's methodology, an organised search was performed in PubMed/Medline, Scopus, Embase, Web of Science, ERIC and Google Scholar. In our search strategy, 761 articles were returned. The exclusion/inclusion criteria were applied. Finally, 35 articles were selected for extracting data. These included six studies on stress monitoring, six on movement disorders, three on sleep tracking, three on blood pressure, two on heart disease, six on covid pandemic, three on safety and six on validation. The use of smartwatches has been found to be effective in diagnosing the symptoms of various diseases. In particular, smartwatches have shown promise in detecting heart diseases, movement disorders, and even early signs of COVID-19. Nevertheless, it should be emphasised that there is an ongoing discussion concerning the reliability of smartwatch diagnoses within healthcare systems. Despite the potential advantages offered by utilising smartwatches for disease detection, it is imperative to approach their data interpretation with prudence. The discrepancies in detection between smartwatches and their algorithms have important implications for healthcare use. The accuracy and reliability of the algorithms used are crucial, as well as high accuracy in detecting changes in health status by the smartwatches themselves. This calls for the development of medical watches and the creation of AI-hospital assistants. These assistants will be designed to help with patient monitoring, appointment scheduling, and medication management tasks. They can educate patients and answer common questions, freeing healthcare providers to focus on more complex tasks.",

      "abstract": "IntroductionAbsence of structured guidelines to navigate the complexities of implementing AI-based applications in healthcare is recognized by clinicians, healthcare leaders, and policy makers. AI implementation presents challenges beyond the technology development which necessitates standardized approaches to implementation. This study aims to explore the activities typical to implementation of AI-based systems to develop an AI implementation process framework intended to guide healthcare professionals. The Quality Implementation Framework (QIF) was considered as an initial reference framework.MethodsThis study employed a qualitative research design and included three components: (1) a review of 30 scientific articles describing differences empirical cases of real-world AI implementation in healthcare, (2) analysis of qualitative interviews with healthcare representatives possessing first-hand experience in planning, running, and sustaining AI implementation projects, (3) analysis of qualitative interviews with members of the research group´s network and purposively sampled for their AI literacy and academic, technical or managerial leadership roles.ResultsThe data were deductively mapped onto the steps of QIF using direct qualitative content analysis. All the phases and steps in QIF are relevant to AI implementation in healthcare, but there are specificities in the context of AI that require incorporation of additional activities and phases. To effectively support the AI implementations, the process frameworks should include a dedicated phase to implementation with specific activities that occur after planning, ensuring a smooth transition from AI's design to deployment, and a phase focused on governance and sustainability, aimed at maintaining the AI's long-term impact. The component of continuous engagement of diverse stakeholders should be incorporated throughout the lifecycle of the AI implementation.ConclusionThe value of this study is the identified processual phases and activities specific and typical to AI implementations to be carried out by an adopting healthcare organization when AI systems are deployed. The study advances previous research by outlining the types of necessary comprehensive assessments and legal preparations located in the implementation planning phase. It also extends prior understanding of what the staff's training should focus on throughout different phases of implementation. Finally, the overall processual, phased structure is discussed in order to incorporate activities that lead to a successful deployment of AI systems in healthcare.",

      "abstract": "Background            Suicide among young people is a worrying public health concern. Despite this, there is a lack of suitable interventions aligned with the needs of this priority population. Emerging evidence supports the effectiveness of digital interventions in alleviating the severity of suicidal thoughts. However, their efficacy may be undermined by poor engagement. Technology-supported strategies (eg, electronic prompts and reminders) have been deployed alongside digital interventions to increase engagement with the latter. However, evidence of their efficacy is inconclusive. User-centered design approaches may be key to developing feasible and effective engagement strategies. Currently, no study has been published on how such an approach might be expressly applied toward developing strategies for promoting engagement with digital interventions.                                Objective            This study aimed to detail the processes and activities involved in developing an adjunctive strategy for promoting engagement with LifeBuoy—a smartphone app that helps young people manage suicidal thoughts.                                Methods            Development of the engagement strategy took place in 2 phases. The discovery phase aimed to create an initial prototype by synthesizing earlier findings—from 2 systematic reviews and a cross-sectional survey of the broader mental health app user population—with qualitative insights from LifeBuoy users. A total of 16 web-based interviews were conducted with young people who participated in the LifeBuoy trial. Following the discovery phase, 3 interviewees were invited by the research team to take part in the workshops in the design phase, which sought to create a final prototype by making iterative improvements to the initial prototype. These improvements were conducted over 2 workshops. Thematic analysis was used to analyze the qualitative data obtained from the interviews and workshops.                                Results            Main themes from the interviews centered around the characteristics of the strategy, timing of notifications, and suitability of social media platforms. Subsequently, themes that emerged from the design workshops emphasized having a wider variety of content, greater visual consistency with LifeBuoy, and a component with more detailed information to cater to users with greater informational needs. Thus, refinements to the prototype were focused on (1) improving the succinctness, variety, and practical value of Instagram content, (2) creating a blog containing articles contributed by mental health professionals and young people with lived experience of suicide, and (3) standardizing the use of marine-themed color palettes across the Instagram and blog components.                                Conclusions            This is the first study to describe the development of a technology-supported adjunctive strategy for promoting engagement with a digital intervention. It was developed by integrating perspectives from end users with lived experience of suicide with evidence from the existing literature. The development process documented in this study may be useful for guiding similar projects aimed at supporting the use of digital interventions for suicide prevention or mental health.",

      "abstract": "AbstractBackgroundPrescribing cascades are important contributors to polypharmacy. Little is known about which older adults are at highest risk of experiencing prescribing cascades. We explored which older veterans are at highest risk of the gabapentinoid (including gabapentin and pregabalin)–loop diuretic (LD) cascade, given the dramatic increase in gabapentinoid prescribing in recent years.MethodsUsing Veterans Affairs and Medicare claims data (2010–2019), we performed a prescription sequence symmetry analysis (PSSA) to assess loop diuretic initiation before and after gabapentinoid initiation among older veterans (≥66 years). To identify the cascade, we calculated the adjusted sequence ratio (aSR), which assesses the temporality of LD relative to gabapentinoid initiation. To explore high‐risk groups, we used multivariable logistic regression with prescribing order modeled as a binary dependent variable. We calculated adjusted odds ratios (aORs), measuring the extent to which factors are associated with one prescribing order versus another.ResultsOf 151,442 veterans who initiated a gabapentinoid, there were 1,981 patients who initiated a LD within 6 months after initiating a gabapentinoid compared to 1,599 patients who initiated a LD within 6 months before initiating a gabapentinoid. In the gabapentinoid–LD group, the mean age was 73 years, 98% were male, 13% were Black, 5% were Hispanic, and 80% were White. Patients in each group were similar across patient and health utilization factors (standardized mean difference <0.10 for all comparisons). The aSR was 1.23 (95% CI: 1.13, 1.34), strongly suggesting the cascade's presence. People age ≥85 years were less likely to have the cascade (compared to 66–74 years; aOR 0.74, 95% CI: 0.56–0.96), and people taking ≥10 medications were more likely to have the cascade (compared to 0–4 drugs; aOR 1.39, 95% CI: 1.07–1.82).ConclusionsAmong older adults, those who are younger and taking many medications may be at higher risk of the gabapentinoid–LD cascade, contributing to worsening polypharmacy and potential drug‐related harms. We did not identify strong predictors of this cascade, suggesting that prescribing cascade prevention efforts should be widespread rather than focused on specific subgroups.",

      "abstract": "Background Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is a common sleep-breathing disorder associated with adverse health outcomes including excessive daytime sleepiness, impaired quality of life and is well-established as a cardiovascular risk factor. Continuous positive airway pressure is the reference treatment, but its cardiovascular and metabolic benefits are still debated. Combined interventions aiming at improving patient's lifestyle behaviours are recommended in guidelines management of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome but adherence decreases over time and access to rehabilitation programmes is limited. Telerehabilitation is a promising approach to address these issues, but data are scarce on obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Methods The aim of this study is to assess the potential benefits of a telerehabilitation programme implemented at continuous positive airway pressure initiation, compared to continuous positive airway pressure alone and usual care, on symptoms and cardiometabolic risk factors of obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. This study is a 6-months multicentre randomized, parallel controlled trial during which 180 obese patients with severe obstructive sleep apnea syndrome will be included. We will use a sequential hierarchical criterion for major endpoints including sleepiness, quality of life, nocturnal systolic blood pressure and inflammation biological parameters. Discussion m-Rehab obstructive sleep apnea syndrome is the first multicentre randomized controlled trial to examine the effectiveness of a telerehabilitation lifestyle programme in obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. We hypothesize that a telerehabilitation lifestyle intervention associated with continuous positive airway pressure for 6 months will be more efficient than continuous positive airway pressure alone on symptoms, quality of life and cardiometabolic risk profile. Main secondary outcomes include continuous positive airway pressure adherence, usability and satisfaction with the telerehabilitation platform and medico-economic evaluation.

Following a promising pilot evaluation of the Supporting MumS intervention, we assess if theory-based and bidirectional text messages to support diet and physical activity behaviour change for weight loss and weight loss maintenance, are effective and cost-effective for weight change in postpartum women with overweight or obesity, compared with an active control arm receiving text messages on child health and development.Methods and analysisTwo-arm, parallel-group, assessor-blind randomised controlled trial with cost-effectiveness and process evaluations. Women (n=888) with body mass index (BMI) ≥25 kg/m2and within 24 months of giving birth were recruited via community and National Health Service pathways through five UK sites targeting areas of ethnic and socioeconomic diversity. Women were 1:1 randomised to the intervention or active control groups, each receiving automated text messages for 12 months. Data are collected at 0, 6, 12 and 24 months. The primary outcome is weight change at 12 months from baseline, compared between groups. Secondary outcomes include weight change (24 months) and waist circumference (cm), proportional weight gain (>5 kg), BMI (kg/m2), dietary intake, physical activity, infant feeding and mental health (6, 12 and 24 months, respectively). Economic evaluation examines health service usage and personal expenditure, health-related quality of life and capability well-being to assess cost-effectiveness over the trial and modelled lifetime. Cost–utility analysis examines cost per quality-adjusted life-years gained over 24 months. Mixed-method process evaluation explores participants’ experiences and contextual factors impacting outcomes and implementation. Stakeholder interviews examine scale-up and implementation.Ethics and disseminationEthical approval was obtained before data collection (West of Scotland Research Ethics Service Research Ethics Committee (REC) 4 22/WS/0003). Results will be published via a range of outputs and audiences.Trial registration numberISRCTN16299220.",

      "abstract": "Objectives\n              This study aimed (1) to examine the association between patient engagement with a bidirectional, semiautomated postdischarge texting programme and Hospital Consumer Assessment of Healthcare Providers and Systems (HCAHPS) survey outcomes, readmissions and revisit rates in a large health system and (2) to describe operational and clinical flow considerations for implementing a postdischarge texting programme.\n            \n            \n              Setting\n              The study involved 1 main academic hospital (beds: 2500+) and 6 community hospitals (beds: 190–400, averaging 300 beds per hospital) in Houston, Texas.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              \n                Retrospective, observational cohort study between non-engaged patients (responded with 0–2 incoming text messages) and engaged patients (responded with 3+ incoming, patient-initiated text messages) between December 2022 and May 2023. We used the two-tailed t-test for continuous variables and χ\n                2\n                test for categorical variables to compare the baseline characteristics between the two cohorts. For the binary outcomes, such as the revisit (1=yes, vs 0=no) and readmissions (1=yes vs 0=no), we constructed mixed effect logistic regression models with the random effects to account for repeated measurements from the hospitals. For the continuous outcome, such as the case mix index (CMI), a generalised linear quantile mixed effect model was built. All tests for significance were two tailed, using an alpha level of 0.05, and 95% CIs were provided. Significance tests were performed to evaluate the CMI and readmissions and revisit rates.\n              \n            \n            \n              Results\n              From 78 883 patients who were contacted over the course of this pilot implementation, 49 222 (62.4%) responded, with 39 442 (50%) responded with 3+ incoming text messages. The engaged cohort had higher HCAHPS scores in all domains compared with the non-engaged cohort. The engaged cohort used significantly fewer 30-day acute care resources, experiencing 29% fewer overall readmissions and 20% fewer revisit rates (23% less likely to revisit) and were 27% less likely to be readmitted. The results were statistically significant for all but two hospitals.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This study builds on the few postdischarge texting studies, and also builds on the patient engagement literature, finding that patient engagement with postdischarge texting can be associated with fewer acute care resources. To our knowledge, this is the only study that documented an association between a text-based postdischarge programme and HCAHPS scores, perhaps owing to the bidirectionality and ease with which patients could interact with nurses. Future research should explore the texting paradigms to evaluate their associated outcomes in a variety of postdischarge applications.",

However, existing research findings on the contribution of self‐quantification to consumer well‐being are disparate. Given the popularity of self‐quantification technology among consumers in the post‐pandemic era and its inherent transformative nature, it is surprising that this gap remains unaddressed. To resolve this inconsistency and to examine how and when self‐quantification influences consumer well‐being, we conduct a meta‐analysis of consumer well‐being in the context of self‐quantification technology. Our findings reveal that self‐quantification positively influences consumer well‐being. However, self‐quantification also negatively affects consumer well‐being through body image and self‐esteem. The systematic moderation effects of cultural dimensions (e.g., uncertainty avoidance and individualism), prior experience, data sharing, and sample characteristics on the relationship between self‐quantification and consumer well‐being are also confirmed. While uncertainty avoidance, prior experience, and data sharing accentuate the positive effects of self‐quantification on consumer well‐being, an individualistic culture attenuates this influence. This study contributes to the consumer well‐being literature and extends objectification theory in the context of self‐quantification. These findings will guide practitioners and policymakers in devising strategies and policies to allow self‐quantification technology to be used in a way that enhances consumers' health and well‐being.",

Using data from American Community Survey, we find that Medicaid take‐up rate increased 8.88 percentage points (pp) among rent‐burdened households and 7.54 pp among non‐rent‐burdened households in expansion states. Conditional on household income and demographic characteristics, rent‐burdened households exhibit a 1.5 pp higher likelihood of Medicaid enrollment, with an additional decline of 0.7 pp in employer‐sponsored insurance and 1.0 pp in directly purchased insurance enrollment. These effects were more pronounced among individuals aged over 26 and those in states without state‐run exchanges. The findings show the importance of tailored Medicaid policies to assist households facing housing burdens, especially for those ineligible for housing vouchers.",

Materials and Methods                  A transformative mixed methods study was conducted in Canada with people with COPD (n = 77) or with a progressive lung condition (n = 6). Stage-1 interviews (n = 7) informed the stage-2 survey. Survey responses (n = 80) facilitated the identification of participants for stage-3 interviews (n = 13). The interviews were thematically analyzed. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the survey. The integrative mixed method analysis involved mixing between and across the stages.                                                Results                  Most COPD participants (87.0%) used DTs. However, few participants frequently used DTs to self-manage COPD. People used DTs to seek online information about COPD symptoms and treatments, but lacked tailored information about illness progression. Few expressed interest in using DTs for self- monitoring and tracking. The regular use of DTs for intergenerational connections may facilitate leaving a legacy and passing on traditions and memories. Use of DTs for leisure activities provided opportunities for connecting socially and for respite, reminiscing, distraction and spontaneity.                                                Discussion and Conclusion                  We advocate reconceptualizing consumer health technologies to prioritize quality of life for people with a progressive, potentially fatal illness. “Quality of life informatics” should focus on reducing stigma regarding illness and disability and taboo towards death, improving access to palliative care resources and encouraging experiences to support social, emotional and mental health. For DTs to support people with fatal, progressive illnesses, we must expand informatics strategies to quality of life.",

      "abstract": "Background            Farmers in Indonesia have a high risk for hypertension owing to their lifestyle and working environment. Diet management is a solution to reduce hypertension, and Indonesia has natural resources in the agricultural sector that could help manage hypertension. Optimizing vegetable and fruit intake in a plant-based diet (PBD) could help maintain blood pressure among farmers in Indonesia.                                Objective            This study aims to explore the health problem of hypertension and the characteristics of local food sources to formulate a PBD menu for treating hypertension, as well as assess the prevalence of hypertension, level of acceptability of a PBD, and associated sociodemographic factors. Further, we want to examine the effectiveness of a community-based nursing program for managing hypertension using a PBD.                                Methods            We will use the exploratory sequential mixed methods approach. There will be a qualitative study (phase I) in 2022 and a quantitative study (phase II) in 2023. We will analyze data using a thematic framework in phase I. In phase II, the study will involve (1) questionnaire development and validation; (2) examination of the prevalence of hypertension, the level of acceptability of a PBD, and the associated factors; and (3) a randomized controlled trial. We will recruit farmers with hypertension who meet the study criteria. Moreover, in phase II, we will invite expert nurses and nutritionists to assess the face and content validity of the questionnaire. We will use multiple logistic regression models to estimate the associated sociodemographic factors and the level of acceptability of a PBD. Furthermore, a linear generalized estimating equation will be used to estimate the parameters of a generalized linear model with a possible unmeasured correlation between observations from different time points for systolic and diastolic blood pressure.                                Results            A model PBD for hypertension management is expected to be developed. In 2022, we will collect information on hypertension and the characteristics of local food sources for managing hypertension, and will formulate a PBD menu to treat hypertension among farmers. In 2023, we will develop a questionnaire to assess the acceptability of a PBD to manage hypertension among farmers, the prevalence of hypertension, and the sociodemographic factors associated with hypertension among farmers. We will implement a community-based nursing program for managing hypertension using a PBD among farmers.                                Conclusions            The PBD model will not be readily available for other agricultural areas since validation of local food variation is required to design the menu. We expect contributions from the local government to implement the intervention as one of the policies in the management of hypertension for farmers in the agricultural plantation areas of Jember. This program may also be implemented in other agricultural countries with similar problems, so that hypertension can be optimally treated among farmers.

This study included a total of 100 patients receiving a kidney transplant, 50 in the intervention group and 50 in the control group.MeasurementsPatients in the intervention group were sent text message reminders four times a day during the 6th–9th months after transplantation. Control patients received no such intervention. Tacrolimus concentrations in the bloodstream were monitored for all participants through measurements taken at Months 7, 8 and 9. Data collection tools included Sociodemographic Form and Immunosuppressive Medication Adherence Scale.ResultsPatients were homogeneously distributed among the groups. Sending daily text message reminders to transplant recipients caused an independent positive effect on medication adherence scale scores at the end of the study. Mean pretest medication adherence score of all patients was 45.18 ± 4.22 and posttest score was 47.4 ± 3.6. The intervention group exhibited a significantly higher mean posttest adherence score compared to controls, with values of 48.68 ± 2.58 and 45.62 ± 4.42, respectively (p < 0.001). Findings demonstrated a substantial improvement in the final medication adherence scores of transplant patients when they received daily Short Message Service reminders, acting as an independent factor (β = 0.356, p < 0.001).ConclusionSending text message reminders to kidney transplant recipients is a statistically and clinically effective intervention to improve immunosuppressive medication adherence.",

      "abstract": "Abstract                Background                Asthma exacerbations reduce the patient’s quality of life and are also responsible for significant disease burdens and economic costs. Machine learning (ML)-based prediction models have been increasingly developed to predict asthma exacerbations in recent years. This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to identify the prediction performance of ML-based prediction models for asthma exacerbations and address the uncertainty of whether modern ML methods could become an alternative option to predict asthma exacerbations.                              Methods                PubMed, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and Web of Science were searched for studies published up to December 15, 2022. Studies that applied ML methods to develop prediction models for asthma exacerbations among asthmatic patients older than five years and were published in English were eligible. The prediction model risk of bias assessment tool (PROBAST) was utilized to estimate the risk of bias and the applicability of included studies. Stata software (version 15.0) was used for the random effects meta-analysis of performance measures. Subgroup analyses stratified by ML methods, sample size, age groups, and outcome definitions were conducted.                              Results                Eleven studies, including 23 prediction models, were identified. Most of the studies were published in recent three years. Logistic regression, boosting, and random forest were the most used ML methods. The most common important predictors were systemic steroid use, short-acting beta2-agonists, emergency department visit, age, and exacerbation history. The overall pooled area under the curve of the receiver operating characteristics (AUROC) of 11 studies (23 prediction models) was 0.80 (95% CI 0.77–0.83). Subgroup analysis based on different ML models showed that boosting method achieved the best performance, with an overall pooled AUROC of 0.84 (95% CI 0.81–0.87).                              Conclusion                This study identified that ML was the potential tool to achieve great performance in predicting asthma exacerbations. However, the methodology within these models was heterogeneous. Future studies should focus on improving the generalization ability and practicability, thus driving the application of these models in clinical practice.",

We aimed to build an ML model to predict in-hospital major adverse events (MAE) in patients hospitalized in CICU.                                                Methods and results                  In April 2021, a French national prospective multicentre study involving 39 centres included all consecutive patients admitted to CICU. The primary outcome was in-hospital MAE, including death, resuscitated cardiac arrest, or cardiogenic shock. Using 31 randomly assigned centres as an index cohort (divided into training and testing sets), several ML models were evaluated to predict in-hospital MAE. The eight remaining centres were used as an external validation cohort. Among 1499 consecutive patients included (aged 64 ± 15 years, 70% male), 67 had in-hospital MAE (4.3%). Out of 28 clinical, biological, ECG, and echocardiographic variables, seven were selected to predict MAE in the training set (n = 844). Boosted cost-sensitive C5.0 technique showed the best performance compared with other ML methods [receiver operating characteristic area under the curve (AUROC) = 0.90, precision–recall AUC = 0.57, F1 score = 0.5]. Our ML score showed a better performance than existing scores (AUROC: ML score = 0.90 vs. Thrombolysis In Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) score: 0.56, Global Registry of Acute Coronary Events (GRACE) score: 0.52, Acute Heart Failure (ACUTE-HF) score: 0.65; all P &lt; 0.05). Machine learning score also showed excellent performance in the external cohort (AUROC = 0.88).                                                Conclusion                  This new ML score is the first to demonstrate improved performance in predicting in-hospital outcomes over existing scores in patients admitted to the intensive care unit based on seven simple and rapid clinical and echocardiographic variables.

The current study explored the nuanced navigation of the COVID-19-related death and burial protocols and its impact on traditional burial and funeral rites in Ghana.                              Methods                This qualitative study was based on the ‘focused’ ethnographic design. Data were collected using key informant interviews from nineteen COVID-19-related bereaved family members and public health officials involved in enforcing adherence to COVID-19-related death and burial protocols in the Cape Coast Metropolis of Central region of Ghana.  Recursive analysis was conducted to generate the themes and sub-themes from the data.                              Results                The overarching theme was “Uncultural” connotations ascribed to the COVID-19-related death and burial protocols. The COVID-19-related death and burial protocols were ubiquitously deemed by participants to be ‘uncultural’ as they inhibited deep-rooted indigenous and eschatological rites of separation between the living and the dead. This was fueled by limited awareness and knowledge about the COVID-19 burial protocols, resulting in fierce resistance by bereaved family members who demanded that public health officials release the bodies of their deceased relatives. Such resistance in the midst of resource limitation led to negotiated compromises of the COVID-19-related death and burial protocols between family members and public health officials.                              Conclusions                Insensitivity to socio-cultural practices compromised the implementation of the COVID-19 pandemic control interventions, particularly, the COVID-19-related death and burial protocols. Some compromises that were not sanctioned by the protocols were reached to allow health officials and families respectfully bury their dead. These findings call for the need to prioritize the incorporation of sociocultural practices in future pandemic prevention and management strategies.",

      "abstract": "Background            Supporting mental health and wellness is of increasing interest due to a growing recognition of the prevalence and burden of mental health issues. Mood is a central aspect of mental health, and several technologies, especially mobile apps, have helped people track and understand it. However, despite formative work on and dissemination of mood-tracking apps, it is not well understood how mood-tracking apps used in real-world contexts might benefit people and what people hope to gain from them.                                Objective            To address this gap, the purpose of this study was to understand motivations for and experiences in using mood-tracking apps from people who used them in real-world contexts.                                Methods            We interviewed 22 participants who had used mood-tracking apps using a semistructured interview and card sorting task. The interview focused on their experiences using a mood-tracking app. We then conducted a card sorting task using screenshots of various data entry and data review features from mood-tracking apps. We used thematic analysis to identify themes around why people use mood-tracking apps, what they found useful about them, and where people felt these apps fell short.                                Results            Users of mood-tracking apps were primarily motivated by negative life events or shifts in their own mental health that prompted them to engage in tracking and improve their situation. In general, participants felt that using a mood-tracking app facilitated self-awareness and helped them to look back on a previous emotion or mood experience to understand what was happening. Interestingly, some users reported less inclination to document their negative mood states and preferred to document their positive moods. There was a range of preferences for personalization and simplicity of tracking. Overall, users also liked features in which their previous tracked emotions and moods were visualized in figures or calendar form to understand trends. One gap in available mood-tracking apps was the lack of app-facilitated recommendations or suggestions for how to interpret their own data or improve their mood.                                Conclusions            Although people find various features of mood-tracking apps helpful, the way people use mood-tracking apps, such as avoiding entering negative moods, tracking infrequently, or wanting support to understand or change their moods, demonstrate opportunities for improvement. Understanding why and how people are using current technologies can provide insights to guide future designs and implementations.",

With the rapid development of whole-slide digital scanners for histopathology, computer-assisted digital pathology image analysis has attracted increasing clinical attention. Thus, the working style of pathologists is also beginning to change. Computer-assisted image analysis systems have been developed to help pathologists perform basic examinations. This paper presents a novel lightweight detection framework for automatic tumor detection in whole-slide histopathology images. We develop the Double Magnification Combination (DMC) classifier, which is a modified DenseNet-40 to make patch-level predictions with only 0.3 million parameters. To improve the detection performance of multiple instances, we propose an improved adaptive sampling method with superpixel segmentation and introduce a new heuristic factor, local sampling density, as the convergence condition of iterations. In postprocessing, we use a CNN model with 4 convolutional layers to regulate the patch-level predictions based on the predictions of adjacent sampling points and use linear interpolation to generate a tumor probability heatmap. The entire framework was trained and validated using the dataset from the Camelyon16 Grand Challenge and Hubei Cancer Hospital. In our experiments, the average AUC was 0.95 in the test set for pixel-level detection.",

To support parents in promoting positive parenting skills (ie, recognizing challenging situations and reacting appropriately), the interactive video e-learning tool ParentCoach was developed. The tool aims to teach parents generic behavioral responses by means of situational learning, tailoring, and problem solving. The first demonstration focused on sleeping problems.

Methods            We conducted usability, understandability, and acceptance tests among the target group (29 parents, 7 youth health care professionals, and 4 individuals with former lower health literacy) in different phases of the development process via focus groups, interviews, and surveys. This allowed for relevant insights on specifications and user requirements to guide the development and revision of the tool in each iteration.                                Results            Iterative testing and development allowed for the final demonstration of ParentCoach to be experienced as a relevant and accessible parenting intervention that can be used as a stand-alone program or in combination with another program.

      "abstract": "BackgroundGlobal cardiovascular disease (CVD) burden is high and rising, especially in low-income and middle-income countries (LMICs). Focussing on 45 LMICs, we aimed to determine (1) the adult population’s median 10-year predicted CVD risk, including its variation within countries by socio-demographic characteristics, and (2) the prevalence of self-reported blood pressure (BP) medication use among those with and without an indication for such medication as per World Health Organization (WHO) guidelines.Methods and findingsWe conducted a cross-sectional analysis of nationally representative household surveys from 45 LMICs carried out between 2005 and 2017, with 32 surveys being WHO Stepwise Approach to Surveillance (STEPS) surveys. Country-specific median 10-year CVD risk was calculated using the 2019 WHO CVD Risk Chart Working Group non-laboratory-based equations. BP medication indications were based on the WHO Package of Essential Noncommunicable Disease Interventions guidelines. Regression models examined associations between CVD risk, BP medication use, and socio-demographic characteristics. Our complete case analysis included 600,484 adults from 45 countries. Median 10-year CVD risk (interquartile range [IQR]) for males and females was 2.7% (2.3%–4.2%) and 1.6% (1.3%–2.1%), respectively, with estimates indicating the lowest risk in sub-Saharan Africa and highest in Europe and the Eastern Mediterranean. Higher educational attainment and current employment were associated with lower CVD risk in most countries. Of those indicated for BP medication, the median (IQR) percentage taking medication was 24.2% (15.4%–37.2%) for males and 41.6% (23.9%–53.8%) for females. Conversely, a median (IQR) 47.1% (36.1%–58.6%) of all people taking a BP medication were not indicated for such based on CVD risk status. There was no association between BP medication use and socio-demographic characteristics in most of the 45 study countries. Study limitations include variation in country survey methods, most notably the sample age range and year of data collection, insufficient data to use the laboratory-based CVD risk equations, and an inability to determine past history of a CVD diagnosis.ConclusionsThis study found underuse of guideline-indicated BP medication in people with elevated CVD risk and overuse by people with lower CVD risk. Country-specific targeted policies are needed to help improve the identification and management of those at highest CVD risk.",

      "abstract": "Background            Most patients with cancer experience psychological or physical distress, which can adversely affect their quality of life (QOL). Smartphone app interventions are increasingly being used to improve QOL and psychological outcomes in patients with cancer. However, there is insufficient evidence regarding the effect of this type of intervention, with conflicting results in the literature.                                Objective            In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we investigated the effectiveness of mobile phone app interventions on QOL and psychological outcomes in adult patients with cancer, with a special focus on intervention duration, type of cancer, intervention theory, treatment strategy, and intervention delivery format.                                Methods            We conducted a literature search of PubMed, Web of Science, the Cochrane Library, Embase, Scopus, China National Knowledge Infrastructure, and WanFang to identify studies involving apps that focused on cancer survivors and QOL or psychological symptoms published from inception to October 30, 2022. We selected only randomized controlled trials that met the inclusion criteria and performed systematic review and meta-analysis. The standardized mean difference (SMD) with a 95% CI was pooled when needed. Sensitivity and subgroup analyses were also conducted.                                Results            In total, 30 randomized controlled trials with a total of 5353 participants were included in this meta-analysis. Compared with routine care, app interventions might improve QOL (SMD=0.39, 95% CI 0.27-0.51; P<.001); enhance self-efficacy (SMD=0.15, 95% CI 0.02-0.29; P=.03); and alleviate anxiety (SMD=−0.64, 95% CI −0.73 to −0.56; P<.001), depression (SMD=−0.33, 95% CI −0.58 to −0.08; P=.009), and distress (SMD=−0.34, 95% CI −0.61 to −0.08; P=.01). Short-term (duration of ≤3 months), physician-patient interaction (2-way communication using a smartphone app), and cognitive behavioral therapy interventions might be the most effective for improving QOL and alleviating adverse psychological effects.                                Conclusions            Our study showed that interventions using mobile health apps might improve QOL and self-efficacy as well as alleviate anxiety, depression, and distress in adult cancer survivors. However, these results should be interpreted with caution because of the heterogeneity of the interventions and the study design. More rigorous trials are warranted to confirm the suitable duration and validate the different intervention theories as well as address methodological flaws in previous studies.

      "abstract": "Background            Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) are designed to provide support when individuals are receptive and can respond beneficially to the prompt. The notion of a just-in-time (JIT) state is critical for JITAIs. To date, JIT states have been formulated either in a largely data-driven way or based on theory alone. There is a need for an approach that enables rigorous theory testing and optimization of the JIT state concept.                                Objective            The purpose of this system ID experiment was to investigate JIT states empirically and enable the empirical optimization of a JITAI intended to increase physical activity (steps/d).                                Methods            We recruited physically inactive English-speaking adults aged ≥25 years who owned smartphones. Participants wore a Fitbit Versa 3 and used the study app for 270 days. The JustWalk JITAI project uses system ID methods to study JIT states. Specifically, provision of support systematically varied across different theoretically plausible operationalizations of JIT states to enable a more rigorous and systematic study of the concept. We experimentally varied 2 intervention components: notifications delivered up to 4 times per day designed to increase a person’s steps within the next 3 hours and suggested daily step goals. Notifications to walk were experimentally provided across varied operationalizations of JIT states accounting for need (ie, whether daily step goals were previously met or not), opportunity (ie, whether the next 3 h were a time window during which a person had previously walked), and receptivity (ie, a person previously walked after receiving notifications). Suggested daily step goals varied systematically within a range related to a person’s baseline level of steps per day (eg, 4000) until they met clinically meaningful targets (eg, averaging 8000 steps/d as the lower threshold across a cycle). A series of system ID estimation approaches will be used to analyze the data and obtain control-oriented dynamical models to study JIT states. The estimated models from all approaches will be contrasted, with the ultimate goal of guiding rigorous, replicable, empirical formulation and study of JIT states to inform a future JITAI.                                Results            As is common in system ID, we conducted a series of simulation studies to formulate the experiment. The results of our simulation studies illustrated the plausibility of this approach for generating informative and unique data for studying JIT states. The study began enrolling participants in June 2022, with a final enrollment of 48 participants. Data collection concluded in April 2023. Upon completion of the analyses, the results of this study are expected to be submitted for publication in the fourth quarter of 2023.                                Conclusions            This study will be the first empirical investigation of JIT states that uses system ID methods to inform the optimization of a scalable JITAI for physical activity.

Those with at least a partial response to VI continued to receive 44 weeks of multi‐agent chemotherapy including the assigned VI regimen. UR patients who did not have measurable disease at study entry, did not have a radiographic response after the VI window, or declined VI window therapy received 31 weeks of multi‐agent chemotherapy including tirapazamine (TPZ) at weeks 1, 4, 10, 19, and 28. Favorable‐risk (FR) patients received 31 weeks of the same multi‐agent chemotherapy without VI and TPZ.ResultsOne hundred thirty‐six eligible patients were enrolled. For 61 patients not responding to VI, the 3‐year failure‐free survival (FFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 17% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8%‐29%) and 24% (13%‐37%), respectively. For 30 UR patients not treated with VI, the 3‐year FFS and OS rates were 21% (8%‐37%) and 39% (20%‐57%), respectively. FR patients had 3‐year FFS and OS rates of 79% (47%‐93%) and 84% (50%‐96%), respectively. There were no unexpected toxicities.ConclusionsPatients with UR RMS at first relapse or disease progression have a poor prognosis when they are treated with this multi‐agent therapy, whereas FR patients have a higher chance of being cured with second‐line therapy.",

These technologies have been introduced in order to make life easier for patients with diabetes by allowing better control of the stability of blood sugar levels and anticipating the occurrence of dangerous events (hypo/hyperglycemia), etc. That being said, the main objectives of the self-management of diabetes is to improve the lifestyle and life quality of patients with diabetes; (2) Methods: We performed a systematic review based on articles that focus on the use of smart devices for the monitoring and better management of diabetes. The search was focused on keywords related to the topic, such as “Diabetes”, “Technology”, “Self-management”, “Artificial Intelligence”, etc. This was performed using databases, such as Scopus, Google Scholar, and PubMed; (3) Results: A total of 89 studies, published between 2011 and 2021, were included. The majority of the selected research aims to solve a diabetes management problem (e.g., blood glucose prediction, early detection of risk events, and the automatic adjustment of insulin doses, etc.). In these studies, wearable devices were used in combination with artificial intelligence (AI) techniques; (4) Conclusions: Wearable devices have attracted a great deal of scientific interest in the field of healthcare for people with chronic conditions, such as diabetes. They are capable of assisting in the management of diabetes, as well as preventing complications associated with this condition. Furthermore, the usage of these devices has improved illness management and quality of life.",

Materials and Methods                  We extracted user comments to alerts generated from September 1, 2022 to September 1, 2023 at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. For a subset of 8 alerts, comment summaries were generated independently by 2 physicians and then separately by GPT-4. We surveyed 5 CDS experts to rate the human-generated and AI-generated summaries on a scale from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) for the 4 metrics: clarity, completeness, accuracy, and usefulness.                                                Results                  Five CDS experts participated in the survey. A total of 16 human-generated summaries and 8 AI-generated summaries were assessed. Among the top 8 rated summaries, five were generated by GPT-4. AI-generated summaries demonstrated high levels of clarity, accuracy, and usefulness, similar to the human-generated summaries. Moreover, AI-generated summaries exhibited significantly higher completeness and usefulness compared to the human-generated summaries (AI: 3.4 ± 1.2, human: 2.7 ± 1.2, P = .001).                                                Conclusion                  End-user comments provide clinicians’ immediate feedback to CDS alerts and can serve as a direct and valuable data resource for improving CDS delivery. Traditionally, these comments may not be considered in the CDS review process due to their unstructured nature, large volume, and the presence of redundant or irrelevant content. Our study demonstrates that GPT-4 is capable of distilling these comments into summaries characterized by high clarity, accuracy, and completeness. AI-generated summaries are equivalent and potentially better than human-generated summaries. These AI-generated summaries could provide CDS experts with a novel means of reviewing user comments to rapidly optimize CDS alerts both online and offline.",

      "abstract": "Background            Mobile app-assisted self-care interventions are emerging promising tools to support self-care of patients with chronic diseases such as type 2 diabetes and hypertension. The effectiveness of such interventions requires further exploration for more supporting evidence.                                Objective            A systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) were conducted to examine the effectiveness of mobile app-assisted self-care interventions developed for type 2 diabetes and/or hypertension in improving patient outcomes.                                Methods            We followed the Cochrane Collaboration guidelines and searched MEDLINE, Cochrane Library, EMBASE, and CINAHL Plus for relevant studies published between January 2007 and January 2019. Primary outcomes included changes in hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels, systolic blood pressure (SBP), and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). Changes in other clinical-, behavioral-, knowledge-, and psychosocial-related outcomes were included as secondary outcomes. Primary outcomes and objective secondary outcomes that were reported in at least two trials were meta-analyzed; otherwise, a narrative synthesis was used for data analysis.                                Results            A total of 27 trials were identified and analyzed. For primary outcomes, the use of mobile app-assisted self-care interventions was associated with significant reductions in HbA1c levels (standardized mean difference [SMD] −0.44, 95% CI −0.59 to −0.29; P<.001), SBP (SMD −0.17, 95% CI −0.31 to −0.03, P=.02), and DBP (SMD −0.17, 95% CI −0.30 to −0.03, P=.02). Subgroup analyses for primary outcomes showed that several intervention features were supportive of self-management, including blood glucose, blood pressure, and medication monitoring, communication with health care providers, automated feedback, personalized goal setting, reminders, education materials, and data visualization. In addition, 8 objective secondary outcomes were meta-analyzed, which showed that the interventions had significant lowering effects on fasting blood glucose levels and waist circumference. A total of 42 secondary outcomes were narratively synthesized, and mixed results were found.                                Conclusions            Mobile app-assisted self-care interventions can be effective tools for managing blood glucose and blood pressure, likely because their use facilitates remote management of health issues and data, provision of personalized self-care recommendations, patient–care provider communication, and decision making. More studies are required to further determine which combinations of intervention features are most effective in improving the control of the diseases. Moreover, evidence regarding the effects of these interventions on the behavioral, knowledge, and psychosocial outcomes of patients is still scarce, which warrants further examination.",

      "abstract": "Background            Chronic disease management is a major health issue worldwide. With the paradigm shift to preventive medicine, disease prediction modeling using machine learning is gaining importance for precise and accurate medical judgement.                                Objective            This study aimed to develop high-performance prediction models for 4 chronic diseases using the common data model (CDM) and machine learning and to confirm the possibility for the extension of the proposed models.                                Methods            In this study, 4 major chronic diseases—namely, diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular disease—were selected, and a model for predicting their occurrence within 10 years was developed. For model development, the Atlas analysis tool was used to define the chronic disease to be predicted, and data were extracted from the CDM according to the defined conditions. A model for predicting each disease was built with 4 algorithms verified in previous studies, and the performance was compared after applying a grid search.                                Results            For the prediction of each disease, we applied 4 algorithms (logistic regression, gradient boosting, random forest, and extreme gradient boosting), and all models show greater than 80% accuracy. As compared to the optimized model’s performance, extreme gradient boosting presented the highest predictive performance for the 4 diseases (diabetes, hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and cardiovascular disease) with 80% or greater and from 0.84 to 0.93 in area under the curve standards.                                Conclusions            This study demonstrates the possibility for the preemptive management of chronic diseases by predicting the occurrence of chronic diseases using the CDM and machine learning. With these models, the risk of developing major chronic diseases within 10 years can be demonstrated by identifying health risk factors using our chronic disease prediction machine learning model developed with the real-world data–based CDM and National Health Insurance Corporation examination data that individuals can easily obtain.",

      "abstract": "Background            Social anxiety disorder is a highly prevalent and burdensome condition. Persons with social anxiety frequently avoid seeking physician support and rarely receive treatment. Social anxiety symptoms are frequently underreported and underrecognized, creating a barrier to the accurate assessment of these symptoms. Consequently, more research is needed to identify passive biomarkers of social anxiety symptom severity. Digital phenotyping, the use of passive sensor data to inform health care decisions, offers a possible method of addressing this assessment barrier.                                Objective            This study aims to determine whether passive sensor data acquired from smartphone data can accurately predict social anxiety symptom severity using a publicly available dataset.                                Methods            In this study, participants (n=59) completed self-report assessments of their social anxiety symptom severity, depressive symptom severity, positive affect, and negative affect. Next, participants installed an app, which passively collected data about their movement (accelerometers) and social contact (incoming and outgoing calls and texts) over 2 weeks. Afterward, these passive sensor data were used to form digital biomarkers, which were paired with machine learning models to predict participants’ social anxiety symptom severity.                                Results            The results suggested that these passive sensor data could be utilized to accurately predict participants’ social anxiety symptom severity (r=0.702 between predicted and observed symptom severity) and demonstrated discriminant validity between depression, negative affect, and positive affect.                                Conclusions            These results suggest that smartphone sensor data may be utilized to accurately detect social anxiety symptom severity and discriminate social anxiety symptom severity from depressive symptoms, negative affect, and positive affect.",

The European Play Store and Apple App Store were systematically searched and relevant apps were tested. Two raters independently assessed app quality using the Mobile Application Rating Scale and conducted a content analysis of provided persuasive system design principles and self-management tasks. A total of 2,269 mobile health applications were identified and 120 could be included in the evaluation. The overall quality was rated as moderateM = 3.20 (SD = 0.39, min = 2.31, max = 4.62), with shortcomings in the subcategories of engagement (M = 2.80,SD = 0.67) and information quality (M = 2.26,SD = 0.48). Scientific evidence is available for 8% of the apps. The reviewed apps implemented a median of three persuasive system design principles (range 0–15) and targeted a median of 4.5 (range 1–8) self-management tasks, however, with a lack of information about psychosocial coping strategies. Most available diabetes self-management apps lack a scientific evidence base. Persuasive system design features are underrepresented and may form a promising tool to improve app quality. Furthermore, the interaction of physical and behavioral health should be improved in existing diabetes self-management mobile health applications.",

This study aimed to identify, appraise and synthesise the barriers and facilitators that influenced the delivery of sustained healthcare interventions in a hospital-based setting.                              Methods                A systematic review reported in accordance with PRISMA. Eight electronic databases were reviewed in addition to a hand search of Implementation Science journal and reference lists of included articles. Two reviewers were used to screen potential abstracts and full text papers against a selection criteria. Study quality was also independently assessed by two reviewers. Barriers and facilitators were extracted and mapped to a consolidated sustainability framework.                              Results                Our searching identified 154,757 records. We screened 14,626 abstracts and retrieved 431 full text papers, of which 32 studies met the selection criteria. The majority of studies employed a qualitative design (23/32) and were conducted in the UK (8/32) and the USA (8/32). Interventions or programmes were all multicomponent, with the majority aimed at improving the quality of patient care and/ or safety (22/32). Sustainability was inconsistently reported across 30 studies. Barriers and facilitators were reported in all studies. The key facilitators included a clear accountability of roles and responsibilities (23/32); ensuring the availability of strong leadership and champions advocating the use of the intervention (22/32), and provision of adequate support available at an organisational level (21/32). The most frequently reported barrier to sustainability was inadequate staff resourcing (15/32). Our review also identified the importance of inwards spread and development of the initiative over time, as well as the unpredictability of sustainability and the need for multifaceted approaches.                              Conclusions                This review has important implications for practice and research as it increases understanding of the factors that faciliate and hinder intervention sustainability. It also highlights the need for more consistent and complete reporting of sustainability to ensure that lessons learned can be of direct benefit to future implementation of interventions.

Methods                PubMed, Cochrane and Embase were searched to include potentially eligible studies. The primary outcomes included progression-free survival (DFS) by ctDNA status at baseline, postoperative, and longitudinal timepoints. The IPD-based survival data was retracted and used in reconstructed IPD-based meta-analysis. Subgroup analysis was implemented based on the baseline characteristics.                              Results                Totally, 28 studies were involved, including 15 full-length articles (1686 patients) for IPD-based synthesis and 20 studies for conventional meta-analysis. The IPD-based meta-analysis discovered that patients with positive ctDNA status at the baseline (hazard ratio, HR = 3.73, 95% confidential interval, CI: 2.95–4.72), postoperative (3.96, 2.19–7.16), or longitudinal timepoints (12.33, 8.72–17.43) showed significantly higher risk of recurrence. Patients with persistent ctDNA-negative status had the lowest recurrence rate, and the negative conversion of ctDNA from baseline to postoperative timepoints was correlated with elevated DFS. Subgroup analyses suggested that stage II–III patients with ctDNA-positive status may achieve preferable therapeutic outcomes.                              Conclusions                Plasm ctDNA monitoring shows excellent clinical significance at the tested timepoints.

A smartwatch/smartphone combination serves as a hub for personal/wearable sensing devices collecting data on health (eg, heart rate, spirometry, medications), motion, and personal exposures (eg, particulate matter, ozone); securely transmitting information to BREATHE’s servers; and interacting with the user (eg, ecological momentary assessments). Server-side integration of electronic health record data and spatiotemporally correlated information (eg, weather, traffic) elaborates on these observations. An initial panel study involving pediatric asthma patients was conducted to assess BREATHE.ResultsTwenty subjects were enrolled, during which BREATHE accrued seven consecutive days of continuous data per individual. The data were used to confirm knowledge about asthma (use of controller inhalers, time-activity behaviors, personal air pollution exposure), and additional analyses provided insights into within-day associations of environmental triggers and asthma exacerbations. Exit surveys focusing on mHealth usability, while positive, noted several translational challenges.DiscussionBased on these promising results, a longitudinal panel study to evaluate individual microenvironments and exposures is ongoing. Lessons learned thus far reflect the need to address various usability aspects, including convenience and ongoing engagement.ConclusionBREATHE enables multi-sensor mHealth studies, capturing new types of information alongside an evolving understanding of personal exposomes.",

However, there is little information on how DMHTs are evaluated and what factors influence their use.ObjectiveA systematic literature review was conducted to understand how DMHTs are valued in the United States from user, payer, and employer perspectives.MethodsArticles published after 2017 were identified from MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, Cochrane Library, the Health Technology Assessment Database, and digital and mental health congresses. Each article was evaluated by 2 independent reviewers to identify US studies reporting on factors considered in the evaluation of DMHTs targeting mental health, Alzheimer disease, epilepsy, autism spectrum disorder, or attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder. Study quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Program Qualitative and Cohort Studies Checklists. Studies were coded and indexed using the American Psychiatric Association’s Mental Health App Evaluation Framework to extract and synthesize relevant information, and novel themes were added iteratively as identified.ResultsOf the 4353 articles screened, data from 26 unique studies from patient, caregiver, and health care provider perspectives were included. Engagement style was the most reported theme (23/26, 88%), with users valuing DMHT usability, particularly alignment with therapeutic goals through features including anxiety management tools. Key barriers to DMHT use included limited internet access, poor technical literacy, and privacy concerns. Novel findings included the discreetness of DMHTs to avoid stigma.ConclusionsUsability, cost, accessibility, technical considerations, and alignment with therapeutic goals are important to users, although DMHT valuation varies across individuals. DMHT apps should be developed and selected with specific user needs in mind.",

It is well known that it constitutes a major risk factor for chronic diseases and the leading cause of preventable death worldwide. Due to high prevalence of smokers, new cost-effective strategies seeking to increase smoking cessation rates are needed.                              Methods                We performed a Markov model-based cost-effectiveness analysis comparing two treatments: health advice provided by general practitioners and nurses in primary care, and health advice reinforced by sending motivational text messages to smokers’ mobile phones. A Markov model was used in which smokers transitioned between three mutually exclusive health states (smoker, former smoker and dead) after 6-month cycles. We calculated the cost-effectiveness ratio associated with the sending of motivational messages. Health care and society perspectives (separately) was adopted. Costs taken into account were direct health care costs and direct health care cost and costs for lost productivity, respectively. Additionally, deterministic sensitivity analysis was performed modifying the probability of smoking cessation with each option.                              Results                Sending of text messages as a tool to support health advice was found to be cost-effective as it was associated with increases in costs of €7.4 and €1,327 per QALY gained (ICUR) for men and women respectively from a healthcare perspective, significantly far from the published cost-effectiveness threshold. From a societal perspective, the combined programmed was dominant.                              Conclusions                Sending text messages is a cost-effective approach. These findings support the implantation of the combined program across primary care health centres.",

      "abstract": "Background            Individuals experiencing psychosis are at a disproportionate risk for premature disengagement from clinical treatment. Barriers to clinical engagement typically result from funding constraints causing limited access to and flexibility in services. Digital strategies, such as SMS text messaging, offer a low-cost alternative to potentially improve engagement. However, little is known about the efficacy of SMS text messaging in psychosis.                                Objective            This review aimed to address this gap, providing insights into the relationship between SMS text messaging and clinical engagement in the treatment of psychosis.                                Methods            Studies examining SMS text messaging as an engagement strategy in the treatment of psychosis were reviewed. Included studies were published from the year 2000 onward in the English language, with no methodological restrictions, and were identified using 3 core databases and gray literature sources.                                Results            Of the 233 studies extracted, 15 were eligible for inclusion. Most studies demonstrated the positive effects of SMS text messaging on dimensions of engagement such as medication adherence, clinic attendance, and therapeutic alliance. Studies examining the feasibility of SMS text messaging interventions found that they are safe, easy to use, and positively received.                                Conclusions            Overall, SMS text messaging is a low-cost, practical method of improving engagement in the treatment of psychosis, although efficacy may vary by symptomology and personal characteristics. Cost-effectiveness and safety considerations were not adequately examined in the studies included. Future studies should consider personalizing SMS text messaging interventions and include cost and safety analyses to appraise readiness for implementation.",

      "abstract": "Personal health records designed for shared decision making (SDM) have the potential to engage patients and provide opportunities for positive health outcomes. Given the limited number of published interventions that become normal practice, this preimplementation evaluation of an integrated SDM personal health record system (e-PHR) was underpinned by Normalization Process Theory (NPT). The theory provides a framework to analyze cognitive and behavioral mechanisms known to influence implementation success. A mixed-methods investigation was utilized to explain the work required to implement e-PHR and its potential to integrate into practice. Patients, care providers, and electronic health record (EHR) and clinical leaders (n = 27) offered a rich explanation of the implementation work. Reliability tests of the NPT-based instrument negated the use of scores for two of the four mechanisms. Participants indicated that e-PHR made sense as explained by two qualitative themes: game-changing technology and sensibility of change. Participants appraised e-PHR as explained by two themes: reflecting on value and monitoring and adapting. The combined qualitative and quantitative results for the other two NPT mechanisms corroborated. Participants strongly agreed (score = 4.6/5) with processes requiring an investment in commitment, explained by two themes: sharing ownership of the work and enabling involvement. Weak agreement (score = 3.6/5) was observed with processes requiring an investment in effort, explained by one theme: uncovering the challenge of building collective action, and three subthemes: assessing fit, adapting to change together, and investing in the change. Finally, participants strongly agreed (score = 4.5/5) that e-PHR would positively affect engagement in self-management decision-making in two themes: care is efficient, and care is patient-centered. Overall, successful integration of e-PHR will only be attained when systemic effort is invested to enact it. Additional investigation is needed to explore the collective action gaps to inform priorities and approaches for future implementation success. This research has implications for patients, care providers, EHR vendors, and the healthcare system for improving the effectiveness and efficiency of patient-centric services. Findings confirm the usefulness of NPT for planning and understanding implementation success of PHRs.",

This secondary analysis of a text message–delivered extended contact intervention (‘Get Healthy, Stay Healthy’ (GHSH)) explores the extent to which changes in physical activity, dietary behaviors and body weight were associated with the frequency of text messages (dose) and contact between the health coach and participant (engagement).                              Methods                Following a telephone coaching program, participants were randomised to receive extended contact via tailored text messages (GHSH, n = 114) or no additional contact (n = 114) over a 6-month period. Message dose, timing, and content were based on participant preferences, ascertained during two tailoring telephone calls. All incoming and outgoing messages were recorded. At baseline and 6 months, participants self-reported body weight and dietary behaviors (fruit and vegetable servings/day). Moderate-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) was assessed via accelerometry.                              Results                Median dose (25th, 75th percentile) was 53 (33, 72) text messages in total across six months. Mean fortnightly dose in weeks 1–2 was 5.5 (95 % CI: 4.3, 6.6) text messages, and remained stable (with the exception of planned decreases in weeks involving additional intervention contacts). Offset against the average fortnightly dose of goal checks (1.6, 95 % CI: 1.3, 2.0 and 1.5, 95 % CI: 1.2, 1.8, for physical activity and diet respectively), mean replies to goal checks were highest in weeks 1–2 (1.4, 95 % CI: 1.4, 1.5 and 1.3, 95 % CI: 1.2, 1.4, respectively) and tended to become lower in most weeks thereafter. Greater weight loss was positively associated with text message dose (P = 0.022), with a difference of 1.9 kg between participants receiving the most and fewest texts. There was no association between engagement and changes in outcome measures.                              Conclusions                A fixed dose of texts does not seem suitable to meet participants’ individual preferences. Higher self-selected text doses predicted better weight outcomes. However, greater participant engagement through text replies does not predict more favourable outcomes, despite being a suggested facilitator of successful behavior change maintenance.

The belief that mHealth apps have the potential to make the health care system more efficient, close gaps in care, and improve the economic outcomes related to health is unwavering and already partially confirmed. Nevertheless, problems and barriers in the context of mHealth apps usually remain unconsidered.                                Objective            The focus groups and interviews conducted in this study aim to shed light on problems and barriers in the context of mHealth apps from the perspective of patients.                                Methods            Guided focus groups and individual interviews were conducted with patients with a disease for which an approved mHealth app was available at the time of the interviews. Participants were recruited via self-help groups. The interviews were recorded, transcribed, and subjected to a qualitative content analysis. The content analysis was based on 10 problem categories (“validity,” “usability,” “technology,” “use and adherence,” “data privacy and security,” “patient-physician relationship,” “knowledge and skills,” “individuality,” “implementation,” and “costs”) identified in a previously conducted scoping review. Participants were asked to fill out an additional questionnaire about their sociodemographic data and about their use of technology.                                Results            A total of 38 patients were interviewed in 5 focus groups (3 onsite and 2 web-based) and 5 individual web-based interviews. The additional questionnaire was completed by 32 of the participants. Patients presented with a variety of different diseases, such as arthrosis, tinnitus, depression, or lung cancer. Overall, 16% (5/32) of the participants had already been prescribed an app. During the interviews, all 10 problem categories were discussed and considered important by patients. A myriad of problem manifestations could be identified for each category. This study shows that there are relevant problems and barriers in the context of mHealth apps from the perspective of patients, which warrant further attention.                                Conclusions            There are essentially 3 different areas of problems in the context of mHealth apps that could be addressed to improve care: quality of the respective mHealth app, its integration into health care, and the expandable digital literacy of patients.",

Objective            This study aimed to evaluate the effect of an intervention in nonregular blood donors using web-based videos and SMS text messages, in which the former was guided by the extended theory of planned behavior, to discover effective intervention methods to improve repeat blood donation rates among nonregular blood donors.                                Methods            A total of 692 nonregular blood donors in Zhejiang province were randomly divided into intervention and control groups. The control group received regular, short reminder messages for a 6-month period, whereas the intervention group received web-based videos on the WeChat platform. The intervention group was guided by an extended theory of planned behavior, which included 9 factors: the respondents’ attitude, subjective behavioral norms, perceived behavioral control, the willingness to donate blood, outcome expectations, self-identity, blood donation–related anxiety, cognition of the blood donation environment, and previous blood donation experience. The intervention group was divided into 2 stages: those with an intervention at 3 months and those with a follow-up 3 months later. After 6 months, the redonation rate was evaluated for the 2 groups, and the scale in the intervention group was determined both before and after the intervention. A t test, chi-square test, logistic stepwise regression, and ANOVA were performed.                                Results            The intervention group’s redonation rate was 16.14%, which was significantly higher than the control group’s redonation rate of 5.16%; P<.001. Men who were aged 31 to 45 years and had donated blood twice had a higher redonation rate after the web-based video intervention than after the SMS text messages; P<.05. The repeat donors’ improved blood donation anxiety (P=.01), outcome expectations (P=.008), and cognition of the blood donation environment (P=.005) after the intervention were significantly higher than those of the nonrepeat donors.                                Conclusions            The web-based short video intervention based on the extended theory of planned behavior can effectively improve redonation rates. Outcome expectations, blood donation anxiety, and cognition of the blood donation environment can directly influence irregular blood donors to redonate blood.",

      "abstract": "AbstractFor the fields of implementation science and health equity, understanding and being responsive to local contexts is of utmost importance to better inform the development, implementation, and evaluation of healthcare and public health interventions to increase their uptake and sustainment. Contexts are multi-level and include political, historical, economic, and social factors that influence health, as well as organizational characteristics, reflecting the richness of members’ views, resources, values, and needs. Poor alignment between solutions and those contextual characteristics could have an impact on inequities. The PRISM (Practical Robust Implementation and Sustainability Model) is a context-based implementation science framework that incorporates RE-AIM outcomes (Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, Maintenance) and offers guidance to researchers, practitioners, and their patient and community partners on how to conceptualize, assess, and address contextual domains with a focus on health equity. Drawing from systems thinking, participatory engagement, and health equity principles, this commentary expands on previous work to 1) offer a novel perspective on how to align an intervention’s core functions and forms with the PRISM’s contextual domains, and 2) foster an ongoing and iterative engagement process with diverse partners throughout the research and practice process using a co-creation approach. We recommend intervention-to-context alignment through iterative cycles. To that end, we present the RE-AIM Framework’s ‘outcomes cascade’ to illustrate touch points of opportunity and gaps within and across each of the five RE-AIM outcomes to illustrate ‘where things go wrong’. We present a case study to illustrate and offer recommendations for research and practice efforts to increase contextual responsiveness, and enhance alignment with context before, during, and after implementation efforts and to ensure equity is being addressed. We strive to make a conceptual contribution to advance the field of pragmatic research and implementation of evidence-based practices through the application of the contextually-based PRISM framework with a focus on health equity.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundPregnant and postpartum women living with HIV (WLWH) need support for HIV and maternal child health (MCH) care, which could be provided using short message service (SMS).Methods and findingsWe compared 2-way (interactive) and 1-way SMS messaging to no SMS in a 3-arm randomized trial in 6 MCH clinics in Kenya. Messages were developed using the Health Belief Model and Social Cognitive Theory; HIV messages were integrated into an existing MCH SMS platform. Intervention participants received visit reminders and prespecified weekly SMS on antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and MCH, tailored to their characteristics and timing. Two-way participants could message nurses as needed. Clinic attendance, viral load (VL), and infant HIV results were abstracted from program records. Primary outcomes were viral nonsuppression (VL ≥1,000 c/ml), on-time clinic attendance, loss to follow-up from clinical care, and infant HIV-free survival. Among 824 pregnant women randomized between November 2015 and May 2017, median age was 27 years, gestational age was 24.3 weeks, and time since initiation of ART was 1.0 year. During follow-up to 2 years postpartum, 9.8% of 3,150 VL assessments and 19.6% of women were ever nonsuppressed, with no significant difference in 1-way versus control (11.2% versus 9.6%, adjusted risk ratio (aRR) 1.02 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.67 to 1.54], p = 0.94) or 2-way versus control (8.5% versus 9.6%, aRR 0.80 [95% CI 0.52 to 1.23], p = 0.31). Median ART adherence and incident ART resistance did not significantly differ by arm. Overall, 88.9% (95% CI 76.5 to 95.7) of visits were on time, with no significant differences between arms (88.2% in control versus 88.6% in 1-way and 88.8% in 2-way). Incidence of infant HIV or death was 3.01/100 person-years (py), with no significant difference between arms; risk of infant HIV infection was 0.94%. Time to postpartum contraception was significantly shorter in the 2-way arm than control. Study limitations include limited ability to detect improvement due to high viral suppression and visit attendance and imperfect synchronization of SMS reminders to clinic visits.ConclusionsIntegrated HIV/MCH messaging did not improve HIV outcomes but was associated with improved initiation of postpartum contraception. In programs where most women are virally suppressed, targeted SMS informed by VL data may improve effectiveness. Rigorous evaluation remains important to optimize mobile health (mHealth) interventions.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov number NCT02400671.",

      "abstract": "BackgroundSending emergency messages via mobile phone text messaging can be a promising communication tool to rapidly disseminate information and promote preventive behavior among the public during epidemic outbreaks. The battle to overcome COVID-19 is not yet over; thus, it is essential that the public practices preventive measures to prevent the spread of COVID-19.ObjectiveThis study aimed to investigate the effectiveness of reading and obtaining information via emergency alert SMS text messages and their effects on the individual's practice of preventive behaviors during the early stages of the COVID-19 outbreak in South Korea.MethodsA cross-sectional web-based survey comprising 990 participants was conducted over 3 days (March 25-27, 2020). A multivariable logistic regression analysis revealed the sociodemographic factors that might influence the behavior of reading emergency alert text messages. A hierarchical linear regression model estimated the associations between reading emergency alert text messages for each precautionary behavior practiced against COVID-19. Additionally, the indirect effects of reading the text messages on each precautionary behavior via psychological factors (ie, perceived risk and response efficacy) were calculated. All data were weighted according to the 2019 Korea census data.ResultsOverall, 49.2% (487/990) of the participants reported that they always read emergency alert text messages and visited the linked website to obtain more information. Factors such as female sex (odds ratio [OR] 1.68, 95% CI 1.28-2.21) and older age (30-39 years: OR 2.02, 95% CI 1.25-3.28; 40-49 years: OR 2.84, 95% CI 1.80-4.47; 50-59 years: OR 3.19, 95% CI 2.01-5.06; 60 years and above: OR 3.12, 95% CI 2.00-4.86 versus 18-29 years) were identified to be associated with a higher frequency of reading the text messages. Participants who always read the text messages practiced wearing facial masks (β=.074, P=.01) more frequently than those who did not. In terms of social distancing, participants who reported they always read the text messages avoided crowded places (β=.078, P=.01) and canceled or postponed social gatherings (β=.103, P<.001) more frequently than those who did not read the text messages. Furthermore, reading text messages directly and indirectly affected practicing precautionary behaviors, as the mediation effect of response efficacy between reading text messages and practicing preventive behaviors was significant.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that emergency alert text messages sent to individuals' mobile phones are timely and effective strategies for encouraging preventive behavior in public. Sending emergency alert text messages to provide the public with accurate and reliable information could be positively considered by the health authorities, which might reduce the negative impact of infodemics.",

      "abstract": "Background            With the rise of mobile medicine, the development of new technologies such as smart sensing, and the popularization of personalized health concepts, the field of smart wearable devices has developed rapidly in recent years. Among them, medical wearable devices have become one of the most promising fields. These intelligent devices not only assist people in pursuing a healthier lifestyle but also provide a constant stream of health care data for disease diagnosis and treatment by actively recording physiological parameters and tracking metabolic status. Therefore, wearable medical devices have the potential to become a mainstay of the future mobile medical market.                                Objective            Although previous reviews have discussed consumer trends in wearable electronics and the application of wearable technology in recreational and sporting activities, data on broad clinical usefulness are lacking. We aimed to review the current application of wearable devices in health care while highlighting shortcomings for further research. In addition to daily health and safety monitoring, the focus of our work was mainly on the use of wearable devices in clinical practice.                                Methods            We conducted a narrative review of the use of wearable devices in health care settings by searching papers in PubMed, EMBASE, Scopus, and the Cochrane Library published since October 2015. Potentially relevant papers were then compared to determine their relevance and reviewed independently for inclusion.                                Results            A total of 82 relevant papers drawn from 960 papers on the subject of wearable devices in health care settings were qualitatively analyzed, and the information was synthesized. Our review shows that the wearable medical devices developed so far have been designed for use on all parts of the human body, including the head, limbs, and torso. These devices can be classified into 4 application areas: (1) health and safety monitoring, (2) chronic disease management, (3) disease diagnosis and treatment, and (4) rehabilitation. However, the wearable medical device industry currently faces several important limitations that prevent further use of wearable technology in medical practice, such as difficulties in achieving user-friendly solutions, security and privacy concerns, the lack of industry standards, and various technical bottlenecks.                                Conclusions            We predict that with the development of science and technology and the popularization of personalized health concepts, wearable devices will play a greater role in the field of health care and become better integrated into people’s daily lives. However, more research is needed to explore further applications of wearable devices in the medical field. We hope that this review can provide a useful reference for the development of wearable medical devices.",

      "abstract": "Background            Mobile health interventions delivered through mobile apps are increasingly used in physiotherapy care. This may be because of the potential of apps to facilitate changes in behavior, which is central to the aims of care delivered by physiotherapists. A benefit of using apps is their ability to incorporate behavior change techniques (BCTs) that can optimize the effectiveness of physiotherapeutic interventions. Research continues to suggest that despite their importance, behavior change strategies are often missing in patient management. Evaluating mobile apps that physiotherapists can use to drive behavior change may inform clinical practice and potentially improve patient outcomes. Examining the quality of apps and exploring their key features that can support behavior change and physiotherapy care are important aspects of such an evaluation.                                Objective            The primary aim of this study was to describe the range of mobile apps in app stores that are intended for use by patients to support physiotherapy care. The secondary aims were to assess app quality, BCTs, and their behavior change potential.                                Methods            A systematic review of mobile apps in app stores was undertaken. The Apple App Store and Google Play were searched using a 2-step search strategy, using terms relevant to the physiotherapy discipline. Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were applied: apps had to be intended for use by patients and be self-contained (or stand-alone) without the requirement to be used in conjunction with a partner wearable device or another plugin. Included apps were coded for BCTs using the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy version 1. App quality was assessed using the Mobile App Rating Scale, and the App Behavior Change Scale was used to assess the app’s potential to change behavior.                                Results            In total, 1240 apps were screened, and 35 were included. Of these 35 apps, 22 (63%) were available on both the Apple App Store and Google Play platforms. In total, 24 (69%) were general in their focus (eg, not condition-specific), with the remaining 11 (31%) being more specific (eg, knee rehabilitation and pelvic floor training). The mean app quality score (Mobile App Rating Scale) was 3.7 (SD 0.4) of 5 (range 2.8-4.5). The mean number of BCTs identified per app was 8.5 (SD 3.6). BCTs most frequently included in the apps were instruction on how to perform a behavior (n=32), action planning (n=30), and self-monitoring of behavior (n=28). The mean behavior change potential score (App Behavior Change Scale) was 8.5 (SD 3.1) of 21 (range 3-15).                                Conclusions            Mobile apps available to support patient care received from a physiotherapist are of variable quality. Although they contain some BCTs, the potential for behavior change varied widely across apps.

      "abstract": "Background            Mobile health (mHealth) interventions are becoming more common in low-income countries. Existing research often overlooks implementation challenges associated with the design and technology requirements of mHealth interventions.                                Objective            We aimed to characterize the challenges that we encountered in the implementation of a complex mHealth intervention in Uganda.                                Methods            We customized a commercial mobile survey app to facilitate a two-arm household-randomized, controlled trial of home-based tuberculosis (TB) contact investigation. We incorporated digital fingerprinting for patient identification in both study arms and automated SMS messages in the intervention arm only. A local research team systematically documented challenges to implementation in biweekly site visit reports, project management reports, and minutes from biweekly conference calls. We then classified these challenges using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR).                                Results            We identified challenges in three principal CFIR domains: (1) intervention characteristics, (2) inner setting, and (3) characteristics of implementers. The adaptability of the app to the local setting was limited by software and hardware requirements. The complexity and logistics of implementing the intervention further hindered its adaptability. Study staff reported that community health workers (CHWs) were enthusiastic regarding the use of technology to enhance TB contact investigation during training and the initial phase of implementation. After experiencing technological failures, their trust in the technology declined along with their use of it. Finally, complex data structures impeded the development and execution of a data management plan that would allow for articulation of goals and provide timely feedback to study staff, CHWs, and participants.                                Conclusions            mHealth technologies have the potential to make delivery of public health interventions more direct and efficient, but we found that a lack of adaptability, excessive complexity, loss of trust among end users, and a lack of effective feedback systems can undermine implementation, especially in low-resource settings where digital services have not yet proliferated. Implementers should anticipate and strive to avoid these barriers by investing in and adapting to local human and material resources, prioritizing feedback from end users, and optimizing data management and quality assurance procedures.

      "abstract": "Background            Conversational artificial intelligence (CAI) is emerging as a promising digital technology for mental health care. CAI apps, such as psychotherapeutic chatbots, are available in app stores, but their use raises ethical concerns.                                Objective            We aimed to provide a comprehensive overview of ethical considerations surrounding CAI as a therapist for individuals with mental health issues.                                Methods            We conducted a systematic search across PubMed, Embase, APA PsycINFO, Web of Science, Scopus, the Philosopher’s Index, and ACM Digital Library databases. Our search comprised 3 elements: embodied artificial intelligence, ethics, and mental health. We defined CAI as a conversational agent that interacts with a person and uses artificial intelligence to formulate output. We included articles discussing the ethical challenges of CAI functioning in the role of a therapist for individuals with mental health issues. We added additional articles through snowball searching. We included articles in English or Dutch. All types of articles were considered except abstracts of symposia. Screening for eligibility was done by 2 independent researchers (MRM and TS or AvB). An initial charting form was created based on the expected considerations and revised and complemented during the charting process. The ethical challenges were divided into themes. When a concern occurred in more than 2 articles, we identified it as a distinct theme.                                Results            We included 101 articles, of which 95% (n=96) were published in 2018 or later. Most were reviews (n=22, 21.8%) followed by commentaries (n=17, 16.8%). The following 10 themes were distinguished: (1) safety and harm (discussed in 52/101, 51.5% of articles); the most common topics within this theme were suicidality and crisis management, harmful or wrong suggestions, and the risk of dependency on CAI; (2) explicability, transparency, and trust (n=26, 25.7%), including topics such as the effects of “black box” algorithms on trust; (3) responsibility and accountability (n=31, 30.7%); (4) empathy and humanness (n=29, 28.7%); (5) justice (n=41, 40.6%), including themes such as health inequalities due to differences in digital literacy; (6) anthropomorphization and deception (n=24, 23.8%); (7) autonomy (n=12, 11.9%); (8) effectiveness (n=38, 37.6%); (9) privacy and confidentiality (n=62, 61.4%); and (10) concerns for health care workers’ jobs (n=16, 15.8%). Other themes were discussed in 9.9% (n=10) of the identified articles.                                Conclusions            Our scoping review has comprehensively covered ethical aspects of CAI in mental health care. While certain themes remain underexplored and stakeholders’ perspectives are insufficiently represented, this study highlights critical areas for further research. These include evaluating the risks and benefits of CAI in comparison to human therapists, determining its appropriate roles in therapeutic contexts and its impact on care access, and addressing accountability. Addressing these gaps can inform normative analysis and guide the development of ethical guidelines for responsible CAI use in mental health care.",

      "abstract": "Background            There is growing evidence supporting the use of mobile health (mHealth) interventions in low- and middle-income countries to address resource limitations in the delivery of health information and services to vulnerable populations. In parallel, there is an increasing emphasis on the use of implementation science tools and frameworks for the early identification of implementation barriers and to improve the acceptability, appropriateness, and adoption of mHealth interventions in resource-limited settings. However, there are limited examples of the application of implementation science tools and frameworks to the formative phase of mHealth design for resource-limited settings despite the potential benefits of this work for enhancing subsequent implementation, scale-up, and sustainability.                                Objective            We presented a case study on the use of an implementation science framework in mHealth design. In particular, we illustrated the usability of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) for organizing and interpreting formative research findings during the design of the mobile Inspección Visual con Ácido Acético (mIVAA) system in Lima, Peru.                                Methods            We collected formative data from prospective users of the mIVAA intervention using multiple research methodologies, including structured observations, surveys, group and individual interviews, and discussions with local stakeholders at the partnering organization in Peru. These activities enabled the documentation of clinical workflows, perceived barriers to and facilitators of mIVAA, overarching barriers to cervical cancer screening in community-based settings, and related local policies and guidelines in health care. Using a convergent mixed methods analytic approach and the CFIR as an organizing framework, we mapped formative research findings to identify key implementation barriers and inform iterations of the mIVAA system design.                                Results            In the setting of our case study, most implementation barriers were identified in the CFIR domains of intervention characteristics and inner setting. All but one barrier were addressed before mIVAA deployment by modifying the system design and adding supportive resources. Solutions involved improvements to infrastructure, including cellular data plans to avoid disruption from internet failure; improved process and flow, including an updated software interface; and better user role definition for image capture to be consistent with local health care laws.                                Conclusions            The CFIR can serve as a comprehensive framework for organizing formative research data and identifying key implementation barriers during mHealth intervention design. In our case study of the mIVAA system in Peru, formative research contributing to the CFIR domains of intervention characteristics and inner setting elicited the most key barriers to implementation. The early identification of barriers enabled design iterations before system deployment. Future efforts to develop mHealth interventions for low- and middle-income countries may benefit from using the approach presented in this case study as well as prioritizing the CFIR domains of intervention characteristics and inner setting.",

      "abstract": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to improve diagnostic accuracy. Yet people are often reluctant to trust automated systems, and some patient populations may be particularly distrusting. We sought to determine how diverse patient populations feel about the use of AI diagnostic tools, and whether framing and informing the choice affects uptake. To construct and pretest our materials, we conducted structured interviews with a diverse set of actual patients. We then conducted a pre-registered (osf.io/9y26x), randomized, blinded survey experiment in factorial design. A survey firm provided n = 2675 responses, oversampling minoritized populations. Clinical vignettes were randomly manipulated in eight variables with two levels each: disease severity (leukemia versus sleep apnea), whether AI is proven more accurate than human specialists, whether the AI clinic is personalized to the patient through listening and/or tailoring, whether the AI clinic avoids racial and/or financial biases, whether the Primary Care Physician (PCP) promises to explain and incorporate the advice, and whether the PCP nudges the patient towards AI as the established, recommended, and easy choice. Our main outcome measure was selection of AI clinic or human physician specialist clinic (binary, “AI uptake”). We found that with weighting representative to the U.S. population, respondents were almost evenly split (52.9% chose human doctor and 47.1% chose AI clinic). In unweighted experimental contrasts of respondents who met pre-registered criteria for engagement, a PCP’s explanation that AI has proven superior accuracy increased uptake (OR = 1.48, CI 1.24–1.77,p< .001), as did a PCP’s nudge towards AI as the established choice (OR = 1.25, CI: 1.05–1.50,p= .013), as did reassurance that the AI clinic had trained counselors to listen to the patient’s unique perspectives (OR = 1.27, CI: 1.07–1.52,p =.008). Disease severity (leukemia versus sleep apnea) and other manipulations did not affect AI uptake significantly. Compared to White respondents, Black respondents selected AI less often (OR = .73, CI: .55-.96,p= .023) and Native Americans selected it more often (OR: 1.37, CI: 1.01–1.87,p= .041). Older respondents were less likely to choose AI (OR: .99, CI: .987-.999,p= .03), as were those who identified as politically conservative (OR: .65, CI: .52-.81,p< .001) or viewed religion as important (OR: .64, CI: .52-.77,p< .001). For each unit increase in education, the odds are 1.10 greater for selecting an AI provider (OR: 1.10, CI: 1.03–1.18,p= .004). While many patients appear resistant to the use of AI, accuracy information, nudges and a listening patient experience may help increase acceptance. To ensure that the benefits of AI are secured in clinical practice, future research on best methods of physician incorporation and patient decision making is required.",

      "abstract": "Abstract                Background                SMS for Life was one of the earliest large-scale implementations of mHealth innovations worldwide. Its goal was to increase visibility to antimalarial stock-outs through the use of SMS technology. The objective of this case study was to show the multiple innovations that SMS for Life brought to the Tanzanian public health sector and to discuss the challenges of scaling up that led to its discontinuation from a health systems perspective.                              Methods                A qualitative case-study approach was used. This included a literature review, a document review of 61 project documents, a timeline of key events and the collection and analysis of 28 interviews with key stakeholders involved in or affected by the SMS for Life programme. Data collection was informed by the health system building blocks. We then carried out a thematic analysis using the WHO mHealth Assessment and Planning for Scale (MAPS) Toolkit as a framework. This served to identify the key reasons for the discontinuation of the programme.                              Results                SMS for Life was reliable at scale and raised awareness of stock-outs with real-time monitoring. However, it was discontinued in 2015 after 4 years of a national rollout. The main reasons identified for the discontinuation were the programme’s failure to adapt to the continuous changes in Tanzania’s health system, the focus on stock-outs rather than ensuring appropriate stock management, and that it was perceived as costly by policy-makers.                Despite its discontinuation, SMS for Life, together with co-existing technologies, triggered the development of the capacity to accommodate and integrate future technologies in the health system.                              Conclusion                This study shows the importance of engaging appropriate stakeholders from the outset, understanding and designing system-responsive interventions appropriately when scaling up and ensuring value to a broad range of health system actors. These shortcomings are common among digital health solutions and need to be better addressed in future implementations.",

We illustrate the use of this framework with case studies involving interventions for tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS in resource-limited settings.ResultsCosts of implementing public health interventions may be conceptualized as occurring across three phases: design, initiation, and maintenance. In the design phase, activities include developing intervention components and establishing necessary infrastructure (e.g., technology, standard operating procedures). Initiation phase activities include training, initiation of supply chains and quality assurance procedures, and installation of equipment. Implementation costs in the maintenance phase include ongoing technical support, monitoring and evaluation, and troubleshooting unexpected obstacles. Within each phase, implementation costs can be incurred at the site of delivery (“site-specific” costs) or more centrally (“above-service” or “central” costs). For interventions evaluated in the context of research studies, implementation costs should be classified as programmatic, research-related, or shared research/program costs. Purely research-related costs are often excluded from analysis of programmatic implementation.ConclusionsIn evaluating public health interventions in resource-limited settings, accounting for implementation costs enables more realistic estimates of budget impact and cost-effectiveness and provides important insights into program feasibility, scale-up, and sustainability. Assessment of implementation costs should be planned prospectively and performed in a standardized manner to ensure generalizability.",

Furthermore, there is a complex interplay of factors at multiple levels of influence that are necessary for successful implementation of integrated care in health systems.MethodsGuided by the Exploration, Preparation, Implementation, Sustainment (EPIS) framework (Aarons et al., 2011), a multiple case study design was used to address two research objectives: 1) To highlight current integrated care implementation efforts through seven international case studies that target a range of healthcare systems, patient populations and implementation strategies and outcomes, and 2) To synthesize the shared and unique challenges and successes across studies using the EPIS framework.ResultsThe seven reported case studies represent integrated care implementation efforts from five countries and continents (United States, United Kingdom, Vietnam, Israel, and Nigeria), target a range of clinical populations and care settings, and span all phases of the EPIS framework. Qualitative synthesis of these case studies illuminated common outer context, inner context, bridging and innovation factors that were key drivers of implementation.ConclusionsWe propose an agenda that outlines priority goals and related strategies to advance integrated care implementation research. These goals relate to: 1) the role of funding at multiple levels of implementation, 2) meaningful collaboration with stakeholders across phases of implementation and 3) clear communication to stakeholders about integrated care implementation.Trial registrationNot applicable.",

      "abstract": "Background            Digital health care apps, including digital therapeutics, have the potential to increase accessibility and improve patient engagement by overcoming the limitations of traditional facility-based medical treatments. However, there are no established tools capable of quantitatively measuring long-term engagement at present.                                Objective            This study aimed to evaluate an existing engagement index (EI) in a commercial health management app for long-term use and compare it with a newly developed EI.                                Methods            Participants were recruited from cancer survivors enrolled in a randomized controlled trial that evaluated the impact of mobile health apps on recovery. Of these patients, 240 were included in the study and randomly assigned to the Noom app (Noom Inc). The newly developed EI was compared with the existing EI, and a long-term use analysis was conducted. Furthermore, the new EI was evaluated based on adapted measurements from the Web Matrix Visitor Index, focusing on click depth, recency, and loyalty indices.                                Results            The newly developed EI model outperformed the existing EI model in terms of predicting EI of a 6- to 9-month period based on the EI of a 3- to 6-month period. The existing model had a mean squared error of 0.096, a root mean squared error of 0.310, and an R2 of 0.053. Meanwhile, the newly developed EI models showed improved performance, with the best one achieving a mean squared error of 0.025, root mean squared error of 0.157, and R2 of 0.610. The existing EI exhibited significant associations: the click depth index (hazard ratio [HR] 0.49, 95% CI 0.29-0.84; P<.001) and loyalty index (HR 0.17, 95% CI 0.09-0.31; P<.001) were significantly associated with improved survival, whereas the recency index exhibited no significant association (HR 1.30, 95% CI 1.70-2.42; P=.41). Among the new EI models, the EI with a menu combination of menus available in the app’s free version yielded the most promising result. Furthermore, it exhibited significant associations with the loyalty index (HR 0.32, 95% CI 0.16-0.62; P<.001) and the recency index (HR 0.47, 95% CI 0.30-0.75; P<.001).                                Conclusions            The newly developed EI model outperformed the existing model in terms of the prediction of long-term user engagement and compliance in a mobile health app context. We emphasized the importance of log data and suggested avenues for future research to address the subjectivity of the EI and incorporate a broader range of indices for comprehensive evaluation.",

A random-effects model was used to pool the outcome data. Subgroup analyses were performed to examine a set of moderators. Data from 20 studies, representing 22 RCTs, were synthesized. Thirteen trials utilized short message service (SMS) reminders, three used pager reminders and six employed electronic alarm device-triggered reminders. The meta-analysis showed that the use of electronic reminders was associated with a significant, yet small, improvement in patient adherence to medication (pooled Cohen’s d=0.29, 95% confidence interval 0.18, 0.41). The effect was sensitive to sample size, type of disease and intervention duration. The frequency and type of electronic reminders appeared to have no moderating effect on medication adherence. The use of electronic reminders seems to be a simple and potentially effective way of improving patient adherence to chronic medication. Future research should concern the optimum strategies for the design and implementation of electronic reminders, with which the effectiveness of the reminders is likely to be augmented.",

      "abstract": "Abstract                Background                The field of implementation science was developed to address the significant time delay between establishing an evidence-based practice and its widespread use. Although implementation science has contributed much toward bridging this gap, the evidence-to-practice chasm remains a challenge. There are some key aspects of implementation science in which advances are needed, including speed and assessing causality and mechanisms. The increasing availability of artificial intelligence applications offers opportunities to help address specific issues faced by the field of implementation science and expand its methods.                              Main text                This paper discusses the many ways artificial intelligence can address key challenges in applying implementation science methods while also considering potential pitfalls to the use of artificial intelligence. We answer the questions of “why” the field of implementation science should consider artificial intelligence, for “what” (the purpose and methods), and the “what” (consequences and challenges). We describe specific ways artificial intelligence can address implementation science challenges related to (1) speed, (2) sustainability, (3) equity, (4) generalizability, (5) assessing context and context-outcome relationships, and (6) assessing causality and mechanisms. Examples are provided from global health systems, public health, and precision health that illustrate both potential advantages and hazards of integrating artificial intelligence applications into implementation science methods. We conclude by providing recommendations and resources for implementation researchers and practitioners to leverage artificial intelligence in their work responsibly.                              Conclusions                Artificial intelligence holds promise to advance implementation science methods (“why”) and accelerate its goals of closing the evidence-to-practice gap (“purpose”). However, evaluation of artificial intelligence’s potential unintended consequences must be considered and proactively monitored. Given the technical nature of artificial intelligence applications as well as their potential impact on the field, transdisciplinary collaboration is needed and may suggest the need for a subset of implementation scientists cross-trained in both fields to ensure artificial intelligence is used optimally and ethically.",

      "abstract": "Background            Previously incarcerated individuals have suboptimal linkage and engagement in community HIV care. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have been shown to be effective in addressing these gaps. In Washington, District of Columbia (DC), we conducted a randomized trial of an SMS text messaging–based mHealth intervention (CARE+ Corrections) to increase linkage to community HIV care and antiretroviral treatment adherence among HIV-infected persons involved in the criminal justice system.                                Objective            This study aimed to describe the SMS text messaging–based intervention, participant use of the intervention, and barriers and facilitators of implementation.                                Methods            From August 2013 to April 2015, HIV-positive incarcerated individuals were recruited within the DC Department of Corrections, and persons released in the past 6 months were recruited within the community via street-based recruitment, community partnerships, and referrals. Participants were followed for 6 months and received weekly or daily SMS text messages. Formative research resulted in the development of the content of the messages in 4 categories: HIV Appointment Reminders, Medication Adherence, Prevention Reminders, and Barriers to Care following release from jail. Participants could customize the timing, frequency, and message content throughout the study period.                                Results            Of the 112 participants enrolled, 57 (50.9%) were randomized to the intervention group and 55 (49.1%) to the control group; 2 control participants did not complete the baseline visit, and were dropped from the study, leaving a total of 110 participants who contributed to the analyses. Study retention was similar across both study arms. Median age was 42 years (IQR 30-50), 86% (49/57) were black or African American, 58% (33/57) were male, 25% (14/57) were female, and 18% (10/57) were transgender. Median length of last incarceration was 4 months (IQR 1.7-9.0), and median lifetime number of times incarcerated was 6.5 (IQR 3.5-14.0). Most participants (32/54, 59%) had a baseline viral load of <200 copies/mL. Nearly all participants (52/57, 91%) chose to use a cell phone provided by the study. The most preferred Appointment Reminder message was Hey how you feeling? Don’t forget to give a call and make your appointment (19/57, 33%). The most preferred Medication Adherence message was Don’t forget your skittles! (31/57, 54%), and 63% (36/57) of participants chose to receive daily (vs weekly) messages from this category at baseline. The most preferred Prevention Reminder message was Stay strong. Stay clean (18/57, 32%). The most preferred Barriers to Care message was Holla at your case manager, they’re here to help (12/57, 22%). Minor message preference differences were observed among participants enrolled in the jail versus those from the community.                                Conclusions            Participants’ ability to customize their SMS text message plan proved helpful. Further large-scale research on mHealth platforms is needed to assess its efficacy among HIV-infected persons with a history of incarceration.

Pregnant women, at least 14 years old with access to a mobile phone and able to read SMS were eligible for participation.MethodsWomen were randomised (1:1:1) to receive one‐way SMS versus two‐way SMS with a nurse versus control. Weekly SMS content was tailored for maternal characteristics and pregnancy or postpartum timing.Main outcome measuresFacility delivery, EBF, and contraceptive use were compared separately between each intervention arm and the control arm by Kaplan–Meier analysis and chi‐square tests using intent‐to‐treat analyses.ResultsThe overall facility delivery rate was high (98%) and did not differ by arm. Compared with controls, probability of EBF was higher in the one‐way SMS arm at 10 and 16 weeks, and in the two‐way SMS arm at 10, 16, and 24 weeks (P < 0.005 for all). Contraceptive use was significantly higher in both intervention arms by 16 weeks (one‐way SMS: 72% and two‐way SMS: 73%; P = 0.03 and P = 0.02 versus 57% control, respectively); however, this difference was not significant when correcting for multiple comparisons.ConclusionOne‐way and two‐way SMS improved EBF practices and early contraceptive use. Two‐way SMS had an added benefit on sustained EBF, providing evidence that SMS messaging influences uptake of interventions that improve maternal and neonatal health.Source of fundingFunding was provided by the National Institutes of Health (K12HD001264 to JAU, R01HD080460, K24HD054314 to GJS, and K01AI116298 to ALD), the National Science Foundation (Graduate Research Fellowship to TP and BD), as well as the University of Washington Global Center for Integrated Health of Women Adolescents and Children (Global WACh).Tweetable abstractThe Mobile WACh RCT demonstrates that SMS improved practice of exclusive breastfeeding and early postpartum contraception.",

The aim of study was to design some patient-centered health education messages, evaluate the feasibility of messages, and explore the effect of this model.MethodsThe messages were designed by a panel of experts, and SMS Quality Evaluation Questionnaire was used to evaluate their quality. A two-arm randomized controlled trial was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of this management model. Participants were randomly divided into an intervention group (IG) who received evaluated messages and a control group (CG) who received regular education. The primary outcomes were changes in plasma glucose and control rates, and the secondary outcomes were improvements in diet control, physical activities, weight control, etc.ResultsA total of 42 messages covering five main domains: health awareness, diet control, physical activities, living habits and weight control were designed, and the average scores of the messages were 8.0 (SD 0.7), 8.5 (SD 0.6), 7.9 (SD 1.0), 8.0 (SD 0.7), and 8.4 (SD 0.9), respectively. In the SMS intervention, 171 patients with an average age of 55.1 years were involved, including 86 in the CG and 85 in the IG. At 12 months, compared with the control group (CG), the decrease of fasting plasma glucose (FPG) (1.5 vs. 0.4, P = 0.011) and control rate (49.4% vs. 33.3%, P = 0.034), the postprandial glucose (PPG) (5.8 vs. 4.2, P = 0.009) and control rate (57.8% vs. 33.7%, P = 0.002) were better in the intervention group (IG). In terms of self-management, improvements in weight control (49.3% vs. 28.2%, P = 0.031), vegetables consumption (87.3% vs. 29.0%, P < 0.001), fruits consumption (27.5% vs. 7.4%, P = 0.022), and physical activities (84.7% vs. 70.0%, P = 0.036) were better in the IG than in the CG.ConclusionsThe overall quality of the messages was high.

      "abstract": "Conversational Health Agents (CHAs) are interactive systems that provide healthcare services, such as assistance and diagnosis. Current CHAs, especially those utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs), primarily focus on conversation aspects. However, they offer limited agent capabilities, specifically lacking multi-step problem-solving, personalized conversations, and multimodal data analysis. Our aim is to overcome these limitations. We propose openCHA, an open-source LLM-powered framework, to empower conversational agents to generate a personalized response for users' healthcare queries. This framework enables developers to integrate external sources including data sources, knowledge bases, and analysis models, into their LLM-based solutions. openCHA includes an orchestrator to plan and execute actions for gathering information from external sources, essential for formulating responses to user inquiries. It facilitates knowledge acquisition, problem-solving capabilities, multilingual and multimodal conversations, and fosters interaction with various AI platforms. We illustrate the framework's proficiency in handling complex healthcare tasks via two demonstrations and four use cases. Moreover, we release openCHA as open source available to the community via GitHub.",

      "abstract": "Personal informatics (PI) has become an area of significant research over the past decade, maturing into a sub-field that seeks to support people from many backgrounds and life contexts in collecting and finding value in their personal data. PI research includes a focus on people with chronic conditions as a monolithic group, but currently fails to distinguish the needs of people with motor disabilities (MD). To understand how current PI literature addresses those needs, we conducted a mapping review on PI publications engaged with people with MD. We report results from 50 publications identified in the ACM DL, Pubmed, JMIR, SCOPUS, and IEEE Xplore. Our analysis shows significant incompatibilities between the needs of individuals with MD and the ways that PI literature supports them. We also found inconsistencies in the ways that disability levels are reported, that PI literature for MD excludes non-health-related data domains, and an insufficient focus on PI tools' accessibility and usability for some MD users. In contrast with Epstein et al.'s [36] recent PI review, behavior change and habit awareness were the most common motivation in these publications. Finally, many of the reviewed articles reported involvement by caregivers, trainers, healthcare providers, and researchers across the PI stages. In addition to these insights, we provide recommendations for designing PI technology through a user-centric lens that will broaden the scope of PI and include people regardless of their motor abilities.",

      "abstract": "Background            Sickle cell disease (SCD) is characterized by severe acute pain episodes as well as risk for chronic pain. Digital delivery of SCD pain self-management support may enhance pain self-management skills and accessibility for youth. However, little is known about how youth with SCD and their caregivers engage with digital health programs. iCanCope with pain is a digital pain self-management platform adapted for youth with SCD and caregivers through a user-centered design approach. The program was delivered via a website (separate versions for youth and caregiver) and mobile app (youth only).                                Objective            We aimed to characterize patterns of user engagement with the iCanCope with SCD program among youth with SCD and their caregivers.                                Methods            A randomized controlled trial was completed across multiple North American SCD clinics. Eligible youth were aged 12-18 years, diagnosed with SCD, English-speaking, and experiencing moderate-to-severe pain interference. Eligible caregivers were English-speaking with a child enrolled in the study. Dyads were randomized to receive the iCanCope intervention or attention-control education for 8-12 weeks. This report focused on engagement among dyads who received the intervention. User-level analytics were captured. Individual interviews were conducted with 20% of dyads. Descriptive statistics characterized quantitative engagement. Content analysis summarized qualitative interview data. Exploratory analysis tested the hypothesis that caregiver engagement would be positively associated with child engagement.                                Results            The cohort included primarily female (60% [34/57] of youth; 91% [49/56] of caregivers) and Black (>90% of youth [53/57] and caregivers [50/56]) participants. Among 56 dyads given program access, differential usage patterns were observed: both the youth and caregiver engaged (16/56, 29%), only the youth engaged (24/56, 43%), only the caregiver engaged (1/56, 2%), and neither individual engaged (16/56, 29%). While most youth engaged with the program (40/57, 70%), most caregivers did not (39/56, 70%). Youth were more likely to engage with the app than the website (85% [34/57] versus 68% [23/57]), and the most popular content categories were goal setting, program introduction, and symptom history. Among caregivers, program introduction, behavioral plans, and goal setting were the most popular content areas. As hypothesized, there was a moderate positive association between caregiver and child engagement (χ21=6.6; P=.01; ϕ=0.34). Interviews revealed that most dyads would continue to use the program (11/12, 92%) and recommend it to others (10/12, 83%). The reasons for app versus website preference among youth were ease of use, acceptable time commitment, and interactivity. Barriers to caregiver engagement included high time burden and limited perceived relevance of content.                                Conclusions            This is one of the first studies to apply digital health analytics to characterize patterns of engagement with SCD self-management among youth and caregivers. The findings will be used to optimize the iCanCope with SCD program prior to release.

      "abstract": "Fatigue significantly affects daily functioning in persons with disabilities. Fatigue management can be challenging, and the information provided during routine physician visits to manage fatigue can be overwhelming. One way to address fatigue is to increase knowledge, skills, and confidence for self-management (ie, patient activation). Self-management programs have shown promising effects in targeting fatigue in persons with disabilities. However, satisfaction with self-management programs is low for persons with disabilities, and tailoring interventions to personalized needs has been recommended. SMS text messaging is increasingly being used to implement health behavior change interventions in a person's natural environment. Little has been done to link mobile health approaches with patient activation and self-management to address fatigue in persons with disabilities.This study aimed to develop and test a mobile phone-based fatigue self-management SMS text messaging intervention targeting patient activation in 3 groups of persons with disabilities: persons with multiple sclerosis, persons who had a stroke, and persons with a spinal cord injury.We used evidence-based resources and input from a consumer advisory board (CAB; composed of 2 participants from each of the 3 disability groups) and a neurologist to develop the intervention. The study was conducted using a 4-step process: development of the initial SMS text messaging library and categorization of the content into 9 content areas, review and modification of the SMS text messages by the neurologist and CAB, integration of the content library into a digital platform, and utility testing by CAB members.A total of 6 CAB participants rated SMS text messages covering 9 domain areas of fatigue self-management with good clarity (mean ratings=3.5-5.0 out of 5) and relevance (mean ratings=3.2-5.0 out of 5). Overall, SMS text messaging content was reported by CAB participants as helpful, clear, and well suited for a mobile health intervention. The CAB reached consensus on the time of day that SMS text messages should be sent (morning) and their frequency (once per day). This feedback led the research team to narrow down the program to deliver 48 SMS text messages, 1 per day, Monday through Thursday only, a total of 4 SMS text messages per week, over a 12-week period. The final set of SMS text messages was programmed into a digital platform with a predefined delivery schedule. The usability of the intervention was high, with 55 (83%) out of 66 responses endorsing the highest rating.This study demonstrates a step-by-step process for developing a fatigue self-management SMS text messaging intervention for persons with disabilities. For this population, whose access to health services is often limited, this intervention provides an alternative delivery model to increase access to fatigue information and deliver content that aligns with the person's needs.",

      "abstract": "IntroductionHealthcare services are responsible for 7% of Australia’s carbon emissions, or 35 772 kt per annum, with 44% of these attributed to hospitals and an unknown proportion originating from the kitchen. Carbon emissions contribute to climate change that is predicted to adversely impact health outcomes. Healthcare professionals and institutions have an opportunity to reduce their impact on the climate. Australian dietitians, however, are not required to learn about environmental sustainability during their tertiary education. This scoping review will identify pedagogical frameworks employed by educational institutions and providers of professional development, to describe how foodservice dietitians and dietetic students develop environmental sustainability capabilities.Methods and analysisThe scoping review methodology established by Arksey and O’Malley will be used for this review. Papers will be included if they focus on dietitians or dietetic students learning about environmental sustainability in the foodservice domain. Nine databases, Business Source Complete, CINAHL, Cochrane, Edge (via informit), EMBASE, MEDLINE, Proquest, Scopus and Web of Science, will be searched from their inception. Grey literature will also be identified by searching theses databases, professional bodies databases and Google Scholar. Eligible articles will be identified by screening papers by their title and abstract, followed by a full-text review. The study selection process will be completed independently by the primary investigator and the research team. Any discrepancies will be resolved through discussion. The extracted data including citation information, information on the intervention and outcomes will be summarised using descriptive statistics. Themes describing the pedagogical underpinnings of the interventions, the measurement tools and the impact of the learning activities will be synthesised narratively.Ethics and disseminationThe results will inform the development of evidence-based pedagogical frameworks to enhance the capabilities of foodservice dietitians and dietetic students in environmental sustainability. Dissemination will occur through conference presentations, peer-reviewed journals and distribution through national accrediting bodies.",

Methods            This is a descriptive observational, cross-sectional, design, and validation study of a scale conducted by telephone interview. Witnesses of urgent assistance and transfers by prehospital emergency medical services in the province of Cadiz, in the south of Spain, were the subjects of study. A questionnaire was designed after focus groups with patients, witnesses, and professionals. It consisted of 10 items, with Likert-type answers, and a range of 0 to 50 points. In addition to basic criteria (frequency of endorsement and ability to discriminate between groups), their validity (content and construct) and reliability (stability and homogeneity) were evaluated. Stability was evaluated by test-retest and homogeneity by means of two properties: internal consistency of items (corrected item-scale correlation coefficient) and internal consistency of the scale (Cronbach α coefficient).                                Results            A total of 849 questionnaires were obtained, with scores between 0 and 50 points, with an average of 47.31 (median of 50). The exploratory factor analysis detected a component that explained 61.1% of the total variance. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.933 with 95% confidence interval between 0.900 and 0.954. The corrected item-scale correlation coefficient was greater than 0.596, and the Cronbach α coefficient was 0.927 (95% confidence interval, 0.919–0.934).

This paper explores personal analytics from the perspective of self-optimization, arguing that the ways in which people confront and engage with visualized personal data are as significant as the technology itself. The paper leans on the concept of the “data double”: the conversion of human bodies and minds into data flows that can be figuratively reassembled for the purposes of personal reflection and interaction. Based on an empirical study focusing on heart-rate variability measurement, the discussion underlines that a distanced theorizing of personal analytics is not sufficient if one wants to capture affective encounters between humans and their data doubles. Research outcomes suggest that these explanations can produce permanence and stability while also profoundly changing ways in which people reflect on themselves, on others and on their daily lives.",

      "abstract": "Introduction            Thorough documentation is of utmost importance in a patient hospital experience. It forms an accurate record of an inpatient stay, facilitates handover between medical colleagues, and is also a legal document. Medical notes tend to be detailed and insightful on admission, but the daily ward round notes have often fallen short of expectation. With most patient records entered by junior level of staff, it is important to ensure that adequate documentation occurs.                                Methods            We analyzed notes entered in patient charts at set periods and compared them against standards set out in the Royal College of Surgeons Ireland and England, as well as Medical Council guidelines from the two countries. After this, a pro forma was established to standardize the medical record keeping on patient ward rounds. Compliance with guidelines was assessed by comparing notes before introduction of the pro forma and after their introduction.                                Results            Before its introduction, 0% of notes fulfilled the full criteria selected for the pro forma documentation. After intervention, there was a good initial response, with notes capturing an average 86% of the required information. A reaudit of compliance 2 months after introduction showed a 9% decrease of information completeness to 75%.                                Conclusions            Introduction of a pro forma for the documentation of daily ward rounds improved compliance of ward round notes when compared with internationally recognized guidelines, with no additional time required during ward rounds. Despite improved compliance, continued effort is needed to achieve a better standard of care.",

Objective            The aim of the study was to determine whether patient safety culture, as measured by the Hospital Survey on Patient Safety Culture (HSOPS), differed regarding care provider involvement in EFC activities.                                Methods            Using the original data from a cross-sectional survey of 5064 employees at a single university hospital in France, we analyzed the differences in HSOPS dimension scores according involvement in EFC activities.                                Results            Of 5064 eligible employees, 3888 (76.8%) participated in the study. Among the respondents, 440 (11.3%) participated in EFC activities. Experience feedback committee participants had a more developed patient safety culture, with 9 of the 12 HSOPS dimension scores significantly higher than EFC nonparticipants (overall effect size = 0.31, 95% confidence interval = 0.21 to 0.41, P < 0.001). A multivariate analysis of variance indicated that all 12 dimension scores, taken together, were significantly different between EFC participants and nonparticipants (P < 0.0001), independently of sex, hospital department, and healthcare profession category. The largest differences in scores related to the “feedback and communication about error,” “organizational learning,” and “Nonpunitive response to error” dimensions. The analysis of the subgroup of professionals who worked in a department with a productive EFC, defined as an EFC implementing at least five actions per year, showed a higher patient safety culture level for seven of the 12 HSOPS dimensions (overall effect size = 0.19, 95% confidence interval = 0.10 to 0.27, P < 0.001).                                Discussion and Conclusions            Participation in EFC activities was associated with higher patient safety culture scores. The findings suggest that root cause analysis in the team’s routine may improve patient safety culture.",

This theory posits a multifaceted causal structure in which self-efficacy beliefs operate together with goals, outcome expectations, and perceived environmental impediments and facilitators in the regulation of human motivation, behavior, and well-being. Belief in one’s efficacy to exercise control is a common pathway through which psychosocial influences affect health functioning. This core belief affects each of the basic processes of personal change—whether people even consider changing their health habits, whether they mobilize the motivation and perseverance needed to succeed should they do so, their ability to recover from setbacks and relapses, and how well they maintain the habit changes they have achieved. Human health is a social matter, not just an individual one. A comprehensive approach to health promotion also requires changing the practices of social systems that have widespread effects on human health.",

      "abstract": "Background            Self-tracking technologies are widely used in people’s daily lives and health care. Academic research on self-tracking and the quantified self has also accumulated rapidly in recent years. Surprisingly, there is a paucity of research that reviews, classifies, and synthesizes the state of the art with respect to self-tracking and the quantified self.                                Objective            Our objective was to identify the state of the art of self-tracking and the quantified self in terms of health and well-being.                                Methods            We have undertaken a systematic literature review on self-tracking and the quantified self in promoting health and well-being. After a rigorous literature search, followed by inclusions, exclusions, and the application of article quality assessment protocols, 67 empirical studies qualified for the review.                                Results            Our results demonstrate that prior research has focused on 3 stakeholders with respect to self-tracking and the quantified self, namely end users, patients and people with illnesses, and health care professionals and caregivers. We used these stakeholder groups to cluster the research themes of the reviewed studies. We identified 11 research themes. There are 6 themes under the end-user cluster: user motivation and goal setting, usage and effects of self-tracking, continuance intention and long-term usage, management of personal data, rejection and discontinuance, and user characteristics. The patient and people with illnesses cluster contains three themes: usage experience of patients and people with illnesses, management of patient-generated data, and advantages and disadvantages in the clinical context. The health care professional and caregiver cluster contains two themes: collaboration among patients, health care professionals, and caregivers, and changes in the roles of patients and professionals. Moreover, we classified the future research suggestions given in the literature into 5 directions in terms of research designs and research topics. Finally, based on our reflections on the observations from the review, we suggest four future research directions: (1) users’ cognitions and emotions related to processing and interpreting the information produced by tracking devices and apps; (2) the dark side of self-tracking (eg, its adverse psychosocial consequences); (3) self-tracking as a societal phenomenon; and (4) systemic impacts of self-tracking on health care and the actors involved.                                Conclusions            This systematic literature review contributes to research and practice by assisting future research activities and providing practitioners with a concise overview of the state of the art of self-tracking and the quantified self.",

      "abstract": "Background            High positive mental health, including the ability to cope with the normal stresses of life, work productively, and be able to contribute to one’s community, has been associated with various health outcomes. The role of positive mental health is therefore increasingly recognized in national mental health promotion programs and policies. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions could be a cost-effective way to disseminate positive psychological interventions to the general population.                                Objective            The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of a fully automated mHealth intervention on positive mental health, and anxiety and depression symptomology among Swedish university students using a randomized controlled trial design.                                Methods            A 2-arm, single-blind (researchers), parallel-groups randomized controlled trial with an mHealth positive psychology program intervention group and a relevant online mental health information control group was employed to estimate the effect of the novel intervention. Participants were recruited using digital advertising through student health care centers in Sweden. Inclusion criteria were (1) university students, (2) able to read and understand Swedish, (3) and have access to a mobile phone. Exclusion criteria were high positive mental health, as assessed by the Mental Health Continuum Short Form (MHC-SF), or high depression and anxiety symptomology, as assessed by the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS). The primary outcome was positive mental health (MHC-SF), and the secondary outcomes were depression and anxiety symptomatology (HADS). The subscales of MHC-SF were also analyzed as exploratory outcomes. Outcomes were measured 3 months after randomization through questionnaires completed on the participants’ mobile phones.                                Results            A total of 654 participants (median age 25 years), including 510 (78.0%) identifying as female, were randomized to either the intervention (n=348) or control group (n=306). At follow-up, positive mental health was significantly higher in the intervention group compared with the control group (incidence rate ratio [IRR]=1.067, 95% CI 1.024-1.112, P=.002). For both depression and anxiety symptomatology, the intervention group showed significantly lower scores at follow-up compared with the control group (depression: IRR=0.820, 95% CI 0.714-0.942, P=.005; anxiety: IRR=0.899, 95% CI 0.840-0.962, P=.002). Follow-up rates were lower than expected (58.3% for primary outcomes and 52.3% for secondary outcomes); however, attrition analyses did not identify any systematic attrition with respect to baseline variables.                                Conclusions            The mHealth intervention was estimated to be superior to usual care in increasing positive mental health among university students. A protective effect of the intervention was also found on depressive and anxiety symptoms. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of using an automated mobile phone format to enhance positive mental health, which offers promise for the use of mHealth solutions in public mental health promotion.

      "abstract": "Abstract                Background                The popularity of consumer-wearable activity trackers has led the scientific community to conduct an increasing number of intervention studies integrating them to promote physical activity (PA) and to reduce sedentary behavior (SB) levels among school-aged children. Therefore, the aim of the present study was to estimate the effects of consumer-wearable activity tracker-based programs on daily objectively measured PA and SB among apparently healthy school-aged children, as well as to compare the influence of participants’ and programs’ characteristics.                              Methods                Eligibility criteria were: (1) participants: apparently healthy school-aged children (< 18 years old); (2) intervention: aimed to promote PA and/or to reduce SB incorporating consumer-wearable activity trackers; (3) comparator: baseline measurements and/or a control/traditional group; (4) outcomes: objectively measured daily PA and/or SB levels; (5) study design: pre-experimental, quasi-experimental, and true-experimental trials. Relevant studies were searched from eight databases up to December 2020, as well as from four alternative modes of searching. Based on the Cochrane Risk-of-bias tool 2, the risk of bias was assessed following four domains: (1) randomization process; (2) missing outcome data; (3) measurement of the outcomes; and (4) selection of the reported results. Based on a comprehensive systematic review, meta-analyses of the Cohen’s standardized mean difference (d) and 95% confidence interval (CI) with a random-effects model were conducted to estimate the overall effects, as well as the within- and between-study subgroups analyses effects, of the programs on daily total steps, moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA), total PA and SB.                              Results                Forty-four publications (i.e., 45 studies) were included in the systematic review (5,620 unique participants; mean age = 12.85 ± 2.84 years) and 40 publications (i.e., 41 studies) in the meta-analysis. Programs had a mean length of 11.78 ± 13.17 weeks and most used a waist-worn consumer-wearable activity tracker (77.78% waist-worn; 22.22% wrist-worn). Programs characteristics were: goal-setting strategies (64.06%); participants’ logbooks (56.25%); counseling sessions (62.50%); reminders (28.13%); motivational strategies (42.19%); and exercise routine (17.19%). Results showed a statistically significant moderate favorable effect on daily total steps (d = 0.612, 95% CI 0.477–0.746), small favorable effect on daily MVPA (d = 0.220, 95% CI 0.134–0.307), trivial favorable effect on daily total PA (d = 0.151, 95% CI 0.038–0.264) and trivial unfavorable effect on daily SB (d = 0.172, 95% CI 0.039–0.305). Subgroups analyses showed a higher effect for daily total steps and daily MVPA levels in females and the physically inactive for daily total steps (p = 0.003–0.044). Programs with educational counseling and/or goal-setting strategies, as well as a greater number of strategies, were more effective for improving children’s daily total steps, and wrist-worn activity trackers were more effective than waist-worn trackers for improving their daily MVPA levels (p = 0.001–0.021).                              Conclusions                Consumer-wearable activity tracker-based programs seem to be effective in promoting school-aged children’s daily total steps and MVPA levels, especially for females and those that are physically inactive. These programs should include specific goal-setting, educational counseling, and wrist-worn trackers as especially effective strategies. However, due to the certainty of evidence being from “low” to “moderate”, future well-designed primary research studies about the topic are needed.                PROSPERO: CRD42020222363.",

However, the economic evaluation of such interventions has not yet been a standard practice. The present study aimed to identify the existing literature on the particular subject.Methods:A systematic search was conducted in six literature databases between 2010 and 2021: PubMed, Scopus, DARE, NHS EED, Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Methodological quality was assessed with the Drummond Checklist.Results:The search identified 423 publications, 66 of which were removed as duplicates, resulting in 357 records to be screened by title and abstract. Ten studies were subjected to full-text review and 3 were included in the analysis. The interventions of these studies referred to video consultations and eHealth interventions for symptom management. Overall, the digital health interventions incurred lower costs compared with usual care or no intervention and were considered cost saving and cost-effective. The methodological quality of the studies was considered good.Conclusion:The results of this systematic review indicate that the use of digital health interventions has the potential to be cost-effective in palliative care. However, applicability and generalizability of the evidence is uncertain, mainly due to methodological heterogeneity and scarcity of research.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND                        The health care costs for reproductive care have substantially increased with the use of in vitro fertilization (IVF) treatment. The mobile health (mHealth) coaching program Smarter Pregnancy is an effective intervention to improve nutrition and lifestyle behaviors and pregnancy rates in (sub)fertile couples, including those who undergo IVF treatment. Therefore, we hypothesize that this mHealth program can also reduce health care costs associated with IVF treatment.                                                                    OBJECTIVE                        This study aimed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of the mHealth coaching program Smarter Pregnancy and compare it to usual care in women of subfertile couples who start their first IVF cycle.                                                                    METHODS                        This model-based cost-effectiveness analysis was performed on data from couples undergoing IVF treatment at the Erasmus MC, University Medical Center Rotterdam. A decision tree model was used to assess the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of ongoing pregnancies and costs of use of the mHealth program as compared to usual care. A probabilistic sensitivity analysis was performed to consider the uncertainty surrounding the point estimates of the input parameters.                                                                    RESULTS                        Based on our model including 793 subfertile women undergoing IVF treatment, use of the mHealth program resulted in 86 additional pregnancies and saved €270,000 compared to usual care after two IVF cycles, with an ICER of –€3050 (95% CI –3960 to –540) per additional pregnancy. The largest cost saving was caused by the avoided IVF treatment costs. Sensitivity analyses showed that the mHealth program needs to increase the ongoing pregnancy rate by at least 51% after two IVF cycles for cost saving.                                                                    CONCLUSIONS                        The mHealth coaching program Smarter Pregnancy is potentially cost saving for subfertile couples preceding their first IVF treatment. Implementation of this mHealth program in routine preconception care for subfertile couples should be seriously considered, given the relatively low costs and promising cost-effectiveness estimates.",

      "abstract": "Background            Wearable activity trackers are popular devices used to motivate behavior change. Wearable activity trackers are especially beneficial for encouraging light physical activity such as walking, which is an ideal behavior for older adults or individuals who cannot be physically active at moderate and vigorous levels. A common problem is that people do not continue to use these wearable devices, with initial behavioral change gains eroding as people disengage. Limited research is available regarding the continued use of wearable activity trackers. The habit formation literature may provide insights into the long-term use of wearables and other health informatics devices.                                Objective            This study aims to uncover the mechanism underlying the long-term continued use of wearable devices among older adults through the theoretical lens of habit formation.                                Methods            In-depth interviews were conducted with 20 participants who were aged 65 years or older and had used wearable activity trackers for more than 6 months to understand their experiences and the strategies they employed to support continued use.                                Results            Thematic analysis of data revealed 8 themes related to habit formation, including aspects in initiation and goal setting, use of contextual cues, action planning, and coping planning. Long-term users tended to have meaningful initiation of wearable activity trackers. They usually started with a small behavioral change goal and gradually increased it. They used consistent time and locational cues to make the use of wearable activity trackers routine. Long-term users also used creative contextual cues and reminders to facilitate action planning, engaged in coping planning to deal with anticipated problems, and had a positive mindset and inventive strategies for managing unfulfillment and lapses.                                Conclusions            The results of this qualitative study of long-term users of wearable activity trackers suggest specific ways to enhance long-term habit formation among older adults. These best practices by long-term users can inform the future design of technology-based behavior interventions.",

To address this gap, two of the NIH’s Big Data to Knowledge Centers of Excellence organized a workshop on potential clinical applications of wearables. A workgroup comprised of 14 stakeholders from diverse backgrounds (hospital administration, clinical medicine, academia, insurance, and the commercial device industry) discussed two successful digital health interventions that involve wearables to identify common features responsible for their success. Seven features were identified including: a clearly defined problem, integration into a system of healthcare delivery, technology support, personalized experience, focus on end-user experience, alignment with reimbursement models, and inclusion of clinician champions. Health providers and systems keen to establish new models of care inclusive of wearables may consider these features during program design. A better understanding of these features is necessary to guide future clinical applications of wearable technology.",

      "abstract": "Background            The prevalence of obesity in children and adolescents remains a global public health issue. Wearable devices may offer new opportunities for prevention and intervention in obesity. Previous systematic reviews have only examined the effect of the wearable device interventions on preventing and treating obesity in adults. However, no systematic review has provided an evaluation of wearable devices as physical activity interventions for preventing and treating obesity in children and adolescents.                                Objective            The purpose of this review and meta-analysis was to evaluate the effectiveness of wearable devices as physical activity interventions on obesity-related anthropometric outcomes in children and adolescents.                                Methods            Research articles retrieved from PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and EBSCO from inception to February 1, 2021, were reviewed. The search was designed to identify studies utilizing wearable devices for preventing and treating obesity in children and adolescents. The included studies were evaluated for risk of bias following the Cochrane recommendation. Meta-analyses were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of wearable devices as physical activity interventions on body weight, body fat, BMI z-score (BMI-Z), BMI, and waist circumference. Subgroup analyses were performed to determine whether the characteristics of the interventions had an impact on the effect size.                                Results            A total of 12 randomized controlled trials (3227 participants) were selected for meta-analysis. Compared with the control group, wearable device interventions had statistically significant beneficial effects on BMI (mean difference [MD] –0.23; 95% CI –0.43 to –0.03; P=.03; I2=2%), BMI-Z (MD –0.07; 95% CI –0.13 to –0.01; P=.01; I2=81%), body weight (MD –1.08; 95% CI –2.16 to –0.00; P=.05; I2=58%), and body fat (MD –0.72; 95% CI –1.19 to –0.25; P=.003; I2=5%). However, no statistically significant effect was found on waist circumference (MD 0.55; 95% CI –0.21 to 1.32; P=.16; I2=0%). The subgroup analysis showed that for participants with overweight or obesity (MD –0.75; 95% CI –1.18 to –0.31; P<.01; I2=0%), in the short-term (MD –0.62; 95% CI –1.03 to –0.21; P<.01; I2=0%), wearable-based interventions (MD –0.56; 95% CI –0.95 to –0.18; P<.01; I2=0%) generally resulted in greater intervention effect size on BMI.                                Conclusions            Evidence from this meta-analysis shows that wearable devices as physical activity interventions may be useful for preventing and treating obesity in children and adolescents. Future research is needed to identify the most effective physical activity indicators of wearable devices to prevent and treat obesity in children and adolescents.",

The purpose of the current study was to examine the effectiveness and acceptability of wearable activity trackers for promoting physical activity (PA) in older adults living in retirement communities.                              Methods                Forty older adult participants (mean age = 85.4 years) used a wearable activity tracker (Fitbit InspireHR) for 12 weeks. Participants were provided with personalized activity goals and weekly feedback of PA during the 12 weeks. The main outcomes were daily step counts collected at baseline and the end of the intervention, and participants’ experiences of using the wearable activity tracker assessed after the 12-week intervention through an 8-item questionnaire and individual interviews.                              Results                Participants used the activity tracker on 97.5% of measured days and had an average increase of 900 steps/day (p < 0.001). The Acceptance questionnaire revealed that the wearable activity tracker was acceptable, useful, and easy to use. Participants found that wearable activity trackers helped improve self-awareness and motivation of PA but reported a few concerns regarding the comfort of wearing the activity trackers and the ease of reading visual feedback.                              Conclusions                Wearable activity trackers lead to a small but significant increase of PA and are perceived as acceptable and useful in older adults. Given the rapidly growing older population, wearable activity trackers are promising tools that could be used in large-scale interventions to improve PA and health in older adults.

The primary outcome was daily electronically monitored antihypertensive medication adherence and secondary outcomes included pre-post participant surveys of adherence self-efficacy, adherence barriers, outcome expectancies for taking medicine, and motivation for and importance of taking medicine. In phase 3, qualitative interviews related to user experiences were conducted with participants in the Reminder+COM-B Message intervention group.                                Results            Following phase 1, 34 participants (mean age 16.59 years, 41% female, 38% African American/Black, 35% hypertension diagnosis) completed the phase 2 pilot randomized controlled trial (n=18 in the Reminder+COM-B Message intervention group, n=16 in the Reminder-only Message active control group). All participants in the Reminder+COM-B Message intervention group completed a phase 3 qualitative interview. Overall, study procedures were feasible and the Reminder+COM-B Message intervention was acceptable to the participants (eg, 15/18 participants reported reading the majority of messages sent to them, 0/18 reported that the messages reduced their desire to take medicine). Prerandomization, there were no significant group differences in the rate of change in daily adherence over time. However, postrandomization, there was a significant group by time interaction (B=.01, P=.04) in which daily adherence decreased significantly over time in the Reminder-only Message active control group but remained stable in the Reminder+COM-B Message intervention group. There were no significant differences between groups in pre-post changes in survey responses. Qualitative interviews revealed participants’ perceptions of how the Reminder+COM-B Message intervention changed adherence behavior and highlighted several areas for improving the intervention (eg, adapt messaging timing, intensity, and content to match daily adherence, send praise when medicine is taken).                                Conclusions            The Reminder+COM-B Message intervention was feasible and acceptable to adolescents/young adults and demonstrated potential to promote participants’ daily medication adherence beyond simple reminders. Further research is needed to determine the Reminder+COM-B Message intervention’s mechanisms of adherence behavior change and to incorporate qualitative participant feedback into a modified version of this intervention to enhance its acceptability.

In recent years, there has been a growing interest surrounding mobile phone-based health communication and service delivery methods especially in the areas of family planning and reproductive health. However, little is known regarding the role of SMS-based family planning communication on the utilisation of modern contraception and maternal healthcare services in low-resource settings.                              Methods                Cross-sectional data on 94,675 mothers (15–49 years) were collected from the latest Demographic and Health Surveys in 14 low-and-middle-income countries. The outcome variables were self-reported use of modern contraception and basic maternal healthcare services (timely and adequate use of antenatal care, and of facility delivery services). Data were analysed using multivariate regression and random effect meta-analyses.                              Results                The coverage of SMS-based family planning communication for the pooled sample was 5.4% (95%CI = 3.71, 7.21), and was slightly higher in Africa (6.04, 95%CI = 3.38, 8.70) compared with Asia (5.23, 95%CI = 1.60, 8.86). Among the countries from sub-Saharan Africa, Malawi (11.92, 95%CI = 11.17, 12.70) had the highest percent of receiving SMS while Senegal (1.24, 95%CI = 1.00, 1.53) had the lowest. In the multivariate analysis, SMS communication shown significant association with the use of facility delivery only (2.22 (95%CI = 1.95, 2.83). The strength of the association was highest for Senegal (OR = 4.70, 95%CI = 1.14, 7.33) and lowest for Burundi (OR = 1.5; 95%CI = 1.01, 2.74). Meta analyses revealed moderate heterogeneity both in the prevalence and the association between SMS communication and the utilisation of facility delivery.                              Conclusion                Although positively associated with using facility delivery services, receiving SMS on family planning does not appear to affect modern contraceptive use and other components of maternal healthcare services such as timely and adequate utilisation of antenatal care.",

      "abstract": "IntroductionLow vaccine coverage is a major public health concern, the consequences of which contribute to around 1.5 million child deaths from vaccine-preventable diseases. Thus, innovative strategies to rapidly increase coverage and recall rates for vaccinations are urgently required. Mobile text messaging (or short messaging service, SMS) has the potential to help increase vaccination coverage and therefore we propose to conduct a review of the current best evidence for the use of SMS as an intervention to promote vaccination coverage.Methods and analysisThis article describes the protocol for a systematic review of the effectiveness of SMS in improving the uptake of vaccination. Primary and secondary outcomes of interest are prespecified. We will preferably include randomised controlled trials (RCTs). However, non-randomised studies (NRS) will be considered if there is an inadequate number of RCTs. We will search several bibliographic databases (eg,PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, Science Citation Index, Africa-Wide Information and WHOLIS electronic databases and search sources for grey literature. Following data extraction and assessment of risk of bias, we will meta-analyse studies and conduct subgroup analyses, according to intervention subtypes. We will assess clinical heterogeneity and statistical heterogeneity. For outcomes without quantitative data, a descriptive analysis will be used. This review protocol is registered in the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of systematic reviews, registration number 2014:CRD42014007531Ethics and disseminationEthics is not required for this study, given that this is a protocol for a systematic review, which uses published data. The findings of this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. We anticipate that the results could be used by researchers and policymakers to help inform them of the efficacy of mobile phone text messaging interventions to promote increased vaccination coverage.Trial registration numberPROSPERO registration number 2014:CRD42014007531.",

Objective            This study aims to evaluate how the interactions between individuals and the social use of the platform affect individuals’ use of persuasive technology and, in turn, their work environment actions and responses, by implementing a persuasive technology health and wellness platform in a work environment.                                Methods            For 8 months, we deployed a persuasive technology platform with different combinations of health-related features and content in 1 embedded case design with 8 fire stations for a small Canadian city (total number of participant firefighters, n=141) assigned to 1 of 2 treatments—interactive or static webpages. We used text-based content analysis techniques for outcome measures, drawn from a total of 29 participant exit interviews. In addition, medical assessments were conducted at baseline, midpoint, and end point by 7 HCPs and 1 researcher (BM), who also served as the data steward and managed the study.                                Results            Our results reveal that group, social, and work influences introduce new elements to the use of persuasive technology, which interact to foster higher levels of individual success. The platform in our study served as part of a larger social system, providing information that facilitated new behaviors at work and home. The 8-month group programs centered on exercise, nutrition, and smoking cessation. Groups of participants coached by certified professionals showed significant increases in sodium awareness, levels of actual exercise, and consistency of activities. As a result of the study, of 141 people, 15 (10.6%) were notified of serious medical health issues and 29 (20.6%) underwent blood work assessments and a privacy shield (protected by federal law) was enacted to protect employees from losing their employment based on any health concerns disclosed.                                Conclusions            The persuasive technology platform, in combination with self-management and professional management and social interactions, significantly altered work management behaviors. Interactions among individual outcomes, group influences, and social situations strongly influenced individuals’ behaviors in their work and home environments. Three things further improved the positive results that we observed: privacy shields (which allowed employees to reveal health concerns without fear of professional consequences), individual private activities aligned with group activities, and integration between HCP work with localized, organizational work roles.",

However, the nursing skill mix model that most successfully achieves both cost effectiveness and quality care has yet to be determined.Aim: The aim of this study was to explore the impact of different nurse staffing models on patient outcomes in a respiratory care center (RCC).Methods: Retrospective data from 2006 to 2008 were obtained from records monitoring nursing care quality, as well as patient records and nursing personnel costs in an RCC as a medical center, in southern Taiwan. A total of 487 patients were categorized into two groups according to the RCC's mix of nursing staff. The “RN/Aide” group comprised 247 patients who received RN and aide care, with a 0.7–0.8 proportion of RNs, from July 2006 to June 2007. The other 240 patients (“All‐RN”) received 100% RN care from January 2008 to December 2008.Results: The results of this study indicated no significant differences in occurrence of pressure ulcer or respiratory tract infections, days of hospitalization, mortality, or nursing costs. However, significant differences were observed in ventilator weaning and occurrence of urinary tract and bloodstream infections.Conclusions: A higher proportion of RNs was associated not only with a lower rate of urinary tract infection but also with more patients being weaned successfully from ventilators. The findings of this study have implications for how managers and administrators manage nurse staffing in respiratory care.",

      "abstract": "Introduction With increasing development and use of mobile health (mHealth) interventions for weight loss in overweight and obese populations, it is timely to gain greater insight into consumer experience with these technologies. The aims of this review were to identify common themes across studies that included user preferences for mHealth intervention for weight loss. Methods The databases PubMed (Medline), CINAHL, Web of Science, and Embase were searched for relevant qualitative studies on mHealth for weight loss. Searches were conducted in May 2016. Results Several common high preference themes were identified relating to simple and attractive apps that allowed for self-monitoring with feedback. The five key themes concerning text messages for weight loss involved a careful consideration of personalization, message tone, structure, frequency and content. Key optimization themes for weight loss apps were personalization, simplicity with appeal and engagement/entertainment. Common identified benefits of mHealth for weight loss included self-monitoring, goal setting, feedback, ability to motivate, educate, and remind. Common barriers users identified were related to technological and psychological issues as well as message overload/inappropriate timing of messages. Conclusion When planning an mHealth weight loss intervention, critical factors are the message tone, structure and the frequency of message delivery. Personalization also seems to be important. Designing simple apps while still ensuring that they engage the user is also essential. Additionally, it seems important to tailor the content in accordance with different target group demographic preferences. The successful reach and adoption of mHealth interventions requires minimizing perceived barriers and maximizing perceived benefits.",

      "abstract": "AbstractObjectiveTo conduct a retrospective analysis of sequential cross-sectional data of opioid prescribing practices in patients with no prior history of opioid use.MethodsIndividuals filling an oral opioid prescription who had 1 year of prior observation were identified from four different administrative claims databases for the period between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2018: IBM MarketScan® Commercial Database (CCAE), Multi-State Medicaid Database (MDCD), Medicare Supplemental Database (MDCR), and Optum© De-Identified Clinformatics® Data Mart Database. Outcomes included incidence of new opioid use and characteristics of patients’ first opioid prescription, including dispensed morphine milligram equivalent (MME) per day, total MME dispensed, total MME ≥300, and days’ supply of prescription for ≤3 or ≥30 days.ResultsThere were 40,600,696 new opioid users identified. The incidence of new opioid use in the past 17 years ranged from 6% to 11% within the two commercially insured databases. Incidence decreased over time in MDCD and was consistently higher in MDCR. Total MME dispensed decreased in MDCD and increased in CCAE, with no major changes in the other databases. The proportion of patients receiving ≥30-day prescriptions decreased and the proportion of patients receiving ≤3-day prescriptions increased in MDCD, while ≥30-day prescriptions in the Optum database dramatically increased (low of 3.0% in 2003 to peak of 16.9% in 2017).ConclusionsOpioid prescribing practices varied across different populations of insured individuals during the past 17 years. The most substantial changes in opioid prescriptions over time have occurred in MDCD, with reductions in use across multiple metrics.",

      "abstract": "Background            Schizophrenia is a severe and disabling condition that presents a dire health equity challenge. Our initial 6-month trial (previously reported) using mobile texting and lay health supporters, called LEAN, significantly improved medication adherence from 0.48 to 0.61 (adjusted mean 0.11, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.20, P=.007) for adults with schizophrenia living in a resource-poor village in rural China.                                Objective            We explored the effectiveness of our texting program in improving participants’ medication adherence, functioning, and symptoms in an extended implementation of the intervention after its initial phase.                                Methods            In an approximated stepped-wedge wait-list design randomized controlled trial, 277 community-dwelling villagers with schizophrenia were assigned 1:1 in phase 1 into intervention and wait-list control groups. The intervention group received (1) lay health supporters (medication or care supervisors), (2) e-platform (mobile-texting reminders and education message) access, (3) a token gift for positive behavioral changes, and (4) integration with the existing government community-mental health program (the 686 Program) while the wait-listed control group initially only received the 686 Program. Subsequently (in the extended period), both groups received the LEAN intervention plus the 686 Program. The primary outcome was antipsychotic medication adherence (percentage of dosages taken over the past month assessed by unannounced home-based pill counts). The secondary outcomes were symptoms measured during visits to 686 Program psychiatrists using the Clinical Global Impression scale for schizophrenia and functioning measured by trained student assessors using the World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0. Other outcomes included data routinely collected in the 686 Program system (refill records, rehospitalization due to schizophrenia, death for any reason, suicide, wandering, and violent behaviors). We used intention-to-treat analysis and missing data were imputed. A generalized estimating equation model was used to assess program effects on antipsychotics medication adherence, symptoms, and functioning.                                Results            Antipsychotics medication adherence improved from 0.48 in the control period to 0.58 in the extended intervention period (adjusted mean difference 0.11, 95% CI 0.04 to 0.19; P=.004). We also noted an improvement in symptoms (adjusted mean difference –0.26, 95% CI –0.50 to –0.02; P=.04; Cohen d effect size 0.20) and a reduction in rehospitalization (0.37, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.76; P=.007; number-needed-to-treat 8.05, 95% CI 4.61 to 21.41). There was no improvement in functioning (adjusted mean difference 0.02, 95% CI –0.01 to 0.06; P=.18; Cohen d effect size 0.04).                                Conclusions            In an extended implementation, our intervention featuring mobile texting messages and lay health workers in a resource-poor community setting was more effective than the 686 Program alone in improving medication adherence, improving symptoms, and reducing rehospitalization.

      "abstract": "Background            Patients with sickle cell disease (SCD) experience significant medical and psychological stressors that affect their mental health, well-being, and disease outcomes. Digital cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) has been used in other patient populations and has demonstrated clinical benefits. Although evidence-based, nonpharmacological interventions for pain management are widely used in other populations, these treatments have not been well studied in SCD. Currently, there are no adequately powered large-scale clinical trials to evaluate the effectiveness and dissemination potential of behavioral pain management for adults with SCD. Furthermore, some important details regarding behavioral therapies in SCD remain unclear—in particular, what works best for whom and when.                                Objective            Our primary goal is to compare the effectiveness of two smartphone–delivered programs for reducing SCD pain symptoms: digital CBT versus pain and SCD education (Education). Our secondary goal is to assess whether baseline depression symptoms moderate the effect of interventions on pain outcomes. We hypothesize that digital CBT will confer greater benefits on pain outcomes and depressive symptoms at 6 months and a greater reduction in health care use (eg, opioid prescriptions or refills or acute care visits) over 12 months.                                Methods            The CaRISMA (Cognitive Behavioral Therapy and Real-time Pain Management Intervention for Sickle Cell via Mobile Applications) study is a multisite comparative effectiveness trial funded by the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute. CaRISMA is conducted at six clinical academic sites, in partnership with four community-based organizations. CaRISMA will evaluate the effectiveness of two 12-week health coach–supported digital health programs with a total of 350 participants in two groups: CBT (n=175) and Education (n=175). Participants will complete a series of questionnaires at baseline and at 3, 6, and 12 months. The primary outcome will be the change in pain interference between the study arms. We will also evaluate changes in pain intensity, depressive symptoms, other patient-reported outcomes, and health care use as secondary outcomes. We have 80% power to detect a difference of 0.37 SDs between study arms on 6-month changes in the outcomes with 15% expected attrition at 6 months. An exploratory analysis will examine whether baseline depression symptoms moderate the effect of the intervention on pain interference.                                Results            This study will be conducted from March 2021 through February 2022, with results expected to be available in February 2023.                                Conclusions            Patients with SCD experience significant disease burden, psychosocial stress, and impairment of their quality of life. CaRISMA proposes to leverage digital technology and overcome barriers to the routine use of behavioral treatments for pain and depressive symptoms in the treatment of adults with SCD. The study will provide data on the comparative effectiveness of digital CBT and Education approaches and evaluate the potential for implementing evidence-based behavioral interventions to manage SCD pain.

      "abstract": "The global cancer disease burden is substantial, resulting in increased economic and clinical strain on our healthcare systems. A proposed solution is text-based communication, which can be used for cancer-supportive care. We conducted a systematic review to synthesize and describe the use of text-based communications for cancer-supportive care. Our population of interest included adult patients with cancer. A total of 18 studies were included in the review: 9 RCTs and 9 non-randomized interventional/observational studies. Patients were largely satisfied with text-based communication during their cancer care. Compared to controls, results for other outcomes including symptoms and quality of life were largely mixed; however, no harms were observed. Furthermore, positive outcomes were seen for specific interventions, such as text message medication reminders. These findings should be considered with caution due to the considerable heterogeneity observed between studies regarding their design and reported outcomes and the high risk of bias associated with 6/18 studies. Overall, this review suggests that text-based communication may be a complementary tool for cancer-supportive care; however, more research is needed to examine the feasibility of implementation and use.",

      "abstract": "Background            Undergoing a surgical procedure is anxiety provoking for patients and their caregivers. During the intraoperative period, caregivers seek out informational updates from health care professionals, a situation complicated by COVID-19 health measures that require caregivers to wait outside the hospital. Short messaging service (SMS)-based communication that allows caregivers to follow their loved ones through surgery has shown promise in relieving anxiety and improving satisfaction with overall care. This form of communication is also well accepted by health care professionals and may be effective at relieving staff burden.                                Objective            Here, we describe a quality improvement initiative of a standardized and integrated intraoperative SMS-based system to improve communication between surgical teams and caregivers. The main goal was to improve satisfaction with care, while the secondary goal was to reduce caregiver anxiety.                                Methods            The initiative followed the framework of the Model for Improvement. A large tertiary care hospital offered the SMS to caregivers who were waiting for loved ones undergoing surgery. SMS messages were integrated into the clinical information system software and sent at key points during the surgical journey to phone numbers provided by caregivers. A satisfaction survey was sent to caregivers 1 business day after surgery. Data were collected between February 16 and July 14, 2021.                                Results            Of the 8129 surgeries scheduled, caregivers waiting for 6149 (75.6%) surgeries agreed to receive SMS messages. A total of 34,129 messages were sent. The satisfaction survey was completed by 2088 (34%) of the 6149 caregivers. Satisfaction with messages was high, with the majority of respondents reporting that the messages received were adequate (1476/2085, 70.8%), clear (1545/2077, 74.4%), informative (1488/2078, 71.6%), and met their needs (1234/2077, 59.4%). The overall satisfaction score was high (4.5 out of 5), and caregivers reported that receiving text messages resulted in a reduction in anxiety (score=8.2 out of 10). Technical errors were reported by 69 (3.3%) caregivers. Suggestions for improvements included having messages sent more often; providing greater patient details, including the patient’s health status; and the service being offered in other languages.                                Conclusions            This digital health initiative provided SMS messages that were systematically sent to caregivers waiting for their loved ones undergoing surgery, just as COVID-19 restrictions began preventing waiting onsite. The messages were used across 15 surgical specialties and have since been implemented hospital-wide. Digital health care innovations have the capacity to improve family-centered communication; what patients and their families find useful and appreciate will ultimately determine their success.",

      "abstract": "Background            Addiction to opiates and synthetic opioids poses a major threat to public health worldwide, with pharmaceutical opioids prescribed to manage pain constituting the main problem. To counteract this threat, suitable pain management strategies should be implemented in health care. Monitoring pain management seems to be feasible using telemedicine with a certain degree of resource intensity and digitization. As a communication channel for this type of monitoring, SMS appears to be a valid alternative.                                Objective            The aim of this systematic literature review was to (1) provide information on the state of research regarding postoperative pain management via SMS, (2) establish a basic understanding of SMS-based pain management, and (3) provide insight into the feasibility of these management strategies. The research question was as follows: Is postoperative pain management feasible and effective utilizing SMS?                                Methods            A systematic literature review was performed mainly following the PRISMA guidelines and another guide on performing a systematic literature review for information systems–related research. A search string was developed based on the objectives and research question, and eight databases were searched.                                Results            The initial search resulted in 2083 records, which could be narrowed down by applying various exclusion criteria. Thereby, 11 articles were identified as relevant, which were accordingly analyzed and evaluated by full-text screening. In all articles, pain management interventions were performed using SMS communication between health care professionals and patients or their legal guardians. A prospective approach was predominantly chosen as the study design (91%) with the leading research objective of determining the intervention’s feasibility (73%). The primary reason for sending SMS messages was to monitor patients (64%). Overall, the use of SMS improved adherence, acceptance, and satisfaction regarding postoperative pain management. With an average response rate of approximately 89.5% (SD 3.8%), the reliability of SMS as a communication and monitoring tool was further emphasized. This response rate is significantly higher than that for email interventions (66.63%, P<.001).                                Conclusions            This study provides a comprehensive picture of the current status on postoperative pain management by SMS. Communication via SMS was beneficial in all interventions, even preoperative. Six SMS interventions could be certified by the respective institutional review board and three were Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act–compliant. Therefore, the results of this study could be leveraged to address the opioid epidemic. Overall, the research question could be confirmed. Future research should extend this systematic literature review regarding preoperative pain management. Based on these findings, a pre- and postoperative communication model should be developed to address the opioid epidemic effectively.",

      "abstract": "Background            Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder causing acute complications and chronic progressive end organ damage. SCD is associated with significant morbidity, early mortality, impaired health-related quality of life, and increased acute health care utilization. Hydroxyurea is a US Food and Drug Administration–approved medication that reduces disease complications, acute health care utilization, and costs. However, adherence to hydroxyurea is suboptimal. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have the potential to improve hydroxyurea adherence, but few examples exist that are specific to the SCD population.                                Objective            This study aimed to design a mHealth intervention for individuals with SCD to improve adherence to hydroxyurea, using a user-centered design that was informed by specific barriers to hydroxyurea adherence and utilization in this population.                                Methods            This study consisted of 4 phases. In phase 1, individuals with SCD and health care providers participated in an optimization digital workshop. In phase 2, patients completed surveys pertaining to their interest in mHealth use, barriers and facilitators to hydroxyurea use, and health literacy. Phases 3 and 4 involved semistructured interviews and focus groups, respectively, and used the Health Belief Model (HBM) as the framework to investigate drivers of poor hydroxyurea adherence and to inform the development of an app prototype. In addition, in phase 4, we have incorporated the patients’ feedback on the preliminary app prototype and its features.                                Results            Barriers to hydroxyurea adherence were consistent with the literature and included forgetfulness and several specific thoughts and emotions associated with hydroxyurea use (eg, fear of side effects, depression, stigma, and hopelessness). In addition, more than half of the participants reported potentially low health literacy. Preferred patient app features included 7 key components, namely (1) medication reminders and tracker, (2) disease education, (3) communication, (4) personalization, (5) motivation, (6) support during pain episodes, and (7) social support. Utilizing a user-centered design approach, data obtained from patients and providers were translated into features within the app, mapping to components of the HBM and the specific drivers of hydroxyurea adherence and matching the literacy level of the population, resulting in the development of a novel mobile app called InCharge Health.                                Conclusions            The InCharge Health app is an mHealth intervention developed with substantial input from users and by mapping the HBM as the framework that guided the choice for its components. InCharge Health is a customized product for the SCD population aimed at optimizing medication adherence, with the end goal of improving quality of life and health outcomes among patients with SCD. The efficacy and implementation of the InCharge Health app as an mHealth intervention to promote hydroxyurea adherence will be tested in a future stepped-wedge multicenter trial for adolescents and adults with SCD.",

      "abstract": "Purpose This study aims to evaluate the reach, usefulness, acceptability, and factors influencing engagement with a lifestylefocused text message intervention to support women’s mental and physical health after breast cancer treatment.\nMethods This study uses a mixed-methods process evaluation nested in the EMPOWER-SMS randomised controlled trial (n = 160; intervention n = 80, wait-list control n = 80). Data sources included screening logs, text message delivery software analytics, intervention feedback survey, and focus groups (n = 16), which were summarised thematically based on the framework approach.\nResults A total of 387 women met the inclusion criteria (meanage ± SD = 59.3 ± 11.6 years). Participants who declined (n = 227) were significantly older than those who enrolled (n = 160; 62.2 ± 11.1 vs 55.1 ± 11.1 years, respectively, p < 0.001). Most intervention participants (64/80; 80%) completed the end-of-study survey, reporting the messages were easy to understand (64/64; 100%), useful (58/64; 91%), and motivating (43/64; 67%). The focus groups (n = 16) revealed five factors influencing engagement: (i) feelings of support/continued care, (ii) convenience/flexibility of message delivery, (iii) weblinks, (iv) information from a credible source, and (v) options to save or share messages.\nConclusion A lifestyle-focused text message program was acceptable and useful for women after breast cancer treatment. However, text messaging may be a barrier for women aged over 68 years. Suggestions for program improvements included delivering the program to patients with other cancers, during all stages of treatment, and including more weblinks in text messages.",

      "abstract": "Background: Obesity is among the most significant health challenges facing today’s adolescents. Weight gain during adolescence is related to cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers in later life. Presently, adolescents living in Australia have limited access to age-appropriate obesity prevention services.\nObjective: This study aims to investigate whether a two-way text message program, with optional telephone health counseling, improves body mass index (BMI) z score and lifestyle outcomes in adolescents who are overweight.\nMethods: This study will be a single-blind randomized controlled trial (N=150) comparing a two-way text message intervention, with optional telephone health counseling, to usual care in adolescents (13-18 years old, inclusive) who are overweight (recruited from a pediatric weight management clinic and the broader community in Sydney, Australia). The intervention group will receive a six-month text message program, which consists of two-way, semipersonalized, lifestyle-focused text messages (four messages/week) in addition to usual care. The control group will be assigned to receive usual care. The study also includes a follow-up at 12-months. The primary outcome is a change in BMI z score at six months. Secondary outcomes are changes in waist-to-height ratio, diet, physical and sedentary activity levels, sleep quality, quality of life, self-esteem, self-efficacy, social support, and eating disorder and depression symptoms. Also, we will examine acceptability, utility, and engagement with the program through a study-specific process evaluation questionnaire, semi-structured telephone interviews, and an analysis of health counselor communication logs. The analyses will be performed by the intention-to-treat principle to assess differences between intervention and control groups.\nResults: The study opened for recruitment in December 2019. Data collection is expected to be completed by December 2021, and the results for the primary outcome are expected to be published in early 2022.\nConclusions: This study will test the effectiveness of an interactive two-way text message program compared to usual care in improving BMI z score and lifestyle outcomes in adolescents with overweight. This interactive, innovative, and scalable project also aims to inform future practice and community initiatives to promote obesity prevention behaviors for adolescents.",

      "abstract": "Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent disease associated with an increased risk of comorbidities, premature death, and health costs. Prediabetes is a stage of glucose alteration previous to T2DM, that can be reversed. The aim of the study is to develop and evaluate a low-intensity, multifaceted, digital intervention to prevent T2DM. The intervention comprises: (1) the use of mobile health technology to send tailored text messages promoting lifestyle changes to people at risk of T2DM and (2) the provision of online education to primary healthcare physicians and nurses about management of prediabetes. Methods: In stages 1–4 we will design, develop and pilot-test the intervention. In Stage 5 we will conduct a phase II, six-month, three-arm, cluster randomized, clinical trial with 42 primary care professionals and 420 patients at risk of T2DM. Patients will be allocated to a control group (usual care), intervention A (patient messaging intervention), or intervention B (patient messaging intervention plus online education to their primary healthcare professionals). The primary outcome will be glycated haemoglobin. All the procedures obtained ethical approval in June 2021 (CEI-IB Ref No: IB4495/21PI). Discussion: Digital health interventions can effectively prevent T2DM and reduce important T2DM risk factors such as overweight or hypertension. In Spain, this type of intervention is understudied. Moreover, there is controversy regarding the type of digital health interventions that are more effective. Findings from this study may contribute to address T2DM prevention, through a low-cost and easily implementable intervention.",

      "abstract": "Many patients spend months waiting for elective procedures, and many have significant modifiable risk factors that could contribute to an increased risk of perioperative morbidity and mortality. The minimal direct contact that usually occurs with healthcare professionals during this period represents a missed opportunity to improve patient health and surgical outcomes. Patients with obesity comprise a large proportion of the surgical workload but are under-represented in prehabilitation studies. Our study piloted a mobile phone based, multidisciplinary, prehabilitation programme for patients with obesity awaiting elective surgery. A total of 22 participants were recruited via the Wollongong Hospital pre-admissions clinic in New South Wales, Australia, and 18 completed the study. All received the study intervention of four text messages per week for six months. Questionnaires addressing the self-reported outcome measures were performed at the start and completion of the study. Forty percent of participants lost weight and 40% of smokers decreased their cigarette intake over the study. Sixty percent reported an overall improved health score. Over 80% of patients found the programme effective for themselves, and all recommended that it be made available to other patients. The cost was A$1.20 per patient per month. Our study showed improvement in some of the risk factors for perioperative morbidity and mortality. With improved methods to increase enrolment, our overall impression is that text message?based mobile health prehabilitation may be a feasible, cost-effective and worthwhile intervention for patients with obesity.",

In this pilot study, we aimed to evaluate the feasibility of short message service (SMS)-based mobile phone follow up to obtain patient-reported outcome measures after hand surgery during a surgical outreach trip to Vietnam.\nMethods Patients undergoing surgery during a week-long outreach trip to Hospital 175 in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, who owned a mobile phone, were included in this study. Eight eligible patients elected to participate and were sent an SMS-based, Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Actcompliant text message with a link to a contextualized shortened Disabilities of the Arm, Shoulder and Hand questionnaire at 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks after the surgery. The patient characteristics and instrument completion rates were reported.\nResults The 8 patients had a mean age of 45.4 years and lived at a mean distance of 72.7 km from the hospital. Seven (87.5%), 7 (87.5%), 8 (100%), 6 (75%), and 8 (100%) patients completed the followup questionnaires at 1 day, 1 week, 2 weeks, 4 weeks, and 12 weeks after the surgery, respectively.\nConclusions This pilot study demonstrates that the collection of patient-reported outcome measures after hand surgery outreach trips to low- and middle-income countries via SMS-based messaging is feasible for up to 12 weeks after the surgery.",

      "abstract": "Objectives. We aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a multifaceted procedure in improving pneumococcal and influenza vaccinations 6 months after an emergency department (ED) visit among patients aged 65 years and older. Methods. We conducted a cluster-randomized, controlled, parallel-group, open-label implementation trial in 18 EDs in France and Monaco. Participants were recruited from November 2015 to September 2016. EDs were randomly assigned with a 1:1 ratio to provide either a multifaceted procedure that combined structured information about pneumococcal and influenza vaccines and three text message reminders sent to patients every two weeks (intervention arm) or nonstructured information only (control arm). The outcomes were self-reported pneumococcal vaccination and influenza vaccination rates within 6 months of enrollment. Results. A total of 9 EDs were randomized to the intervention arm (n = 780 patients) and 9 to the control arm (n = 695 patients). The median age for all enrolled patients was 74 years (25–75th percentiles, 69 to 82): 50.1% were male, 34.9% had at least one underlying condition, and 30.7% were at risk for invasive pneumococcal infection. In the intention-to-treat analysis, the multifaceted intervention did not alter the pneumococcal vaccination rate (6.4% versus 4.6%, absolute difference: 1.8; 95% CI: [−0.9 to 4.4]; p = 0.19), whereas it improved the influenza vaccination rate (52.1% versus 40.0%, absolute difference: 12.1; 95% CI: [2.4 to 21.8]; p = 0.01). At 12 months, mortality did not differ between the intervention (9.7%) and control (11.2%) arms (p = 0.35). Conclusions. A multifaceted intervention based on text message reminders provides an opportunity to increase anti-influenza vaccination among elderly patients visiting the ED. Efforts are warranted to provide better information on pneumococcal diseases and the benefits of pneumococcal vaccines, especially in the elderly.",

      "abstract": "Background: Low back pain (LBP) is a frequent reason for emergency department (ED) presentations, with a global prevalence of 4.4%. Despite being common, the number of clinical trials investigating LBP in the ED is low. Recruitment of patients in EDs can be challenging because of the fast-paced and demanding ED environment.\nObjective: The aim of this study is to describe the recruitment and response rates using an SMS text messaging and web-based survey system supplemented by telephone calls to recruit patients with LBP and collect health outcomes in the ED.\nMethods: An automated SMS text messaging system was integrated into Research Electronic Data Capture and used to collect patient-reported outcomes for an implementation trial in Sydney, Australia. We invited patients with nonserious LBP who presented to participating EDs at 1, 2, and 4 weeks after ED discharge. Patients who did not respond to the initial SMS text message invitation were sent a reminder SMS text message or contacted via telephone. The recruitment rate was measured as the proportion of patients who agreed to participate, and the response rate was measured as the proportion of participants completing the follow-up surveys at weeks 2 and 4. Regression analyses were used to explore factors associated with response rates.\nResults: In total, 807 patients with nonserious LBP were invited to participate and 425 (53.0%) agreed to participate. The week 1 survey was completed by 51.5% (416/807) of participants. At week 2, the response rate was 86.5% (360/416), and at week 4, it was 84.4% (351/416). Overall, 60% of the surveys were completed via SMS text messaging and on the web and 40% were completed via telephone. Younger participants and those from less socioeconomically disadvantaged areas were more likely to respond to the survey via the SMS text messaging and web-based system.\nConclusions: Using an SMS text messaging and web-based survey system supplemented by telephone calls is a viable method for recruiting patients with LBP and collecting health outcomes in the ED. This hybrid system could potentially reduce the costs of using traditional recruitment and data collection methods (eg, face-to-face, telephone calls only).",

      "abstract": "Patient and health provider interaction via text messaging (TM) has become an accepted form of communication, often favored by adolescents and young adults. While integration of TM in disease management has aided health interventions and behavior modifications, broader adoption is hindered by expense, fixed reporting schedules, and monotonic communication. A low-cost, flexible TM reporting system (REMOTES) was developed using inexpensive cloud-based services with features of two-way communication, personalized reporting scheduling, and scalable and secured data storage. REMOTES is a template-based reporting tool adaptable to a wide-range of complexity in response formats. In a pilot study, 27 adolescents with sickle cell disease participated to assess feasibility of REMOTES in both inpatient and outpatient settings. Subject compliance with at least one daily self-report pain query was 94.9% (112/118) during inpatient and 91.1% (327/359) during outpatient, with an overall accuracy of 99.2% (970/978). With use of a more complex 8-item questionnaire, 30% (7/21) inpatient and 66.6% (36/54) outpatient responses were reported with 98.1% (51/52) reporting accuracy. All participants expressed high pre-trial expectation (88%) and post-trial satisfaction (89%). The study suggests that cloud-based text messaging is feasible and an easy-of-use solution for low-cost and personalized patient engagement.",

METHODS Participants included 54 older adults (mean age = 81.2y, 77.8% female, 98.1% white) living in a retirement community. Participants received a Fitbit Zip and access to a multilevel mHealth physical activity intervention (MapTrek Residential) for 8weeks. Physical activity (in steps per day) and intervention compliance (days worn) were measured objectively with the Fitbit for 12weeks (8-wk intervention plus 4-wk follow-up). Psychosocial outcomes (social support, self-efficacy, and outcome expectations) were assessed at baseline and 8weeks. Acceptability outcomes were assessed with an open-ended process evaluation survey and focus groups. Descriptive statistics and linear mixed models were used to examine intervention effects. RESULTS Participants increased daily steps from 5438 steps per day at baseline (95% CI, 4620 to 6256) to 6201 steps per day (95% CI, 5359 to 7042) at week 8 (P < .0001) but this was not maintained at 12weeks (P = .92). CONCLUSIONS Our multilevel mHealth physical activity intervention was effective for increasing physical activity older adults over 8weeks. Additional research focused on maintaining physical activity gains with this approach is warranted.",

      "abstract": "Background Early detection of diabetic foot ulcers can improve outcomes. However, patients do not always monitor their feet or seek medical attention when ulcers worsen. New approaches for diabetic-foot surveillance are needed. The goal of this study was to determine if patients would be willing and able to regularly photograph their feet; evaluate different foot-imaging approaches; and determine clinical adequacy of the resulting pictures. Methods We recruited adults with diabetes and assigned them to Self Photo (SP), Assistive Device (AD), or Other Party (OP) groups. The SP group photographed their own feet, while the AD group used a selfie stick; the OP group required another adult to photograph the patient's foot. For 8 weeks, we texted all patients requesting that they text us a photo of each foot. The collected images were evaluated for clinical adequacy. Numbers of (i) submitted and (ii) clinically useful images were compared among groups using generalized linear models and generalized linear mixed models. Results A total of 96 patients consented and 88 participated. There were 30 patients in SP, 29 in AD, and 29 in OP. The completion rate was 77%, with no significant differences among groups. However, 74.1% of photographs in SC, 83.7% in AD, 92.6% in OP were determined to be clinically adequate, and these differed statistically significantly. Conclusions Patients with diabetes are willing and able to take photographs of their feet, but using selfie sticks or having another adult take the photographs increases the clinical adequacy of the photographs.Level of Evidence: II.",

This reality introduces a new chronic disease paradigm: the patient-professional partnership, involving collaborative care and self-management education. Self-management education complements traditional patient education in supporting patients to live the best possible quality of life with their chronic condition. Whereas traditional patient education offers information and technical skills, self-management education teaches problem-solving skills. A central concept in self-management is self-efficacy--confidence to carry out a behavior necessary to reach a desired goal. Self-efficacy is enhanced when patients succeed in solving patient-identified problems. Evidence from controlled clinical trials suggests that (1) programs teaching self-management skills are more effective than information-only patient education in improving clinical outcomes; (2) in some circumstances, self-management education improves outcomes and can reduce costs for arthritis and probably for adult asthma patients; and (3) in initial studies, a self-management education program bringing together patients with a variety of chronic conditions may improve outcomes and reduce costs. Self-management education for chronic illness may soon become an integral part of high-quality primary care.",

      "abstract": "Background Stress in education is an adverse reaction that teachers have to excessive pressures or other types of demands placed on them. Consumer digital technologies are already being used by teachers for stress management, albeit not in a systematic way. Understanding teachers’ experiences and the long-term use of technologies to support stress self-management in the educational context is essential for meaningful insight into the value, opportunity, and benefits of use. Objective The aim of this study was first to understand teachers’ experiences of consumer technologies for stress management. They were chosen by teachers from a taxonomy tailored to their stress management. The second aim was to explore whether their experiences of use evolved over time as teachers transitioned from working at home during lockdown to working full time on school premises. Methods A longitudinal study intended for 6 weeks in the summer term (2020) was extended because of COVID-19 into the autumn term, lasting up to 27 weeks. Teachers chose to use a Withings smartwatch or the Wysa, Daylio, or Teacher Tapp apps. In total, 2 semistructured interviews and web-based surveys were conducted with 8 teachers in South London in the summer term, and 6 (75%) of them took part in a third interview in the autumn term. The interviews were analyzed by creating case studies and conducting cross-case analysis. Results The teachers described that the data captured or shared by the technology powerfully illustrated the physical and psychosocial toll of their work. This insight gave teachers permission to destress and self-care. The social-emotional confidence generated also led to empathy toward colleagues, and a virtuous cycle of knowledge, self-compassion, permission, and stress management action was demonstrated. Although the COVID-19 pandemic added a new source of stress, it also meant that teachers’ stress management experiences could be contrasted between working from home and then back in school. More intentional self-care was demonstrated when back in school, sometimes without the need to refer to the data or technology. Conclusions The findings of this study demonstrate that taking a situated approach to understand the real-world, existential significance and value of data generates contextually informed insights. Where a strategic personal choice of consumer technology is enabled for high school heads of year, the data generated are perceived as holistic, with personal and professional salience, and are motivational in the educational context. Technology adoption was aided by the pandemic conditions of home working, and this flexibility would otherwise need workplace facilitation. These findings add to the value proposition of technologies for individual stress management and workforce health outcomes pertinent to educators, policy makers, and designers.",

      "abstract": "In the last decade, the research interest in self-tracking practices mediated by wearable technologies has risen exponentially. A variety of contributions is focused on examining interaction modalities and user experiences to increase the usability and utility of such systems. However, several scholars are also committed to unveiling the inherent ethical, social and political implications of the self-tracking phenomenon, proposing an alternative perspective. Based on the review of contributions investigating polarities and issues in the landscape of self-tracking technologies, the current work proposes five interrelated tensions at play in the self-tracking domain. The tensions presented are allusion to objectivity and non-neutrality of numbers; trust in data and reliance on subjective experience; reductionism and complexity of lived phenomena; performance and wellbeing; and surveillance and self-surveillance. Rather than researching ways to avoid these tensions, the present contribution discusses the role that design may play in further exploring them. In particular, the paper illustrates studies leveraging speculative and critical design approaches to explore the ethical, political, and social issues of technologically-mediated self-tracking practices, as well as individuals’ relations with data, beyond conscious interaction.",

Here we describe validation studies, conducted during daily activities at home, in the outpatient clinic, in the cardiac catheterization laboratory and in the intensive care unit, of the safety and performance of a wearable ultrasound sensor for blood pressure monitoring. The sensor has closely connected sonographic windows and a backing layer that improves the sensor’s accuracy and reliability to meet the highest requirements of clinical standards.

Signal processing emerges as a critical aspect, dictating the accuracy and reliability of readings. Despite its potential, the integration of cuffless technologies into clinical practice faces obstacles, including the need to address concerns related to accuracy, calibration, and standardization across diverse devices and patient populations. The development of robust algorithms to mitigate artifacts and environmental disturbances is essential for extracting clear physiological signals. Based on extensive research, this review emphasizes the necessity for standardized protocols, validation studies, and regulatory frameworks to ensure the reliability and safety of cuffless blood pressure monitoring devices and their implementation in mainstream medical practice. Interdisciplinary collaborations between engineers, clinicians, and regulatory bodies are crucial to address technical, clinical, and regulatory complexities during implementation. In conclusion, while cuffless blood pressure monitoring holds immense potential to transform cardiovascular care. The resolution of existing challenges and the establishment of rigorous standards are imperative for its seamless incorporation into routine clinical practice. Conclusion: The emergence of these new technologies shifts the paradigm of cardiovascular health management, presenting a new possibility for non-invasive continuous and dynamic monitoring. The concept of cuffless blood pressure measurement is viable and more finely tuned devices are expected to enter the market, which could redefine our understanding of blood pressure and hypertension. This review explores cuffless blood pressure technologies and their impact on clinical practice, highlighting innovative devices that offer non-invasive, continuous and non-continuous monitoring without a cuff. Signal processing is essential for ensuring accurate readings, as it filters out unwanted artifacts and environmental disturbances which could make the reading inaccurate. While these advancements show great potential for transforming cardiovascular care, there are still several challenges to overcome, including the need for standardized protocols and validation studies to ensure their reliability and safety in clinical settings. Collaborative efforts between engineers, clinicians, and regulatory bodies are needed to address the technical and regulatory complexities surrounding the implementation of these technologies. These cuffless blood pressure measurement devices have the potential to reshape how we understand and manage blood pressure and hypertension.",

      "abstract": "Hypertension is a worldwide health problem and a primary risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Continuous monitoring of blood pressure has important clinical value for the early diagnosis and prevention of cardiovascular disease. However, existing technologies for wearable continuous blood pressure monitoring are usually inaccurate, rely on subject-specific calibration and have poor generalization across individuals, which limit their practical applications. Here, we report a new blood pressure measurement method and develop an associated wearable device to implement continuous blood pressure monitoring for new subjects. The wearable device detects cardiac output and pulse waveform features through dual photoplethysmography (PPG) sensors worn on the palmar and dorsal sides of the wrist, incorporating custom-made interface sensors to detect the wearing contact pressure and skin temperature. The detected multichannel signals are fused using a machine-learning algorithm to estimate continuous blood pressure in real time. This dual PPG sensing method effectively eliminates the personal differences in PPG signals caused by different people and different wearing conditions. The proposed wearable device enables continuous blood pressure monitoring with good generalizability across individuals and demonstrates promising potential in personal health care applications.",

      "abstract": "Remote patient monitoring (RPM) for hypertension enables automatic transmission of blood pressure (BP) and pulse into the electronic health record (EHR), but its effectiveness in primary care is unknown. This pragmatic matched cohort study using EHR data compared BP outcomes between individuals prescribed RPM and temporally-matched controls from six primary care practices. We retrospectively created a cohort of 288 Medicare-enrolled patients prescribed BP RPM (cases) and 1152 propensity score-matched controls (1:4). Matching was based on age, sex, systolic blood pressure (SBP), marital status, and other characteristics. Outcomes at 3, 6, 9 and 12 months were: controlling high BP (most recent BP < 140/90 mm Hg), antihypertensive medication intensification, and most recent SBP assessed using: all measurements, and office measurements only. At baseline, RPM-prescribed patients and controls had similar ages and systolic BP. BP control diverged at 3 months (RPM: 72.2%, control: 51%, p < 0.001). This difference persisted but decreased over follow-up. After 12 months, the RPM-prescribed cohort had greater BP control (RPM: 71.5%, control: 58.1%, p < 0.001) and lower SBP (132.3 versus 136.5 mm Hg, p = 0.003) using all measurements, but they did not differ using only office measurements (12 month BP control: 60.8% versus 58.1%, p = 0.44; SBP: 135.9 versus 136.5 mm Hg, p = 0.91). At 12 months, the most recent BP measurements were more current for RPM-prescribed patients (median [IQR] 8 [0–109] versus 134 [56–239] days). Net increases in antihypertensive medications by 12 months were similar. Implementation of RPM in primary care could inform hypertension management strategies and increase hypertension control.

The sensor is controlled via long-range communication through a subcutaneously implanted and wirelessly powered Bluetooth Low Energy system-on-a-chip. The device can be delivered via a minimally invasive transcatheter procedure or it can be mounted on a passive medical device such as a stent, as we show for the case of the pulmonary artery in a pig model and the aorta and left ventricle in a sheep model, where the device performs comparably to clinical tools for monitoring of blood flow and pressure. Battery-less and wireless devices such as these that integrate capabilities for flow, pressure and temperature sensing offer the potential for continuous monitoring of blood haemodynamics in patients.",

      "abstract": "Background: The use of telehealth for the management and treatment of hypertension and cardiovascular disease (CVD) has increased across the United States (U.S.), especially during the COVID-19 pandemic. Telehealth has the potential to reduce barriers to accessing health care and improve clinical outcomes. However, implementation, outcomes, and health equity implications related to these strategies are not well understood. The purpose of this review was to identify how telehealth is being used by U.S. health care professionals and health systems to manage hypertension and CVD and to describe the impact these telehealth strategies have on hypertension and CVD outcomes, with a special focus on social determinants of health and health disparities.Methods: This study comprised a narrative review of the literature and meta-analyses. The meta-analyses included articles with intervention and control groups to examine the impact of telehealth interventions on changes to select patient outcomes, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure. A total of 38 U.S.-based interventions were included in the narrative review, with 14 yielding data eligible for the meta-analyses.Results: The telehealth interventions reviewed were used to treat patients with hypertension, heart failure, and stroke, with most interventions employing a team-based care approach. These interventions utilized the expertise of physicians, nurses, pharmacists, and other health care professionals to collaborate on patient decisions and provide direct care. Among the 38 interventions reviewed, 26 interventions utilized remote patient monitoring (RPM) devices mostly for blood pressure monitoring. Half the interventions used a combination of strategies (e.g., videoconferencing and RPM). Patients using telehealth saw significant improvements in clinical outcomes such as blood pressure control, which were comparable to patients receiving in-person care. In contrast, the outcomes related to hospitalizations were mixed. There were also significant decreases in all-cause mortality when compared to usual care. No study explicitly focused on addressing social determinants of health or health disparities through telehealth for hypertension or CVD.Conclusions: Telehealth appears to be comparable to traditional in-person care for managing blood pressure and CVD and may be seen as a complement to existing care options for some patients. Telehealth can also support team-based care delivery and may benefit patients and health care professionals by increasing opportunities for communication, engagement, and monitoring outside a clinical setting.",

These devices collect and analyze long-term continuous data on measures of behavioral or physiologic function, which may provide clinicians with a more comprehensive view of a patients’ health compared with the traditional sporadic measures captured by office visits and hospitalizations. Wearable devices have a wide range of potential clinical applications ranging from arrhythmia screening of high-risk individuals to remote management of chronic conditions such as heart failure or peripheral artery disease. As the use of wearable devices continues to grow, we must adopt a multifaceted approach with collaboration among all key stakeholders to effectively and safely integrate these technologies into routine clinical practice. In this Review, we summarize the features of wearable devices and associated machine learning techniques. We describe key research studies that illustrate the role of wearable devices in the screening and management of cardiovascular conditions and identify directions for future research. Last, we highlight the challenges that are currently hindering the widespread use of wearable devices in cardiovascular medicine and provide short- and long-term solutions to promote increased use of wearable devices in clinical care.",

      "abstract": "Cuff-based home blood pressure (BP) devices, which have been the standard for BP monitoring for decades, are limited by physical discomfort, convenience, and their ability to capture BP variability and patterns between intermittent readings. In recent years, cuffless BP devices, which do not require cuff inflation around a limb, have entered the market, offering the promise of continuous beat-to-beat measurement of BP. These devices take advantage of a variety of principles to determine BP, including (1) pulse arrival time, (2) pulse transit time, (3) pulse wave analysis, (4) volume clamping, and (5) applanation tonometry. Because BP is calculated indirectly, these devices require calibration with cuff-based devices at regular intervals. Unfortunately, the pace of regulation of these devices has failed to match the speed of innovation and direct availability to patient consumers. There is an urgent need to develop a consensus on standards by which cuffless BP devices can be tested for accuracy. In this narrative review, we describe the landscape of cuffless BP devices, summarize the current status of validation protocols, and provide recommendations for an ideal validation process for these devices.",

      "abstract": "The diagnosis and management of hypertension has been based on the measurement of blood pressure (BP) in the office setting. However, data have demonstrated that BP may substantially differ when measured in the office than when measured outside the office setting. Higher out-of-office BP is associated with increased cardiovascular risk independent of office BP. Ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) and home BP monitoring (HBPM) are validated approaches for out-of-office BP measurement. In the 2015 and 2021 United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) reports on screening for hypertension, ABPM was recommended as the reference standard for out-of-office BP monitoring and for confirming an initial diagnosis of hypertension. This recommendation was based on data from more published studies of ABPM vs. HBPM on the predictive value of out-of-office BP independent of office BP. Therefore, HBPM was recommended as an alternative approach when ABPM was not available or well tolerated. The 2017 American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) BP guideline recommended ABPM as the preferred initial approach for detecting white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension among adults not taking antihypertensive medication. In contrast, HBPM was recommended as the preferred initial approach for detecting the white-coat effect and masked uncontrolled hypertension among adults taking antihypertensive medication. The current review provides an overview of ABPM and HBPM in the US, including best practices, BP thresholds that should be used for the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, barriers to widespread use of such monitoring, US guideline recommendations for ABPM and HBPM, and data supporting HBPM over ABPM.",

A multitude of US and international hypertension guidelines, scientific statements, and policy statements have recommended evidence-based approaches for hypertension management and improved blood pressure (BP) control. These recommendations are based largely on high-quality observational and randomized controlled trial data. However, recent published data demonstrate troubling temporal trends with declining BP control in the United States after decades of steady improvements. Therefore, there is a widening disconnect between what hypertension experts recommend and actual BP control in practice. This scientific statement provides information on the implementation strategies to optimize hypertension management and to improve BP control among adults in the United States. Key approaches include antiracism efforts, accurate BP measurement and increased use of self-measured BP monitoring, team-based care, implementation of policies and programs to facilitate lifestyle change, standardized treatment protocols using team-based care, improvement of medication acceptance and adherence, continuous quality improvement, financial strategies, and large-scale dissemination and implementation. Closing the gap between scientific evidence, expert recommendations, and achieving BP control, particularly among disproportionately affected populations, is urgently needed to improve cardiovascular health.",

Most of them focus on adults but separate recommendations and validation criteria for BP devices intended for use in children and adolescents are included in some validation protocols. In this review we compare the validation criteria for BP measuring devices among consensus documents from different scientific organizations focusing on the pediatric population and we discuss the evidence gaps targeting the needs for validated BP measuring devices in children and adolescents.

In-office BP measurement using an upper-arm cuff constitutes the evidence-based reference method for current BP classification and treatment targets. However, out-of-office BP evaluation using 24 h ambulatory or home BP monitoring is recommended by all major medical associations for obtaining further insights into the BP profile of an individual and how it relates to their daily activities. Importantly, the highly variable nature of office and out-of-office BP readings has been widely acknowledged, including the association of BP variability with cardiovascular outcomes. However, to date, the implications of BP variability on cardiovascular outcomes have largely been ignored, with limited application in clinical practice. Novel cuffless wearable technologies might provide a detailed assessment of the 24 h BP profile and behaviour over weeks or months. These devices offer many advantages for researchers and patients compared with traditional BP monitors, but their accuracy and utility remain uncertain. In this Review, we outline and compare conventional and novel methods and techniques for assessing average BP levels and BP variability, and reflect on the utility and potential of these methods for improving the treatment and management of patients with hypertension.",

      "abstract": "High blood pressure (BP) is the commonest modifiable cardiovascular risk factor, yet its monitoring remains problematic. Wearable cuffless BP devices offer potential solutions; however, little is known about their validity and utility. We aimed to systematically review the validity, features and clinical use of wearable cuffless BP devices.We searched MEDLINE, Embase, IEEE Xplore and the Cochrane Database till December 2019 for studies that reported validating cuffless BP devices. We extracted information about study characteristics, device features, validation processes, and clinical applications. Devices were classified according to their functions and features. We defined devices with a mean systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) biases of &lt;5 mmHg as valid as a consensus. Our definition of validity did not include assessment of device measurement precision, which is assessed by standard deviation of the mean difference—a critical component of ISO protocol validation criteria. Study quality was assessed using the Quality Assessment of Diagnostic Accuracy Studies version 2 tool. A random-effects model meta-analysis was performed to summarise the mean biases for SBP and DBP across studies. Of the 430 studies identified, 16 studies (15 devices, 974 participants) were selected. The majority of devices (81.3%) used photoplethysmography to estimate BP against a reference device; other technologies included tonometry, auscultation and electrocardiogram. In addition to BP and heart rate, some devices also measured night-time BP (n = 5), sleep monitoring (n = 3), oxygen saturation (n = 3), temperature (n = 2) and electrocardiogram (n = 3). Eight devices showed mean biases of &lt;5 mmHg for SBP and DBP compared with a reference device and three devices were commercially available. The meta-analysis showed no statistically significant differences between the wearable and reference devices for SBP (pooled mean difference = 3.42 mmHg, 95% CI: −2.17, 9.01, I2 95.4%) and DBP (pooled mean = 1.16 mmHg, 95% CI: −1.26, 3.58, I2 87.1%).Several cuffless BP devices are currently available using different technologies, offering the potential for continuous BP monitoring. The variation in standards and validation protocols limited the comparability of findings across studies and the identification of the most accurate device. Challenges such as validation using standard protocols and in real-life settings must be overcome before they can be recommended for uptake into clinical practice.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Hypertension management remains a major public health challenge in primary care. Innovative interventions to improve blood pressure (BP) control are needed. One approach is through community-based models of care with the involvement of pharmacists and other non-physician healthcare professionals. Our objective is to systematically review the evidence of the impact of pharmacist care alone or in collaboration with other healthcare professionals on BP among hypertensive outpatients compared with usual care. Because these interventions can be complex, with various components, the effect size may differ between the type of interventions. One major focus of our study will be to assess carefully the heterogeneity in the effects of these interventions to identify which ones work best in a given healthcare setting.\nMethods and analysis Systematic searches of the Medical Literature Analysis and Retrieval System Online (MEDLINE), Excerpta Medica (Embase) and Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) databases will be conducted. Randomised controlled trials assessing the effect of pharmacist interventions on BP among outpatients will be included. Examples for pharmacist interventions are patient education, feedback to physician and medication management. The outcome will be the change in BP or BP at follow-up or BP control. Results will be synthesised descriptively and, if appropriate, will be pooled across studies to perform meta-analyses. If feasible, we will also perform a network meta-analysis to compare interventions that have not been compared directly head-to-head by using indirect evidence. Heterogeneity in the effect will be evaluated through prespecified subgroup and stratified analyses, accounting notably for the type and intensity of interventions, patients’ characteristics and healthcare setting.\nEthics and dissemination Ethical approval is not required as the results will be drawn from currently available published literature. Outcomes of the review will be shared through peer-reviewed journal and used for implementation policy.\nPROSPERO registration number CRD42021279751.",

      "abstract": "Several novel cuffless wearable devices and smartphone applications claiming that they can measure blood pressure (BP) are appearing on the market. These technologies are very attractive and promising, with increasing interest among health care professionals for their potential use. Moreover, they are becoming popular among patients with hypertension and healthy people. However, at the present time, there are serious issues about BP measurement accuracy of cuffless devices and the 2021 European Society of Hypertension Guidelines on BP measurement do not recommend them for clinical use. Cuffless devices have special validation issues, which have been recently recognized. It is important to note that the 2018 Universal Standard for the validation of automated BP measurement devices developed by the American Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation, the European Society of Hypertension, and the International Organization for Standardization is inappropriate for the validation of cuffless devices. Unfortunately, there is an increasing number of publications presenting data on the accuracy of novel cuffless BP measurement devices, with inadequate methodology and potentially misleading conclusions. The objective of this review is to facilitate understanding of the capabilities and limitations of emerging cuffless BP measurement devices. First, the potential and the types of these devices are described. Then, the unique challenges in evaluating the BP measurement accuracy of cuffless devices are explained. Studies from the literature and computer simulations are employed to illustrate these challenges. Finally, proposals are given on how to evaluate cuffless devices including presenting and interpreting relevant study results.",

      "abstract": "Introduction Improving hypertension management is a national priority that can decrease morbidity and mortality. Evidence-based hypertension management guidelines advocate self-measured BP (SMBP), but widespread implementation of SMBP is lacking. The purpose of this study was to describe the perspective of primary care physicians (PCPs) on SMBP to identify the barriers and facilitators for implementing SMBP. Methods We collected data from PCPs from a large health system using semi-structured interviews based on the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF). Responses were recorded, transcribed, and qualitatively analyzed into three overarching TDF domains based on the Behavior Change Wheel (BCW): 1) Motivation 2) Opportunity and 3) Capabilities. The sample size was based on theme saturation. Results All 17 participating PCPs believed that SMBP is a useful, but underutilized tool. Although individual practices varied, most physicians felt that the increased data points from SMBP allowed for better hypertension management. Most felt that overcoming existing barriers would be difficult, but identified several facilitators: physician support of SMBP, the possibility of having other trained health professionals to assist with SMBP and patient education; improving patient engagement and empowerment with SMBP, and the interest of the health system in using technology to improve hypertension management. Conclusion PCPs believe that SMBP can improve hypertension management. There are numerous barriers and facilitators for implementing SMBP. Successful implementation in clinical practice will require implementation strategies targeted at increasing patient acceptability and reducing physician workload. This may need a radical change in the current methods of managing hypertension.",

      "abstract": "The diagnosis and management of hypertension, a common cardiovascular risk factor among the general population, have been based primarily on the measurement of blood pressure (BP) in the office. BP may differ considerably when measured in the office and when measured outside of the office setting, and higher out-of-office BP is associated with increased cardiovascular risk independent of office BP. Self-measured BP monitoring, the measurement of BP by an individual outside of the office at home, is a validated approach for out-of-office BP measurement. Several national and international hypertension guidelines endorse self-measured BP monitoring. Indications include the diagnosis of white-coat hypertension and masked hypertension and the identification of white-coat effect and masked uncontrolled hypertension. Other indications include confirming the diagnosis of resistant hypertension and detecting morning hypertension. Validated self-measured BP monitoring devices that use the oscillometric method are preferred, and a standardized BP measurement and monitoring protocol should be followed. Evidence from meta-analyses of randomized trials indicates that self-measured BP monitoring is associated with a reduction in BP and improved BP control, and the benefits of self-measured BP monitoring are greatest when done along with cointerventions. The addition of self-measured BP monitoring to office BP monitoring is cost-effective compared with office BP monitoring alone or usual care among individuals with high office BP. The use of self-measured BP monitoring is commonly reported by both individuals and providers. Therefore, self-measured BP monitoring has high potential for improving the diagnosis and management of hypertension in the United States. Randomized controlled trials examining the impact of self-measured BP monitoring on cardiovascular outcomes are needed. To adequately address barriers to the implementation of self-measured BP monitoring, financial investment is needed in the following areas: improving education and training of individuals and providers, building health information technology capacity, incorporating self-measured BP readings into clinical performance measures, supporting cointerventions, and enhancing reimbursement.",

      "abstract": "Background Self-monitoring of blood pressure (BP) appears to reduce BP in hypertension but important questions remain regarding effective implementation and which groups may benefit most. This individual patient data (IPD) meta-analysis was performed to better understand the effectiveness of BP self-monitoring to lower BP and control hypertension. Methods and findings Medline, Embase, and the Cochrane Library were searched for randomised trials comparing self-monitoring to no self-monitoring in hypertensive patients (June 2016). Two reviewers independently assessed articles for eligibility and the authors of eligible trials were approached requesting IPD. Of 2,846 articles in the initial search, 36 were eligible. IPD were provided from 25 trials, including 1 unpublished study. Data for the primary outcomes—change in mean clinic or ambulatory BP and proportion controlled below target at 12 months—were available from 15/19 possible studies (7,138/8,292 [86%] of randomised participants). Overall, self-monitoring was associated with reduced clinic systolic blood pressure (sBP) compared to usual care at 12 months (−3.2 mmHg, [95% CI −4.9, −1.6 mmHg]). However, this effect was strongly influenced by the intensity of co-intervention ranging from no effect with self-monitoring alone (−1.0 mmHg [−3.3, 1.2]), to a 6.1 mmHg (−9.0, −3.2) reduction when monitoring was combined with intensive support. Self-monitoring was most effective in those with fewer antihypertensive medications and higher baseline sBP up to 170 mmHg. No differences in efficacy were seen by sex or by most comorbidities. Ambulatory BP data at 12 months were available from 4 trials (1,478 patients), which assessed self-monitoring with little or no co-intervention. There was no association between self-monitoring and either lower clinic or ambulatory sBP in this group (clinic −0.2 mmHg [−2.2, 1.8]; ambulatory 1.1 mmHg [−0.3, 2.5]). Results for diastolic blood pressure (dBP) were similar. The main limitation of this work was that significant heterogeneity remained. This was at least in part due to different inclusion criteria, self-monitoring regimes, and target BPs in included studies. Conclusions Self-monitoring alone is not associated with lower BP or better control, but in conjunction with co-interventions (including systematic medication titration by doctors, pharmacists, or patients; education; or lifestyle counselling) leads to clinically significant BP reduction which persists for at least 12 months. The implementation of self-monitoring in hypertension should be accompanied by such co-interventions.",

Text messages are a primary communication form for adolescents and potentially a scalable strategy for delivering population health interventions.\nObjective: This study aimed to determine the effectiveness of text message interventions in reducing BMI in adolescents and describe characteristics that are common to effective interventions.\nMethods: This systematic review included randomized controlled trials of text message lifestyle interventions involving adolescents aged 10 to 19 years with outcomes focused on obesity prevention or management. Primary outcome was objective or self-report change in BMI.\nResults: In total, 4362 records were identified, and 215 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility. A total of 8 unique studies were identified, including 767 participants, mean age 14.3 (SD 0.9) years, BMI 29.7 (SD 1.6) kg/m2 and 53.1% (407/767) female (31/101, 30.7%-172/172, 100.0%). All interventions were multicomponent. The median active intervention period was 4.5 months. During the active and extended intervention phases, text messages accounted for >50% (8 studies) and >85% (3 studies) of contact points, respectively. Text messages were heterogeneous, with a median of 1.5 text messages sent per week (range: 1-21). A total of 4 studies utilized two-way text message communication with health professionals Of the 8 studies, 7 demonstrated reductions in BMI or BMI z-score in the intervention group compared with the control at the end of the final follow-up. The effect was only statistically significant in 1 study at 6 months. Over 6 months, reductions in BMI (kg/m2) ranged from 1.3% to 4.5% and BMI z-score ranged from 4.2% to 28.1%.

This shift from acute to chronic care requires rethinking how resources are invested in managing these conditions. One response has been to create programs and interventions that have the goal of helping patients better manage their own conditions. Over time, these self-management interventions and strategies have increasingly relied on various technologies for their implementation, with the newest technology being mobile phones and short message service (SMS).\n\nAim\nThe objective of this meta-review was to evaluate the current evidence on the use of mobile phones and SMS to deliver self-management interventions for chronic conditions.\n\nMethods\nA meta-review was conducted of the 11 systematic reviews (SRs) that were identified and retrieved after an extensive search of electronic databases covering the years 2000–2012. Relevant information was abstracted from each systematic review and a quality assessment carried out using the AMSTAR (“A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews”) criteria.\n\nFindings\nThe number and types of included studies and total number of subjects varied significantly across the systematic reviews. Mobile phone text messaging was reported to significantly improve adherence to appointments and antiretroviral therapy, short-term smoking quit rates, and selected clinical and behavioral outcomes. AMSTAR scores ranged from 11 to 3, reflecting substantial variation in SR quality.\n\nLinking Evidence to Action\nMobile phones and SMS show promise as a technology to deliver self-management interventions to improve outcomes of chronic care management. However, the quality of future studies and systematic reviews needs to be improved. There also are unresolved issues about the technology itself.",

A total of 136 patients completed the study (mean age 31 years; 91% Malay; 51% with an illness duration of more than 5 years). A between-group analysis showed that the awareness, knowledge and attitudes (AKA) about epilepsy did not significantly differ between the groups at baseline ( P > 0.05). The intervention patients reported better AKA levels during follow-up compared to the control patients ( P < 0.05). A within-group analysis showed that in intervention patients, there were significant improvements in all AKA domains with larger effect sizes ( P < 0.01) while control patients also exhibited significant improvement in most domains except for Awareness but with smaller effect sizes. After controlling for possible confounding variables (age, gender, educational qualification, monthly income and baseline mean for each domain), the intervention group still reported significantly higher AKA than the control group particularly in Awareness ( P < 0.001) and Total AKA ( P = 0.003). There was also significantly better medication adherence and clinic attendance in the intervention group ( P < 0.05). The results suggest that the addition of the MEES to conventional epilepsy education is effective in improving AKA.",

The objective of this study was to investigate the role of HIT in controlling and managing lupus.\nMethods: We searched Scopus, PubMed, Web of Science, and Embase, using \"self-management\", \"self-care\" and \"Systemic Lupus Erythematosus\" keywords. Two researchers selected relevant papers and extracted data using a data collection form. Disagreements were resolved in consultation with the third and fourth researchers. After extraction, the data were analyzed.\nResults: Totally, 23 papers met the inclusion criteria. About 75% of the studies used web and telephone-based technologies. Most services provided with health technologies were ‘Training’ and ‘consulting’. The ‘lifestyle\" and ‘Consultation and education’ axes were the most widely used HIT services to control and manage lupus. While, ‘Better management and control of the disease’, ‘Increasing knowledge and awareness of people about lupus’ and ‘Improving behaviors and attitudes toward self-management and self-care’ were also the most important outcomes. ‘Collectiing patient data and information’, ’Providing education and consultation services to patients’, ’Measuring patient-reported outcomes’, and ’Increasing patients’ knowledge and awareness of their disease’ were the most important advantages of various technologies. ’Slow internet speed’ and ’Challenges and problems related to appearance and usability’ and ’Patient concerns about privacy and misuse of their data’ were three disadvantages of technologies.\nConclusion: The findings showed that HIT can improve the management and control of lupus and facilitate self-efficacy, self-care, and self-management in patients.

      "abstract": "AbstractComorbidities and socioeconomic barriers often limit patient adherence and self-management with hemodialysis. Missed sessions, often associated with communication barriers, can result in emergency dialysis and avoidable hospitalizations. This proof of concept study explored using a novel digital-messaging platform, EpxDialysis, to improve patient-to-dialysis center communication via widely available text messaging and telephone technology. A randomized controlled trial was conducted through Washington University-affiliated hemodialysis centers involving ESRD patients with poor attendance, defined as missing 2–6 sessions over the preceding 12 weeks. A cross-over study design evaluated appointment adherence between intervention and control groups. Comparing nonadherence rates eight weeks prior to enrollment, median appointment adherence after using the system increased by 75%, and median number of unintended hospitalization days fell by 31%. A conservative cost-benefit analysis of EpxDialysis demonstrates a 1:36 savings ratio from appointment adherence. EpxDialysis is a low-risk, cost-effective, intervention for increasing hemodialysis adherence in high-risk patients, especially at centers caring for vulnerable and low-income patients.",

      "abstract": "Over 1.3 million people live with colorectal cancer in the United States. Physical activity is associated with lower risk of colorectal cancer recurrence and mortality. Interventions are needed to increase physical activity in colorectal cancer survivors. We conducted a 2-arm non-blinded pilot randomized controlled trial at the University of California, San Francisco among 42 individuals who had completed curative-intent treatment for colorectal cancer to determine the feasibility and acceptability of a 12-week (84days) physical activity intervention using a Fitbit Flex™ and daily text messages. Participants were randomized 1:1 to receive the intervention with print educational materials or print educational materials alone. We explored the impact of the intervention versus usual care on physical activity using ActiGraph GT3X+ accelerometers pre−/post-intervention. We screened 406 individuals and randomized 42 to intervention (n=21) or control (n=21) groups. During the 12-week study, the intervention arm wore their Fitbits a median of 74days [88% of days in study period, interquartile range: 23–83days] and responded to a median of 34 (out of 46) text messages that asked for a reply (interquartile range: 13–38 text messages). Among the 16 intervention participants who completed the feedback survey, the majority (88%) reported that the intervention motivated them to exercise and that they were satisfied with their experience. No statistically significant difference in change in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity was found from baseline to 12weeks between arms. A 12-week physical activity intervention with a Fitbit and text messages was feasible and acceptable among colorectal cancer patients after curative treatment. Larger studies are needed to determine whether the intervention increases physical activity.

There is a need for an accessible, cost-effective, and low-burden intervention to support individuals in managing their endometriosis condition. Objective This study aimed to co-design and evaluate the acceptability, readability, and quality of a bank of supportive SMS text messages (EndoSMS) for individuals with endometriosis. Methods In phase 1 of this mixed method design, 17 consumer representatives (individuals with endometriosis) participated across three 3-hour web-based (Zoom, Zoom Video Communications, Inc) focus groups. The transcripts were encoded and analyzed thematically. In phase 2, consumer representatives (n=14) and health care professionals (n=9) quantitatively rated the acceptability, readability, and appropriateness of the developed text messages in a web-based survey. All the participants initially completed a background survey assessing sociodemographic and medical factors. Results Consumer representatives demonstrated diverse sociodemographic characteristics (Mage=33.29), varying in location (metropolitan vs rural or regional), employment, and relationship and educational statuses. Participants reached a consensus regarding the delivery of 4 SMS text messages per week, delivered randomly throughout the week and in one direction (ie, no reply), with customization for the time of day and use of personal names. Seven main areas of unmet need for which participants required assistance were identified, which subsequently became the topic areas for the developed SMS text messages: emotional health, social support, looking after and caring for your body, patient empowerment, interpersonal issues, general endometriosis information, and physical health. Through a web-based survey, 371 co-designed SMS text messages were highly rated by consumers and health care professionals as clear, useful, and appropriate for individuals with endometriosis. Readability indices (Flesch-Kincaid scale) indicated that the SMS text messages were accessible to individuals with a minimum of 7th grade high school education. Conclusions On the basis of the needs and preferences of a diverse consumer representative group, we co-designed EndoSMS, a supportive SMS text message program for individuals with endometriosis. The initial evaluation of the SMS text messages by consumer representatives and health professionals suggested the high acceptability and suitability of the developed SMS text messages. Future studies should further evaluate the acceptability and effectiveness of EndoSMS in a broader population of individuals with endometriosis.",

      "abstract": "Background: Extending contact with participants after the end of an initial intervention is associated with successful maintenance of weight loss and behavior change. However, cost-effective methods of extending intervention contact are needed. Objective: This study investigated whether extended contact via text message was efficacious in supporting long-term weight loss and physical activity and dietary behavior change in breast cancer survivors. Methods: Following the end of an initial 6-month randomized controlled trial of a telephone-delivered weight loss intervention versus usual care, eligible and consenting intervention participants received a 6-month extended contact intervention via tailored text messages targeting a range of factors proposed to influence the maintenance of behavior change. In this single-group, pre-post designed study, within group changes in weight, moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (Actigraph GT3X+ accelerometers), and total energy intake (2x24 hour dietary recalls) were evaluated from baseline to end of initial intervention (6 months), end of extended contact intervention (12 months), and after a no-contact follow-up (18 months) via linear mixed models. Feasibility of implementation was assessed through systematic tracking of text message delivery process outcomes, and participant satisfaction was assessed through semistructured interviews. Results: Participants at baseline (n=29) had a mean age of 54.9 years (SD 8.8), body mass index of 30.0 kg/m 2  (SD 4.2), and were recruited a mean 16.6 months (SD 3.2) post diagnosis. From baseline to 18 months, participants showed statistically significantly lower mean weight (-4.2 kg [95% CI -6.0 to -2.4];  P <.001) and higher physical activity (mean 10.4 mins/day [95% CI 3.6-17.2];  P =.003), but no significant differences in energy intake ( P =.200). Participants received a mean of 8 text messages every 2 weeks (range 2-11) and reported a high rate of satisfaction. Conclusions: In comparison to interventions without extended contact, results suggest text message–delivered extended contact may support the attenuation of weight regain and promote the maintenance of physical activity.

As growing healthcare costs coincide with tighter blood pressure (BP) targets, innovative management programs are needed to maximize efficiency of care delivery and optimize control.\nHYPOTHESIS: We aimed to develop a remote, navigator-led hypertension innovation program that would leverage algorithmic care pathways, home BP measurements and patient coaching to allow rapid and complete medication titration.\nMETHODS: A multidisciplinary group of clinical experts from subspecialties and primary care collaborated to develop an evidence-based clinical algorithm, designed to be automated and administered by non-licensed patient navigators. In the development stage, a prospective pilot cohort of 130 patients was managed by nurse practitioners and pharmacists to ensure efficacy and safety. Patients with clinic BP ≥ 140/90 mm Hg were enrolled and given a Bluetooth-enabled BP device. Home BPs were transmitted automatically into the electronic medical record. Medication titrations were performed by phone at biweekly intervals, based upon weekly average BP, until home BP was controlled at <135/85 mm Hg.\nRESULTS: Eighty-one percent of all enrolled, and 91% of those patients who regularly measured home BP achieved goal, in an average of 7 weeks. Control was reached similarly across races, genders, and ages.\nCONCLUSIONS: A home-based BP control program run by non-physicians can provide efficient, effective and rapid control, suggesting an innovative paradigm for hypertension management. This program is effective, sustainable, adaptable, and scalable to fit current and emerging national systems of healthcare.",

Pharmacists can help patients with hypertension to reduce blood pressure (BP) with telemedicine technology. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of a new pharmacist-led telemedicine disease management model based on mobile application for elderly hypertensive patients.Methods Elderly patients aged 60&amp;ndash;85 years old, diagnosed with hypertension, and taking at least five medications were enrolled in a pharmacist-led telemedicine disease management program for six months, during which patient transmitted BP and blood glucose (BG) to pharmacist via a new telemedicine system, and pharmacists provided interventions such as monitoring indicators, medication therapy management (MTM), medication consultation, and measured HbA1c and blood lipid of patients every three months. If necessary, pharmacists also communicated with community physicians about patients&amp;rsquo; medications adjustment plan.Results After the six-month intervention, systolic blood pressure (132.30&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;9.88 vs 134.54&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;15.59, p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.013), LDL-C (1.85&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;0.77 vs 2.09&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;0.85, p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.001), and HbA1c (6.59&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;0.98 vs 6.91&amp;thinsp;&amp;plusmn;&amp;thinsp;1.17, p&amp;thinsp;=&amp;thinsp;0.009) showed significant reductions in all patients.

      "abstract": "Objective The aim of this study was to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of an individually tailored intervention consisting of motivational counselling and text message reminders to reduce sedentary behaviour in comparison with usual lifestyle in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA).\nMethods RA patients (n=150) were randomised to the intervention or control group. Costs of the intervention and healthcare utilisation during a 22-month follow-up period were reported. Outcomes were objectively measured as 24 hours/7 days sitting time and self-reported Health Assessment Questionnaire (HAQ) and EQ-5D scores at baseline, and 16 weeks, 10 and 22 months after baseline. Cost-effectiveness was reported as incremental costeffectiveness ratios and statistical uncertainty presented as cost-effectiveness acceptability curves.\nResults The intervention cost was estimated at €387 per participant. The mean incremental 22-month healthcare cost was €−1165 (95% bootstrap CI −5613 to 3283). An incremental 20%-point of the participants (CI 10.4% to 29.6%) reduced their daily sitting time more than 50 min and 36%-point reported better HAQ scores (change>0.22). The time-weighted health utilities (quality-adjusted life years (QALYs)) increased by 0.10 (CI 0.02 to 0.18) and 0.11 (CI 0.04 to 0.19) for EQ-5D index and EQ-VAS, respectively. The intervention dominated usual lifestyle by offering better outcomes and lower costs. With a threshold value of €30 000/QALY the intervention has a probability of 95% of being cost-effective.\nConclusion This protocolised cost-effectiveness analysis showed that an individually tailored intervention aimed at reducing sedentary behaviour in patients with RA is improving participants’ 22-month health status and reducing healthcare costs. These results suggest that the intervention should be implemented in routine rheumatology care. Trial registration number NCT01969604.Trial registration number",

      "abstract": "Objective To evaluate the 18-month postintervention efficacy following a 4-month individually tailored behavioral intervention on daily sitting time in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). Methods In an observer-blinded randomized trial, 150 RA patients were included. During 4 months, the intervention group (n = 75) received 3 motivational counseling sessions and tailored text messages aimed at increasing light-intensity physical activity through reduction of sedentary behavior. The control group (n = 75) maintained their usual lifestyle. The primary outcome was change from baseline to 18 months postintervention in objectively measured daily sitting time (using ActivPAL). Secondary outcomes included changes in clinical patient-reported outcomes and cardiometabolic biomarkers. A mixed-effect repeated measures analysis of covariance model in the intent-to-treat population was applied. Results At 22 months follow-up from baseline, 12 participants were lost to follow-up. Compared to baseline, sitting time in the intervention group decreased 1.10 hours/day, whereas it increased by 1.32 hours/day in the control group, a between-group difference of –2.43 hours/day (95% confidence interval [95% CI] –2.99, –1.86; P < 0.0001) favoring the intervention group. For most secondary outcomes, between-group differences favored the intervention: visual analog scale (VAS) pain –15.51 mm (95% CI –23.42, –7.60), VAS fatigue –12.30 mm (95% CI –20.71, –3.88), physical function –0.39 Health Assessment Questionnaire units (95% CI –0.53, –0.26), total cholesterol –0.86 mmoles/liter (95% CI –1.03, –0.68), triglycerides –0.26 mmoles/liter (95% CI –0.43, –0.09), and average glucose –1.15 mmoles/liter (95% CI –1.39, –0.91). Conclusion The 4-month postintervention results showed that patients in the intervention reduced their daily sitting time and improved patient-reported outcomes and total cholesterol levels compared to the control group. Eighteen months after intervention, patients in the intervention group were still significantly less sedentary than controls. Findings suggest that a behavioral approach is beneficial for promoting long-term physical activity and health in patients with RA.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND Commercial off-the-shelf activity trackers (eg, Fitbit) allow users to self-monitor their daily physical activity (PA), including the number of steps, type of PA, amount of sleep, and other features. Fitbits have been used as both measurement and intervention tools. However, it is not clear how they are being incorporated into PA intervention studies, and their use in specific age groups across the life course is not well understood. OBJECTIVE This narrative review aims to characterize how PA intervention studies across the life course use Fitbit devices by synthesizing and summarizing information on device selection, intended use (intervention vs measurement tool), participant wear instructions, rates of adherence to device wear, strategies used to boost adherence, and the complementary use of other PA measures. This review provides intervention scientists with a synthesis of information that may inform future trials involving Fitbit devices. METHODS We conducted a search of the Fitabase Fitbit Research Library, a database of studies published between 2012 and 2018. Of the 682 studies available on the Fitabase research library, 60 interventions met the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. A supplemental search in PubMed resulted in the inclusion of 15 additional articles published between 2019 and 2020. A total of 75 articles were reviewed, which represented interventions conducted in childhood; adolescence; and early, middle, and older adulthood. RESULTS There was considerable heterogeneity in the use of Fitbit within and between developmental stages. Interventions for adults typically required longer wear periods, whereas studies on children and adolescents tended to have more limited device wear periods. Most studies used developmentally appropriate behavior change techniques and device wear instructions. Regardless of the developmental stage and intended Fitbit use (ie, measurement vs intervention tool), the most common strategies used to enhance wear time included sending participants reminders through texts or emails and asking participants to log their steps or synchronize their Fitbit data daily. The rates of adherence to the wear time criteria were reported using varying metrics. Most studies supplemented the use of Fitbit with additional objective or self-reported measures for PA. CONCLUSIONS Overall, the heterogeneity in Fitbit use across PA intervention studies reflects its relative novelty in the field of research. As the use of monitoring devices continues to expand in PA research, the lack of uniformity in study protocols and metrics of reported measures represents a major issue for comparability purposes. There is a need for increased transparency in the prospective registration of PA intervention studies. Researchers need to provide a clear rationale for the use of several PA measures and specify the source of their main PA outcome and how additional measures will be used in the context of Fitbit-based interventions.",

      "abstract": "Abstract   Physical activity is important for preventing obesity and diabetes, but most obese and pre-diabetic patients are not physically active. We developed a Fitbit-based game called MapTrek that promotes walking. We recruited obese and pre-diabetic patients. Half were randomly assigned to the control group and given a Fitbit alone. The others were given a Fitbit plus MapTrek. The MapTrek group participated in 6months of weekly virtual races. Each week, participants were placed in a race with 9 others who achieved a similar number of steps in the previous week’s race. Participants moved along the virtual route by the steps recorded on their Fitbit and received daily walking challenges via text message. Text messages also had links to the race map and leaderboard. We used a Bayesian mixed effects model to analyze the number of steps taken during the intervention. A total of 192 (89%) participants in the control group and 196 (91%) in the MapTrek group were included in the analyses. MapTrek significantly increased step counts when it began: MapTrek participants walked almost 1,700 steps more than the control group on the first day of the intervention. We estimate that there is a 97% probability that the effect of MapTrek is at least 1,000 additional steps per day throughout the course of the 6-month intervention and that MapTrek participants would have walked an additional 81 miles, on average, before the effect ended. Our MapTrek intervention led to significant extra walking by the MapTrek participants.",

      "abstract": "Abstract   Background  Medical offices are increasingly hiring clinical pharmacists to improve management of cardiovascular disease (CVD). Most offices employ only one pharmacist, while the volume of patients with complex medical and social issues creates a struggle for providers to meet demand. We have developed a remote telehealth service provided by clinical pharmacists to complement CVD services provided by on-site clinical pharmacists and aid sites without a clinical pharmacist. This cardiovascular risk service (CVRS) has been studied in two NIH-funded trials, however, we identified barriers to optimal intervention implementation. The purpose of this study is to examine how to implement the CVRS into medical offices and see if the intervention will be sustained.    Methods  This is a 5-year, pragmatic, cluster-randomized clinical trial in 13 primary care clinics across the US. We randomized clinics to receive CVRS or usual care and will enroll 300 patient subjects and 288 key stakeholder subjects. We have obtained access to the electronic medical records (EMRs) of all study clinics to recruit subjects and provide the pharmacist intervention. The intervention is staggered so that after 12months, the usual care sites will receive the intervention for 12months. Follow-up will be accomplished though medical record abstraction at baseline, 12months, 24months, and 36months.    Conclusions  This study will enroll subjects through 2021 and results available in 2024. This study will provide unique information on how the CVRS provided by remote clinical pharmacists can be effectively implemented in medical offices, many of which already employ on-site clinical pharmacists.

      "abstract": "While the practice of taking blood pressure readings at the physician’s office continues to be valid, home blood pressure monitoring is being increasingly used to enhance diagnostic accuracy and ensure a more personalized follow-up of patients. In the case of white coat hypertension and resistant arterial hypertension, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring is indispensable. Recent studies attach great importance to nocturnal blood pressure patterns, with a reduction in these becoming a treatment goal, a strategy known as chronotherapy. Home blood pressure monitoring is useful for both diagnosis and follow-up of arterial hypertension. Its use, particularly if combined with other patient-support interventions, serves to improve blood pressure control. Telemonitoring is associated with a decrease in blood pressure values and an increase in patient satisfaction. All studies highlight the importance of patients being supported by a multidisciplinary health care team, since blood pressure telemonitoring with a support team is more effective than simple data telemonitoring. Further studies are called for, especially on the illiterate population, with difficulties posed by technological accessibility and transcriptions into different languages. More cost-effectiveness studies and long-term results are needed to ascertain the true benefit of blood pressure telemonitoring.",

OBJECTIVE This study aims to evaluate the effects of ACT delivered via an automated mobile messaging robot on postoperative opioid use and patient-reported outcomes (PROs) in patients with orthopedic trauma who underwent operative intervention for their injuries. METHODS Adult patients presenting to a level 1 trauma center who underwent operative fixation of a traumatic upper or lower extremity fracture and who used mobile phone text messaging were eligible for the study. Patients were randomized in a 1:1 ratio to either the intervention group, who received twice-daily mobile phone messages communicating an ACT-based intervention for the first 2 weeks after surgery, or the control group, who received no messages. Baseline PROs were completed. Two weeks after the operative intervention, follow-up was performed in the form of an opioid medication pill count and postoperative administration of PROs. The mean number of opioid tablets used by patients was calculated and compared between groups. The mean PRO scores were also compared between the groups. RESULTS A total of 82 subjects were enrolled in the study. Of the 82 participants, 76 (38 ACT and 38 controls) completed the study. No differences between groups in demographic factors were identified. The intervention group used an average of 26.1 (SD 21.4) opioid tablets, whereas the control group used 41.1 (SD 22.0) tablets, resulting in 36.5% ([41.1-26.1]/41.1) less tablets used by subjects receiving the mobile phone-based ACT intervention (P=.004). The intervention group subjects reported a lower postoperative Patient-Reported Outcome Measure Information System Pain Intensity score (mean 45.9, SD 7.2) than control group subjects (mean 49.7, SD 8.8; P=.04). CONCLUSIONS In this study, the delivery of an ACT-based intervention via an automated mobile messaging robot in the acute postoperative period decreased opioid use in selected patients with orthopedic trauma. Participants receiving the ACT-based intervention also reported lower pain intensity after 2 weeks, although this may not represent a clinically important difference.

      "abstract": "Previous studies have demonstrated the cost-effectiveness of physician-pharmacist collaborations to improve hypertension control. However, most studies have limited generalizability, lacking minority and low-income populations. The Collaboration Among Pharmacist and Physicians to Improve Blood Pressure Now (CAPTION) trial randomized 625 patients from 32 medical offices in 15 states. Each office had an existing clinical pharmacist on staff. Pharmacists in intervention offices communicated with patients and made recommendations to physicians about changes in therapy. Demographic information, blood pressure (BP), medications, and physician visits were recorded. In addition, pharmacists tracked time spent with each patient. Costs were assigned to medications and pharmacist and physician time. Cost-effectiveness ratios were calculated based on changes in BP measurements and hypertension control rates. Thirty-eight percent of patients were black, 14% were Hispanic, and 49% had annual income <$25 000. At 9 months, average systolic BP was 6.1 mm Hg lower (±3.5), diastolic was 2.9 mm Hg lower (±1.9), and the percentage of patients with controlled hypertension was 43% in the intervention group and 34% in the control group. Total costs for the intervention group were $1462.87 (±132.51) and $1259.94 (±183.30) for the control group, a difference of $202.93. The cost to lower BP by 1 mm Hg was $33.27 for systolic BP and $69.98 for diastolic BP. The cost to increase the rate of hypertension control by 1 percentage point in the study population was $22.55. Our results highlight the cost-effectiveness of a clinical pharmacy intervention for hypertension control in primary care settings.",

      "abstract": "The purpose of this review is to describe the role of the pharmacist in innovative pathways of care for hypertension (HTN) management for emergency department (ED) patients, particularly in under-resourced communities. Due to intersecting socioeconomic and personal health risk factors, these patients bear a disproportionate share of cardiovascular disease, yet often have limited access to high-quality primary care. Recent meta-analyses demonstrate a clear advantage associated with pharmacist-physician collaborative models over traditional physician-only care in achieving blood pressure control. However, no prior study has evaluated use of pharmacist-led follow-up for ED patients with uncontrolled blood pressure (BP). Thus, we developed a pharmacist-driven transitional care clinic (TCC) that utilizes a collaborative practice agreement with ED physicians to improve HTN management for ED patients. We have successfully implemented the TCC in a high-volume urban ED and in a pilot study have shown clinically relevant BP reductions with our collaborative model. The use of pharmacist-led follow-up for HTN management is highly effective. Novel programs such as our TCC, which extend the reach of such a model to ED patients, are promising, and future studies should focus on implementation through larger, multicenter, randomized trials. However, to be most effective, policy advocacy is needed to expand pharmacist prescriptive authority and develop innovative financial models to incentivize this practice.",

      "abstract": "Physician–pharmacist collaboration improves blood pressure, but there is little information on whether this model can reduce the gap in healthcare disparities. This trial involved 32 medical offices in 15 states. A clinical pharmacist was embedded within each office and made recommendations to physicians and patients in intervention offices. The purpose of the present analysis was to evaluate whether the pharmacist intervention could reduce healthcare disparities by improving blood pressure in high-risk racial and socioeconomic subjects compared with the control group. The analyses in minority subjects were prespecified secondary analyses, but all other comparisons were secondary, post hoc analyses. The 9-month visit was completed by 539 patients: 345 received the intervention, and 194 were in the control group. Following the intervention, mean systolic blood pressure was found to be 7.3 mmHg (95% confidence interval 2.4, 12.3) lower in subjects from racial minority groups who received the intervention compared with the control group ( P =0.0042). Subjects with ≤12 years of education in the intervention group had a systolic blood pressure 8.1 mmHg (95% confidence interval 3.2, 13.1) lower than the control group with lower education ( P =0.0001). Similar reductions in blood pressure occurred in patients with low incomes, those receiving Medicaid, or those without insurance. This study demonstrated that a pharmacist intervention reduced racial and socioeconomic disparities in the treatment of blood pressure. Although disparities in blood pressure were reduced by the intervention, there were still nonsignificant gaps in mean systolic blood pressure when compared with intervention subjects not at risk.

Observational data can be used to predict outcomes and evaluate treatments; however, exactly which strategy should be used to analyze the outcomes of treatment using observational data is currently unclear. This study aimed to determine the most accurate machine learning technique to predict 1-year-after-initial-acute-myocardial-infarction (AMI) survival of elderly patients and to identify the association of angiotensin-converting- enzyme inhibitors and angiotensin-receptor blockers (ACEi/ARBs) with survival.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              We built a cohort of 124,031 Medicare beneficiaries who experienced an AMI in 2007 or 2008. For analytical purposes, all variables were categorized into nine different groups: ACEi/ARB use, demographics, cardiac events, comorbidities, complications, procedures, medications, insurance, and healthcare utilization. Our outcome of interest was 1-year-post-AMI survival. To solve this classification task, we used lasso logistic regression (LLR) and random forest (RF), and compared their performance depending on category selection, sampling methods, and hyper-parameter selection. Nested 10-fold cross-validation was implemented to obtain an unbiased estimate of performance evaluation. We used the area under the receiver operating curve (AUC) as our primary measure for evaluating the performance of predictive algorithms.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              LLR consistently showed best AUC results throughout the experiments, closely followed by RF. The best prediction was yielded with LLR based on the combination of demographics, comorbidities, procedures, and utilization. The coefficients from the final LLR model showed that AMI patients with many comorbidities, older ages, or living in a low-income area have a higher risk of mortality 1-year after an AMI. In addition, treating the AMI patients with ACEi/ARBs increases the 1-year-after-initial-AMI survival rate of the patients.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Given the many features we examined, ACEi/ARBs were associated with increased 1-year survival among elderly patients after an AMI. We found LLR to be the best-performing model over RF to predict 1-year survival after an AMI. LLR greatly improved the generalization of the model by feature selection, which implicitly indicates the association between AMI-related variables and survival can be defined by a relatively simple model with a small number of features. Some comorbidities were associated with a greater risk of mortality, such as heart failure and chronic kidney disease, but others were associated with survival such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, and diabetes. In addition, patients who live in urban areas and areas with large numbers of immigrants have a higher probability of survival. Machine learning methods are helpful to determine outcomes when RCT results are not available.",

Blood pressure was measured by trained study coordinators in each office, and patients were included in the study if they had uncontrolled blood pressure. Included patients were randomized to a 9‐month intervention, a 24‐month intervention, or usual care. The goal of the pharmacist intervention was to improve blood pressure control and resolve drug therapy problems impeding progress toward blood pressure goals. This intervention included medical record review, a structured assessment with the patient, collaboration to achieve goals of therapy, and patient follow‐up. The two intervention arms (9 and 24 mo) were identical the first 9 months, and that time frame is the focus of this workload evaluation. Pharmacists completed study encounter forms for every patient encounter and estimated time spent in pre‐visit, face‐to‐face care, and post‐visit activities. Among the 390 patients, there were 2811 encounters with pharmacists that involved 3.44 hours/patient for face‐to‐face care visits plus 1.55 hours/patient for pre‐visit and post‐visit work. Intensity of work was reflected in interventions to resolve drug therapy problems with patients (43% of encounters) and with physicians (1169 recommendations, of which physicians accepted 1153 [98.6%]), resulting in improvement of patients' blood pressure goals achieved (from 0% at baseline to 43% at 9 months based on the primary study end point).\n              \n            \n            \n              Conclusion\n              Pharmacists provided extensive interventions to patients with hypertension.

We investigated potential cardiac‐related events associated with antimicrobial use in a population of patients with acute myocardial infarction.\n            \n            \n              Methods and Results\n              \n                For 185 010 Medicare beneficiaries, we recorded prescriptions for azithromycin, clarithromycin, levofloxacin, moxifloxacin, doxycycline, and amoxicillin‐clavulanate. In the following week, we recorded death, acute myocardial infarction, atrial fibrillation or atrial flutter, a non–atrial fibrillation/atrial flutter arrhythmia, or ventricular arrhythmia. We fit unadjusted and adjusted logistic regression models using generalized estimating equations. Adjusted models included patients’ comorbidities, medications, procedures, demographics, insurance status, time since index acute myocardial infarction, number of visits, and the influenza rate. In unadjusted analyses, macrolides and fluoroquinolones were associated with a risk of cardiac events. However, the risk associated with macrolide use was substantially attenuated after adjustment for a wide range of variables, and the risk associated with fluoroquinolones was no longer statistically significant. For example, for azithromycin, the odds ratio for any cardiac event or death was 1.35 (95% confidence interval, 1.27–1.44;\n                P\n                <0.0001), but after controlling for a wide range of covariates, the odds ratio decreased to 1.01 (95% confidence interval, 0.95–1.08;\n                P\n                <0.6688).\n              \n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              Controlling for covariates explains much of the adverse cardiac risk associated with antimicrobial use found in other studies. Most antimicrobials are not associated with risk of cardiac events, and others, specifically azithromycin and clarithromycin, may pose a small risk of certain cardiac events. However, the modest potential risks attributable to these antimicrobials must be weighed against the drugs’ considerable and immediate benefits.",

Additional research is needed to determine the cost-effectiveness of team-based care models relative to one another and as they relate to implementing intensive BP goals. As a focus of healthcare shifts to value (i.e., cost, effectiveness, and patient preferences), formal cost-effectiveness analyses will inform which team-based initiatives hold the highest value in different healthcare settings with different populations and needs. Several challenges, including clinical inertia, financial investment, and billing restrictions for pharmacist-delivered services, will need to be addressed in order to improve public health through intensive BP control and team-based care.",

BP readings are routinely measured and recorded at most healthcare visits. Thus, there are many opportunities to diagnose hypertension and improve BP control. The objective of this study was to determine the percentage of patients with elevated BP measurements where BP or hypertension is mentioned in the clinical notes.\nMethods: We randomly selected outpatient visits for 10,000 patients in Internal Medicine clinics (1-1-2017 to 6-30-2021) and recorded if there was a BP value ≥ 140/90 mm Hg. The Assessment and Plans (A/Ps) from these clinic visits were extracted using a rule-based pattern-matching algorithm. A/Ps with no matching text pattern indicating BP or hypertension was considered not to have addressed hypertension. The percentage of visits where BP was mentioned was calculated for each specialty.\nResults: Among the 10,000 patients, we found 5,674 clinic visits where patients had elevated BP. A/Ps from nephrology, cardiology and general internal medicine visits mentioned elevated BP at least 50% of the time. In contrast, A/Ps from encounters with allergy/immunology, endocrinology (not diabetes clinic) and rheumatology specialists referenced the patient’s BP less than 10% of the time.\nConclusions: We demonstrate widespread deficiencies in the discussion of hypertension and BP in clinical notes across medical specialties.",

      "abstract": "Continuous blood pressure (BP) monitoring is of great significance for the real-time monitoring and early prevention of cardiovascular diseases. Recently, wearable BP monitoring devices have made great progress in the development of daily BP monitoring because they adapt to long-term and high-comfort wear requirements. However, the research and development of wearable continuous BP monitoring devices still face great challenges such as obvious motion noise and slow dynamic response speeds. The pulse wave transit time method which is combined with photoplethysmography (PPG) waves and electrocardiogram (ECG) waves for continuous BP monitoring has received wide attention due to its advantages in terms of excellent dynamic response characteristics and high accuracy. Here, we review the recent state-of-art wearable continuous BP monitoring devices and related technology based on the pulse wave transit time; their measuring principles, design methods, preparation processes, and properties are analyzed in detail. In addition, the potential development directions and challenges of wearable continuous BP monitoring devices based on the pulse wave transit time method are discussed.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The most appropriate targets for systolic blood pressure to reduce cardiovascular morbidity and mortality among persons without diabetes remain uncertain.\nMETHODS: We randomly assigned 9361 persons with a systolic blood pressure of 130 mm Hg or higher and an increased cardiovascular risk, but without diabetes, to a systolic blood-pressure target of less than 120 mm Hg (intensive treatment) or a target of less than 140 mm Hg (standard treatment). The primary composite outcome was myocardial infarction, other acute coronary syndromes, stroke, heart failure, or death from cardiovascular causes.\nRESULTS: At 1 year, the mean systolic blood pressure was 121.4 mm Hg in the intensive-treatment group and 136.2 mm Hg in the standard-treatment group. The intervention was stopped early after a median follow-up of 3.26 years owing to a significantly lower rate of the primary composite outcome in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group (1.65% per year vs. 2.19% per year; hazard ratio with intensive treatment, 0.75; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.64 to 0.89; P<0.001). All-cause mortality was also significantly lower in the intensive-treatment group (hazard ratio, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.60 to 0.90; P=0.003). Rates of serious adverse events of hypotension, syncope, electrolyte abnormalities, and acute kidney injury or failure, but not of injurious falls, were higher in the intensive-treatment group than in the standard-treatment group.\nCONCLUSIONS: Among patients at high risk for cardiovascular events but without diabetes, targeting a systolic blood pressure of less than 120 mm Hg, as compared with less than 140 mm Hg, resulted in lower rates of fatal and nonfatal major cardiovascular events and death from any cause, although significantly higher rates of some adverse events were observed in the intensive-treatment group.

      "abstract": "Blood pressure (BP) is one of the most important monitoring parameters in clinical medicine. For years, the cuff-based sphygmomanometer and the arterial invasive line have been the gold standards for care professionals to assess BP. During the past few decades, the wide spread of the oscillometry-based BP arm or wrist cuffs have made home-based BP assessment more convenient and accessible. However, the discontinuous nature, the inability to interface with mobile applications, the relative inaccuracy with movement, and the need for calibration have rendered those BP oscillometry devices inadequate for next-generation healthcare infrastructure where integration and continuous data acquisition and communication are required. Recently, the indirect approach to obtain BP values has been intensively investigated, where BP is mathematically derived through the “Time Delay” in propagation of pressure waves in the vascular system. This holds promise for the realization of cuffless and continuous BP monitoring systems, for both patients and healthy populations in both inpatient and outpatient settings. This review highlights recent efforts in developing these next-generation blood pressure monitoring devices and compares various mathematical models. The unmet challenges and further developments that are crucial to develop “Time Delay”-based BP devices are also discussed.",

      "abstract": "There is an obvious gap in the translation of clinical trial evidence into practice with regards to optimal hypertension control. The three major categories of barriers to BP control are patient‐related, physician‐related, and medical environment/health care system factors. Patient‐related barriers include poor medication adherence, beliefs about hypertension and its treatment, depression, health literacy, comorbidity, and patient motivation. The most pertinent is medication adherence, given its centrality to the other factors. The most salient physician‐related barrier is clinical inertia—defined, as the failure of health care providers to initiate or intensify drug therapy in a patient with uncontrolled BP. The major reasons for clinical inertia are: 1) overestimation of the amount of care that physicians provide; 2) lack of training on how to attain target BP levels; and 3) clinicians' use of soft reasons to avoid treatment intensification by adopting a “wait until next visit” approach in response to patients' excuses.",

Four themes were identified: enabling autonomy and empowerment of own health (allowing access to comprehensive and accurate data, bolstering motivation for lifestyle changes, encouraging diligence in medication taking, gaining interest in self-management, and increasing awareness of health status); providing reassurance and convenience (instilling a sense of security, readiness for troubleshooting, and reducing the frequency of clinical appointments); triggering confusion and stress (anxiety and panic over \"bad\" numbers, constant reminder of illness identity, disregarded by clinicians, lack of confidence in interpreting and responding to results, redundancy of continuous monitoring, and uncertainties around targets and frequency of measures, concerns of unreliability); financial and operational burden of device (vulnerability preventing use, or unsustainable cost).\nCONCLUSIONS: Inadequate knowledge about the benefits of lowering blood pressure, home blood pressure monitoring, blood pressure goals, and interpretation of blood pressure values, limited access to home blood pressure monitoring devices, and psychological burden with home blood pressure monitoring limit home blood pressure monitoring.",

      "abstract": "Out-of-office blood pressure measurement is an essential part of diagnosing and managing hypertension. In the era of advanced digital health information technology, the approach to achieving this is shifting from traditional methods (ambulatory and home blood pressure monitoring) to wearable devices and technology. Wearable blood pressure monitors allow frequent blood pressure measurements (ideally continuous beat-by-beat monitoring of blood pressure) with minimal stress on the patient. It is expected that wearable devices will dramatically change the quality of detection and management of hypertension by increasing the number of measurements in different situations, allowing accurate detection of phenotypes that have a negative impact on cardiovascular prognosis, such as masked hypertension and abnormal blood pressure variability. Frequent blood pressure measurements and the addition of new features such as monitoring of environmental conditions allows interpretation of blood pressure data in the context of daily stressors and different situations. This new digital approach to hypertension contributes to anticipation medicine, which refers to strategies designed to identify increasing risk and predict the onset of cardiovascular events based on a series of data collected over time, allowing proactive interventions to reduce risk. To achieve this, further research and validation is required to develop wearable blood pressure monitoring devices that provide the same accuracy as current approaches and can effectively contribute to personalized medicine.",

      "abstract": "Background\nWearable devices hold great promise, particularly for data generation for cutting-edge health research, and their demand has risen substantially in recent years. However, there is a shortage of aggregated insights into how wearables have been used in health research.\n\nObjective\nIn this review, we aim to broadly overview and categorize the current research conducted with affordable wearable devices for health research.\n\nMethods\nWe performed a scoping review to understand the use of affordable, consumer-grade wearables for health research from a population health perspective using the PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) framework. A total of 7499 articles were found in 4 medical databases (PubMed, Ovid, Web of Science, and CINAHL). Studies were eligible if they used noninvasive wearables: worn on the wrist, arm, hip, and chest; measured vital signs; and analyzed the collected data quantitatively. We excluded studies that did not use wearables for outcome assessment and prototype studies, devices that cost >€500 (US $570), or obtrusive smart clothing.\n\nResults\nWe included 179 studies using 189 wearable devices covering 10,835,733 participants. Most studies were observational (128/179, 71.5%), conducted in 2020 (56/179, 31.3%) and in North America (94/179, 52.5%), and 93% (10,104,217/10,835,733) of the participants were part of global health studies. The most popular wearables were fitness trackers (86/189, 45.5%) and accelerometer wearables, which primarily measure movement (49/189, 25.9%). Typical measurements included steps (95/179, 53.1%), heart rate (HR; 55/179, 30.7%), and sleep duration (51/179, 28.5%). Other devices measured blood pressure (3/179, 1.7%), skin temperature (3/179, 1.7%), oximetry (3/179, 1.7%), or respiratory rate (2/179, 1.1%). The wearables were mostly worn on the wrist (138/189, 73%) and cost <€200 (US $228; 120/189, 63.5%). The aims and approaches of all 179 studies revealed six prominent uses for wearables, comprising correlations—wearable and other physiological data (40/179, 22.3%), method evaluations (with subgroups; 40/179, 22.3%), population-based research (31/179, 17.3%), experimental outcome assessment (30/179, 16.8%), prognostic forecasting (28/179, 15.6%), and explorative analysis of big data sets (10/179, 5.6%). The most frequent strengths of affordable wearables were validation, accuracy, and clinical certification (104/179, 58.1%).\n\nConclusions\nWearables showed an increasingly diverse field of application such as COVID-19 prediction, fertility tracking, heat-related illness, drug effects, and psychological interventions; they also included underrepresented populations, such as individuals with rare diseases. There is a lack of research on wearable devices in low-resource contexts. Fueled by the COVID-19 pandemic, we see a shift toward more large-sized, web-based studies where wearables increased insights into the developing pandemic, including forecasting models and the effects of the pandemic. Some studies have indicated that big data extracted from wearables may potentially transform the understanding of population health dynamics and the ability to forecast health trends.",

Optimal management includes frequent blood pressure monitoring and antihypertensive medication titration, but in the traditional office-based care delivery model, patients have their blood pressure measured only intermittently and in a way that is subject to misdiagnosis with white coat or masked hypertension. There is a growing opportunity to leverage our expanding repository of digital technology to reimagine hypertension care delivery. This paper reviews existing and emerging digital tools available for hypertension management, as well as behavioral economic insights that could supercharge their impact.\n\nRecent Findings\nDigitally connected blood pressure monitors offer an alternative to office-based blood pressure monitoring. A number of cuffless blood pressure monitors are in development but require further validation before they can be deployed for widespread clinical use. Patient-facing hubs and applications offer a means to transmit blood pressure data to clinicians. Though artificial intelligence could allow for curation of this data, its clinical use for hypertension remains limited to assessing risk factors at this time. Finally, text-based and telemedicine platforms are increasingly being employed to translate hypertension data into clinical outcomes with promising results.\n\nSummary\nThe digital management of hypertension shows potential as an avenue for increasing patient engagement and improving clinical efficiency and outcomes. It is important for clinicians to understand the benefits, limitations, and future directions of digital health to optimize management of hypertension.",

We sought to gain insight into the perceived value of ABPM among stakeholders who responded to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services’ (CMS) request for comments to inform the first revision of ABPM reimbursement policy in over 15 years. We found that most comments were classifiable in two main themes, current coverage and future coverage. Individuals and institutions representing multiple disciplines and specialties were highly supportive of expanding the current CMS coverage of ABPM, including for a wide range of clinical indications and populations. It is clear from the comments reviewed that there is wide support for expanding CMS coverage for ABPM. Broad support for a change in ABPM reimbursement policy may lead to changes in the way this technology is used in the United States.",

We also appraised the methodological quality of studies.\n\nData sources\nPubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, and the Cochrane Central Register of Control Trials (CENTRAL).\n\nInclusion criteria\nRandomized control trials, prospective and retrospective cohort studies, observational studies, and case-control studies published in English from any year to present that describe HBPM and 24-hour ABPM and report on systolic and/or diastolic BP and/or heart attack, stroke, kidney failure and/or all-cause mortality for adult patients. Due to the nature of the question, studies with only untreated patients were not considered.\n\nResults\nOf 1,742 titles and abstractions independently reviewed by two reviewers, 137 studies met predetermined criteria for evaluation. Nineteen studies were identified as relevant and included in the paper. The common themes were that HBPM and ABPM correlated with cardiovascular events and mortality, and targeting HBPM or ABPM resulted in similar outcomes. Associations between BP measurement type and mortality differed by study population. Both the low sensitivity of office blood pressure monitoring (OBPM) to detect optimal BP control by ABPM and the added association of HBPM with cardiovascular mortality supported the routine use of HBPM in clinical practice. There was insufficient data to determine the benefit of using HBPM as a measurement standard for BP control.\n\nConclusion\nHBPM encourages patient-centered care and improves BP control and patient outcomes. Given the limited number of studies with both HBPM and ABPM, these measurement types should be incorporated into the design of randomized clinical trials within hypertensive populations.",

      "abstract": "The accurate measurement of blood pressure (BP) in pregnancy is essential to guide medical decision making that affects both mother and fetus. The aim of this systematic review was to determine the accuracy of ambulatory, home, and clinic BP measurement devices in pregnant women. We searched Ovid MEDLINE, The Cochrane Library, EMBASE, CINAHL EBSCO, ClinicalTrials.gov, International Clinical Trials Registry Platform, and dabl from inception through August 3, 2017 for articles that assessed the validity of an upper arm BP measurement device against a mercury sphygmomanometer in pregnant women. Two independent investigators determined eligibility, extracted data, and adjudicated protocol violations. From 1798 potential articles identified, 41, that assessed 28 devices, met the inclusion criteria. Most articles (n=32) followed a standard or modified American National Standards Institute/Association for the Advancement of Medical Instrumentation/International Organization for Standardization, British Hypertension Society, or European Society of Hypertension validation protocol. Several articles described the results of validation studies performed on >1 device (n=7) or in >1 population of pregnant women (n=12), comprising 64 pairwise validity assessments. The device was validated in 61% (32 of 52) of studies which used a standard or modified protocol. Only 34% (11 of 32) of the studies wherein the device was successfully validated were performed without a protocol violation. Given the implications of inaccurate BP measurement in pregnant women, healthcare providers should be aware of and try to use the BP measurement devices which have been properly validated in this population.",

      "abstract": "<sec> <title>BACKGROUND</title> Digital technologies for health promotion have proliferated over the past decade, with uptake increasing steadily among young people, including those in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Youth increasingly rely on digital tools for health information, and the early influence of this digital technology can have an impact throughout the lifespan. While there is a growing body of literature on the opportunities and challenges of digital health promotion (DHP) for young people, a gap remains in research that closely examines the characteristics of digital health strategies developed specifically for youth in LMICs. </sec> <sec> <title>OBJECTIVE</title> In the present paper we investigate and compare selected examples of DHP tools, from three countries in sub-Saharan Africa, namely Ghana, Kenya, and South Africa. Our aim is to create a multidimensional descriptive taxonomy of DHP tools developed specifically to promote the health of adolescents and young adults in these countries. </sec> <sec> <title>METHODS</title> We conducted systematic online searches using relevant keywords, incorporating the expertise of local professionals to ensure a thorough search. We thereafter created a taxonomy describing selected features for each tool, including health area of focus, key stakeholders, type of service, and ethical values explicitly referenced within the tool. </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> A total of 31 DHP tools were identified. Sexual and reproductive health was the most common health area of focus for DHP services, which were primarily funded and supported by local NGOs, foundations, and international organizations. The assessed tools were predominantly web and social media-based, with the overarching goal and core value of expanding health knowledge and offering access to health promotion services to young people. </sec> <sec> <title>CONCLUSIONS</title> With sustained investment, DHP can improve the health of young people while relieving the pressure on healthcare services. Addressing ethical concerns such as privacy, transparency, equity, and inclusiveness are essential to the safety, usefulness, and fairness of DHP. To achieve the greatest benefit, local youth perspectives and priorities should be included in DHP development. </sec>",

Research has explored modalities, like photos and open-ended text and voice descriptions, to make journaling less burdensome and more descriptive than traditional barcode and database searches. However, less is known about how people prefer to journal foods when less constrained by limitations of databases, natural language processing, and image recognition. We deployed a food journal prototype supporting varied devices and input modalities, which 15 participants used to journal 1008 food logs over two weeks. Participants had diverse strategies for indicating what and how much they ate, varying from ambiguous foods to specifying varieties and using different measurements for clarifying amount. Some strategies were interpretable by natural language food identification and image classification services, while others point to open research questions. We finally discuss opportunities for accounting for variance in food journaling.",

Technological interventions, such as mobile and wearable health systems, can support data collection and reflection about health status. However, little is known about how ADHD children interpret such data. We conducted a deployment study with 10 children, aged 10 to 15, for six weeks, during which they used a smartwatch in their homes. Results from observations and interviews during this study indicate that children with ADHD can interpret their own health data, particularly in the moment. However, as ADHD children develop more autonomy, smartwatch systems may require alternatives for data reflection that are interpretable and actionable for them. This work contributes to the scholarly discourse around health data visualization, particularly in considering implications for the design of health technologies for children with ADHD.",

      "abstract": "Self-tracking practices enable users to record and analyze their personal data. In recent years, non-digital forms of manual self-tracking, such as bullet journaling, have gained popularity. We conduct a survey (N = 404) and follow-up interviews (N = 18) to better understand users' motivations for physical tracking, the challenges they face with their current practices, and their perceptions of both digital and physical tracking tools. We find that for some users, physical practices are a structured and constructive creative outlet and a form of artistic expression. While the resulting physical artifacts may not easily enable retrospective reflection over long-term data, they preserve personal traces in a unique and tangible form that is meaningful to users. Moreover, the reflective power of physical tracking stems from the interaction with the physical materiality, the slow pace of these practices, the creative exploration they facilitate, and the associated digital disconnect. We conclude with design implications for future technologies, including ways digital tools might extend current physical practices and support richly reflective self-tracking.",

However, there is scarce evidence of such technological interventions’ effectiveness, and there are no standardized methods to evaluate their impact on people’s physical activity and health. This work aims to help ST practitioners and researchers by empowering them with systematic guidelines and a framework for designing and evaluating technological interventions to facilitate health behavior change and user engagement, focusing on increasing physical activity and decreasing sedentariness. To this end, we conduct a literature review of 129 papers between 2008 and 2022, which identifies the core ST design principles and their efficacy, as well as the most comprehensive list to date of user engagement evaluation metrics for ST. Based on the review’s findings, we propose PAST SELF, a framework to guide the design and evaluation of ST technology that has potential applications in industrial and scientific settings. Finally, to facilitate researchers and practitioners, we complement this article with an open corpus and an online, adaptive exploration tool for the PAST SELF data.",

The framework also includes the generation of high level fine actions for multi-agents such as techniques for interactive activities in pedagogical scenarios based on environment and temporal triggers. We applied our multi-agent scenario generation framework in an interactive simulation for hand hygiene education, and conduct an initial usability study to assess the educational benefits of the simulation to nursing students and evaluated the performance characteristics of our framework.

      "abstract": "Background: Telemedicine and electronic health (eHealth) interventions have been proposed to improve management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) for patients between traditional clinic and hospital visits to reduce complications. However, the effectiveness of such interventions may depend on patients’ comfort with technology. Objective: The aim was to describe the relationship between patient demographics and COPD disease severity and the use of communication-related technology. Methods: We administered a structured survey about the use of communication technologies to a cohort of persons in the COPDGene study at one midwestern hospital in the United States. Survey results were combined with clinical and demographic data previously collected as part of the cohort study. A subsample of patients also completed eHealth simulation tasks. We used logistic or linear regression to determine the relationship between patient demographics and COPD disease severity and reported use of communication-related technology and the results from our simulated eHealth-related tasks. Results: A total of 686 patients completed the survey and 100 participated in the eHealth simulation. Overall, those who reported using communication technology were younger (P=.005) and had higher incomes (P=.03). Men appeared less likely to engage in text messaging (P 10 (P=.02) and walked shorter distances in their 6-minute walk tests (P=.003) than those who took less time. Conclusions: Older patients, patients with lower incomes, and less healthy patients were less likely to report using communication technology, and they did not perform as well on our simulated eHealth tasks. Thus, eHealth-based interventions may not be as effective in these populations, and additional training in communication technology may be needed.  [J Med Internet Res 2018;20(4):e125]",

Design A systematic review with meta-analysis and meta-regression. Data sources Five databases (PubMed, Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest and Discus) were searched from inception to May 2022. The database search was complemented with backward and forward citation searches and search of the references from relevant systematic reviews. Eligibility criteria Randomised controlled trials comparing an intervention using self-monitoring (active control arm) with an intervention comprising the same treatment PLUS any additional component (intervention arm). Data extraction and synthesis The effect measures were mean differences in daily step count. Meta-analyses were performed using random-effects models, and effect moderators were explored using univariate and multivariate meta-regression models. Results Eighty-five studies with 12 057 participants were identified, with 75 studies included in the meta-analysis at postintervention and 24 at follow-up. At postintervention, the mean difference between the intervention and active control arms was 926 steps/day (95% CI 651 to 1201). At a follow-up, the mean difference was 413 steps/day (95% CI 210 to 615). Interventions with a prescribed goal and involving human counselling, particularly via phone/video calls, were associated with a greater mean difference in the daily step count than interventions with added print materials, websites, smartphone apps or incentives. Conclusion Physical activity interventions that combine self-monitoring with other components provide an additional modest yet sustained increase in step count compared with self-monitoring alone. Some forms of counselling, particularly remote phone/video counselling, outperformed other intervention components, such as websites and smartphone apps. PROSPERO registered number CRD42020199482.",

Inexpensive, convenient, and effective methods for predicting which patients need GSDs could help improve adoption. The purpose of this study was to determine if a Wii Balance Board (WBB) can be used to determine whether or not patients use a GSD. We prospectively recruited participants ages 70-100, some who used GSDs and some who did not. Participants first answered questions from the Modified Vulnerable Elders Survey, and then completed a grip-strength test using a handgrip dynamometer. Finally, they were asked to complete a series of four 30-second balance tests on a WBB in random order: (1) eyes open, feet apart; (2) eyes open, feet together; (3) eyes closed, feet apart; and (4) eyes closed, feet together. The four-test series was repeated a second time in the same random order. The resulting data, represented as 25 features extracted from the questionnaires and the grip test, and data from the eight balance tests, were used to predict a subject's GSD use using generalized functional linear models based on the Bernoulli distribution. 268 participants were consented; 62 were missing data elements and were removed from analysis; 109 were not GSD users and 97 were GSD users. The use of velocity and acceleration information from the WBB improved upon predictions based solely on grip strength, demographic, and survey variables. The WBB is a convenient, inexpensive, and easy-to-use device that can be used to recommend whether or not patients should be using a GSD.",

More evidence are needed to determine the utility of WAM in improving sleep. The efficacy of interventions using WAM to improve PA, SB, and/or sleep could not be conclusively determined.

The interventions considered include: (i) voluntary self-isolation of healthcare personnel (HCPs) with symptoms; (ii) a program of active syndromic surveillance and compulsory isolation of HCPs; (iii) the use of masks or respirators by patients and HCPs; (iv) improved social distancing among HCPs; (v) increased physical separation of dialysis stations; and (vi) patient isolation combined with preemptive isolation of exposed HCPs. Our simulations show that under conditions that existed prior to the COVID-19 outbreak, extremely high rates of COVID-19 infection can result in a dialysis unit. In simulations under worst-case modeling assumptions, a combination of relatively inexpensive interventions such as requiring surgical masks for everyone, encouraging social distancing between healthcare professionals (HCPs), slightly increasing the physical distance between dialysis stations, and-once the first symptomatic patient is detected-isolating that patient, replacing the HCP having had the most exposure to that patient, and relatively short-term use of N95 respirators by other HCPs can lead to a substantial reduction in both the attack rate and the likelihood of any spread beyond patient zero. For example, in a scenario with R0 = 3.0, 60% presymptomatic viral shedding, and a dialysis patient being the infection source, the attack rate falls from 87.8% at baseline to 34.6% with this intervention bundle. Furthermore, the likelihood of having no additional infections increases from 6.2% at baseline to 32.4% with this intervention bundle.",

Well-established social and behavioral determinants that have led to health disparities among black men include racism, discrimination, and stress. While advocacy work that includes community-engagement and tailoring health promotion strategies have shown local impact, evidence shows the gaps are increasing. We suspect that failure to reduce current disparities may be due to conventional public health interventions and programs; therefore, we submit that innovative interventions, ones that embrace digital technologies and their ability to harness naturally occurring social networks within groups, like black men, have particular importance and deserve attention. This commentary characterizes the current literature on chronic illness among black men as well as health interventions that use digital technology, to build a case for expanding research in this area to reduce the overwhelming burden of chronic illness among black men. </sec>",

      "abstract": "Introduction: The unparalleled surge in digital health adoption during the COVID-19 pandemic has emphasized the potential of mHealth apps. However, the quality of available evidence is generally low, and regulatory frameworks have focused on apps with medical purposes only, overlooking apps with significant interactions with patients that may require stronger oversight.Areas covered: To support this expanded evidence generation process, we identified the reasons that distinguish mHealth apps compared to medical devices at large and that should differentially feature their assessment. mHealth apps are characterized by the iterative nature of the corresponding interventions, frequent user interactions with a non-linear relationship between technology usage, engagement and outcomes, significant organizational implications, as well as challenges associated with genericization, their broad diagnostic potential, and price setting.Expert Opinion: The renewed reliance experienced during the pandemic and the unprecedented injection of resources through recovery instruments can further boost the development of apps. Only robust evidence of the benefits of mHealth apps will persuade health-care professionals and beneficiaries to systematically deploy them. Regulatory bodies will need to question their current approaches by adopting comprehensive evaluation processes that adequately consider the specific features of mHealth apps.",

      "abstract": "AIMS Digital therapeutics is a new approach to facilitate the non-pharmacological treatment of hypertension using software programmes such as smartphone applications and/or device algorithms. Based on promising findings from a small pilot trial, the HERB Digital Hypertension 1 (HERB-DH1) pivotal trial investigated the efficacy of digital therapeutics in patients with hypertension not receiving antihypertensive medication. METHODS AND RESULTS This prospective, open-label, randomized controlled study was performed at 12 sites in Japan. Patients with hypertension [office systolic blood pressure (SBP) 140 to <180 mmHg and 24 h SBP ≥130 mmHg] were randomly assigned 1:1 to the digital therapeutics group (HERB system + standard lifestyle modification) or control group (standard lifestyle modification alone). The primary efficacy endpoint was the mean change in 24 h ambulatory SBP from baseline to 12 weeks; key secondary efficacy endpoints were mean changes in office and home blood pressure (BP) from baseline to 12 weeks. All analyses were conducted in the full analysis set population. Between December 2019 and June 2020, 390 patients were randomly assigned to the digital therapeutics group (n = 199) or control (n = 191) group. Between-group differences in 24-h ambulatory, home, and office SBPs at 12 weeks were -2.4 (95% confidence interval -4.5 to -0.3), -4.3 (-6.7 to -1.9), and -3.6 (-6.2 to -1.0) mmHg, respectively. No major programme-related safety events occurred up to 24 weeks. CONCLUSION The HERB-DH1 pivotal study showed the superiority of digital therapeutics compared with standard lifestyle modification alone to reduce 24-h ambulatory, home, and office BPs in the absence of antihypertensive medications.",

In this paper, we work with teachers and students to iteratively develop Storyfer, which leverages text generation models to enable learners to read a generated story that covers any target words, conduct a story cloze test, and use these words to write a new story with adaptive AI assistance. Our within-subjects study (N=28) shows that learners generally favor the generated stories for connecting target words and writing assistance for easing their learning workload. However, in the read-cloze-write learning sessions, participants using Storyfer perform worse in recalling and using target words than learning with a baseline tool without our AI features.

These technologies appeal particularly to young people, who are more familiar with digital devices. How this digital transformation facilitates health promotion is therefore a topic of animated debate. However, most research to date focuses on the promise and peril of digital health promotion (DHP) in high-income settings, while DHP in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) remain largely unexplored. This narrative review aims to fill this gap by critically examining key ethical challenges of implementing DHP in LMICs, with a focus on young people. In the existing literature, we identified potential impediments as well as enabling conditions. Aspects to consider in unlocking the potential of DHP include (1) addressing the digital divide and structural injustice in data-related practices; (2) engaging the target population and responding to their specific needs given their economic, cultural, and social contexts; (3) monitoring the quality and impact of DHP over time; and (4) improving responsible technology governance and its implementation. Addressing these concerns could result in meaningful health benefits for populations lacking access to more conventional healthcare resources.",

We report on an extended analysis of 15 participants' experiences with ModEat, a prototype supporting journaling with several input modalities on phone, computer, and voice assistants. Participants' modality and device preferences were largely influenced by their goals, but they frequently deviated from those preferences depending on device availability, perceived affordances, and characteristics of foods eaten. Participants rarely combined input modalities in entries, but some described that doing so allowed for more detailed journaling or serve as a placeholder for later.

In our study, we developed an exergame called Social Balance Ball to engage older and younger people to play together, encouraging social interaction between generations. From May to July 2021, we evaluated this exergame in Shanghai, China, performing a user experiment with 18 unfamiliar young-old pairs under three test conditions (virtual player, mediated human player, and co-located human player). To evaluate the exergame, our main findings demonstrated that participants felt significantly perceived social interaction in mediated play and co-located play than in virtual play. Overall, older participants perceived significantly higher social interaction than younger participants. In this study, we contribute (1) empirical research findings on how the Social Balance Ball exergame enhances social interaction in generations; (2) design implications for informing future design and development of social exergames.",

We conducted three co-design sessions with eight families, each with ADHD children who had used a smartwatch for tracking. Results indicate that situated displays could nudge families to jointly use their data for learning and skill-building. Accommodating individual needs and preferences when family members are alone is also important, particularly to support parents exploring their co-regulation role, and assisting children with data interpretation and guidance on self and co-regulation.

      "abstract": "Abstract An abundant and growing supply of digital health applications (apps) exists in the commercial tech-sector, which can be bewildering for clinicians, patients, and payers. A growing challenge for the health care system is therefore to facilitate the identification of safe and effective apps for health care practitioners and patients to generate the most health benefit as well as guide payer coverage decisions. Nearly all developed countries are attempting to define policy frameworks to improve decision-making, patient care, and health outcomes in this context. This study compares the national policy approaches currently in development/use for health apps in nine countries. We used secondary data, combined with a detailed review of policy and regulatory documents, and interviews with key individuals and experts in the field of digital health policy to collect data about implemented and planned policies and initiatives. We found that most approaches aim for centralized pipelines for health app approvals, although some countries are adding decentralized elements. While the countries studied are taking diverse paths, there is nevertheless broad, international convergence in terms of requirements in the areas of transparency, health content, interoperability, and privacy and security. The sheer number of apps on the market in most countries represents a challenge for clinicians and patients. Our analyses of the relevant policies identified challenges in areas such as reimbursement, safety, and privacy and suggest that more regulatory work is needed in the areas of operationalization, implementation and international transferability of approvals. Cross-national efforts are needed around regulation and for countries to realize the benefits of these technologies.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Hypertension increases the risk of cardiovascular and other diseases. Lifestyle modification is a significant component of nonpharmacological treatments for hypertension. We previously reported the clinical efficacy of digital therapeutics (DTx) in the HERB-DH1 trial. However, there is still a lack of cost-effectiveness assessments evaluating the impact of prescription DTx. This study aimed to analyze the cost-effectiveness of using prescription DTx in treating hypertension. We developed a monthly cycle Markov model and conducted Monte Carlo simulations using the HERB-DH1 trial data to investigate quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs) and the cost of DTx for hypertension plus guideline-based lifestyle modification consultation treatment as usual (TAU), comparing DTx + TAU and TAU-only groups with a lifetime horizon. The model inputs were obtained from the HERB-DH1 trial, published or publicly available data, and expert assumptions. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) per QALY was used as the benchmark for cost-effectiveness. We performed probabilistic sensitivity analyses (PSAs) using the Monte Carlo simulation with two million sets. The DTx + TAU strategy produced 18.778 QALYs and was associated with ¥3,924,075 ($34,122) expected costs, compared with 18.686 QALYs and ¥3,813,358 ($33,160) generated by the TAU-only strategy over a lifetime horizon, resulting in an ICER of ¥1,199,880 ($10,434)/QALY gained for DTx + TAU. The monthly cost and attrition rate of DTx for hypertension have a significant impact on ICERs. In the PSA, the probability of the DTx arm being a cost-effective option was 87.8% at a threshold value of ¥5 million ($43,478)/QALY gained. In conclusion, the DTx + TAU strategy was more cost-effective than the TAU-only strategy.",

      "abstract": "Low back pain (LBP) is the leading cause of disability throughout the world and is economically burdensome. The recommended first line treatment for non-specific LBP is non-invasive care. A digital care program (DCP) delivering evidence-based non-invasive treatment for LBP can aid self-management by engaging patients and scales personalized therapy for patient-specific needs. We assessed the efficacy of a 12-week DCP for LBP in a two-armed, pre-registered, randomized, controlled trial (RCT). Participants were included based on self-reported duration of LBP, but those with surgery or injury to the lower back in the previous three months were excluded. The treatment group (DCP) received the 12-week DCP, consisting of sensor-guided exercise therapy, education, cognitive behavioral therapy, team and individual behavioral coaching, activity tracking, and symptom tracking – all administered remotely via an app. The control group received three digital education articles only. All participants maintained access to treatment-as-usual. At 12 weeks, an intention-to-treat analysis showed each primary outcome—Oswestry Disability Index (p<0.001), Korff Pain (p<0.001) and Korff Disability (p<0.001)—as well as each secondary outcome improved more for participants in the DCP group compared to control group. For participants who completed the DCP (per protocol), average improvement in pain outcomes ranged 52-64% (Korff: 48.8–23.4, VAS: 43.6–16.5, VAS impact on daily life: 37.3–13.4; p<0.01 for all) and average improvement in disability outcomes ranged 31–55% (Korff: 33.1–15, ODI: 19.7–13.5; p<0.01 for both). Surgical interest significantly reduced in the DCP group. Participants that completed the DCP had an average engagement, each week, of 90%. Future studies will further explore the effectiveness of the DCP for long-term outcomes beyond 12 weeks and for a LBP patient population with possibly greater baseline pain and disability. In conclusion, the DCP resulted in improved LBP outcomes compared to treatment-as-usual and has potential to scale personalized evidence-based non-invasive treatment for LBP patients.",

      "abstract": "Health-related apps have great potential to enhance health and prevent disease globally, but their quality currently varies too much for clinicians to feel confident about recommending them to patients. The major quality concerns are dubious app content, loss of privacy associated with widespread sharing of the patient data they capture, inaccurate advice or risk estimates and the paucity of impact studies. This may explain why current evidence about app use by people with health-related conditions is scanty and inconsistent. There are many concerns about health-related apps designed for use by patients, such as poor regulation and implicit trust in technology. However, there are several actions that various stakeholders, including users, developers, health professionals and app distributors, can take to tackle these concerns and thus improve app quality. This article focuses on the use of checklists that can be applied to apps, novel evaluation methods and suggestions for how clinical specialty organisations can develop a low-cost curated app repository with explicit risk and quality criteria. Clinicians and professional societies must act now to ensure they are using good quality apps, support patients in choosing between available apps and improve the quality of apps under development. Funders must also invest in research to answer important questions about apps, such as how clinicians and patients decide which apps to use and which app factors are associated with effectiveness.",

      "abstract": "Osteoporosis is the fourth most common chronic disease worldwide. The adoption of preventative measures and effective self-management interventions can help improve bone health. Mobile health (mHealth) technologies can play a key role in the care and self-management of patients with osteoporosis.This study presents a systematic review and meta-analysis of the currently available mHealth apps targeting osteoporosis self-management, aiming to determine the current status, gaps, and challenges that future research could address, as well as propose appropriate recommendations.A systematic review of all English articles was conducted, in addition to a survey of all apps available in iOS and Android app stores as of May 2021. A comprehensive literature search (2010 to May 2021) of PubMed, Scopus, EBSCO, Web of Science, and IEEE Xplore was conducted. Articles were included if they described apps dedicated to or useful for osteoporosis (targeting self-management, nutrition, physical activity, and risk assessment) delivered on smartphone devices for adults aged ≥18 years. Of the 32 articles, a random effects meta-analysis was performed on 13 (41%) studies of randomized controlled trials, whereas the 19 (59%) remaining studies were only included in the narrative synthesis as they did not provide enough data.In total, 3906 unique articles were identified. Of these 3906 articles, 32 (0.81%) articles met the inclusion criteria and were reviewed in depth. The 32 studies comprised 14,235 participants, of whom, on average, 69.5% (n=9893) were female, with a mean age of 49.8 (SD 17.8) years. The app search identified 23 relevant apps for osteoporosis self-management. The meta-analysis revealed that mHealth-supported interventions resulted in a significant reduction in pain (Hedges g -1.09, 95% CI -1.68 to -0.45) and disability (Hedges g -0.77, 95% CI -1.59 to 0.05). The posttreatment effect of the digital intervention was significant for physical function (Hedges g 2.54, 95% CI -4.08 to 4.08) but nonsignificant for well-being (Hedges g 0.17, 95% CI -1.84 to 2.17), physical activity (Hedges g 0.09, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.50), anxiety (Hedges g -0.29, 95% CI -6.11 to 5.53), fatigue (Hedges g -0.34, 95% CI -5.84 to 5.16), calcium (Hedges g -0.05, 95% CI -0.59 to 0.50), vitamin D intake (Hedges g 0.10, 95% CI -4.05 to 4.26), and trabecular score (Hedges g 0.06, 95% CI -1.00 to 1.12).Osteoporosis apps have the potential to support and improve the management of the disease and its symptoms; they also appear to be valuable tools for patients and health professionals. However, most of the apps that are currently available lack clinically validated evidence of their efficacy and focus on a limited number of symptoms. A more holistic and personalized approach within a cocreation design ecosystem is needed.PROSPERO 2021 CRD42021269399; https://tinyurl.com/2sw454a9.",

      "abstract": "Hypertension is the most considerable but treatable risk factor for cardiovascular disease. Although physicians prescribe multiple antihypertensive drugs and promote lifestyle modifications, the real-world blood pressure (BP) control rate remains poor. To improve BP target achievement, we developed a novel digital therapeutic-the HERB software system -to manage hypertension. Here, we performed a randomized pilot study to assess the safety and efficacy of the HERB system for hypertension. We recruited 146 patients with essential hypertension from March 2018 to March 2019. We allocated eligible patients to the intervention group (HERB system + standard lifestyle modification) or control group (standard lifestyle modification alone). The primary outcome was the mean change from baseline to 24 weeks in 24-hour systolic BP (SBP) measured by ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM). The baseline characteristics in each group were well balanced; the mean age was approx. 57 years, and 67% were male. In the primary end point at 24 weeks, HERB intervention did not lower the mean change of 24-hour SBP by ABPM compared with the controls (adjusted difference: -0.66 mmHg; p = .78). In an exploratory analysis focusing on antihypertensive drug-naive patients aged <65, the effects of the HERB intervention were significantly greater than the control for reducing 24-hour SBP by ABPM at 16 weeks (adjusted difference: -7.6 mmHg; p = .013; and morning home SBP at 24 weeks (adjusted difference - 6.0 mmHg; p = .012). Thus, the HERB intervention did not achieve a primary efficacy end point. However, we observed that antihypertensive drug-naive adult hypertensive patients aged <65 years could be a potential HERB system-effective target for further investigations of the efficacy of the system.",

We develop a HERB system-new interactive smartphone app (HERB Mobile) with web-based patient management console (HERB Console)-to lower blood pressure (BP) based on an algorithm that helps users to promote lifestyle modifications in conjunction with medically validated non-pharmacological interventions. The app can assess the personalities, behavior characteristics, and hypertension determinants of each patient with hypertension to provide adequate guidance. To demonstrate the efficacy of the system, we designed a randomized, controlled, multicenter, open-label trial \"HERB-DH1 (HERB digital hypertension 1)\" to assess the efficacy of HERB system in patients with essential hypertension. The authors allocate patients to the intervention group (HERB system+standard lifestyle modification) or to the control group (standard lifestyle modification alone). In the intervention group, we provide the HERB Mobile for patients and the HERB Console for their primary physicians for 24weeks. Both groups are instructed for standard lifestyle modifications based on the current recommendations in the Japanese Society of Hypertension 2019 guideline. The primary outcome is the mean change from baseline to 12weeks in 24-hour systolic BP measured by ambulatory BP monitoring. We started this study in December of 2019, and the trial results will be expected in early 2021. We believe that this trial enables us to verify the efficacy of the HERB system in patients with essential hypertension.",

      "abstract": "Background: The use of mobile apps for health and well being promotion has grown exponentially in recent years. Yet, there is currently no app-quality assessment tool beyond “star”-ratings. Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a reliable, multidimensional measure for trialling, classifying, and rating the quality of mobile health apps. Methods: A literature search was conducted to identify articles containing explicit Web or app quality rating criteria published between January 2000 and January 2013. Existing criteria for the assessment of app quality were categorized by an expert panel to develop the new Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) subscales, items, descriptors, and anchors. There were sixty well being apps that were randomly selected using an iTunes search for MARS rating. There were ten that were used to pilot the rating procedure, and the remaining 50 provided data on interrater reliability. Results: There were 372 explicit criteria for assessing Web or app quality that were extracted from 25 published papers, conference proceedings, and Internet resources. There were five broad categories of criteria that were identified including four objective quality scales: engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information quality; and one subjective quality scale; which were refined into the 23-item MARS. The MARS demonstrated excellent internal consistency (alpha = .90) and interrater reliability intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC = .79). Conclusions: The MARS is a simple, objective, and reliable tool for classifying and assessing the quality of mobile health apps. It can also be used to provide a checklist for the design and development of new high quality health apps.",

While mHealth interventions have shown promise, there is limited research on T2DM management apps in real-world app stores.\nObjective: This study aimed to systematically search and analyze T2DM care mobile apps in the Chinese market, describing their features, and functions, and evaluating the quality of the most popular apps using validated tools.\nMethods: We conducted a comprehensive search in Chinese Android and iOS app stores for T2DM management apps. We downloaded 138 eligible ones for a general review of their key features and function. We also assessed the quality of the top 20 apps from both platforms using the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS) by both researcher and patient.\nResults: A total of 3524 apps were searched. 138 eligible apps were downloaded for general review and 29 popular apps were included for quality assessment. Most apps were designed for patient users (87.0 %) and developed by commercial companies (85.5 %). Common functions included blood glucose monitoring, diabetes education, integration with measuring devices, medication adherence reminders, teleconsultation services, and diabetes risk factor tracking. The researcher’s evaluation yielded an average MARS score of 4.0 out of 5 for popular apps, with subscale scores of functionalities (4.5), aesthetics (4.1), engagement (3.7), and information (3.6). However, patient ratings were lower in functionality (3.5), aesthetics (3.4), and engagement (2.6), and the patient faced difficulties with information-related items. Similar trends were observed in subject quality items.\nConclusion: App developers should engage caregivers, and family members as target users, and involve government agencies as partners to improve T2DM management apps. Future apps should incorporate scientifically proven advanced functions to enhance their effectiveness. The quality assessment highlighted weaknesses in engagement and information and the importance of user-centric approaches in app development.",

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Digital technologies connect young people with health services and resources that support their self-care. The lack of accessible, reliable digital resources tailored to young people with persistent musculoskeletal pain is a significant gap in the health services in Australia. Recognizing the intense resourcing required to develop and implement effective electronic health (eHealth) interventions, the adaptation of extant, proven digital technologies may improve access to pain care with cost and time efficiencies. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to test the acceptability and need for adaptation of extant digital technologies, the painHEALTH website and the iCanCope with Pain app, for use by young Australians with musculoskeletal pain. METHODS: A 3-phased, mixed methods evaluation was undertaken from May 2019 to August 2019 in Australia. Young people aged 15 to 25 years with musculoskeletal pain for >3 months were recruited. Phases were sequential: (1) phase 1, participant testing (3 groups, each of n=5) of co-designed website prototypes compared with a control website (painHEALTH), with user tasks mapped to eHealth quality and engagement criteria; (2) phase 2, participants' week-long use of the iCanCope with Pain app with engagement data captured using a real-time analytic platform (daily check-ins for pain, interference, sleep, mood, physical activity, and energy levels; goal setting; and accessing resources); and (3) phase 3, semistructured interviews were conducted to gain insights into participants' experiences of using these digital technologies. RESULTS: Fifteen young people (12/15, 80% female; mean age 20.5 [SD 3.3] years; range 15-25 years) participated in all 3 phases. The phase 1 aggregated group data informed the recommendations used to guide 3 rapid cycles of prototype iteration. Adaptations included optimizing navigation, improving usability (functionality), and enhancing content to promote user engagement and acceptability. In phase 2, all participants checked in, with the highest frequency of full check-ins attributed to pain intensity (183/183, 100.0%), pain interference (175/183, 95.6%), and mood (152/183, 83.1%), respectively. Individual variability was evident for monitoring progress with the highest frequency of history views for pain intensity (51/183, 32.3%), followed by pain interference (24/183, 15.2%). For the goals set feature, 87% (13/15) of participants set a total of 42 goals covering 5 areas, most frequently for activity (35/42, 83%). For phase 3, metasynthesis of qualitative data highlighted that these digital tools were perceived as youth-focused and acceptable. A total of 4 metathemes emerged: (1) importance of user-centered design to leverage user engagement; (2) website design (features) promoting user acceptability and engagement; (3) app functionality supporting self-management; and (4) the role of wider promotion, health professional digital prescriptions, and strategies to ensure longer-term engagement. CONCLUSIONS: Leveraging extant digital tools, with appropriate user-informed adaptations, can help to build capacity tailored to support young people's self-management of musculoskeletal pain.",

Goals: This paper discusses the application of positive psychology principles and techniques for adoption by various GI providers to initiate early, effective psychological care for patients with GI disorders, saving CBTs for more complex cases. Study/Results: Authors provide a comprehensive framework of patient well-being known as REVAMP, which is consistent with CBT principles, and elaborate on research and interventions that can be adopted within the gastroenterology practice setting. Building positive resources can bolster patients with GI disorders against comorbid psychological and psychiatric distress. Conclusions: Positive psychology interventions can be implemented within gastroenterology practice. Research is necessary to evaluate the efﬁcacy and acceptability of positive psychology interventions among patients with different digestive disorders and baseline psychological characteristics, as well as the feasibility of administration by different clinicians in the gastroenterology practice setting.",

The study findings highlight that behavior change is tied to meanings that point to existential matters, relates to a nexus of life circumstances, and unfolds over long periods of time. By contrast, the technology used by the participants appears mostly to focus on the present target behavior, ignoring its links to the participants’ life “context” and “time,” also providing scarce help for sense-making. Based on these findings, we surface a preliminary “existential model of behavior change,” identify several barriers that may prevent the modification of behavior and propose some design suggestions to overcome them.",

Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy (HDP) negatively impact acute and long-term cardiovascular health, with approximately 16% of all pregnancies affected. With CVD 2-4 times more likely after HDP compared to normotensive pregnancies, effective interventions to promote cardiovascular health are imperative. Given that physical activity (PA) is associated with decreased CVD risk, promotion of this behavior may be a promising approach in a postpartum population affected by HDP. Objective: With postpartum PA interventions after HDP an under explored preventative strategy, we aimed in this study to 1) assess the feasibility and acceptability of a remotely delivered PA intervention for individuals with HDP 3-6 months postpartum and 2) assess changes in average steps per day, skill related to PA behavior, and postpartum blood pressure (BP). Methods: A remotely delivered 14-week health coaching intervention was designed based on prior  formative work to promote PA during the postpartum period after HDP. The health coaching intervention called the Hypertensive disorders of pregnancy Postpartum Exercise Intervention (the HyPE Intervention) was tested for feasibility and acceptability with a single-arm proof-of-concept study design. A total of 19 women who were 3-6 months postpartum HDP, currently inactive, 18 years of age or older, resided in Iowa, and without diabetes, kidney disease, and CVD were enrolled. Feasibility was assessed by the number of sessions attended and acceptability by self-reported satisfaction with the program. Changes in steps achieved per day was measured with an activPAL4 micro, PA behavior skills via validated surveys online, and BP was assessed remotely with a research grade Omron Series 5 BP monitor. Results: Participants at enrollment were on average 30.3 years of age, 4.1 months postpartum, self-identified as Non-Hispanic White (82%), in a committed relationship (94%), and had a bachelor’s degree (53%). A total of 140 of 152 possible health coaching sessions were attended by those who started the intervention (n = 19; 92.1%). Intervention completers (n=17) indicated they were satisfied with the program (100%) and would recommend it to others (100%). Among completers, no significant changes in activPAL measured steps were observed from pre- to post-testing (+138.40, ±1294.00 steps/day; P = 0.75). Significant improvements were observed in PA behavior skills including planning (5.35±4.97, 15.06±3.09, p<0.001) and monitoring of PA levels (7.29±3.44, 13.00±2.45, p<0.001). No significant decreases were observed for systolic (-1.28±3.59 mmHg, Hedge’s g = -0.26, p = 0.16) and diastolic BP (-1.80±5.03 mmHg, Hedge’s g = -0.44, p = 0.12). Conclusions: While PA behaviors did not change, the intervention was found to be feasible and acceptable among this sample of at-risk women. After additional refinement, the intervention should be retested among a larger, more diverse, and less physically active sample. Clinical Trial: Clinical Trials #: NCT06019715",

To address this, initiatives like Exercise is Medicine® aim to promote physical activity in health care systems. However, integrating physical activity counseling into clinical practice faces barriers such as limited reimbursement. Understanding billing practices and reimbursement rates for physical activity counseling is crucial for its integration into health care. Methods: This study used 12 months of billing data from a large midwestern US hospital. Variables included charges, charge amounts, primary payors, reimbursement rates, and denial rates associated with International Classification of Diseases-10 diagnosis codes, and Evaluation and Management billing codes for physical activity counseling. Logistic regression analysis identified factors associated with denial rates. Results: Over 12 months, 19,366 lifestyle-related charges were submitted, totaling $7,842,845. Of these, 5.28% were denied, amounting to $414,446. The most common International Classification of Diseases-10 codes were “obesity” (38.8%) and “sedentary lifestyle” (32.6%), while the most common Evaluation and Management codes were for established outpatient office visits. Charges were mainly submitted to employer-paid insurance (43.5%), Medicaid (22.2%), and Medicare (21.9%). Higher odds of denial were associated with newer patients, shorter visit lengths, and the sedentary lifestyle code. Conclusion: This study provides novel data on the use, reimbursement, and denial rates of physical activity counseling billing codes in a large health care system. Physical activity counseling-related charges are rarely denied by third-party payors. Further research is needed to determine if these findings are generalizable to other US health care systems.",

      "abstract": "Introduction\nPhysical inactivity is a major health risk factor for multiple chronic diseases and early death. Despite evidence supporting diet and physical activity behavioral counseling interventions, physical inactivity is rarely measured or managed in primary care. A need exists to fully explore and demonstrate the value of screening patients for physical inactivity. This study aimed to 1) compare health profiles of patients screened for inactivity versus patients not screened for inactivity, and 2) compare health profiles of inactive, insufficiently active, and active patients as measured by the Exercise Vital Sign screener.\n\nMethods\nThe study sample comprised adult patients attending a well visit from November 1, 2017, through December 1, 2022, at a large midwestern university hospital. We extracted data from electronic medical records on exercise behavior reported by patients using the Exercise Vital Sign (EVS) questionnaire. We extracted data on demographics characteristics, resting pulse, encounters, and disease diagnoses from PCORnet Common Data Model (version 6.1). We used the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index to determine disease burden. We compared patients with complete and valid EVS values (n =7,261) with patients not screened for inactivity (n = 33,445). We conducted further comparisons between screened patients reporting 0 minutes (inactive), 1 to 149 minutes (insufficiently active), or ≥150 minutes (active) minutes per week of moderate-vigorous physical activity.\n\nResults\nPatients screened for inactivity had significantly lower rates of several comorbid conditions, including obesity (P < .001), diabetes (P < .001), and hypertension (P < .001) when compared with unscreened patients. Compared with insufficiently active and inactive patients, active patients had a lower risk of 19 inactivity-related comorbid conditions including obesity (P < .001), depression (P < .001), hypertension (P < .001), diabetes (P < .001), and valvular disease (P < .001).\n\nConclusion\nThese findings suggest inactive and insufficiently active patients are at increased risk for multiple inactivity-related chronic conditions. These findings further support existing recommendations that inactive patients receive or be referred to evidence-based lifestyle behavioral counseling programs.",

When reflective thought occurs, it sometimes leads to negative thought and emotion cycles. To help explain these cycles, we draw from Psychology to introduce the concept of rumination—anxious, perseverative cognition focused on negative aspects of the self—as a result of engaging with personal data. Rumination is an important concept for the Human Computer Interaction community because it can negatively affect users’ well-being and lead to maladaptive use. Thus, preventing and mitigating rumination is beneficial. In this conceptual paper, we differentiate reflection from rumination. We also explain how self-tracking technologies may inadvertently lead to rumination and the implications this has for design. Our goal is to expand self-tracking research by discussing these negative cycles and encourage researchers to consider rumination when studying, designing, and promoting tools to prevent adverse unintended consequences among users.",

      "abstract": "Abstract Some individuals do not limit their self-tracking efforts to passively collecting and observing gathered data about themselves, but rather develop it into forms of self-research and self-experimentation, also called “personal science”. This type of N-of-1 research is relevant to the fields of personal informatics, patient-led research and social studies of science, but as a knowledge generation practice is still poorly understood. To fill this gap, we conducted 22 semi-structured interviews to investigate the intrinsic and extrinsic motivations of individuals engaging in personal science activities, as well as shared goals and values present in self-research communities. Our analysis is based on a conceptual framework that integrates previous approaches in self-research, as well as in connection with citizen science, the scientific ethos and cooperation in peer production. We identify how self-researchers seek to go beyond personal metrics about their health and wellbeing regarding data provided by wearables, are engaged over time by individual involvement in technology and scientific-related activity, and collaborate following similar goals and values when learning and sharing empirical knowledge with peers. In this sense, personal science can be understood as a specific type of citizen science and an example of a more participatory and inclusive scientific culture driven by self-reflection, critical thinking and openness.",

We explore design principles for incorporating personal informatics data like steps, heart rate, or duration in data-driven stickers as a first step towards integrating these data into ephemeral social media. We examine the effect of a sticker's presentation style, domain, domain-relevance, and background through three surveys with 506 total participants.

Data from sensors can be visualized and viewed by the user to increase self-awareness and promote adaptive coping strategies. A capacity to effectively self-regulate negative emotion can mitigate the biological process of inflammation, which has implications for long-term health. Two studies were undertaken utilizing a mobile lifelogging platform to collect cardiovascular data over a week of real-life commuter driving. The first was designed to establish a link between cardiovascular markers of inflammation and the experience of anger during commuter driving in the real world. Results indicated that an ensemble classification model provided an accuracy rate of 73.12% for the binary classification of episodes of high vs. low anger based upon a combination of features derived from driving (e.g. vehicle speed) and cardiovascular psychophysiology (heart rate, heart rate variability, pulse transit time). During the second study, participants interacted with an interactive, geolocated visualisation of vehicle parameters, photographs and cardiovascular psychophysiology collected over two days of commuter driving (pre-test). Data were subsequently collected over two days of driving following their interaction with the dynamic, data visualization (post-test). A comparison of pre- and post-test data revealed that heart rate significantly reduced during episodes of journey impedance after interaction with the data visualization. There was also evidence that heart rate variability increased during the post-test phase, suggesting greater vagal activation and adaptive coping. Subjective mood data were collected before and after each journey, but no statistically significant differences were observed between pre- and post-test periods. The implications of both studies for ambulatory monitoring, user interaction and the capacity of personal informatics to enhance long-term health are discussed.",

Participants completed a 25-item survey about the presence of external, internal, and staircase design features at their worksite. Participants also reported their desk type. General linear models were used to examine relations between the number of features present for each category and physical activity (steps per hour) and sedentary behavior (sitting time per hour).Results:Internal design scores were positively associated with occupational physical activity. Each single item increase in facilitating internal design features was associated with +64.5 steps/hr (p = .045) at work. Workers who reported having a desk job walked 538 fewer steps/hr (p < .01) and sat 17 min more/hr at work than workers who reported not having a desk.Conclusion:These results suggest that internal design features can promote more movement and less sitting at work. Future studies that examine the longitudinal effect of changing internal design features on occupational physical activity and sedentary behaviors are warranted.",

ADHD requires comprehensive treatment; however, lack of communication and integration across multiple points of care is a substantial barrier to progress. Given the chronic and pervasive challenges associated with ADHD, innovative approaches are crucial. We developed the digital health intervention (DHI)—CoolTaCo [Cool Technology Assisting Co-regulation] to address these critical barriers. CoolTaCo uses Patient-Centered Digital Healthcare Technologies (PC-DHT) to promote co-regulation (child/parent), capture patient data, support efficient healthcare delivery, enhance patient engagement, and facilitate shared decision-making, thereby improving access to timely and targeted mental health intervention for children at significant risk for poor outcomes. The present paper will describe our planned protocol to evaluate the efficacy of CoolTaCo via randomized control trial (RCT).\n            \n            \n              Methods/design\n              \n                We will recruit 60 children (ages 8–12) with ADHD who will be randomized to either immediate (\n                n\n                 = 30) or delayed (\n                n\n                 = 30) treatment (i.e., a waitlist control group). Among those randomized to immediate treatment, half will be assigned to DHI (delivered via a smartwatch and smartphone application), the other half to an active control treatment as usual (TAU). Unlike the DHI group, the TAU group will receive the smartwatch with no assigned activities, applications, or interventions on the devices. The intervention period will last 16 weeks; after a participant has been in the delayed treatment group for 16 weeks and has completed the post-waiting period assessment, they will be randomly assigned to either the intervention or active control group. Thus, 30 participants will complete the intervention, and 30 will complete the active control, with half of the total sample completing a waitlist period.\n              \n            \n            \n              Discussion\n              Individuals with ADHD have complex needs. Despite improvement in outcomes following cognitive behavioral therapies (CBT) and pharmaceutical treatment, long-term maintenance is a challenge often not addressed by traditional medical approaches, and, as we described, ineffective approaches to information sharing across points of care create further barriers to progress. Our research will fill a significant gap in translating early treatment investments and gains into long-term, sustainable outcomes.\n              This study was registered as a clinic trial at ClinicalTrials.gov (Digital Health Intervention for Children With ADHD, ID# NCT06456372) on 06/13/2024.",

      "abstract": "Personal informatics (PI) systems are widely used in various domains such as mental health to provide insights from self-tracking data for behavior change. Users are highly interested in examining relationships from the self-tracking data, but identifying causality is still considered challenging. In this study, we design DeepStress, a PI system that helps users analyze contextual factors causally related to stress. DeepStress leverages a quasi-experimental approach to address potential biases related to confounding factors. To explore the user experience of DeepStress, we conducted a user study and a follow-up diary study using participants’ own self-tracking data collected for 6 weeks. Our results show that DeepStress helps users consider multiple contexts when investigating causalities and use the results to manage their stress in everyday life. We discuss design implications for causality support in PI systems.",

Research suggests strategies to address such challenges, but has struggled to translate these strategies into design practice. This study examines translation of insights from personal health informatics research into resources to support designers. Informed by a review of relevant literature, we present our development of a prototype set of design cards intended to support designers in re-thinking potential assumptions about personal health informatics. We examined our design cards in semi-structured interviews, first with 12 student designers and then with 12 health-focused professional designers and researchers. Our results and discussion reveal tensions and barriers designers encounter, the potential for translational resources to inform the design of health-related technologies, and a need to support designers in addressing challenges of knowledge, advocacy, and evidence in designing for health.",

      "abstract": "Increasing availability of personal data opened new possibilities for technologies that support individuals’ reflection, increase their self-awareness, and inform their future choices. Personal informatics, chiefly concerned with investigating individuals’ engagement with personal data, has become an area of active research within Human-Computer Interaction. However, more recent research has argued that personal informatics solutions often place high demands on individuals and require knowledge, skills, and time for engaging with personal data. New advances in Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) can help to reduce the cognitive burden of personal informatics and identify meaningful trends using analytical engines. Furthermore, introducing ML and AI can enable systems that provide more direct support for action, for example through predictions and recommendations. However, there are many open questions as to the design of personal informatics technologies that incorporate ML and AI. In this workshop, we will bring together an interdisciplinary group of researchers in personal informatics, ML, and AI to outline the design space for intelligent personal informatics solutions and develop an agenda for future research in this area.",

To deal with that problem, fitness trackers use derived metrics---scores calculated based on sensor data, e.g. a stress score. This means that part of the agency in interpreting health data is transferred from the user to the tracker. In this paper, we investigate the consequences of that transition and study how derived metrics can be designed to offer an optimal personal informatics experience. We conducted an online survey and a series of interviews which examined a health score (a hypothetical derived metric) at three levels of abstraction. We found that the medium abstraction level led to the highest level of reflection. Further, we determined that presenting the metric without contextual information led to decreased transparency and meaning. Our work contributes guidelines for designing effective derived metrics.",

      "abstract": "Background: Digital health apps are among the most visible facets of the ongoing digital transition in health care, with mental health–focused apps as one of the main therapeutic areas. However, concerns regarding their scientific robustness drove regulators to establish evaluation procedures, with Germany’s Digitale Gesundheitsanwendungen program pioneering in app prescription with costs covered by statutory health insurance. Portugal gathers a set of conditions and requirements that position it as an excellent test bed for digital health apps. Its daunting mental health landscape reinforces the potential interest in new interventions. To understand if they would be acceptable, we need to understand the supply side’s attitudes and perceptions toward them, that is, those of psychiatrists and psychologists.\nObjective: This study aims to understand the attitudes and expectations of psychiatrists and psychologists toward digital mental health apps (DMHAs) in the Portuguese context, as well as perceived benefits, barriers, and actions to support their adoption.\nMethods: We conducted a 2-stage sequential mixed methods study. Stage 1 consisted of a cross-sectional web survey adapted to the Portuguese context that was delivered to mental health professionals and psychologists. Stage 2 complemented the insights of the web survey results with a key opinion leader analysis.\nResults: A total of 160 complete survey responses were recorded, most of which were from psychologists. This is the most extensive study on mental health professionals’ attitudes and perceptions of DMHAs in Portugal. A total of 87.2% (136/156) of the respondents supported the opportunity to prescribe DMHAs. Increased health literacy (139/160, 86.9%), wider adherence to treatment (137/160, 85.6%), and proper disease management (127/160, 79.4%) were the most frequently agreed upon benefits of DMHAs. However, only less than half (68/156, 43.6%) of the respondents planned to prescribe or recommend DMHAs, with psychologists being more favorable than psychiatrists. Professionals faced substantial barriers, such as a lack of information on DMHAs (154/160, 96.3%), the level of initial training effort (115/160, 71.9%), and the need for adjustments of clinical processes and records (113/160, 70.6%). Professionals reported that having more information on the available apps and their suitability for health objectives (151/160, 94.4%), more scientific evidence of the validity of the apps as a health intervention (147/160, 91.9%), and established recommendations of apps by specific clinical guidelines or professional societies (145/160, 90.6%) would be essential to foster adoption.\nConclusions: More information about DMHAs regarding their clinical validity and how they work is necessary so that such an intervention can be adopted in Portugal.

Previous studies have linked sleep deficiency with cognitive decline in older adults. However, there is need for more prospective investigations that focus on specific domains of cognitive function. The present study analysed cross-sectional and prospective associations between self-reported sleep and cognitive function in the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study. Weekday and weekend sleep duration and habitual sleep quality were obtained via questionnaire data. Brief Test of Adult Cognition by Telephone was conducted to assess overall cognitive function, as well as episodic memory and executive function. We found significant trend for both long weekday and weekend sleep (>8 hr) and lower episodic memory scores in the overall sample. Sex-specific cross-sectional analysis demonstrated men with longer weekend sleep duration have lower overall cognitive function scores, and a negative association between weekend sleep and episodic memory scores. Women demonstrated a positive association between weekend sleep duration and executive function scores. There was no prospective significance for overall or sex-specific analysis. Our present results suggest that sleep duration may contribute to cognitive function, and future studies should include objective sleep measurements and focus on the potential cognitive benefits of improving sleep to further elucidate this association.",

The goal of the SOARING (Studying Older Adults and Researching their Information Needs and Goals) Project was to understand older adult personal health information management (PHIM) needs and practices to inform the design of HITs that support older adults.\n\nMaterials and Methods\nDrawing on the Work System Model, we took an ecological approach to investigate PHIM needs and practices of older adults in different residential settings. We conducted in-depth interviews and surveys with adults 60 years of age and older.\n\nResults\nWe performed on-site in-person interview sessions with 88 generally healthy older adults in various settings including independent housing, retirement communities, assisted living, and homelessness. Our analysis revealed 5 key PHIM activities that older adults engage in: seeking, tracking, organizing, sharing health information, and emergency planning. We identified 3 major themes influencing older adults’ practice of PHIM: (1) older adults are most concerned with maintaining health and preventing illness, (2) older adults frequently involve others in PHIM activities, and (3) older adults’ approach to PHIM is situational and context-dependent.\n\nDiscussion\nOlder adults’ approaches to PHIM are dynamic and sensitive to changes in health, social networks, personal habits, motivations, and goals.\n\nConclusions\nPHIM tools that meet the needs of older adults should accommodate the dynamic nature of aging and variations in individual, organizational, and social contexts.",

However, there is little evidence about healthcare providers’ intentions to use such technologies in resource-limited settings. Therefore, this study aimed to assess predicting healthcare providers’ acceptance of electronic personal health record systems.Methods An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 19 July to 23 August 2022 at teaching hospitals in the Amhara regional state of Ethiopia. A total of 638 health professionals participated in the study. Simple random sampling techniques were used to select the study participants. Structural equation modelling analysis was employed using AMOS V.26 software.Result Perceived ease of use had a significant effect on the intention to use electronic personal health records (β=0. 377, p<0.01), perceived usefulness (β=0.104, p<0.05) and attitude (β=0.204, p<0.01); perceived ease of use and information technology experience had a significant effect on perceived usefulness (β=0.077, p<0.05); and digital literacy (β=0.087, p<0.05) and attitude had also a strong effect on intention to use electronic personal health records (β=0.361, p<0.01). The relationship between perceived ease of use and the intention to use was mediated by attitude (β=0.076, p<0.01).Conclusion Perceived ease of use, attitude and digital literacy had a significant effect on the intention to use electronic personal health records. The perceived ease of use had a greater influence on the intention to use electronic personal health record systems. Thus, capacity building and technical support could enhance health providers’ acceptance of using electronic personal health records in Ethiopia.",

PHRs support patient-centered care and patient engagement. To support the achievement of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030 ambitions, the National Transformation program provides a framework to use PHRs in meeting the 3-fold aim for health care—increased access, reduced cost, and improved quality of care—and to provide patient- and person-centered care.

The relationship of predictors (main theory constructs) and moderators (age, gender, and experience with health apps) with the dependent variable (intention to use MNGHA Care) was tested using hierarchical multiple regression.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Of the eligible population, a total of 261 adult patients were included in the analysis. They had a mean age of 35.07 (SD 9.61) years, 50.6 % were male (n=132), 45.2% had university-level education (n=118), and 53.3% had at least 1 chronic medical condition (n=139). The model explained 48.9% of the variance in behavioral intention to use the PHR (P=.38). Performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and positive attitude were significantly associated with behavioral intention to use the PHR (P<.05). Prior experience with health apps moderated the relationship between social influence and behavioral intention to use the PHR (P=.04).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This study contributes to the existing literature on PHR adoption broadly as well as in the context of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia. Understanding which factors are associated with patient adoption of PHRs can guide future development and support the country’s aim of transforming the health care system. Similar to previous studies on PHR adoption, performance expectancy, effort expectancy, and positive attitude are important factors, and practical consideration should be given to support these areas.",

      "abstract": "Rest activity rhythm (RAR) describes the pattern of physical activity and sleep in 24 hours. Disruptions in RAR have been associated with various age-related chronic conditions, including sleep disorders, depression, and increased risk for cognitive decline. Few studies examined if RAR changes from intervention that includes both physical activity and sleep components. This study investigated the effects of an 8-week lifestyle intervention targeting the full 24-hour activity profile (physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep) on RAR. Participants engaged in up to five sessions with a student health coach, viewed three health education videos targeting physical activity, sedentary behavior, and sleep, and received an Acttrust2 activity monitor. A cohort of 26 participants (mean age = 49.3 years, SD = 11.1; 73.1% female) was monitored using wrist-worn Acttrust2 devices for one week pre- and post-intervention to observe changes in RAR. RAR parameters were analyzed using cosinor approach, such as amplitude (maximum activity level), mesor (mean activity level), pseudo-F-statistic (the robustness of RAR), and acrophase (peak activity time). The intervention showed mixed effects on RAR parameters. While not statistically significant, positive changes were observed in amplitude (Cohen’s d=0.24) and mesor (Cohen’s d=0.12). Conversely, the pseudo-F-statistic (Cohen’s d = -0.002) and acrophase (Cohen’s d=-0.02) remained stable post-intervention. Although statistically significant changes in RAR parameters were not observed, encouraging trends suggest the potential for the intervention to influence maximum and mean physical activity level. These findings contribute to our understanding of lifestyle interventions in adults and highlight areas for further research and intervention refinement.",

METHODS This narrative review synthesizes understanding of applied models and digital health technologies, in terms of dementia risk prediction, diagnostic discrimination, prognosis, and progression. Machine learning approaches show evidence of improved predictive power compared to standard clinical risk scores in predicting dementia, and the potential to decompose large numbers of variables into relatively few critical predictors. RESULTS This review focuses on key areas of emerging promise including: emphasis on easier, more transparent data sharing and cohort access; integration of high-throughput biomarker and electronic health record data into modeling; and progressing beyond the primary prediction of dementia to secondary outcomes, for example, treatment response and physical health. DISCUSSION Such approaches will benefit also from improvements in remote data measurement, whether cognitive (e.g., online), or naturalistic (e.g., watch-based accelerometry).",

      "abstract": "Introduction Mobile health (mHealth) is now considered an important approach to extend traditional health services and to meet the growing medical needs. The prescribability of mHealth applications is a complex problem because it depends on a large number of factors and concerns a wide range of disciplines and actors in the industrial, health, normative, and regulatory domains. Objective Our study correlated data from the scientific literature with data on regulatory developments in the United States, the European Union, and France with the aim of identifying the conditions for the prescription of mHealth applications. Methods The search method adopted was the systematic literature review process by Brereton et al. All empirical evidence from the relevant fields of study was gathered and then evaluated to answer our predefined research questions. The WoS and PubMed databases were queried for the period between 1 January 1975 and 30 November 2020. A total of 165 articles (15 with a direct focus and 150 with an indirect focus on mHealth prescribing) were analyzed/cross-referenced. The ScienceDirect database was consulted to complement the collected data when needed. Data published by international and national regulatory bodies were analyzed in light of the scientific data obtained from the WoS, PubMed, and ScienceDirect databases. Results The International Medical Device Regulators Forum has ensured the international structuring of the regulatory field in collaboration with participating countries. The creation and updating of databases have allowed the tracking of medical device versions/upgrades and incidents. The regulatory organizations of the United States, the European Union, and France are currently consulting healthcare personnel, manufacturers, and patients to establish evaluation criteria for usability and quality of instructions for use that take into consideration patients' level of literacy. These organizations are also providing support to manufacturers who wish to file marketing applications. Marketing, privacy, and cybersecurity measures are evolving with developments in technology and state cooperation policies. The prescription of mHealth applications will gain social acceptance only if consistency and coordination are ensured at all stages of the process: from pre-design, through verification of medical effectiveness, to ethical consideration during data collection and use, and on to marketing. Conclusion The conditions for mHealth prescribability include the adaptation of international regulation by the different states, the state provision of marketing support, and the evaluation of mHealth applications. For mHealth to gain social acceptance, increased collaboration among physicians, manufacturers, and \"information technology stakeholders\" is needed. Once this is achieved, MHealth can become the cornerstone of successful health care reform.",

The intervention was tailored to rural men’s preferences based on findings of a needs assessment study. Steps, muscle-strengthening behaviors, muscular endurance, and psychosocial outcomes were measured at baseline and post-intervention. Likert scales, open-ended survey questions, and focus groups were used to assess acceptability. Continuous data were analyzed using a t-test and Wilcoxon signed-ranked test, and dichotomous variables were analyzed using a McNemar test.\n          Results \n          A total of 27 (39 consented, 27% attrition) mostly White, non-Hispanic rural men completed the intervention. On average, participants completed 8.0 ± 4.4 (out of the 11 provided) modules over the 10-wk intervention period, and 15 participants (56%) completed all 11 modules. The proportion of participants engaging in muscle strengthening behavior increased from 18.5% to 69.2% (P = 0.003). Push-up (P < 0.001), sit-up (P = 0.004), and squat (P < 0.001) tests significantly improved. Behavior regulation (Hedges’ g = 1.23, P < 0.05) and physical activity identity (Hedges’ g = 0.85, P < 0.05) increased from baseline to 10 wk. On average, all features were rated at least somewhat helpful.\n          Conclusions \n          The intervention improved rural men’s muscle strengthening behaviors, muscular endurance, behavioral regulation, and physical activity identity, but not steps. Future studies can expand on this work by improving intervention features, such as greater accountability, and comparing the intervention against a control group.",

      "abstract": "Background\n              Congestive heart failure (CHF) is a disease that requires complex management involving multiple medications, exercise, and lifestyle changes. It mainly affects older patients with depression and anxiety, who commonly find management difficult. Existing mobile apps supporting the self-management of CHF have limited features and are inadequately validated.\n            \n            \n              Objective\n              The HeartMan project aims to develop a personal health system that would comprehensively address CHF self-management by using sensing devices and artificial intelligence methods. This paper presents the design of the system and reports on the accuracy of its patient-monitoring methods, overall effectiveness, and patient perceptions.\n            \n            \n              Methods\n              A mobile app was developed as the core of the HeartMan system, and the app was connected to a custom wristband and cloud services. The system features machine learning methods for patient monitoring: continuous blood pressure (BP) estimation, physical activity monitoring, and psychological profile recognition. These methods feed a decision support system that provides recommendations on physical health and psychological support. The system was designed using a human-centered methodology involving the patients throughout development. It was evaluated in a proof-of-concept trial with 56 patients.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Fairly high accuracy of the patient-monitoring methods was observed. The mean absolute error of BP estimation was 9.0 mm Hg for systolic BP and 7.0 mm Hg for diastolic BP. The accuracy of psychological profile detection was 88.6%. The F-measure for physical activity recognition was 71%. The proof-of-concept clinical trial in 56 patients showed that the HeartMan system significantly improved self-care behavior (P=.02), whereas depression and anxiety rates were significantly reduced (P<.001), as were perceived sexual problems (P=.01). According to the Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology questionnaire, a positive attitude toward HeartMan was seen among end users, resulting in increased awareness, self-monitoring, and empowerment.\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              The HeartMan project combined a range of advanced technologies with human-centered design to develop a complex system that was shown to help patients with CHF.

All participants completed the 7-day-long UT, during which they were given the daily tasks of asking Dr. Joy at least 3 questions at any time and place and then giving the chatbot either positive or negative feedback with emoji, using at least one feature of the chatbot, and finally, sending a facilitator all screenshots for the history of the day’s use via KakaoTalk before midnight. One day after the UT completion, all participants were asked to fill out a questionnaire on the evaluation of usability, perceived benefits and risks, intention to seek and share health information on the chatbot, and strengths and weaknesses of its use, as well as demographic characteristics.\n            \n            \n              Results\n              Despite the relatively higher score of ease of learning (EOL), the results of the Spearman correlation indicated that EOL was not significantly associated with usefulness (ρ=0.26; P=.36), ease of use (ρ=0.19; P=.51), satisfaction (ρ=0.21; P=.46), or total usability scores (ρ=0.32; P=.24). Unlike EOL, all 3 subfactors and the total usability had significant positive associations with each other (all ρ>0.80; P<.001). Furthermore, perceived risks exhibited no significant negative associations with perceived benefits (ρ=−0.29; P=.30) or intention to seek (SEE; ρ=−0.28; P=.32) or share (SHA; ρ=−0.24; P=.40) health information on the chatbot via KakaoTalk, whereas perceived benefits exhibited significant positive associations with both SEE and SHA. Perceived benefits were more strongly associated with SEE (ρ=0.94; P<.001) than with SHA (ρ=0.70; P=.004).\n            \n            \n              Conclusions\n              This study provides the potential for the uptake of this newly developed Q&A knowledge database–based KakaoTalk chatbot for obstetric and mental health care. As Dr. Joy had quality contents with both utilitarian and hedonic value, its male and female users could be encouraged to use medical chatbots in a convenient, easy-to-use, and enjoyable manner. To boost their continued usage intention for Dr. Joy, its Q&A sets need to be periodically updated to satisfy user intent by monitoring both male and female user utterances.",

      "abstract": "Background: With an increasing number of digital health apps available in app stores, it is important to assess these technologies reliably regarding their quality. This is done to mitigate the risks associated with their use. There are many different guidelines, methods, and metrics available to assess digital health apps with regard to their quality.\nObjective: This study aimed to give a holistic summary of the current methods and “condition agnostic” frameworks that are broadly applicable for the quality assessment of all digital health apps.\nMethods: A systematic search of literature was conducted on 4 databases: Scopus, PubMed, ACM Digital Library, and IEEE Xplore. We followed the PICOS (Population, Patient, or Problem; Intervention; Comparison; Outcomes; and Study Design) and PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) methodologies when conducting this umbrella review. The search was conducted on January 26, 2024, for review articles published between 2018 and 2023. We identified 4781 candidate papers for inclusion; after title and abstract screening, 39 remained. After full-text analysis, we included 15 review articles in the full review.\nResults: Of the 15 review articles, scoping reviews were the most common (n=6, 40%), followed by systematic reviews (n=4, 27%), narrative reviews (n=4, 27%), and a rapid review (n=1, 7%). A total of 4 (27%) review articles proposed assessment criteria for digital health apps. “Data privacy and/or security” was the most mentioned criterion (n=13, 87%) and “Cost” was the least mentioned criterion (n=1, 7%) for the assessment of digital health apps. The Mobile App Rating Scale was the most frequently used framework for quality assessment of digital health apps.\nConclusions: There is a lack of unity or consolidation across identified frameworks, as most do not meet all the identified criteria from the reviewed articles. Safety concerns associated with the use of digital health apps may be mitigated with the use of quality frameworks.",

The BMD change in the femoral neck at the 24-weeks were signiﬁcantly different between the 2 groups (CON: 1.3 ± 2.7%, EX: 3.1 ± 4.6%, P = .001). Grip strength, sidestep and physical functional domain of HRQoL in the EX group were signiﬁcantly improved compared to the CON.

      "abstract": "Background: There has been a surge in academic and business interest in software as a medical device (SaMD). SaMD enables medical professionals to streamline existing medical practices and make innovative medical processes such as digital therapeutics a reality. Furthermore, SaMD is a billion-dollar market. However, SaMD is not clearly understood as a technological change and emerging industry.\nObjective: This study aims to review the landscape of SaMD in response to increasing interest in SaMD within health systems and regulation. The objectives of the study are to (1) clarify the innovation process of SaMD, (2) identify the prevailing typology of such innovation, and (3) elucidate the underlying mechanisms driving the SaMD innovation process.\nMethods: We collected product information on 581 US Food and Drug Administration–approved SaMDs from the OpenFDA website and 268 company profiles of the corresponding manufacturers from Crunchbase, Bloomberg, PichBook.com, and other company websites. In addition to assessing the metadata of SaMD, we used correspondence and business process analysis to assess the distribution of intended use and how SaMDs interact with other devices in the medical process.\nResults: The current SaMD industry is highly concentrated in medical image processing and radiological analysis. Incumbents in the medical device industry currently lead the market and focus on incremental innovation, whereas new entrants, particularly startups, produce more disruptive innovation. We found that hardware medical device functions as a complementary asset for SaMD, whereas how SaMD interacts with the complementary asset differs according to its intended use. Based on these findings, we propose a regime map that illustrates the SaMD innovation process.\nConclusions: SaMD, as an industry, is nascent and dominated by incremental innovation. The innovation process of the present SaMD industry is shaped by data accessibility, which is key to building disruptive innovation.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To investigate the association between accelerometer-derived physical activity energy expenditure (PAEE) and incident type 2 diabetes (T2D) in a cohort of middle-aged adults and within subgroups. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Data were from 90,096 UK Biobank participants without prevalent diabetes (mean 62 years of age; 57% women) who wore a wrist accelerometer for 7 days. PAEE was derived from wrist acceleration using a population-speciﬁc method validated against doubly labeled water. Logistic regressions were used to assess associations between PAEE, its underlying intensity, and incident T2D, ascertained using hospital episode and mortality data up to November 2020. Models were progressively adjusted for demographic, lifestyle factors, and BMI.\nRESULTS The association between PAEE and T2D was approximately linear (n = 2,018 events). We observed 19% (95% CI 17–21) lower odds of T2D per 5 kJ · kg21 · day21 in PAEE without adjustment for BMI and 11% (9–13) with BMI adjustment. The association was stronger in men than women and weaker in those with obesity and higher genetic susceptibility to obesity. There was no evidence of effect modiﬁcation by genetic susceptibility to T2D or insulin resistance. For a given level of PAEE, odds of T2D were lower among those engaging in more moderate-to-vigorous activity.\nCONCLUSIONS There was a strong linear relationship between PAEE and incident T2D. A difference in PAEE equivalent to an additional daily 20-min brisk walk was associated with 19% lower odds of T2D. The association was broadly similar across population subgroups, supporting physical activity for diabetes prevention in the whole population.",

      "abstract": "Dozens of frameworks have been proposed to assess evidence for digital health interventions (DHIs), but existing frameworks may not facilitate DHI evidence reviews that meet the needs of stakeholder organizations including payers, health systems, trade organizations, and others. These organizations may benefit from a DHI assessment framework that is both rigorous and rapid. Here we propose a framework to assess Evidence in Digital health for EFfectiveness of INterventions with Evaluative Depth (Evidence DEFINED). Designed for real-world use, the Evidence DEFINED Quick Start Guide may help streamline DHI assessment. A checklist is provided summarizing high-priority evidence considerations in digital health. Evidence-to-recommendation guidelines are proposed, specifying degrees of adoption that may be appropriate for a range of evidence quality levels. Evidence DEFINED differs from prior frameworks in its inclusion of unique elements designed for rigor and speed. Rigor is increased by addressing three gaps in prior frameworks. First, prior frameworks are not adapted adequately to address evidence considerations that are unique to digital health. Second, prior frameworks do not specify evidence quality criteria requiring increased vigilance for DHIs in the current regulatory context. Third, extant frameworks rarely leverage established, robust methodologies that were developed for non-digital interventions. Speed is achieved in the Evidence DEFINED Framework through screening optimization and deprioritization of steps that may have limited value. The primary goals of Evidence DEFINED are to a) facilitate standardized, rapid, rigorous DHI evidence assessment in organizations and b) guide digital health solutions providers who wish to generate evidence that drives DHI adoption.",

      "abstract": "Despite the significant advancements in the diagnosis and treatment of hypertension, the burden of hypertension remains a major global health care concern. In Japan, estimates show that more than two-thirds of the population have uncontrolled hypertension, regardless of whether they were taking antihypertensive medication. To improve hypertension management, hypertension guidelines have been developed and updated regularly by hypertension societies across various countries and regions. The Japanese Society of Hypertension (JSH) updated the Guidelines for the Management of Hypertension in 2019 (JSH 2019). The JSH 2019 aims to establish a standard management strategy for hypertension and provide evidence to all health care providers. One of its updated main features is its proposal for multidisciplinary team-based care (TBC) involving physicians, pharmacists, nurses, dietitians, and other health care providers. The TBC will help initiate and intensify the management of hypertension, as well as combat clinical inertia, which is expected to contribute to uncontrolled blood pressure and subsequent development of cardiovascular diseases. This is consistent with the recommendations from recent major guidelines on hypertension management. Moreover, to reduce the evidence–practice gap in hypertension management, it is essential to disseminate the essence of the guidelines and provide hypertension education programs for all health care providers and patients. This review summarizes the points of the JSH 2019-based strategy for improving hypertension management and discusses guidelines for its implementation into actual clinical practice.",

We discuss data security and privacy as a major concern for patients when using mHealth apps. Patients are often not involved in the development of mobile health guidelines, and professionals’ views regarding high-quality health apps may not reflect patients’ views. We discuss efforts to develop guidelines for the development of safe and effective mHealth apps in the US and elsewhere and the role of independent app reviews sites in identifying mHealth apps for patient care. There are only a small number of clinical scenarios where published evidence suggests that mHealth apps may improve patient outcomes.",

      "abstract": "Physical activity is inversely associated with risk of some cancers. The relation with cancer-specific death remains uncertain. Mainly, studies on relationships between physical activity and cancer are based on self-reported physical activity (SPA). Hereby, we examined whether measured cardiorespiratory fitness (CRF) is associated with cancer risk, mortality, and case fatality. We also describe relationships between SPA and these outcomes, and between CRF and SPA. A cohort of 1997 healthy Norwegian men, aged 40–59 years at inclusion in 1972–75, was followed throughout 2012. At baseline, CRF was objectively measured. SPA (leisure time and occupational) was obtained through a questionnaire. Relationships between CRF or SPA, and the outcomes were estimated using Cox regression, adjusted for age, body mass index (BMI), and smoking. Pearson correlation coefficients evaluated agreements between CRF and SPA. During follow-up, 758 men were diagnosed with cancer and 433 cancer deaths occurred. Analyses revealed lower cancer risk (Hazard ratio [HR] 0.85, 95% confidence intervals [CI]: 0.68–1.00), mortality (HR 0.68, 95% CI: 0.53–0.88), and case fatality (HR 0.74, 95% CI: 0.57–0.96), in men with high CRF compared to low CRF. Light leisure time SPA was associated with lower cancer risk (HR 0.70, 95% CI: 0.56–0.86) and mortality (HR 0.64 95% CI: 0.49–0.83), whereas strenuous occupational SPA was associated with higher risks (HR 1.42, 95% CI: 1.13–1.78 and HR 1.45, 95% CI: 1.09–1.93). Correlations between CRF and SPA were 0.351 (P < 0.001) and −0.106 (P < 0.001) for leisure time and occupational SPA, respectively. A high midlife CRF may be beneficial for cancer risk, cancer mortality, and case fatality.",

We created a data extraction template which adapted data elements from the PRISMA guidelines for systematic literature reviews to data elements operationalised for health app-focused reviews. We extracted the data from included health app-focused reviews to describe: (1) which elements of the adapted 'usual' methods of systematic review are used; (2) methods of app appraisal; and (3) reporting of clinical efficacy and recommendations for app use. From 2798 records, the 26 included health app-focused reviews showed incomplete or unclear reporting of review protocol registration; use of reporting guidelines; processes of screening apps; data extraction; and appraisal tools. Reporting of clinical efficacy of apps or recommendations for app use were infrequent.

Methods This systematic review examined digital self-monitoring in behavioral weight loss interventions among adults with overweight or obesity. Six databases (PubMed, Embase, Scopus, PsycInfo, CINAHL, and ProQuest Dissertations & Theses) were searched for randomized controlled trials with interventions ≥ 12 weeks, weight outcomes ≥ 6 months, and outcomes on self-monitoring engagement and their relationship to weight loss. Results Thirty-nine studies from 2009 to 2019 met inclusion criteria. Among the 67 interventions with digital self-monitoring, weight was tracked in 72% of them, diet in 81%, and physical activity in 82%. Websites were the most common self-monitoring modality, followed by mobile applications, wearables, electronic scales, and, finally, text messaging. Few interventions had digital self-monitoring engagement rates ≥ 75% of days. Rates were higher in digital- than in paper-based arms in 21 out of 34 comparisons and lower in just 2. Interventions with counseling had similar rates to standalone interventions. Greater digital self-monitoring was linked to weight loss in 74% of occurrences.

It is essential to combat these negative effects on health by incorporating lifestyle interventions to slow disease progression, such as exercise. We sought to examine the effects of aquatic walking exercise on cardiovascular function, cardiorespiratory capacity [maximal volume of oxygen consumption (V̇o\n              2max\n              )], exercise tolerance [6-min walking distance (6MWD)], physical function, muscular strength, and body composition in patients with PAD.

There were significant group × time interactions ( P < 0.05) after 12 wk for legPWV and HR, which significantly decreased ( P < 0.05) in AQ, and V̇o\n              2max\n              , 6MWD, physical function, and muscular strength, which significantly increased ( P < 0.05) in AQ, compared with no changes in CON. There were no significant differences ( P > 0.05) for BP, ABI, RMR, or flexibility after 12 wk. Interestingly, there was relatively high adherence (84%) to the aquatic walking exercise program in this population. These results suggest that aquatic walking exercise is an effective therapy to reduce arterial stiffness and resting HR and improve cardiorespiratory capacity, exercise tolerance, physical function, and muscular strength in patients with PAD.\n            \n            NEW & NOTEWORTHY The results of this study reveal for the first time that aquatic walking exercise can decrease arterial stiffness and improve exercise tolerance, cardiorespiratory capacity, and muscular strength in patients with peripheral artery disease (PAD). Aquatic walking exercise training demonstrates relatively high exercise adherence in this population. Aquatic walking exercise training may be a useful therapeutic intervention for improving physical function in patients with PAD.",

Physical activity was assessed at baseline using the Seven-Day Physical Activity Recall questionnaire, and patients were followed until April 1, 2016, at which time 93 of 103 had died.\nResults—Greater physical activity level at baseline was significantly associated with longer subsequent survival time in a Cox proportional hazards model (hazard ratio, HR=0.90; 95% CI=0.84, 0.97, p<.01). Engaging in one additional hour per day of moderate activity reduced the hazard of subsequent mortality by 23% (HR=0.77, 95% CI=0.65, 0.92, p<.01). These results remained significant even after controlling for demographic, medical, cancer, depression and cortisol variables (HR=0.91, CI: 0.84–0.99, p<.05).\nConclusions—Women with advanced breast cancer who engaged in physical activity for 1 or more hours per day at baseline had an increased likelihood of survival compared to those who exercised less than 1 hour per day.",

      "abstract": "The mental health beneﬁts of resistance training (RT) alone or beyond those provided by aerobic physical activity (PA) are unclear. This study aimed to determine the association between meeting recommendations for aerobic PA and/or RT, and symptoms of depression and/or anxiety. Participants were Australian female members of the 10,000 Steps project (n = 5180, 50.0 ± 11.5 years). Symptoms of depression and anxiety were determined using the Depression Anxiety Stress Score. Participants were grouped as ‘depression only’, ‘anxiety only’, ‘co-occurring depression and anxiety’ or ‘neither depression nor anxiety’ based on relevant subscale score (cut-points: depression≥14 points, anxiety≥10 points). The International Physical Activity Questionnaire-Long Form questionnaire was used to determine PA with an additional item to specify RT frequency. Participants were classiﬁed as adhering to ‘aerobic PA only’ (≥150 min PA/week), ‘RT only’ (RT ≥ 2 days/week), ‘aerobic PA + RT’ (≥150 min PA/week+RT ≥ 2 days/week), or ‘neither aerobic PA nor RT’ (< 150 min PA/week +RT < 2 days/week). Adjusted relative risk ratios (RRR [95%CI]) were estimated using multinomial logistic regression models. Relative to the ‘neither PA nor RT’ (n = 2215), the probabilities of ‘depression only’ (n = 317) and ‘co-occurring depression and anxiety’ (n = 417) were lower for the ‘aerobic PA only’ (n = 1590) (RRR = 0.74 [0.56–0.97] and RRR = 0.76 [0.59–0.97] respectively), and ‘both PA + RT’ (n = 974) groups (RRR = 0.61 [0.43–0.86] and RRR = 0.47 [0.33–0.67] respectively). There were no associations between adhering to one or both recommendations and ‘anxiety only’ (n = 317), or between ‘RT only’ (n = 401) and depression and/or anxiety. Prevention and treatment strategies including both aerobic PA and RT may provide additional beneﬁts for depression with or without comorbid anxiety.",

The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of physical activity on the cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes of MHO. The study included participants who were followed for 10 years and recruited from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES), a population-based cohort study. Participants with previously recorded CVDs or cancer, or who had received steroids or anticoagulants at baseline were excluded. A total of 8144 participants (3,942 men and 4,202 women) fulfilled inclusion criteria. In a multivariate Cox regression model adjusted for age and sex, MHO participants were not at elevated risk of CVD compared with their metabolically healthy non-obese (MHNO) counterparts (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.96–1.71), although both the non-obese (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.19–1.90) and obese (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.48–2.30) participants with metabolic abnormalities were at elevated risk. However, in the subgroup analysis by physical activity, physically inactive MHO participants had a significantly higher HR for CVD events compared to active MHNO participants (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.03–2.30), while active MHO participants were not at elevated risk (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.70–1.89). Physically inactive MHO participants had significantly increased risk of CVD compared to physically active MHNO participants whereas physically active MHO participants did not.",

      "abstract": "Background: A diverse array of digital technologies are available to children and young people living in the Global North to monitor, manage, and promote their health and well-being.\nObjective: This article provides a narrative literature review of the growing number of social research studies published over the past decade that investigate the types of digital technologies used by children and young people in the Global North, in addition to investigating which of these technologies they find most useful or not useful. Key findings as well as major gaps and directions for future research are identified and discussed.\nMethods: A comprehensive search of relevant publications listed in Google Scholar was conducted, supported by following citation trails of these publications. The findings are listed under type of digital technology used for health: cross-media, internet, social media, apps and wearable devices, sexual health support and information, and mental health support and information.\nResults: Many young people in the Global North are active users of digital health technologies. However, it is notable that they still rely on older technologies, such as websites and search engines, to find information. Apps and platforms that may not have been specifically developed for young people as digital health resources often better suit their needs. Young people appreciate the ready availability of information online, the opportunities to learn more about their bodies and health states, and the opportunities to learn how to improve their health and physical fitness. They enjoy being able to connect with peers, and they find emotional support and relief from distress by using social media platforms, YouTube, and online forums. Young people can find the vast reams of information available to them difficult to navigate. They often look to trusted adults to help them make sense of the information they find online and to provide alternative sources of information and support. Face-to-face interactions with these trusted providers remain important to young people. Risks and harms that young people report from digital health use include becoming overly obsessed with their bodies’ shape and size when using self-tracking technologies and comparing their bodies with the social media influencers they follow.\nConclusions: Further details on how young people are using social media platforms and YouTube as health support resources and for peer-to-peer sharing of information, including attention paid to the content of these resources and the role played by young social media influencers and microcelebrities, would contribute important insights to this body of literature. The role played by visual media, such as GIFs (Graphics Interchange Format) and memes, and social media platforms that have recently become very popular with young people (eg, Snapchat and TikTok) in health-related content creation and sharing requires more attention by social researchers seeking to better understand young people’s use of digital devices and software for health and fitness.",

The business model along with physician payment models are crucial drivers for the adoption of innovations. In the U.S., physician payment is mostly codified in the Current Procedural Terminology (CPT). Until recently, CPT codes related to digital medicine activities were mainly limited to telephone services. To embrace the evolving implementation of the various modalities of digital medicine, the American Medical Association (AMA) determined that a more comprehensive codeset is needed. Thus, the Digital Medicine Payment Advisory Group (DMPAG) was initiated in late 2016. Since then, the DMPAG has achieved a significant and measurable impact on digital medicine intervention adoption by introducing CPT codes for remote physiologic monitoring, remote therapeutic monitoring, artificial intelligence, and other digital innovations.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Across the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) follow-up, cumulative diabetes incidence remained lower in the lifestyle compared with the placebo and metformin randomized groups and could not be explained by weight. Collection of self-reported physical activity (PA) (yearly) with cross-sectional objective PA (in follow-up) allowed for examination of PA and its long-term impact on diabetes prevention. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Yearly self-reported PA and diabetes assessment and oral glucose tolerance test results (fasting glucose semiannually) were collected for 3,232 participants with one accelerometry assessment 11–13 years after randomization (n 5 1,793). Mixed models determined PA differences across treatment groups. The association between PA and diabetes incidence was examined using Cox proportional hazards models.\nRESULTS There was a 6% decrease (Cox proportional hazard ratio 0.94 [95% CI 0.92, 0.96]; P < 0.001) in diabetes incidence per 6 MET-h/week increase in time-dependent PA for the entire cohort over an average of 12 years (controlled for age, sex, baseline PA, and weight). The effect of PA was greater (12% decrease) among participants less active at baseline (<7.5 MET-h/week) (n 5 1,338) (0.88 [0.83, 0.93]; P < 0.0001), with stronger ﬁndings for lifestyle participants. Lifestyle had higher cumulative PA compared with metformin or placebo (P < 0.0001) and higher accelerometry total minutes per day measured during follow-up (P 5 0.001 and 0.047). All associations remained signiﬁcant with the addition of weight in the models.\nCONCLUSIONS PA was inversely related to incident diabetes in the entire cohort across the study, with cross-sectional accelerometry results supporting these ﬁndings. This highlights the importance of PA within lifestyle intervention efforts designed to prevent diabetes and urges health care providers to consider both PA and weight when counseling high-risk patients.",

      "abstract": "Rheumatology faces a critical shortage of health-care professionals, exacerbated by an ageing patient population and escalating costs, resulting in widening gaps in care. Exponential advances in digital health technologies (DHTs) in the past 5 years offer new opportunities to address these challenges and could contribute to overall improved health care. However, keeping pace with innovations and integrating them into clinical practice can be challenging. This Review explores the transformative potential of DHTs for rheumatology in reshaping the entire patient pathway and redefining the roles of patients and providers, and discusses the potential barriers to DHT integration. Key technologies, such as large language models, clinical decision-support systems, digital therapeutics, electronic patient-reported outcomes, digital biomarkers, robots, self-sampling devices and artificial intelligence-based scribes, can be implemented along the patient pathway. A digital-first hybrid stepped-care patient pathway could combine in-person and remote care, enabling personalized and continuous monitoring through a digital safety net. The potential benefits and risks of transforming the traditional patient–provider relationship into a digital health triad with technology are discussed. Collaborative efforts are needed to navigate the evolving digital health landscape and harness the potential of DHTs to improve rheumatology care.",

It also quantifies children’s heterogeneous game play patterns using game telemetry and determines the effects of these patterns on players’ food choices.\nMethods: We analyzed data from a randomized controlled trial (RCT) involving 104 children, aged 10 to 11 years, randomly assigned to the treatment group (played fooya!, a dietary mobile game developed by one of the authors) or the control group (played Uno, a board game without dietary education). Children played the game for 20 minutes each in two sessions. After playing the game in each session, the children were asked to choose 2 out of 6 food items (3 healthy and 3 unhealthy choices). The number of healthy choices in both sessions was used as the major outcome. We first compared the choice and identification of healthy foods between treatment and control groups using statistical tests. Next, using game telemetry, we determined the variability in game play patterns by quantifying game play measures and modeled the process of game playing at any level across all students as a Markov chain. Finally, correlation tests and regression models were used to establish the relationship between game play measures and actual food choices.\nResults: We saw a significant main effect of the mobile game on number of healthy foods actually chosen (treatment 2.48, control 1.10; P&lt;.001; Cohen d=1.25) and identified (treatment 7.3, control 6.94; P=.048; Cohen d=.25). A large variation was observed in children’s game play patterns. Children played an average of 15 game levels in 2 sessions, with a range of 2 to 23 levels. The greatest variation was noted in the proportion of scoring activities that were highly rewarded, with an average of 0.17, ranging from 0.003 to 0.98. Healthy food choice was negatively associated with the number of unhealthy food facts that children read in the game (Kendall τ=–.32, P=.04), even after controlling for baseline food preference.\nConclusions: A mobile video game embedded with implicit learning components showed a strong positive impact on children’s food choices immediately following the game. Game telemetry captured children’s different play patterns and was associated with behavioral outcomes. These results have implications for the design and use of mobile games as an intervention to improve health behaviors, such as the display of unhealthy food facts during game play. Longitudinal RCTs are needed to assess long-term impact.\nTrial Registration: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT04082195; https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04082195, registered retrospectively.",

      "abstract": "Recent innovations in digital technology have enabled the simultaneous accumulation, and the linking and analysis of timeseries big data relating to several factors that inﬂuence blood pressure (BP), including biological indicators, physical activity, and environmental information. Various approaches can be used to monitor BP: in the ofﬁce/clinic; at home; 24-h ambulatory recording; or with wearable and cufﬂess devices. Of these, home BP monitoring is a reliable and convenient method, and is recommended for hypertension management by current national and international guidelines. This recommendation is based on evidence showing that home BP is an important predictor of cardiovascular, cerebrovascular and kidney disease in patients with hypertension. In addition, lifetime personalized health record (PHR)-based home BP with telemonitoring combined with co-interventions has been shown to lower BP more effectively than the traditional approach based on ofﬁce BP. Thus, home BP represents a key metric for personalized anticipation medicine, from digital healthcare to digital medicine. This paper summarizes the latest evidence on home BP monitoring and proposes a Hypertension Cardiovascular Outcome Prevention and Evidence in Asia (HOPE Asia) Network consensus on a home BP-centered approach to the management of hypertension.",

The most important remaining research issues include the identification of patients likely to respond to this therapeutic approach and the development of clinical efficacy indices.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Poor fitness in middle age is a risk factor for heart failure, particularly heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction. The development of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction is likely mediated through increased left ventricular (LV) stiffness, a consequence of sedentary aging. In a prospective, parallel group, randomized controlled trial, we examined the effect of 2 years of supervised highintensity exercise training on LV stiffness.\nMETHODS: Sixty-one (48% male) healthy, sedentary, middle-aged participants (53±5 years) were randomly assigned to either 2 years of exercise training (n=34) or attention control (control; n=27). Right heart catheterization and 3-dimensional echocardiography were performed with preload manipulations to define LV end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships and Frank-Starling curves. LV stiffness was calculated by curve fit of the diastolic pressure-volume curve. Maximal oxygen uptake (V. o 2max) was measured to quantify changes in fitness.\nRESULTS: Fifty-three participants completed the study. Adherence to prescribed exercise sessions was 88±11%. V. o 2max increased by 18% (exercise training: pre 29.0±4.8 to post 34.4±6.4; control: pre 29.5±5.3 to post 28.7±5.4, group×time P<0.001) and LV stiffness was reduced (right/downward shift in the end-diastolic pressure-volume relationships; preexercise training stiffness constant 0.072±0.037 to postexercise training 0.051±0.0268, P=0.0018), whereas there was no change in controls (group×time P<0.001; pre stiffness constant 0.0635±0.026 to post 0.062±0.031, P=0.83). Exercise increased LV end-diastolic volume (group×time P<0.001), whereas pulmonary capillary wedge pressure was unchanged, providing greater stroke volume for any given filling pressure (loading×group×time P=0.007).\nCONCLUSIONS: In previously sedentary healthy middle-aged adults, 2 years of exercise training improved maximal oxygen uptake and decreased cardiac stiffness. Regular exercise training may provide protection against the future risk of heart failure with a preserved ejection fraction by preventing the increase in cardiac stiffness attributable to sedentary aging.",

      "abstract": "High-impact exercise can improve femoral neck bone mass but ﬁndings in postmenopausal women have been inconsistent and there may be concern at the effects of high-impact exercise on joint health. We investigated the effects of a high-impact exercise intervention on bone mineral density (BMD), bone mineral content (BMC), and section modulus (Z) as well as imaging biomarkers of osteoarthritis (OA) in healthy postmenopausal women. Forty-two women aged 55 to 70 years who were at least 12 months postmenopausal were recruited. The 6-month intervention consisted of progressive, unilateral, high-impact exercise incorporating multidirectional hops on one randomly assigned exercise leg (EL) for comparison with the contralateral control leg (CL). Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) was used to measure BMD, BMC, and Z of the femoral neck. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the knee joint was used to analyze the biochemical composition of articular cartilage using T2 relaxometry and to analyze joint pathology associated with OA using semiquantitative analysis. Thirty-ﬁve participants (61.7 4.3 years) completed the intervention with a mean adherence of 76.8% 22.5%. Femoral neck BMD, BMC, and Z all increased in the EL (+0.81%, +0.69%, and +3.18%, respectively) compared to decreases in the CL (−0.57%, −0.71%, and −0.75%: all interaction effects p < 0.05). There was a signiﬁcant increase in mean T2 relaxation times (main effect of time p = 0.011) but this did not differ between the EL and CL, indicating no global effect. Semiquantitative analysis showed high prevalence of bone marrow lesions (BML) and cartilage defects, especially in the patellofemoral joint (PFJ), with no indication that the intervention caused pathology progression. In conclusion, a high-impact exercise intervention that requires little time, cost, or specialist equipment improved femoral neck BMD with no negative effects on knee OA imaging biomarkers. Unilateral high-impact exercise is a feasible intervention to reduce hip fracture risk in healthy postmenopausal women. © 2019 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research.",

This study examined the association of muscle-strengthening activities with the risk of T2D in women.\nMethodsandFindings: We prospectively followed up 99,316 middle-aged and older women for 8 years from the Nurses’ Health Study ([NHS] aged 53–81 years, 2000–2008) and Nurses’ Health Study II ([NHSII] aged 36–55 years, 2001–2009), who were free of diabetes, cancer, and cardiovascular diseases at baseline. Participants reported weekly time spent on resistance exercise, lower intensity muscular conditioning exercises (yoga, stretching, toning), and aerobic moderate and vigorous physical activity (MVPA) at baseline and in 2004/2005. Cox regression with adjustment for major determinants for T2D was carried out to examine the influence of these types of activities on T2D risk. During 705,869 person years of follow-up, 3,491 incident T2D cases were documented. In multivariable adjusted models including aerobic MVPA, the pooled relative risk (RR) for T2D for women performing 1–29, 30–59, 60–150, and .150 min/week of total muscle-strengthening and conditioning activities was 0.83, 0.93, 0.75, and 0.60 compared to women reporting no muscle-strengthening and conditioning activities (p,0.001 for trend). Furthermore, resistance exercise and lower intensity muscular conditioning exercises were each independently associated with lower risk of T2D in pooled analyses. Women who engaged in at least 150 min/week of aerobic MVPA and at least 60 min/week of muscle-strengthening activities had substantial risk reduction compared with inactive women (pooled RR = 0.33 [95% CI 0.29–0.38]). Limitations to the study include that musclestrengthening and conditioning activity and other types of physical activity were assessed by a self-administered questionnaire and that the study population consisted of registered nurses with mostly European ancestry.\nConclusions:Our study suggests that engagement in muscle-strengthening and conditioning activities (resistance exercise, yoga, stretching, toning) is associated with a lower risk of T2D. Engagement in both aerobic MVPA and musclestrengthening type activity is associated with a substantial reduction in the risk of T2D in middle-aged and older women.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdInactive older ($60 years of age) participants (N = 10) were recruited from the community and were nonsmoking, with a BMI ,35 kg/m2 and a fasting blood glucose concentration between 105 and 125 mg dL21. Participants completed three randomly ordered exercise protocols spaced 4 weeks apart. Each protocol comprised a 48-h stay in a whole-room calorimeter, with the ﬁrst day serving as the control day. On the second day, participants engaged in either 1) postmeal walking for 15 min or 45 min of sustained walking performed at 2) 10:30 A.M. or 3) 4:30 P.M. All walking was on a treadmill at an absolute intensity of 3 METs. Interstitial glucose concentrations were determined over 48 h with a continuous glucose monitor. Substrate utilization was measured continuously by respiratory exchange (VCO2/VO2).\nRESULTSdBoth sustained morning walking (127 6 23 vs. 118 6 14 mg dL21) and postmeal walking (129 6 24 vs. 116 6 13 mg dL21) signiﬁcantly improved 24-h glycemic control relative to the control day (P , 0.05). Moreover, postmeal walking was signiﬁcantly (P , 0.01) more effective than 45 min of sustained morning or afternoon walking in lowering 3-h postdinner glucose between the control and experimental day.\nCONCLUSIONSdShort, intermittent bouts of postmeal walking appear to be an effective way to control postprandial hyperglycemia in older people.",

      "abstract": "Background: Although physical activity has been consistently associated with reduced breast cancer mortality, evidence is largely based on data collected at one occasion. We examined how pre- and postdiagnosis physical activity was associated with survival outcomes in high-risk breast cancer patients. Methods: Included were 1340 patients enrolled in the Diet, Exercise, Lifestyle and Cancer Prognosis (DELCaP) Study, a prospective study of lifestyle and prognosis ancillary to a SWOG clinical trial (S0221). Activity before diagnosis, during treatment, and at 1- and 2-year intervals after enrollment was collected. Patients were categorized according to the Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans as meeting the minimum guidelines (yes/no) and incrementally as inactive, low active, moderately active (meeting the guidelines), or high active. Results: In joint-exposure analyses, patients meeting the guidelines before and 1 year after diagnosis experienced statistically signiﬁcant reductions in hazards of recurrence (hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 0.59, 95% conﬁdence interval [CI] ¼ 0.42 to 0.82) and mortality (HR ¼ 0.51, 95% CI ¼ 0.34–0.77); associations were stronger at 2-year follow-up for recurrence (HR ¼ 0.45, 95% CI ¼ 0.31 to 0.65) and mortality (HR ¼ 0.32, 95% CI ¼ 0.19 to 0.52). In time-dependent analyses, factoring in activity from all time points, we observed striking associations with mortality for low- (HR ¼ 0.41, 95% CI ¼ 0.24 to 0.68), moderate- (HR ¼ 0.42, 95% CI ¼ 0.23 to 0.76), and high-active patients (HR ¼ 0.31, 95% CI ¼ 0.18 to 0.53). Conclusions: Meeting the minimum guidelines for physical activity both before diagnosis and after treatment appears to be associated with statistically signiﬁcantly reduced hazards of recurrence and mortality among breast cancer patients. When considering activity from all time points, including during treatment, lower volumes of regular activity were associated with similar overall survival advantages as meeting and exceeding the guidelines.",

      "abstract": "This perspective article explores the challenges and potential of using speech as a biomarker in clinical settings, particularly when constrained by the small clinical datasets typically available in such contexts. We contend that by integrating insights from speech science and clinical research, we can reduce sample complexity in clinical speech AI models with the potential to decrease timelines to translation. Most existing models are based on high-dimensional feature representations trained with limited sample sizes and often do not leverage insights from speech science and clinical research. This approach can lead to overfitting, where the models perform exceptionally well on training data but fail to generalize to new, unseen data. Additionally, without incorporating theoretical knowledge, these models may lack interpretability and robustness, making them challenging to troubleshoot or improve post-deployment. We propose a framework for organizing health conditions based on their impact on speech and promote the use of speech analytics in diverse clinical contexts beyond cross-sectional classification. For high-stakes clinical use cases, we advocate for a focus on explainable and individually-validated measures and stress the importance of rigorous validation frameworks and ethical considerations for responsible deployment. Bridging the gap between AI research and clinical speech research presents new opportunities for more efficient translation of speech-based AI tools and advancement of scientific discoveries in this interdisciplinary space, particularly if limited to small or retrospective datasets.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To evaluate whether sedentary time (ST) and/or sedentary behavior patterns are related to incident diabetes in the U.S.’s oldest age-groups. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Women without physician-diagnosed diabetes (n 5 4,839, mean 6 SD age 5 79 6 7 years) wore accelerometers for ‡4 days and were followed up to 6 years for selfreported newly diagnosed diabetes requiring treatment with medications. Hazard ratios (HRs) for incident diabetes were estimated across quartiles of accelerometermeasured ST and mean bout duration with use of Cox proportional hazards models. We conducted isotemporal substitution analyses using Cox regression and tested associations with risk for diabetes after statistically replacing ST with light physical activity (PA) or moderate-to-vigorous PA (MVPA) and after replacing light PA with MVPA.\nRESULTS During 20,949 person-years, 342 diabetes cases were identiﬁed. Women in ST quartile (Q)2, Q3, and Q4 (vs. Q1) had incident diabetes HR 1.20 (95% CI 0.87–1.65), 1.33 (0.97–1.82), and 1.21 (0.86–1.70); Ptrend 5 0.04. Respective HRs following additional adjustment for BMI and MVPA were 1.04 (95% CI 0.74–1.47), 1.04 (0.72–1.50), and 0.85 (0.56–1.29); Ptrend 5 0.90. Fully adjusted isotemporal substitution results indicated that each 30 min of ST replaced with MVPA (but not light PA) was associated with 15% lower risk for diabetes (HR 0.85 [95% CI 0.75–0.96]; P 5 0.01); the HR for replacing 30 min of light PA with MVPA was 0.85 (95% CI 0.73–0.98); P 5 0.03. Mean bout duration was not associated with incident diabetes.\nCONCLUSIONS Statistically replacing ST or light PA with MVPA was associated with lower diabetes risk in older women. While reducing ST is important for several health outcomes, results indicate that to reduce diabetes risk among older adults, the primary public health focus should be on increasing MVPA.",

      "abstract": "There is a paucity of information on associations between speciﬁc types of physical activity and fracture risk at different sites in otherwise healthy postmenopausal women. Therefore, we examined risk of fracture at seven different sites associated with seven different types of physical activity in the population-based prospective UK Million Women Study. A total of 371,279 postmenopausal women (mean age 59.8 years), rating their health as good or excellent and reporting participation in walking, cycling, gardening, doing housework, yoga, dance, and sports club activities, were followed for site-speciﬁc incident fracture through record linkage to national databases on day-case and overnight hospital admissions. Cox regression yielded adjusted relative risks (RRs) and, because of the large number of statistical tests done, 99% conﬁdence intervals (CIs) for fracture at seven different sites in relation to seven different physical activities. During an average follow-up of 12 years, numbers with a ﬁrst site-speciﬁc fracture were as follows: humerus (2341), forearm (1238), wrist (7358), hip (4354), femur (not neck) (617), lower leg (1184), and ankle (3629). For upper limb fractures there was signiﬁcant heterogeneity across the seven activity types (test for heterogeneity p = 0.004), with gardening more than 1 hour/week associated with a lower risk (RR = 0.91; 99% CI, 0.86 to 0.96; p < 0.0001), whereas cycling more than 1 hour/ week was associated with an increased risk (RR = 1.11; 99% CI, 1.00 to 1.23; p = 0.008). For fractures of the lower limb (including hip) there was no signiﬁcant heterogeneity by type of activity, with signiﬁcant approximately 5% to 15% reductions in risk associated with most activities, except cycling. For hip fractures, there was no signiﬁcant heterogeneity by type of activity, but with signiﬁcant 15% to 20% reductions in risk associated with walking for 1 hour/day and participating in yoga and sporting activities. Physical activity is a modiﬁable risk factor for fracture, but the effects differ between different types of activities and different fracture sites. © 2019 The Authors.

      "abstract": "Background: In the earlier randomized controlled Physical Activity during Cancer Treatment (PACT) study, we found beneficial effects of an 18-week supervised exercise program on fatigue in patients with newly diagnosed breast or colon cancer undergoing adjuvant treatment. The present study assessed long-term effects of the exercise program on levels of fatigue and physical activity 4 years after participation in the PACT study.\nMethods: The original study was a two-armed, multicenter randomized controlled trial comparing an 18-week supervised exercise program to usual care among 204 breast cancer patients and 33 colon cancer patients undergoing adjuvant treatment. Of the 237 PACT participants, 197 participants were eligible and approached to participate in the 4-year post-baseline measurements, and 128 patients responded. We assessed fatigue and physical activity levels at 4 years post-baseline and compared this to levels at baseline, post-intervention (18 weeks post-baseline), and at 36 weeks post-baseline.\nResults: Intention-to-treat mixed linear effects model analyses showed that cancer patients in the intervention group reported significantly higher moderate-to-vigorous total physical activity levels (141.46 min/week (95% confidence interval (CI) 1.31, 281.61, effect size (ES) = 0.22) after 4 years compared to the usual care group. Furthermore, cancer patients in the intervention group tended to experience less physical fatigue at 4 years postbaseline compared to the usual care group (− 1.13, 95% CI –2.45, 0.20, ES = 0.22), although the result was not statistically significant.\nConclusion: Patients with breast or colon cancer who participated in the 18-week exercise intervention showed significant higher levels of moderate-to-vigorous total physical activity levels and a tendency towards lower physical fatigue levels 4 years post-baseline. Our result indicate that exercising during chemotherapy is a promising strategy for minimizing treatment-related side effects, both short and long term.

One of the main goals of caring for patients with heart failure is to improve their quality of life.\nObjective: The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of the use of a smartphone-based app on the quality of life of patients with heart failure.\nMethods: This randomized controlled clinical trial with a control group was conducted from June to October 2018 in an urban hospital. In this study, 120 patients with heart failure hospitalized in cardiac care units were randomly allocated to control and intervention groups. Besides routine care, patients in the intervention group received a smartphone-based app and used it every day for 3 months. Both the groups completed the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire before entering the study and at 3 months after entering the study. Data were analyzed using the SPSS software V.16.\nResults: The groups showed statistically significant differences in the mean scores of quality of life and its dimensions after the intervention, thereby indicating a better quality of life in the intervention group (P<.001). The effect size of the intervention on the quality of life was 1.85 (95% CI 1.41-2.3). Moreover, the groups showed statistically significant differences in the changes in the quality of life scores and its dimensions (P<.001).\nConclusions: Use of a smartphone-based app can improve the quality of life in patients with heart failure. The results of our study recommend that digital apps be used for improving the management of patients with heart failure.\nTrial Registration: Iranian Registry of Clinical Trials IRCT2017061934647N1; https://www.irct.ir/trial/26434",

This randomized controlled trial examined the effects of eight weeks of ecologically-valid, guidelines-based RET, compared to a wait-list control, on depressive symptoms among 55 young adults (26±5y; 36 female) with and without subclinical, or analogue, Generalized Anxiety Disorder (AGAD; Psychiatric Diagnostic Screening Questionnaire GAD subscale ≥6 and Penn State Worry Questionnaire ≥45) and Major Depressive Disorder (AMDD). Following a three-week familiarization period, participants completed one-on-one, twice-weekly RET sessions. The 16-item, self-reported Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptomatology (QIDS) assessed depressive symptoms. RM-ANCOVAs examined between-group differences, and significant interactions were decomposed with simple effects analysis. Hedges’ d effect sizes (95%CI) quantified the magnitude of differences in change between groups across time. Stratified analyses were conducted among subsamples with AMDD and AGAD. There were no baseline depressive symptom differences between groups. Attendance was 83%, and compliance was 80%. RET induced statistically significant, clinicallymeaningful, large-magnitude reductions in depressive symptoms from baseline to week eight in the total (d = 1.01; [95%CI: 0.44–1.57]), AMDD (d = 1.71; [95%CI: 0.96–2.46]), and AGAD (d = 1.39; [95%CI: 0.55–2.24]) samples.

      "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Increased levels of inflammation are associated with many diseases, including cancer. Physical activity can lower breast cancer risk as well as levels of inflammation. The Women In Steady Exercise Research (WISER) Sister trial was a randomized controlled trial that investigated the effects of a dosed, moderate to vigorous, aerobic exercise intervention on levels of inflammation in premenopausal women who were at high risk of developing breast cancer. METHODS: Participants were randomized to control (<75 minutes per week; 41 patients), low-dose exercise (150 minutes per week; 38 patients), or high-dose exercise (300 minutes per week; 37 patients) groups. The 5-menstrual cycles–long, home-based treadmill exercise intervention gradually increased in minutes per week and intensity up to a maximum of 80% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate. Blood was collected at baseline and at follow-up and assayed for chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), interleukin 10 (IL-10), interleukin 12 (IL-12), and tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α). RESULTS: A linear dose-response relationship was observed for the proinflammatory biomarkers CCL2 (%Δ of −5.44% in the control group, −0.03% in the low-dose exercise group, and 1.54% in the high-dose exercise group), IL-12 (%Δ of −21.5% in the control group, 38.2% in the low-dose exercise group, and 25.8% in the high-dose exercise group,) and TNF-α (%Δ of −4.69% in the control group, 9.51% in the low-dose exercise group, and 15.7% in the high-dose exercise group) but not for the anti-inflammatory biomarker IL-10 (%Δ of 5.05% in the control group, 6.05% in the low-dose exercise group, and 10.6% in the high-dose exercise group). For IL-12 and TNF-α, the percentage change was significantly higher in the low-dose (IL-12: P < .001; and TNF-α: P = .01) and high-dose (IL-12: P < .001; and TNF-α: P < .001) exercise groups compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise appeared to increase levels of proinflammatory biomarkers in a dose-dependent manner in a population of healthy women at high risk of developing breast cancer. The results of the current study suggest that for healthy premenopausal women, the mechanism of reduced breast cancer risk observed in physically active individuals may not be a result of reduced levels of inflammation.

      "abstract": "Ten years passed since Japan set out the Action Plan of Growth Strategy that declared the initiatives of digitalization for medicine, nursing care, and healthcare to achieve the world’s most advanced medical care. The initiatives formed the foundation of the Japanese national strategy and have been continuously refined, resulting in the current environment of digital health and digital medicine. Digital health–related terminologies are organized, such as “digital health,” “digital medicine,” and “digital therapeutics” (DTx), as well as several common digital technologies, including artificial intelligence, machine learning, and mobile health (mHealth). DTx is included in mHealth and is a novel disease treatment option. Also, this article thoroughly describes DTx in Japan and compares it with those in the US and Germany, the leading countries in digital health–related policies, regulations, and their development status. In Japan, two of three DTx applications that have been approved and reimbursed by the Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare are explained in detail in relation to cardiovascular medicine. When added to a standard smoking cessation program, the DTx system for nicotine dependence significantly improved the continuous abstinence rate. Moreover, the DTx for hypertension together with the guideline-based hypertension management was effective in patients aged 65 years or younger who were diagnosed with essential hypertension without antihypertensive agents, and it was also found to be cost-effective. DTx in cardiovascular medicine, with consideration on safety, efficacy, and cost-effectiveness, could be widely used not only through basic experiments and clinical studies but also through social implementation.",

      "abstract": "“Digital Hypertension” is a new research field proposed by the Japanese Society of Hypertension that integrates digital technology into hypertension management and proactively promotes research activities. This novel approach includes the development of new technologies for better BP management, such as sensors for detecting environmental factors that affect BP, information processing, and machine learning. To facilitate “Digital Hypertension,” a more sophisticated BP monitoring system capable of measuring an individual’s BP more frequently in various situations would be required. With the use of these technologies, hypertension management could shift from the current “dots” management based on office BP readings during clinic visits to a “line” management system based on seamless home BP or individual BP data taken by a wearable BP monitoring device.",

      "abstract": "The past decade in rheumatology has seen tremendous innovation in digital health technologies, including the electronic health record, virtual visits, mobile health, wearable technology, digital therapeutics, artificial intelligence and machine learning. The increased availability of these technologies offers opportunities for improving important aspects of rheumatology, including access, outcomes, adherence and research. However, despite its growth in some areas, particularly with non-health-care consumers, digital health technology has not substantially changed the delivery of rheumatology care. This Review discusses key barriers and opportunities to improve application of digital health technologies in rheumatology. Key topics include smart design, voice enablement and the integration of electronic patient-reported outcomes. Smart design involves active engagement with the end users of the technologies, including patients and clinicians through focus groups, user testing sessions and prototype review. Voice enablement using voice assistants could be critical for enabling patients with hand arthritis to effectively use smartphone apps and might facilitate patient engagement with many technologies. Tracking many rheumatic diseases requires frequent monitoring of patient-reported outcomes. Current practice only collects this information sporadically, and rarely between visits. Digital health technology could enable patient-reported outcomes to inform appropriate timing of face-to-face visits and enable improved application of treat-to-target strategies. However, best practice standards for digital health technologies do not yet exist. To achieve the potential of digital health technology in rheumatology, rheumatology professionals will need to be more engaged upstream in the technology design process and provide leadership to effectively incorporate the new tools into clinical care.",

      "abstract": "Background: An increasing number of patients expect and want to play a greater role in their treatment and care decisions. This emphasizes the need to adopt collaborative health care practices, which implies collaboration among interprofessional health care teams and patients, their families, caregivers, and communities. In recent years, digital health technologies that support self-care and collaboration between the community and health care providers (ie, participatory health technologies) have received increasing attention. However, knowledge regarding the features of such technologies that support effective patient-professional partnerships is still limited.\nObjective: This study aimed to map and assess published studies on participatory health technologies intended to support partnerships among patients, caregivers, and health care professionals in chronic care, focusing specifically on identifying the main features of these technologies.\nMethods: A scoping review covering scientific publications in English between January 2008 and December 2020 was performed. We searched PubMed and Web of Science databases. Peer-reviewed qualitative, quantitative, and mixed methods studies that evaluated digital health technologies for patient-professional partnerships in chronic care settings were included. The data were charted and analyzed thematically. The PRISMA-ScR (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses extension for Scoping Reviews) checklist was used.\nResults: This review included 32 studies, reported in 34 papers. The topic of participatory health technologies experienced a slightly increasing trend across publication years, with most papers originating from the United States and Norway. Diabetes and cardiovascular diseases were the most common conditions addressed. Of the 32 studies, 12 (38%) evaluated the influence of participatory health technologies on partnerships, mostly with positive outcomes, although we also identified how partnership relationships and the nature of collaborative work could be challenged when the roles and expectations between users were unclear. Six common features of participatory health technologies were identified: patient-professional communication, self-monitoring, tailored self-care support, self-care education, care planning, and community forums for peer-to-peer interactions.\nConclusions: Our findings emphasize the importance of clarifying mutual expectations and carefully considering the implications that the introduction of participatory health technologies may have on the work of patients and health care professionals, both individually and in collaboration. A knowledge gap remains regarding the use of participatory health technologies to effectively support patient-professional partnerships in chronic care management.",

Aerobic exercise training (AT) improves endothelial function. However, the effects of resistance training (RT) and combined training (CT) on endothelial function remain controversial in individuals with SAH. We determined the effects of AT, RT, and CT on endothelial function and systolic (SBP)/diastolic blood pressure (DBP) in individuals with prehypertension or hypertension. Forty-two participants (54 ± 11 y, resting SBP/DBP 137 ± 9/86 ± 6 mmHg) were randomly allocated into AT (n = 14, 40 min of cycling, 50–75% heart rate reserve), RT (n = 14, 6 resistance exercises, 4 × 12 repetitions, 60% maximum strength) and CT (n = 14, 2 × 12 repetitions of RT + 20 min of AT). All participants performed a 40-minute exercise session twice a week for 8 weeks. Endothelial function was evaluated by brachial artery flow-mediated dilation (FMD). Blood pressure was evaluated through ambulatory monitoring for 24 hours. After 8 weeks of exercise training, blood pressure was reduced in all 3 groups: −5.1 mmHg in SBP (95%CI –10.1, 0.0; p = 0.003) in AT; −4.0 mmHg in SBP (95%CI −7.8, −0.5; p = 0.027) in RT; and −3.2 mmHg in DBP (95%CI −7.9, 1.5; p = 0.001) in CT. All 3 exercise training modalities produced similar improvements in FMD: + 3.2% (95%CI 1.7, 4.6) (p < 0.001) in AT; + 4.0% (95%CI 2.1, 5.7) (p < 0.001) in RT; and +6.8% (95%CI 2.6, 11.1) (p = 0.006) in CT. In conclusion, different exercise training modalities were similarly effective in improving endothelial function but impacts on ambulatory blood pressure appear to be variable in individuals with prehypertension or hypertension.",

      "abstract": "Objective Digital interventions such as remote monitoring of symptoms and physiological measurements have the potential to reduce the economic burden of asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) but their cost-effectiveness remains unclear. This systematic review of randomised controlled trials (RCT) aims to assess whether digital health interventions can be cost-effective in these patients. Design Systematic review of RCTs. Study quality was assessed using RoB2 tool. Data Sources Systematic search in three databases: PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science. Eligibility Criteria Studies were eligible if they were RCTs with health economic evaluations assessing participants with asthma and/or COPD and comparing a digital health intervention to standard of care. Results We included 35 RCTs, of which 21 were related to COPD, 13 to asthma and one to both diseases. Overall, studies assessed four categories of digital health interventions: (i) Electronic patient diaries (n = 4), (ii) real-time monitoring (n = 19), (iii) teleconsultations (n = 6) and (iv) others (n = 6). Eleven studies performed a full economic evaluation analysis, while 24 studies performed a partial economic analysis. Most studies involving real-time monitoring or teleconsultations presented economic results in favour of digital health interventions (indicating them to be cost-effective or less expensive than the standard of care). Mixed results were obtained for electronic patient diaries. In the studies that conducted a full economic analysis, the incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) ranged from 3530,93€/QALY and 286,369,28€/QALY. In the studies that conducted a partial economic analysis, the cost differences between the intervention group and the control group ranged from 0,12€ and 85,217,86€. Half studies with low risk of bias concluded that the intervention was economically favourable. Conclusion Although costs varied based on intervention type, follow-up period and country, most studies report digital health interventions to be affordable or associated with decreased costs.

We aimed to evaluate the impact of COVID-19-related public health guidelines on physical activity (PA), sedentary behavior, mental health, and their interrelations. Cross-sectional data were collected from 3052 US adults 3–8 April 2020 (from all 50 states). Participants self-reported pre- and post-COVID-19 levels of moderate and vigorous PA, sitting, and screen time. Currently-followed public health guidelines, stress, loneliness, positive mental health (PMH), social connectedness, and depressive and anxiety symptoms were self-reported. Participants were grouped by meeting US PA guidelines, reporting ≥8 h/day of sitting, or ≥8 h/day of screen time, pre- and post-COVID-19. Overall, 62% of participants were female, with age ranging from 18–24 (16.6% of sample) to 75+ (9.3%). Self-reported PA was lower post-COVID among participants reporting being previously active (mean change: −32.3% [95% CI: −36.3%, −28.1%]) but largely unchanged among previously inactive participants (+2.3% [−3.5%, +8.1%]). No longer meeting PA guidelines and increased screen time were associated with worse depression, loneliness, stress, and PMH (p < 0.001). Self-isolation/quarantine was associated with higher depressive and anxiety symptoms compared to social distancing (p < 0.001). Maintaining and enhancing physical activity participation and limiting screen time increases during abrupt societal changes may mitigate the mental health consequences.",

Through these virtual storefronts Apple and Google act as the distributor (and sometimes, importer) of many thousands of health and wellness apps into the EU, some of which have a medical purpose. As a result of changes to EU law which came into effect in May 2021, they must now ensure that apps are compliant with medical devices regulation and to inform authorities of serious incidents arising from their use. The extent to which these new rules are being complied with in practice is uneven, and in some areas unclear. In light of EU legislation related to competition, which came into effect in November 2022, it is also unclear how conflicts of interest can be managed between Apple and Google’s roles as gateway duopoly importers and distributors whilst also developers of their own competitive health products. Finally, with the proposed European health data space regulation, wellness apps will be voluntarily registered and labelled in a fashion more like medical devices than consumer software. We explore the implications of these new regulations and propose future models that could resolve the apparent conflicts. All stakeholders would benefit from improved app store models to sustainably evolve safer, better, and fairer provision of digital health applications in the EU. As EU legislation comes into force it could serve as a template for other regions globally.",

At the same time, wearables have also been associated with issues and risks, such as those connected to privacy and data sharing. Yet, discussions in the literature have mostly focused on either technical or ethical considerations, framing these as largely separate areas of discussion, and the contribution of wearables to the collection, development, application of biomedical knowledge has only partially been discussed. To fill in these gaps, in this article we provide an epistemic (knowledgerelated) overview of the main functions of wearable technology for health: monitoring, screening, detection, and prediction. On this basis, we identify 4 areas of concern in the application of wearables for these functions: data quality, balanced estimations, health equity, and fairness. To move the field forward in an effective and beneficial direction, we present recommendations for the 4 areas: local standards of quality, interoperability, access, and representativity.",

Exercise might be the most promising non-pharmaceutic intervention to address the large variety of risk factors related to the pronounced estradiol decline during peri- and early-postmenopause. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of an 18-month multipurpose exercise program on risk factors and symptoms related to the menopausal transition. Fifty-four women 1–5 years postmenopause with osteopenia or osteoporosis were randomly assigned 1) to a high impact weight-bearing/high-intensity/velocity resistance training group (EG: n=27) exercising three times a week or 2) to an attendance control group (CG: n=27) that performed low-intensity exercise once a week. Both groups were supplemented with cholecalciferol and calcium. The primary study endpoint was bone mineral density (BMD) at lumbar spine (LS) and total hip, secondary outcomes were lean body mass (LBM), total and abdominal body percentage, metabolic syndrome Z-Score (MetS-Z), menopausal symptoms and muscle strength and power. Due to COVID-19, the study was stopped after 13 months. We observed significant effects for BMD-LS (EG: 0.002±.018 versus CG: −.009±0.018 mg/cm2, p=0.027) but not for BMD total hip (EG: −0.01±.016 versus CG: −.009±0.020 mg/cm2, p=0.129). LBM improved significantly in the EG and decreased in the CG (0.39±1.08 vs −0.37±1.34 kg, p=0.026). Total and abdominal body fat improved significantly in the EG and was maintained in the CG (−1.44±1.49 vs −0.02±1.55 kg, p=0.002 and -1.50±2.33 vs 0.08±2.07 kg, p=0.011). Significant effects in favor of the EG were also determined for menopausal symptoms (p=0.029), hip/leg extension strength (p<0.001) and power (p<0.001). However, changes of the MetS-Z did not differ significantly (p=0.149) between EG and CG. In summary, with minor exceptions, we demonstrated the effectiveness of a multipurpose exercise protocol dedicated to early-postmenopausal women on various risk factors and complaints related to the menopausal transition.",

      "abstract": "Introduction: Health informatics and digital health, two rapidly growing disciplines, are becoming increasingly important to the sustainability of health service provision, highlighted especially through the COVID-19 pandemic. To maximise the benefits of the adoption and growth of health informatics and digital health, health service managers play a critical role in leading and managing the implementation and transformation of the system, both strategically and operationally, whilst still needing to manage ‘business as usual’.\nObjectives: The objectives of the paper are to present and discuss the findings from a scoping review identifying: 1) competencies required for health service managers leading the implementation and transformation of informatics and digital technology in the health sector; and 2) factors that are critical to building the management workforce capacity in the era of health informatics and digital health.\nMethods: A scoping review of the literature was conducted in 2020 focussing on identifying empirical articles published in the English language since the year 2000 using a number of keywords such as ‘health informatics’, ‘digital health’, ‘electronic health’, ‘competencies’, ‘capability’, ‘proficiency’, ‘qualification’, ‘certification’, ‘health manager’, ‘health executive’ and ‘health administrator’. The literature search was guided by a PRISMA approach searching within eight databases: Scopus, ProQuest, Web of Science, ACM Digital Library, CINAHL, PubMed, Google Scholar and ProQuest Dissertations.\nResults: After duplicates were removed, 941 publications were included for title screening as the result of an initial review. Title screening selected 185 articles to be included for abstract screening by two reviewers confirming 19 papers relevant to the focus of the current paper which were included in data extraction and content analysis. The analysis identified the additional competency of ‘information and data management’ be included as a core competency for health service managers. The analysis also confirmed additional elements for the following four core management competencies that are important to health service managers working in the digital health context, including: 1) leadership; 2) operational and resource management; 3) personal, interpersonal and professional qualities, and 4) understanding the industry and environment. Factors that are critical to developing the system and organization capacity in the use of health informatics and digital health technology, and leading and managing the adoption in the healthcare organizations were identified in three categories: 1) policy/system; 2) organizational structure and processes; and 3) people factors.\nConclusions: This paper has taken an important step in confirming the competency requirements for health services managers that are relevant to leading and managing in the health informatics and digital health space, consequently indicating the directions for developing a competent workforce in meeting the existing and emerging healthcare delivery challenges, both now and in the future.",

      "abstract": "Bone is inﬂuenced by physical activity (PA) throughout life, but childhood and adolescence provide a key opportunity to maximize peak bone mass. Thus, it is important to identify the relationship between PA practiced in childhood and young adulthood to design a promotion plan for bone health. The purpose of this study was to analyze the relationship between diﬀerent impact-loading PAs (and their continuity throughout school periods from childhood to young adulthood) and bone stiﬀness index (SI). In this cross-sectional study, which was conducted on 145 university students aged 18–21 years, bone measurements were measured by quantitative ultrasonometry (QUS), and PA information was recalled using a self-administered questionnaire. Associations between the SI and the impact of PA performed during secondary school (p = 0.027), high school (p = 0.002), and university (p = 0.016) periods were observed. The continuity of PA over a longer period of time was related to a higher SI (p = 0.007). Those who practiced PA throughout all school periods had a higher SI than those who practiced during primary school only (p = 0.038) or through primary and secondary schools (p = 0.009). These results suggest that impact-loading PA practiced during diﬀerent school periods is related to higher values of the SI. Therefore, continuous PA from an early age may be an important contributing factor to achieving and maintaining adequate bone health.",

      "abstract": "Priority setting is an important component of systematic planning in health promotion and also factors into the development of a comprehensive evaluation plan. The basic priority rating (BPR) model was introduced more than 50 years ago and includes criteria that should be considered in any priority setting approach (i.e., use of predetermined criteria, standardized comparisons, and a rubric that controls bias). Although the BPR model has provided basic direction in priority setting, it does not represent the broad array of data currently available to decision makers. Elements in the model also give more weight to the impact of communicable diseases compared with chronic diseases. For these reasons, several modifications are recommended to improve the BPR model and to better assist health promotion practitioners in the priority setting process. The authors also suggest a new name, BPR 2.0, to represent this revised model.",

      "abstract": "OBJECTIVE To determine the association of leisure-time physical activity with incidence of common types of cancer and whether associations vary by body size and/or smoking. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS We pooled data from 12 prospective US and European cohorts with self-reported physical activity (baseline, 1987-2004). We used multivariable Cox regression to estimate hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals for associations of leisure-time physical activity with incidence of 26 types of cancer. Leisure-time physical activity levels were modeled as cohort-specific percentiles on a continuous basis and cohortspecific results were synthesized by random-effects meta-analysis. Hazard ratios for high vs low levels of activity are based on a comparison of risk at the 90th vs 10th percentiles of activity. The data analysis was performed from January 1, 2014, to June 1, 2015. EXPOSURES Leisure-time physical activity of a moderate to vigorous intensity. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Incident cancer during follow-up.\nRESULTS A total of 1.44 million participants (median [range] age, 59 [19-98] years; 57% female) and 186 932 cancers were included. High vs low levels of leisure-time physical activity were associated with lower risks of 13 cancers: esophageal adenocarcinoma (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.37-0.89), liver (HR, 0.73; 95% CI, 0.55-0.98), lung (HR, 0.74; 95% CI, 0.71-0.77), kidney (HR, 0.77; 95% CI, 0.70-0.85), gastric cardia (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.64-0.95), endometrial (HR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.68-0.92), myeloid leukemia (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.70-0.92), myeloma (HR, 0.83; 95% CI, 0.72-0.95), colon (HR, 0.84; 95% CI, 0.77-0.91), head and neck (HR, 0.85; 95% CI, 0.78-0.93), rectal (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.80-0.95), bladder (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.82-0.92), and breast (HR, 0.90; 95% CI, 0.87-0.93). Body mass index adjustment modestly attenuated associations for several cancers, but 10 of 13 inverse associations remained statistically significant after this adjustment. Leisure-time physical activity was associated with higher risks of malignant melanoma (HR, 1.27; 95% CI, 1.16-1.40) and prostate cancer (HR, 1.05; 95% CI, 1.03-1.08). Associations were generally similar between overweight/obese and normal-weight individuals. Smoking status modified the association for lung cancer but not other smoking-related cancers.\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Leisure-time physical activity was associated with lower risks of many cancer types. Health care professionals counseling inactive adults should emphasize that most of these associations were evident regardless of body size or smoking history, supporting broad generalizability of findings.",

A total of 135 responses from employees of a private corporation working at 11 different worksites were factor analyzed in 2005. Exploratory factor analysis was used to obtain an initial factor structure. Factor validity was evaluated using confirmatory factor analysis methods. A second sample was collected in 2006 from the same population (N 5 178) and was used to confirm the factor structure via confirmatory factor analysis. Cronbach’s a and itemtotal correlations provided information on the reliability of the factor subscales.\nResults. Four subscales were identified: business alignment with health promotion objectives, awareness of the health-productivity link, worksite support for health promotion, and leadership support for health promotion. Factor by group comparisons revealed that the initial factor structure was effective in detecting differences in organizational support for health promotion across different employee groups.\nConclusions. Management support for health promotion can be assessed using the LBE, a brief, self-report questionnaire. Researchers can use the LBE to diagnose, track, and evaluate worksite health promotion programs. (Am J Health Promot 2008;22[5]:359–367.)",

      "abstract": "Background: Information and communications technology (ICT)-based tailored management (TM) intervention is a novel automatic system in which smartphone application for management of hypertensive and diabetic patients, the provider web, and Bluetooth devices are linked. However, little evidence exists regarding the cost-effectiveness of the interventions using mobile application.\nObjective: This study aimed to assess the cost-effectiveness of TM intervention for adult patients with hypertension or diabetes in primary care compared with usual care (UC).\nMethods: Cost-effectiveness analysis using a Markov model was conducted from the Korean healthcare system perspective. Based on 6-month outcome data from an ICT-based tailored chronic disease management (ICT-CM) trial, effectiveness over a lifetime beyond the trial periods was extrapolated using a cardiovascular disease risk prediction model. Costs were estimated using ICT-CM trial data and national health insurance claims data. Health utility weights were obtained from the Korea National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.\nResults: In the base-case analysis, compared with UC, TM was more costly ($23,157 for TM vs. $22,391 for UC) and more effective (12.006 quality-adjusted life-years [QALYs] for TM vs. 11.868 QALYs for UC). The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) was $5556 per QALY gained. Probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that the probability of TM being costeffective compared with UC was approximately 97% at an ICER threshold of $26,515 (KRW 35 million) per QALY gained.\nConclusions: Compared with UC, TM intervention is a cost-effective option for hypertensive or diabetic patients in primary care settings. The study results can assist policymakers in making evidence-based decision when implementing accessible chronic disease management services.",

      "abstract": "Patients undergoing systemic anti-cancer treatment experience distressing side effects, and these symptoms are often experienced outside the hospital setting. The impact of usage of cancer-related mobile health (mHealth) applications on patient-related outcomes requires investigation. A critical appraisal of the literature was performed for the following question: ‘In patients with cancer have mHealth applications been compared with usual care to examine impact on commonly used clinical outcomes’. Literature searches were undertaken with the help of a research librarian and included Medline, Cochrane Collaboration, clinical trial databases and grey searches. Seventeen studies including between 12 and 2352 patients were identified and reviewed. Smartphone applications or internet portals collected data on symptoms or patient activity. Several studies showed statistically significant differences in patient-reported outcomes when symptom monitoring using mobile health application was compared to usual care. Change in mobility was the only outcome that was related directly to toxicity. Only limited data on mortality, cancer-related morbidity including complications of care, health-economic outcomes or long-term outcomes were reported. Studies on mHealth applications might improve aspects of symptom control in patients with cancer, but there is currently little evidence for impact on other outcomes. This requires future research in interventional studies.",

      "abstract": "Conventional therapeutic interventions, which range from drug treatment to learning and training regimens, are often given at a fixed dose/intensity. This often leads to sub-optimal responses, or even none at all. Similarly, fixed intensity training can lead to plateaus in learning trajectories and training outcomes. This barrier will impact the field of digital therapeutics, where drug-based therapies may be complemented or replaced by learning and training platforms. A potential solution is to optimize training by identifying N-of-1 (single subject) training profiles that can then enhance learning trajectories through individualized training regimens. In this study, CURATE.AI, a mechanism-independent and indication-agnostic artificial intelligence (AI) platform, is used to identify N-of-1 learning trajectory profiles for healthy volunteers trained on the Multi-Attribute Task Battery (MATB), a flight deck simulator developed by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and United States Air Force. By leveraging modulated MATB training intensity in a prospective study, CURATE.AI successfully develops N-of-1 learning trajectory profiles that may actionably mediate training optimization on the single-subject level, by dynamically identifying training inputs that drive the best possible scoring outcome. Therefore, CURATE.AI-guided training may serve as a powerful optimization platform for digital therapy, student learning, cognitive decline prevention, and other indications.",
