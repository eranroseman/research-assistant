# Notes

The primary objective of this software is to improve research capabilities within a Zotero library. @src/build_kb.py is responsible for transforming the library into a searchable knowledge base (KB). @src/cli.py manages access to the KB, which is utilized for conducting research. You also have direct access to the KB data located in kb_data/ and the full-text papers found in kb_data/papers/. This allows you to follow a two-step process: first, use semantic search to identify the most relevant papers, and then analyze these papers to generate a report.






The main goal of this software is to enhance research capabilities within a Zotero library. @src/build_kb.py is tasked with transforming the library into a searchable knowledge base (KB). @src/cli.py oversees access to the KB, which Claude Code (@src/.claude/commands/*.md) uses to conduct research based on user requests. Claude employs a two-step process: first, it utilizes semantic search to identify the most relevant papers, and then it analyzes these papers to generate a report.

Recommend an optimized version of @src/.claude/commands/research.md that makes optimal use of the tools provided by @src/build_kb.py and @src/cli.py, provide the best research reports, and enhance user experience.

 Recommend improvements that wil either improve the quality of the research reports, enhance the user experience, or increase maintainability.

remove all fallback code, backwards compatibility, and legacy paths to simplify the codebase. Users will need to delete and rebuild their knowledge base for any upgrades.
