# Notes

The main goal of this software is to enhance research capabilities within a Zotero library. @src/build_kb.py is tasked with transforming the library into a searchable knowledge base (KB). @src/cli.py oversees access to the KB, which Claude Code (@src/.claude/commands/research.md) uses to conduct research based on user requests. Claude employs a two-step process: first, it utilizes semantic search to identify the most relevant papers, and then it analyzes these papers to generate a report.

 Recommend improvements that wil either improve the quality of the research reports, enhance the user experience, or increase maintainability.

remove all fallback code, backwards compatibility, and legacy paths to simplify the codebase. Users will need to delete and rebuild their knowledge base for any upgrades.
