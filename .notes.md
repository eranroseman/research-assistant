The primary objective of this software is to improve research capabilities within a Zotero library. @src/build_kb.py is responsible for transforming the library into a searchable knowledge base (KB). @src/cli.py manages access to the KB, which is utilized for conducting research. You also have direct access to the KB data located in kb_data/ and the full-text papers found in kb_data/papers/. This allows you to follow a two-step process: first, use semantic search to identify the most relevant papers, and then analyze these papers to generate a report.

Research-assistant in a simple light weight python CLI tool designed to enhance research capabilities within a Zotero library. @src/build_kb.py is tasked with transforming the library into a searchable knowledge base (KB). @src/cli.py oversees access to the KB, which is used to conduct research based on user requests. It enables a two-step process: first, it utilizes semantic search to identify the most relevant papers, and then it analyzes these papers to generate a report.

Recommend an optimized version of @src/.claude/commands/research.md that makes optimal use of the tools provided by @src/build_kb.py and @src/cli.py, provide the best research reports, and enhance user experience.

 Recommend improvements that wil either improve the quality of the research reports, enhance the user experience, or increase maintainability.

remove all fallback code, backwards compatibility, and legacy paths to simplify the code. Users will need to delete and rebuild their knowledge base for any upgrades.

  PDF to Text Processing Pipeline

  1. PDF Path Discovery (get_pdf_paths_from_sqlite)

- Queries Zotero's SQLite database to find PDF attachments for papers
- Maps paper keys to PDF file paths in Zotero storage directory
- Validates PDF files exist in the filesystem

  2. PDF Text Extraction (extract_pdf_text)

- Cache Check: First checks if text was previously extracted (using file size + modification time)
- Extraction Methods (in priority order):
  - PyMuPDF4LLM: Converts PDF to Markdown format, preserving structure
  - Basic PyMuPDF: Falls back to simple text extraction if PyMuPDF4LLM unavailable
- Caching: Saves extracted text with metadata (file size, mtime, extraction method)

  3. Text Augmentation (augment_papers_with_pdfs)

- Batch processes all papers needing PDF extraction
- Adds full_text and pdf_path fields to paper dictionaries
- Reports cache hits vs. new extractions
- Saves cache after processing batch

  4. Section Extraction (extract_sections)

  Two-tier approach:

  Primary Method - PragmaticSectionExtractor (if available):

- Uses specialized extractor for academic paper sections
- Identifies: abstract, introduction, methods, results, discussion, conclusion, references, supplementary

  Fallback Method - Pattern-based extraction:

- Handles markdown headers (## Section)
- Detects numbered sections (1. Introduction)
- Uses regex patterns for inline headers
- Multiple fallback strategies for abstract extraction

  5. Abstract Enhancement (_extract_abstract_fallback)

  Multiple strategies when abstract is missing/short:

- Uses Zotero's abstractNote if available
- Searches for explicit "Abstract:" indicators
- Extracts text between title/metadata and first main section
- Validates length (10-5000 characters)

  6. Markdown Formatting (format_paper_as_markdown)

- Structures paper with metadata header
- Organizes extracted sections in standard order
- Falls back to full text if section extraction failed
- Saves as paper_XXXX.md files

  Key Features

  Caching System:

- .pdf_text_cache.json stores extracted text
- Avoids re-extracting unchanged PDFs
- Validates using file size + modification time

  Structure Preservation:

- PyMuPDF4LLM maintains formatting and structure
- 50KB limit per section (no truncation)
- Complete preservation of methods, results, discussions

  Robustness:

- Multiple extraction fallbacks
- Handles various PDF formats and structures
- Graceful degradation when sections can't be identified
