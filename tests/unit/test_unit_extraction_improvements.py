ABSTRACT
This study investigates digital health interventions for diabetes management.
We conducted a systematic review of randomized controlled trials published
between 2010 and 2024. Our analysis aims to determine the effectiveness of
mobile health applications in improving glycemic control.

INTRODUCTION
Digital health has become increasingly important in chronic disease management.
Previous studies have shown mixed results regarding the effectiveness of these
interventions. This systematic review addresses the gap in understanding by
analyzing the most recent evidence from high-quality trials.

METHODS
We searched multiple databases including PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane for relevant studies.
Inclusion criteria were randomized controlled trials of digital health interventions
for type 2 diabetes management. Statistical analysis was performed using random effects
models with heterogeneity assessed using I-squared statistics.

RESULTS
The analysis included 42 studies with a total of 8,456 participants from diverse populations.
Digital interventions showed significant improvements in HbA1c levels with a mean difference
of -0.5% (95% CI: -0.7 to -0.3, p<0.001). Secondary outcomes also showed improvements.

DISCUSSION
Our findings suggest that digital health interventions are effective for diabetes management.
These results are consistent with recent systematic reviews and provide strong evidence
for the integration of digital tools in routine clinical practice.

CONCLUSION
Digital health interventions represent a promising approach for improving glycemic control
in patients with type 2 diabetes. Future research should focus on long-term outcomes.
