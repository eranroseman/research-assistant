### Reference Implementations

- **[grobid_config.py](grobid_config.py)** - Maximum extraction configuration
- **[post_processor.py](post_processor.py)** - Post-processing implementation
- **[entity_extractor.py](entity_extractor.py)** - Entity extraction from Grobid XML
- **[quality_scorer.py](quality_scorer.py)** - Quality scoring implementation

### Working Implementations

- **[implementations/](implementations/)** - Directory with working scripts
  - `extract_zotero_library.py` - Successfully extracted 2,210/2,221 papers
  - `grobid_overnight_runner.py` - 7-file output strategy implementation
  - `grobid_post_processor.py` - Full post-processing pipeline (631 lines)
  - `retry_all_failed.py` - Retry script that recovered 10/11 failed papers
  - See [implementations/README.md](implementations/README.md) for details

### Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Read overview to understand the system
cat 01_overview.md

# 2. Check installation requirements
cat 06_installation_setup.md

# 3. Review Grobid configuration
cat 02_grobid_extraction.md

# 4. Understand post-processing
cat 03_post_processing.md

# 5. Check command reference
cat 05_commands_reference.md
```

### Key Insights

- **Philosophy**: Maximum extraction over speed (we run Grobid rarely)
- **Performance**: ~15s per paper average, 9.5 hours for 2,200 papers
- **Two-Pass Strategy**: 90s first pass (99.82% success), 180s retry for failures
- **Local Processing Only**: No Azure dependencies, full control
- **Document Focus**: Research papers only (99.95% success), books excluded
- **Storage**: 7 files per paper (~1-2MB) for maximum flexibility
- **Accuracy**: 99%+ abstract extraction, 85-90% section detection after post-processing
- **Empirical**: All recommendations based on 2,221 paper analysis

### Important Update (Aug 2025)

**Local Processing Strategy**: Based on empirical testing of 2,221 documents:
- Two-pass extraction (90s + 180s) achieves 99.95% success for research papers
- Books/proceedings excluded - they require different processing pipeline
- Local processing provides full control and predictable timing
- See [02_grobid_extraction.md](02_grobid_extraction.md) for complete strategy

### Version History

- **v5.0** (Current) - Three-system integration with maximum extraction
- **v4.6** - Previous version with reliability issues
- **v4.0** - Introduction of enhanced quality scoring
