docker run -t --rm -p 8070:8070 lfoppiano/grobid:0.8.2-full
python extraction_pipeline_runner_checkpoint.py

# Resume after interruption (automatic)

cat 01_overview.md           # System architecture
cat 09_final_pipeline_results.md  # What to expect
cat 07_troubleshooting.md    # If things go wrong
```

### Pipeline Directory Structure (NEW - Sep 1, 2025)

All pipeline outputs are now organized in a single directory with numbered stages:

```
extraction_pipeline_YYYYMMDD/
â”œâ”€â”€ 01_tei_xml/              # GROBID TEI XML output
â”œâ”€â”€ 02_json_extraction/      # Comprehensive TEI â†’ JSON
â”œâ”€â”€ 03_zotero_recovery/      # Zotero metadata recovery
â”œâ”€â”€ 04_crossref_enrichment/  # CrossRef batch enrichment
â”œâ”€â”€ 05_s2_enrichment/        # Semantic Scholar enrichment

### Key Insights

- **Philosophy**: Maximum extraction over speed (we run Grobid rarely)
- **Performance**: ~15.4s per paper average, 97.7% overall success rate
- **Two-Pass Strategy**: GROBID's retry mechanism IS the fallback (90s â†’ 180s timeout)
- **Extraction Success**: 99.72% full text extraction, 94.77% complete data coverage
- **Local Processing Only**: No Azure dependencies, full control
- **Document Focus**: Research papers only, books excluded
- **Checkpoint Recovery**: Prevents data loss, enables resume from interruptions
- **Root Causes**: 0.7% unfixable GROBID failures (scanned/encrypted PDFs)
- **Industry Leading**: Exceeds typical extraction pipelines (85-90% standard)
- **Final Quality**: 2,160 articles with comprehensive metadata and full text

   - Journal recovery: 2,006 papers (addresses GROBID's main weakness)
   - Zero API cost, instant processing

3. **`crossref_batch_enrichment.py`**: Batch processing for fast enrichment (RECOMMENDED)
   - Processes up to 50 DOIs per API call (60x speedup)
   - Adds 35+ fields including citations, ISSN, volume/issue, funding
   - Alternative: `crossref_enrichment_comprehensive.py` for individual queries

**Final Results**:
- >99% coverage for all critical fields after full pipeline
- Journal coverage: 99.6% (Zotero recovery + CrossRef)
