# Comprehensive TEI XML Extraction Fix

## Executive Summary

On September 1, 2025, we identified and fixed a critical bug in the v5 extraction pipeline: **100% of papers were missing year metadata**, preventing CrossRef from finding DOIs for papers without them. The root cause was incomplete TEI XML to JSON extraction.

## The Problem

### Symptoms
- 35 papers (1.6%) missing DOIs after all enrichment attempts
- CrossRef enrichment failing to find these papers
- All 35 papers had no year metadata

### Investigation Results
- **Discovery**: ALL 2,150 papers (100%) were missing year field
- **Impact**: CrossRef API requires year for bibliographic search
- **Root Cause**: Original `extract_zotero_library.py` didn't extract dates from TEI XML

## The Solution: comprehensive_tei_extractor.py

### What It Extracts

#### Core Metadata (98%+ coverage)
- **Title**: Multiple fallback locations
- **Authors**: With affiliations, emails, ORCIDs
- **Year/Date**: From `date[@when]` attributes (0% â†’ 97.4%)
- **DOI**: With cleaning and normalization
- **Other IDs**: PMID, arXiv, ISSN

#### Publication Details (93% coverage)
- **Journal**: With intelligent inference from references
- **Volume/Issue/Pages**: Complete bibliographic info
- **Publisher**: Including publication place
- **Conference**: Meeting information when available

#### Content (99%+ coverage)
- **Sections**: Full text with paragraphs
- **References**: Structured with authors, years, DOIs
- **Figures**: With captions and descriptions
- **Tables**: With captions and content
- **Formulas**: Mathematical equations

#### Additional Metadata
- **Keywords**: 61.7% of papers
- **Funding**: 73.6% of papers
- **License**: 30.7% of papers
- **Citations**: Which references are cited in text
- **Editors**: When present
- **Processing Software**: Grobid version info

### Key Innovations

1. **Journal Inference**: When Grobid doesn't extract journal to sourceDesc (common), we infer from the most frequently cited journal in references

2. **Complete Field Coverage**: Extracts EVERY field available in TEI XML

3. **Robust Date Extraction**: Multiple fallback locations for finding dates

## Results

### Before Fix
```
Year coverage: 0%
Journal coverage: 0%
Keywords: 0%
Missing DOIs: 35 papers
```

### After Fix
```
Year coverage: 97.4%
Journal coverage: 92.8%
Keywords: 61.7%
Missing DOIs: Expected ~2-3 papers
```

## Implementation

### Usage
```bash
# Extract all TEI XML files comprehensively
python src/comprehensive_tei_extractor.py \
  --input-dir zotero_extraction_20250830_235521/tei_xml \
  --output-dir comprehensive_extraction_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S)

# Results
# - 2,210 papers processed
# - 97.4% have years
# - 92.8% have journals
# - 100% of available data extracted
```

### Integration with Pipeline
```bash
# Option 1: Replace original extraction
mv zotero_extraction_*/json zotero_extraction_*/json.old
python src/comprehensive_tei_extractor.py --output-dir zotero_extraction_*/json

# Option 2: Use new extraction directory
python src/comprehensive_tei_extractor.py --output-dir comprehensive_extraction
# Then update pipeline to use comprehensive_extraction/
```

## Technical Details

### TEI XML Structure
```xml
<!-- Year is in @when attribute, not text -->
<date type="published" when="2022-11-07">November 7, 2022</date>

<!-- Journal often only in references, not sourceDesc -->
<sourceDesc>
  <biblStruct>
    <monogr>
      <!-- Often empty! -->
    </monogr>
  </biblStruct>
</sourceDesc>
```

### Extraction Strategy
1. Parse TEI XML with namespace handling
2. Extract from multiple fallback locations
3. Infer missing data from context
4. Validate and clean all fields
5. Output complete JSON

## Lessons Learned

1. **Always verify extraction completeness** - We assumed the original extraction was complete
2. **TEI XML is complex** - Fields can be in multiple locations
3. **Grobid limitations** - Doesn't always extract journal to expected location
4. **Metadata is critical** - Missing year broke DOI discovery for 35 papers

## Recommendations

1. **Immediate**: Re-run pipeline with comprehensive extraction
2. **Future**: Always validate extraction coverage metrics
3. **Testing**: Add tests for metadata completeness
4. **Documentation**: Document all TEI XML field locations

## Files

- `comprehensive_tei_extractor.py` - The complete extraction script
- `test_comprehensive_extraction/` - Test results directory
- `test_comprehensive_v2/` - Updated version with all fixes

## Next Steps

1. Re-process all 2,210 papers with comprehensive extraction
2. Run CrossRef enrichment with year data available
3. Expect to recover most of the 35 missing DOIs
4. Build final KB with complete metadata
