  "title": "Effectiveness of Digital Health Interventions on Sedentary Behavior Among Patients With Chronic Diseases: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
  "abstract": "Background: Individuals with chronic diseases commonly engage in a sedentary lifestyle, which may exacerbate poor disease progression and increase the burden of care. Digital health interventions have been broadly used in promoting healthy lifestyles in recent decades, while their effectiveness on sedentary behavior (SB) remains inconsistent and inconclusive. Objective: This review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of digital health interventions in reducing SB among patients with chronic diseases. Methods: PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Library, and ACM Digital Library were searched for randomized controlled trials published from January 2000 to October 2023. Two researchers independently screened studies and evaluated study quality. The revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool was used to assess the risk of bias. Mean differences (MDs) were calculated for intervention effect comparison. Results: Twenty-six trials were selected and 3800 participants were included. The mean age was 57.32 (SD 9.91) years. The typical chronic diseases reported in the studies included obesity (n=6), arthritis (n=5), coronary artery disease (n=4), cancer (n=4), type 2 diabetes mellitus (n=3), metabolic syndrome (n=2), and stroke (n=2). Phone, web, and activity trackers were 3 digital technologies adopted in the interventions and they were used in combination in most studies (18/26, 69.2%). The functions included facilitating self-monitoring of SB, reminding interruption of long undisturbed sitting, and promoting goal attainment. Approaches targeting SB reduction included standing (n=6), walking (n=9), light physical activity (n=5), moderate to vigorous physical activity (n=4), screen time limitation (n=2), and contextual-related activities based on patients' preference (n=4). The majority (80.8%) of studies had a low to moderate risk of bias. Meta-analysis revealed significant decreases in overall sitting time (MD -30.80; 95% CI -49.79 to-11.82; I 2 =65%; P=.001), pre-post sitting time changes (MD -50.28; 95% CI -92.99 to -7.57; I 2 =92%; P=.02), and SB proportions (MD -4.65%; 95% CI -7.02 to -2.28; I 2 =20%; P<.001) after digital health interventions, compared with nondigital interventions such as usual care, wait-list, or other active controls, with a small effect size (Cohen d=-0.27 to -0.47). No significant differences in the length of sedentary bouts and breaks were found. Subgroup analyses showed that studies with objective SB measurements and those younger than 65 years had significant reductions in sitting time. Conclusions: Digital health interventions significantly reduced the SB among patients with chronic illness. More research with rigorous design to promote a long-term decrease in sitting time, differentiate primary and compensatory SB reductions, and explore the underlying mechanisms is needed.",

      "text": "Chronic diseases, including cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases, and diabetes, contributed to 71% of all causes of death, imposing an enormous and growing global burden on health care systems and financial expenditure  [1] . Individuals diagnosed with chronic diseases required consistent engagement in physical activity (PA) to prevent disease progression and enhance long-term quality of life  [2] . However, those patients were always engaged in substantially long sedentary lifestyle because of limited physical function, fatigue, and insufficient exercise endurance.\n\nSedentary behavior (SB), defined by the Sedentary Behavior Research Network and the American Heart Association, means any waking behaviors characterized by an energy expenditure of \u22641.5 metabolic equivalents (METs) while in a sitting or reclining posture  [3, 4] . Patients with chronic diseases continue to demonstrate a high level of SB. For instance, a study investigating 131 patients with coronary artery disease (CAD) demonstrated an average sitting time of 10.4 hours per day  [5] . Patients with acute coronary syndrome continued to exhibit prolonged sitting of approximately 9 hours per day even after participating in cardiac rehabilitation  [6] . Another study indicated that patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) spent 71%-92% of their waking hours in SB  [7] . Among 2497 individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), they allocated an average of 64% waking hours in SB  [8] . Patients with stroke also reported 9.22 hours per day sitting time in the first week after discharge in a prospective cohort study  [9] . Similarly, a national survey among 741 survivors from cancer found that the patients spent at least 8 hours per day in sitting  [10] . Such long-time SB accelerated the negative progression of diseases in those patients  [11] [12] [13] .\n\nThe detrimental effects of prolonged SB on chronic disease progression were attributed to various underlying mechanisms, including increased central arterial stiffness  [14] , impaired vascular function and structure, reduced antegrade blood flow and shear rate, increased insulin resistance, and heightened oxidative stress and apoptosis  [15, 16] . Those functional deterioration resulted in suboptimal control of cardiometabolic indicators, subsequently increased occurrence of complications, and elevated risk of hospital readmission and mortality  [4, [17] [18] [19] . Therefore, reducing SB, typically in patients with chronic diseases, is a public health priority.\n\nIn recent decades, digital health, or the use of digital technologies for health, has gained significant prominence in addressing various health needs  [20] . In 2019, the World Health Organization (WHO) announced the Global Strategy on Digital Health 2020-2025, which emphasized the adoption of digital health in health care  [21] . Digital health interventions have great potential for behavioral change without on-site visits, no time constraints, and few travel costs, which facilitate flexible, efficient, and cost-effective interventions  [22] . Currently, many researchers have applied digital health interventions for SB reduction. However, the results of previous studies were still inconsistent and inconclusive. For example, a meta-analysis indicated that wearable activity trackers were associated with a significant reduction of 35.46 minutes per day in sedentary time among hospitalized patients, but this finding was derived from only 2 studies included in this review  [23] . Additionally, 2 other systematic reviews reported conflicting results regarding the effectiveness of smartphone-based interventions in interrupting SB in older adults, whereas this evidence was also obtained from a limited number of studies (n\u22642), and the definition of SB was different  [24, 25] .\n\nGiven the rapid development in digital technologies and variation of intervention patterns, as well as the importance of improving SB among patients with chronic diseases, it is crucial to update and comprehensively summarize the evidence to incorporate digital solutions for this vulnerable population. Thereby, this systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to search and synthesize available evidence regarding the effectiveness of digital health interventions in improving SB among patients with chronic diseases."

Two independent authors (YZ and QLY) manually screened these papers and identified those specifically targeting patients with chronic diseases, as defined by the International Classification of Diseases, Eleventh Revision (ICD-11). At last, a comprehensive search was carried out in PubMed, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, CINAHL Complete, Cochrane Library, and ACM Digital Library.

      "title": "SB-Related Outcomes",
      "text": "Sixteen studies designated SB as the primary outcome  [28, [34] [35] [36] [37] 42, 43, [45] [46] [47] 49, 51, 52, [58] [59] [60] , while the remaining 10 RCTs identified PA as the primary outcome  [44, [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [60] [61] [62] [63] . SB-related outcomes included the overall sitting time (n=16), pre-post sitting time changes (n=8), SB proportion among all activities (n=4), sedentary bouts (n=7), and breaks of sedentary time (n=6). The overall sitting time (minutes per day) was the volume of sitting time accrued per day, which was the most common indicator in SB assessment  [64] . The pre-post sitting time changes (minutes per day) were calculated as the overall sitting time after intervention minus the baseline sitting time, also called sedentary time reduction  [43] . SB proportion (%) was the percentage of time spent performing the activities that require \u22641.5 MET of tasks, after the subtraction of sleeping time  [34, 35] . Essentially, it also referred to the SB percentage among all activities, including SB (MET \u22641.5), light physical activity (LPA) (1.5 < MET \u22643), and moderate to vigorous physical activity (MVPA) (MET >3.0)  [28] .\n\nSedentary bout was defined as a continuous period of uninterrupted sedentary time. However, there seemed to be a lack of consensus on the criteria used to determine the sedentary bouts. Six studies used various thresholds for defining sedentary bouts, including 30 minutes  [43] , 20 minutes  [46, 47, 53, 54] , and 10 minutes  [49] . And 1 study reported the average duration of all sedentary bouts  [48] . Six studies presented data on breaks of sedentary time (frequency of interrupted sedentary time per day), using the number of breaks  [38, 48, 49, 52] , and changes in the number of breaks from baseline to end point  [36, 37] . However, only 1 study reported how to determine the \"break\" clearly, stating that a break was defined as a transition from SB (<99 counts per minute, measured by accelerometer; ActiGraph) to any other level of PA (>99 counts per minute) between 2 sedentary bouts (>10 consecutive minutes)  [49] .\n\nIn terms of measurement of SB, most of the researchers (22/26, 84.6%) used objective activity trackers. Four studies adopted subjective methods, including the International Physical Activity Questionnaire  [56, 58] , the Activity Questionnaire for Adolescents and Adults  [42] , and telephone interviews  [45] . Only 2 studies used both an accelerometer and a questionnaire  [51, 58] ."

      "title": "Characteristics of Digital Health Interventions",
      "text": "The intervention primarily targeting SB encompassed screen time limitation (n=2)  [34, 35] , standing (n=6)  [36, 38, 43, 46, 52, 59] , walking (n=9)  [36, 43, [45] [46] [47] 49, 51, 52, 60] , LPA (n=5)  [37, 38, 45, 51, 59] , and MVPA (n=5)  [28, 38, 42, 47, 60] . The majority of these trials (11/16, 68.8%) adopted the combination of these approaches. Regarding SB intervention, the context in which the SB occurred included leisure time, household tasks, transportation, and occupational settings  [65] . Due to this contextrelated characteristic of SB, 4 RCTs explicitly proposed that participants could select the methods and set goals of interrupting SB based on their preference, including using standing desks, standing during phone calls, taking stairs instead of elevators, home-cleaning activities, or other kinds of LPA  [36, 38, 43, 59] . Six studies reported the compensatory SB reduction by increasing PA level (without addressing SB directly)  [28, 44, 50, [55] [56] [57] , which included LPA/MVPA  [50, 55, 57] , cardiac rehabilitation  [56] , and free choice of any kinds of exercise, such as gardening, cycling  [44] , endurance, and strength training  [28] . Motivational counseling or health coaching was also frequently used (8/16, 50%) to assist participants in increasing awareness of the detrimental effects of SB, establishing and revising goals, or receiving personalized prescriptions based on their preferences  [36, 37, 45, 46, 51, 52, 58, 59 ].\n\nMore than one-third of the studies (10/26, 38.5%) adopted a theoretic framework in intervention design and implementation. Three of them applied the Social Cognitive Theory  [36, 56, 60] , incorporating pivotal constructs such as self-efficacy and outcome expectations. This theory emphasized optimization of cognitive, behavioral aspects (eg, self-efficacy and skill mastery), and environmental influences (eg, peer support and barriers to action) to facilitate behavioral modifications. Two studies applied the Self-regulation Theory, which reinforced an individual's attitude and behavioral intention to change. Moreover, the discrepancy between a person's goal and the actual situation also served as a catalyst for behavioral transformations  [42, 49] . Other studies were based on the principle of Self-efficacy Theory  [37] , Theory of Planned Behavior  [42] , Acceptance Commitment Therapy  [45] , intervention mapping adaption framework  [43] , or Cognitive Behavioral Therapy  [58] . In summary, these theories were used to facilitate the reduction of SB or enhancement of PA by influencing individuals' attitudes, beliefs, motivations, and cognitive processes. The intervention duration ranged from a minimum of 6 weeks to a maximum of 24 months, with a median duration of 6 months. Three months accounted for the highest proportion (7/26, 26.9%)."

      "title": "Digital Technologies Used in the Interventions",
      "text": "Three kinds of digital technologies were adopted in the intervention, including phone (phone calls, text messages, and apps), web (email and web-based messages), and activity trackers (accelerometer, pedometer, and heart rate monitor). Two studies used all 3 types of digital technologies  [53, 54] , while 16 RCTs used 2 kinds  [28, 38, 41, 43, 44, [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] 56, 57, 59, 60 ] and 8 studies used 1 type such as phone calls (n=5), text messages (n=2), and web (n=1)  [34] [35] [36] [37] 42, 45, 55, 58] . Phone-based digital health interventions were the most prevalent (22/26, 84.6%), including phone calls and short text messages, which were applied to remind participants to adhere to the interventions. Two studies used common phone-based apps, such as WhatsApp  [57]  and WeChat  [56] , for liaison with participants, while others developed tailored ones, such as Mijn Actieplan  [49]  and Heathesteps  [60] , to support self-monitoring, reminding, and goal attaining. One study stated that they used a virtual coach in the smartphone app to provide personalized prescriptions and help participants maintain their goals  [60] . However, details were limited even in the protocol  [66] .\n\nWeb-based interventions accounted for 26.92% (7/26) in all studies, and more than half of the interventions (4/7, 57.10%) were in combination with phones to facilitate the goal attainment process or disseminate supportive information  [49, 54, 56, 60] . It also served as a management platform for researchers to access participants' SB status in a real-time manner, which enabled timely feedback, information sharing, and encouragement to attain the designed goals  [55] .\n\nHalf of the studies (13/26, 50%) used activity trackers, including wearable accelerometer (wrist, hip, or pocketworn)  [38, 41, 43, [46] [47] [48] [52] [53] [54] , pedometer  [51] , and heart rate monitor  [51] , for data collection, self-monitoring, and safety assurance. Two of them implemented alerts in the accelerometer using vibrotactile feedback  [43]  or visual \"move\" display with an audible beep  [46] , which directly and efficiently reminded patients about their unconscious long-time sitting. Six studies synchronized activity trackers with phone-based apps via Bluetooth or GPS automatically, enabling researchers or health professionals to provide timely feedback or help participants to self-monitor their behavior, such as SB or PA  [38, 43, 46, 48, 53, 59 ]."

Domains assessed as having a high risk of bias were attributed to the missing outcome data. Three papers had no description of the allocation concealment  [28, 50, 58] . One study had unbalanced baseline data regarding marital status and employment status (P<.05)  [57] . One study reported longer sitting time in the intervention group than in the control group (9.8 vs 8.8 hours per day) at baseline  [37] . No study adopted blinding because it was not possible due to the nature of the intervention. The majority of the studies used the intention-to-treat analysis, while 3 studies applied the on-protocol analysis  [28, 50, 59] . For the domain of missing outcome data, only 8 of the studies reported a data availability of \u226595%  [37, 38, 43, 46, 47, 53, 54, 58] .

The overall sitting time was significantly decreased with a pooled MD of 30. Subgroup analyses were conducted based on disease classification, age group, theoretical framework, primary or compensatory SB reduction, intervention duration, and objective or subjective measurement of SB. There was no significant reduction in overall sitting time (minutes per day) among patients with specific kinds of chronic diseases, including obesity, RA, CAD, cancer, T2DM, MetS, and stroke. As for age groups, only those aged 65 years and younger showed a noticeable decline in sitting time (MD -35.74 minutes per day; 95% CI -57.20 to -14.28; I 2 =66%; P=.001). Both theory-based and non-theory-based interventions had a significant effect on reducing sitting time, while the theory-based interventions demonstrated a greater reduction (MD -52.48 vs -17.20 minutes per day).\n\nA meta-analysis was conducted separately for studies primarily focusing on SB or PA (compensatory SB reduction). The results showed that compensatory SB exhibited a significant decrease (MD -47.58 minutes per day; 95% CI -84.94 to -10.22; I 2 =77%; P=.01). Regarding the duration of interventions, both the short duration (\u22643 months) and the long duration (>3 months) significantly decreased sitting time (MD -55.89 minutes per day; MD -18.86 minutes per day). One study reported an average sedentary time of 18.8 hours based on objective measurement, which was clinically unreasonable and might include sleeping time  [58] . Therefore, the subjective data on sedentary time was extracted in this study. The results showed that only those objectively measured sedentary time reduced 22.20 minutes per day significantly (95% CI -39.07 to -5.33; I 2 =42%; P=.01).

    {
      "title": "Principal Findings",
      "text": "The findings of this review supported the effectiveness of digital health interventions in modifying SB, leading to a reduction in overall sitting time, pre-post sitting time changes, and SB proportion among patients with chronic diseases. The use of digital technology, including mobile phone, web, and activity trackers, facilitated real-time self-monitoring, personalized feedback, and automatic reminders, and elevated motivation and engagement in reducing SB.\n\nPrevious researches have shown that SB, characterized by low energy expenditure, was associated with an elevated risk of all-cause mortality in a clear dose-response pattern  [12] . This correlation was particularly prominent among individuals who led sedentary lifestyles, notably in those with chronic diseases  [67] . The advancement of digital technology could improve the efficacy of the intervention implementation  [68] . In this review, the overall sitting time decreased by 30.80 minutes per day, which was less than the 42.28 minutes per day reduction in SB observed in a previous meta-analysis evaluating digital technology-enhanced interventions on SB among healthy adults in a workplace setting  [69] . This difference may be explained by different populations (healthy vs unhealthy populations) and settings. Gardner et al  [70]  supported this explanation by noting that workplace SB was more receptive to routinization than nonworkplace SB. Another systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of interventions using wearable activity trackers to enhance PA and reduce SB in hospitalized patients, indicating an average reduction of 35.46 minutes per day in sitting time  [23] . However, a different meta-analysis including 48 papers revealed that wearable activity trackers effectively improved conscious exercise behavior, such as steps and MVPA in daily life, but they were not effective in modifying habitual behaviors, such as SB  [71] . Variations in the target population and the diverse array of digital technologies used may contribute to the discrepancies in results across the referenced studies and this study. There were no confirmed results regarding the effectiveness of digital health interventions on SB among specific chronic disease due to the limited number of available studies (n\u22644). This notion was also highlighted in a scoping review that evaluated the efficacy of mHealth interventions in addressing PA and SB among survivors from cancer. The evidence on SB was inconclusive, primarily attributed to the limited number of available studies  [72] . In another systematic review and meta-analysis examining mHealth app interventions in reducing sedentary time among older adults, the findings did not achieve statistical significance, possibly due to the limited sample size  [25] . Therefore, more studies targeting different kinds of chronic diseases are warranted. The results were more promising for those aged 65 years and younger, which was reasonable that younger patients may be more adaptable and easier to incorporate new technologies into interventions. However, individuals aged older than 65 years were more likely to experience multiple chronic diseases and complex health conditions, making the maintenance of an active lifestyle particularly crucial for them. Hence, future study needs to explore effective strategies to enhance the efficacy of digital health interventions aimed at reducing SB among older adults, such as improving their digital health literacy  [73] .\n\nTheory-based approaches showed a higher reduction in overall sitting time than no-theory-based interventions. Social Cognitive Theory was the most extensively applied framework. This theory focused on individuals' perceptions, beliefs, and expectations regarding SB  [74] , aiming to raise awareness of the harmful consequences of SB, emphasize the benefits of any level of activity, and promote changes in SB  [75] . It was also reasonable to observe a greater SB reduction in the short term than in the long term (55.89 minutes per day vs 18.86 minutes per day). This suggested that maintaining SB reduction was still challenging due to the diminishing novelty of technology-mediated interventions  [69]  and additional efforts were needed to stimulate long-term SB reduction. For instance, individualized cognitive-behavioral telephone supports were proven effective in sustaining the reduction of SB for at least half a year  [58] . The involvement of participants' respective centers in digital health interventions may escalate trust, facilitate information sharing, and encourage seeking support and feedback as necessary for sustained engagement over an extended duration  [57] . In addition, improving awareness of SB-related health issues, addressing long sitting time patterns  [58] , and replacing SB with LPA together with the individual in daily life perspective  [36]  may prolong the long-term impact of reducing SB. Only the objective sitting time reduction was significant, while the subjective measurements varied a lot and had high heterogeneity (I 2 =96%). SB and PA were 2 of the 3 main categories of 24-hour movement and nonmovement behaviors and were interchangeable with each other  [29] . For approaches targeting SB reduction, standing, walking, LPA, and MVPA were the most common substitutes. For studies focused on PA increase solely, we also found a compensatory SB reduction significantly (47.58 minutes per day). However, previous research mentioned that individuals may engage in increased SB after exercise training, which could be attributed to the perception that they earned the right to be sedentary due to their earlier PA  [76] . The difference may be explained by different target populations, and further studies are necessary to conclude the difference and interactive mechanism between primary and compensatory SB reduction.\n\nSedentary bout, an important aspect of SB, showed no significant alteration after digital health interventions. Among the original trials that emphasized the reduction of sedentary bouts or set an upper limit time on sedentary time  [47, 53, 54] , only 1 study demonstrated a significant decrease in sedentary bouts (MD -42 minutes per day; 95% CI -83 to -2; P=.04)  [46] . Notably, sedentary bouts \u226530 minutes were linked to a higher risk of all-cause mortality compared with shorter bouts  [77] [78] [79] . Furthermore, among individuals with similar total sitting time, frequent interruptions of sitting were associated with lower cardiovascular risks  [80] . Given the insufficient focus on breaks in SB (n=3) in the included studies, further research in this area is also warranted."

    {
      "title": "Strengths and Limitations",
      "text": "The comprehensive search strategy was solely based on RCTs and most of the selected trials had a low risk of bias. We prioritized the use of objective measures of SB in the meta-analysis, making the results of the meta-analysis more reliable. Moreover, we performed subgroup analyses based on whether the interventions targeted SB directly or indirectly to distinguish primary SB reduction from compensatory changes of SB after PA interventions.\n\nThere were also certain limitations. First, this review selected only those papers published in English, which may exist a language bias. Second, the limited number of RCTs included in subgroup analyses posed a challenge in identifying potential sources of bias, particularly when focusing on specific types of chronic diseases. Third, the substantial heterogeneity observed in the contents of the interventions and the joint application of digital technologies constrained the ability to interpret the individual contribution of each approach or technology. Therefore, caution is warranted when interpreting the results, and further research that compares different delivery methods of digital health interventions is necessary to provide more robust evidence. While it is not feasible to conduct a meta-analysis to compare different technologies, the findings emphasized the potential effectiveness of different combinations of digital technologies in reducing SB. In addition, a few publications were identified as study protocols or pilot studies, necessitating their exclusion with the intent to update at a later time."

      "text": "In clinical practice, nurses could leverage phone, web, or activity tracker-based interventions to offer support to sedentary patients with chronic diseases, which may effectively reduce their sitting time and then facilitate better disease management.\n\nThe digital health interventions with rigorous design targeting SB reduction remain limited, particularly for certain type of chronic illnesses. Additionally, it is recommended to place a greater emphasis on addressing sedentary bouts and breaks, rather than solely focusing on reducing overall sitting time. Meanwhile, this review reveals a reduction in compensatory SB reduction following PA interventions, which has not been widely studied before. Further research is needed to understand the underlying mechanisms and their implications for behavior modification."
