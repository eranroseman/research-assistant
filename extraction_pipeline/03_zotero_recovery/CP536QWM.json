  "abstract": "\u00ae D uring the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, social distancing requirements compelled health systems, practices, clinicians, and patients to use video and telephone visits as alternatives to in-person visits. 1 This shift was further supported by policy changes-for example, CMS offered temporary payment parity across in-person, telephone, and video visits.  2  There are concerns that the shift to telemedicine may exacerbate disparities in health care access. Early evidence on telemedicine use overall has demonstrated less use among female and non-Englishspeaking patients compared with other groups, but no differences among racial/ethnic groups.  3, 4 iven key trade-offs between telemedicine modalities, there may be additional, potentially concerning differences in access to video and telephone visits. Compared with telephone visits, video visits allow some aspects of a physical examination and a more personal connection between clinicians and patients. However, video requires more complex setup and broadband internet access, which may present barriers for older adults, racial/ethnic minorities, and those with limited English proficiency (LEP) who are on the wrong side of the \"digital divide.\" The digital divide refers to the gap between those who have access to and can meaningfully engage with technology and those who cannot. For example, at least 21 million people lack broadband internet access in the United States, many from underserved communities that also face worse health outcomes. 5  Further, a recent study suggests that 13 million older adults are not ready for video visits due to difficulties using technology.  6 Video visits may also present technical and logistical challenges for some practices and clinicians to set up and incorporate into workflows. However, we know little about differences in and drivers of the use of video vs telephone visits. Therefore, we analyzed detailed electronic health record (EHR) data from a large, integrated health system to fill these gaps. \n Objectives Understanding drivers of differences in use of telephone and video visits would help to inform rapidly changing telemedicine payment policies and practices. In this study, we examined trends",

We then focused on the period April 23 to June 1 (the study period), which began 1 month after the shift to telemedicine (Massachusetts issued a stay-at-home advisory on March 23). We chose this period to bypass transition challenges, including rapid workflow and technical requirements, that could affect initial uptake of video visits. During this period, we examined trends in the percentage of all telemedicine visits done via video by patient sociodemographic categories. We assessed predictors of video vs telephone use with bivariate analyses using \u03c7 2 tests and t tests as appropriate for the previously described patient-and zip code-level variables. We then built a multivariable logistic regression model in which the outcome was video or telephone visit. Finally, we built a hierarchical logistic regression model to determine the relative contribution of patient-, physician-, and practice-level components to variance in the choice of video or telephone visits. Hierarchical models account for the fact that patients are nested within clinicians and clinicians are nested within clinics. In a sensitivity analysis, we repeated our main analyses among primary care practices alone. The MGB Institutional Review Board approved this study and waived the use of informed consent. Analyses were performed using R statistical software (version 3.5.3)."

These trends developed early and grew steadily over time.\n\nDuring the study period, 162,102 patients (21.7% of all attributed patients) attended 231,596 visits to primary care and specialty practices.

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "At a large, integrated health system scaling telemedicine visits in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we found lower use of video vs telephone visits among older, Black, Hispanic, and Spanish-speaking patients that developed almost immediately and persisted. We also found that clinicians and practices largely drove this variation in the use of video vs telephone visits, suggesting an important target for intervention. Various factors likely influence the choice between a telephone and video visit, including patient access to technology, an organization's telemedicine infrastructure, and patient and clinician preferences. To the extent that video is better than telephone, it is important to expand access to video visits. At the same time, given that telephone visits may be more accessible for some and are often reasonable substitutes, it will be important to offer patients flexibility and ensure payment parity for both visit types.\n\nWe found that Spanish-speaking patients were less likely to use video visits. This extends prior findings that showed decreased telemedicine use among patients with LEP.  3, 9 For example, Eberly et al found that non-English-speaking patients were 50% less likely to use telemedicine, although they did not find differences in video visit use.  3  Given these findings, practices might develop video visit workflows that integrate interpreter services and assign dedicated language-concordant guides to train patients in the use of video visits.\n\nWe found that patients in areas with lower levels of broadband internet access were less likely to engage in video visits, corroborating prior work showing that internet access predicts telemedicine use and patient portal adoption.  10, 11 Importantly, internet access is necessary yet not sufficient for use of video visits. Patients must also have a video-enabled device, as well as digital literacy, or the ability to navigate telehealth platforms, which underserved and older patients often lack.  12, 13 linician-and practice-level factors contributed to the gaps in video visit use. Clinicians and practices that serve primarily underserved patients may be less equipped to provide video visits given additional implementation requirements. Thus, a focus on supporting video visit infrastructure and training clinicians on using video visits may help address these challenges. Due in part (CONTINUED FROM PAGE 22)"

      "text": "to implicit biases, clinicians may also offer telephone over video visits for some patients based on assumptions about their ability or desire to engage in video visits.  [14] [15] 5] [16] [17]  A structured approach to screening patients for video visit readiness can help check these assumptions. Further, practices should develop efficient workflows to make it easy for both patients and clinicians to use video visits.\n\nAddressing differences in use the of visit modalities will require a multilevel approach. To ensure that greater telephone visit use among underserved populations does not contribute to decreased access to medical care, payment parity for telephone and video visits is critical. In March 2020, CMS extended parity for both telephone and video relative to in-person visits; these changes should persist beyond the pandemic, and commercial payers should follow suit. In addition, policy initiatives to narrow digital divides, such as investments in telemedicine and broadband infrastructure, are essential. Policy makers should establish universal broadband laws and funding to ensure that patients have essential digital access and to mitigate pressures faced by health systems to connect their patients. The recent COVID-19 Telehealth Program, which provided $200 million for health care organizations to expand their telemedicine infrastructure, is a start.  18 At the organizational level, effective workflows are important to ensure that patients and providers feel satisfied with care in the digital setting. Additionally, collaboration with community organizations already focusing on digital literacy will address digital divides in local communities. Finally, EHR and telemedicine vendors should develop inclusive platforms that account for the varied literacy, numeracy, and usability needs of underserved and older populations."
