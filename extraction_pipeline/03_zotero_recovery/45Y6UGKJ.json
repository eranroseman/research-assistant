      "text": "The use and development of mobile interventions are experiencing rapid growth. Mobile interventions are used across the health fields and include treatments to improve HIV medication adherence  [1, 2] , to increase activity  [3] , supplement counseling/ pharmacotherapy in treatment for substance use  [4, 5] , reinforce abstinence in addictions  [6, 7]  and to support recovery from alcohol dependence  [8, 9] . Mobile interventions for adherence to anti-retroviral therapy and smoking cessation have shown sufficient effectiveness and replicability in trials and have been recommended for inclusion in health services  [10] .\n\nHowever, as Nilsen et al.  [11]  state, \"In fact, the development of mHealth technologies is currently progressing at a much faster pace than the science to evaluate their validity and efficacy, introducing the risk that ineffective or even potentially harmful or iatrogenic applications will be implemented.\" Indeed reviews, while reporting preliminary evidence of effectiveness, call for more programmatic, data-based approaches to constructing mobile interventions  [10, 12] . In particular, these reviews call for research that focuses on datainformed development of these complex multi-component interventions prior to their evaluation in standard randomized controlled trials. But methods for using data to inform the design and evaluation of adaptive mobile interventions have lagged behind the use and deployment of these interventions  [11, 13, 14] .\n\nMany mobile interventions are designed to be \"just-in-time\" interventions, meaning that they intend to provide treatments that help an individual make healthy decisions in the moment, such as engaging in a desirable behavior (e.g., taking a medication on time) or effectively coping with a stressful situation. As such, mobile interventions are often intended to have proximal, near-term effects. A first approach toward developing data-based methods for evaluation of mobile health interventions is to provide an experimental design for testing the proximal effects of the treatments. This paper proposes a micro-randomized trial design for this purpose. In a micro-randomized trial, treatments are sequentially randomized throughout the conduct of the study, with the result that each participant may be randomized at the hundreds or thousands of occasions at which a treatment might be provided. This repeated randomization of treatments under investigation enables causal modeling of each treatment's time-varying proximal effect as well as modeling of time-varying effect moderation. Thus, the micro-randomized trial can be seen as a first experimental step in the development of effective mobile interventions that are composed of sequences of treatments. We propose to size the trial to detect the proximal main effect of the treatments. This is akin to the use of factorial designs for use in constructing multi-component interventions. In these factorial designs  [15, 16] , a first analysis often involves testing if the main effect of each treatment is equal to 0. This work is motivated by our collaboration on the HeartSteps mobile application for increasing physical activity, which we will use to illustrate our discussion. One of the treatments in HeartSteps is suggestions for physical activity which are tailored to the person's current context. HeartSteps can deliver these suggestions at any of the five time intervals during the day, which correspond roughly to morning commute, mid-day, midafternoon, evening commute, and post-dinner times. When a suggestion is delivered, the user's phone plays a notification sound, vibrates and lights up, and the suggestion is displayed on the lock screen of the phone. These suggestions encourage activity in the current context and are intended to have an effect (getting a person to walk) within the next hour.\n\nIn the following section, we introduce the micro-randomized trial design. In section 3 we precisely define the proximal main effect of a treatment, using the language of potential outcomes. We develop the test statistic for assessing the proximal effect of a treatment as well as an associated sample size calculator in section 4 and 5. Next we provide simulation evaluation of the sample size calculator. We end, in Section 7, with a discussion.\n\nIn HeartSteps, data (S t ) is collected both passively via sensors and via participant self-report. Each participant is provided a \"Jawbone\" band, worn at the wrist, which collects daily step count and the amount of sleep the user had the previous night. Furthermore sensors on the phone are used to collect a variety of information at each of the 5 time points during the day, including the time-stamp, location, busyness of planned activities on the phone calendar and other activity on the phone. Each evening, self-report data is collected including utility and burden ratings. The proximal response, Y t+1 , for activity suggestions is the step count in the hour following time t.\n\nA decision time is a point in time at which-based on participant's current state, past behavior, or current context-treatment may need to be delivered. Decision times vary by the nature of the intervention component. In HeartSteps, the decision times for activity suggestions are 5 times per day over the 42 day study duration. For an alcohol-recovery application that provides an intervention when an individual goes within 10 feet of a high risk location (e.g. a liquor store), decision points might be every 1 minute, the frequency at which the application would get the person's current location and assess whether she is close to a high-risk location. In a long-term study of an intervention for multiple health behaviors, the decision points might be weekly or monthly at which times, decisions are made regarding whether to change the focus from one behavior (e.g., physical activity) to another (e.g., diet). Finally, in many studies there is an option for an individual to press a \"panic\" button, indicating the need for help; for such interventions, decision times correspond to times at which the panic button is pressed.\n\nA micro-randomized trial is a trial in which at each decision time t, participants are randomized to a treatment option, denoted by A t . Treatment options may correspond to whether or not a treatment is provided at a decision time; for example in HeartSteps, whether or not the individual is provided a lock-screen activity suggestion. Or treatment options may be alternative types of treatment that can be provided at the same decision time; for example, a daily step goal treatment might have two options, a fixed 10,000-steps-a-day goal or an adaptive goal based on the user's activity level on the previous day. Considerations of treatment burden often imply that the randomization will not be uniform. For example in HeartSteps, the randomization probability is 0.4, so that, if an individual is always available, on average 2 lock-screen activity messages are delivered per day.\n\nIn designing, that is, determining the sample size for, a micro-randomized trial we focus on the reduced longitudinal data The variable, I t is an \"availability\" indicator. The availability indicator is coded as I t = 1 if the individual is available for treatment and I t = 0 otherwise. At some decision times feasibility, ethics or burden considerations mean that the individual is unavailable for treatment and thus A t should not be delivered. Consider again HeartSteps: if sensors indicate that the individual is likely driving a car or the individual is currently walking, then the lockscreen activity message should not be sent. Other examples of when individuals are unavailable for treatment include: in the alcohol recovery setting, an \"warning\" treatment would only be potentially provided when sensors indicate that the individual is within 10 feet of a high risk location or a treatment might only be provided if the individual reports a high level of craving. If the application has a panic button, then only in an x second interval in which the panic button is pressed is it appropriate to provide \"panic button\" treatments. Individuals may be unavailable for treatment by choice. For example, the HeartSteps application permits the individual to turn off the lock-screen activity messages; this option is considered critical to maintaining participant buy-in and engagement with HeartSteps. After viewing the lock-screen activity message, the individual has the option of turning off the lock-screen messages for 4, 8 or 12 hours. After the specified time interval, the delivery of lock-screen messages automatically turns on again. To summarize, the availability indicator at time t is the indicator for the subpopulation at time t among which we are interested in assessing the proximal main effect of the treatment; we are uninterested in assessing the proximal main effect of a treatment among individuals for whom it is unethical to provide treatment or for whom it makes no scientific sense to provide treatment or among those who refuse to be provided a treatment."

      "title": "Proximal Main Effect of a Treatment",
      "text": "As discussed above, treatments in mobile health interventions are often designed so as to have a proximal effect (e.g., increase activity in near future, help an individual manage current cravings for drugs or food, take medications on schedule, etc.). As a result, a first question in developing a mobile health intervention is whether the treatments have a proximal effect. Here we develop sample size formulae that guarantee a stated power to detect the proximal effect of a treatment. In particular we aim to test if the proximal main effect is zero.\n\nTo define the proximal main effect of a treatment, we use potential outcomes  [17, 18, 19] . Our use of potential outcome notation is slightly more complicated than usual because treatment can only be provided when an individual is available. As a result, we index the potential outcomes by decision rules that incorporate availability. In particular define d(a, i) for a \u2208 {0,1}, i \u2208 {0,1} by d(a,0) =\"unavailable-do nothing\" and d(a,1) = a. Then for each a 1 \u2208 1 = {0,1}, define D 1 (a 1 ) = d(a 1 , I 1 ). Then we denote the potential proximal responses \u2026,a t ) \u2208 t = {(a 1 , \u2026,a t )|a i \u2208 {0,1}, i = 1, \u2026, t}, define and . For each \u0101 t = (a 1 , \u2026,a t ) \u2208 t , the potential proximal response is (following decision time t -1) and potential availability indicator is at decision time t.\n\nWe define the proximal main effect of a treatment at time t among available individuals by: where the expectation is taken with respect to the distribution of the potential outcomes and randomization in \u0100 t-1 . This proximal effect is conditional in that the effect of treatment at time t is defined for only individuals available for treatment at time t, that is, . This proximal effect is a main effect in that the effect is marginal over any effects of \u0100 t-1 .\n\nThe former conditional aspect of the definition is related to the concept of viable or feasible dynamic treatment regimes  [20, 21]  in which one assesses only the causal effect of treatments that can actually be provided.\n\nConsider the proximal main effect, \u03b2(t), as t varies across time. \u03b2(t) may vary across time for a variety of reasons. To see this consider the case of HeartSteps. Here \u03b2(t) might initially increase with increasing t as participants learn and practice the activities suggested on the lock-screen. For larger t one might expect to see decreasing or flat \u03b2(t) due to habituation (participants begin to, at least partially, ignore the messages). This time variation in \u03b2(t) can be attributed to both the immediate effect of a lock-screen activity message as well as interactions between the past lock-screen activity messages and the present activity message; the time variation occurs at least partially due to the marginal character of \u03b2(t). Alternately the conditional definition of \u03b2(t) means that the effect is only defined among the population of individuals who are available at decision time t. Changes in this population may cause changes in \u03b2(t) across time. Again consider HeartSteps. At earlier time points, participants may be highly engaged, yet have not developed habits that in various ways increase their activity, thus most participants will be available. However as time progresses, some participants may develop sufficiently positive activity habits or anticipate activity suggestions, thus at later decision times these participants may be already active and thus unavailable to receive a suggestion. Other participants may become increasing disengaged and repeatedly turn off the lock-screen activity messages; these participants are also unavailable. Thus as time progresses, \u03b2(t) may vary due to the subpopulation of participants among whom it is appropriate to assess the effect of the lock-screen activity messages.\n\nOur main objective in determining the sample size will be to assure sufficient power to detect alternatives to the null hypothesis of no proximal main effect, H 0 : \u03b2(t) = 0, t = 1, \u2026 T for a trial with T decision points (if \u03b2(t) is nonzero then for the population available at decision time t, there is a proximal effect). The proposed test will be focused on detecting smooth, i.e., continuous in t, alternatives to this null hypothesis.\n\nTo express \u03b2(t) in terms of the observed data distribution, we assume consistency  [18, 19] . This assumption is that for each t, the observed Y t and observed I t equal the corresponding potential outcomes, whenever \u0100 t-1 = \u0101 t-1 . This assumption may be violated if some of the treatments promote social linkages between participants, for example, to enhance social/emotional support or to compete in mobile games. In these cases it would be more appropriate to additionally index each individual's potential outcomes by other participants' treatments. The micro-randomization plus the consistency assumption implies that the proximal main effect of treatment at time t among available individuals, \u03b2(t) can be written as, where the second equality follows from the randomization of the A t 's and the last equality follows from the consistency assumption."

      "title": "Test Statistic",
      "text": "Our sample size formula is based on a test statistic for use in testing H 0 : \u03b2(t) = 0, t = 1, \u2026 T against a scientifically plausible alternative. This alternative should be formed based on conversations with domain experts. Here we construct a test statistic to detect alternatives that are, at least approximately, linear in a vector parameter, \u03b2, that is, alternatives of the form , where the p \u00d71 vector, Z t , is a function of t and covariates that are unaffected by treatment such as time of day or day of week. In the case of HeartSteps, a plausible alternative is quadratic:\n\n(1)\n\nwhere \u03b2 = (\u03b2 1 ,\u03b2 2 ,\u03b2 3 )\u2032 (p = 3). Recall that in HeartSteps there are 5 decision times per day;\n\ntranslates decision times t to days. This rather simplistic parametrization marginalizes across the day and treats the weekends and weekdays similarly.\n\nWe propose to use the alternate, , t = 1, \u2026, T to construct the test statistic. We base the test statistic on the estimator of \u03b2 in a least squares fit of a working model. A simple working model based on the alternative is:\n\n(2) over all t \u2208 {1, \u2026, T}, where \u03c1 t is the known randomization probability (P[A t = 1] = \u03c1 t ) and the q \u00d71 vector B t is a function of t and covariates that are unaffected by treatment such as time of day or day of week. Note that A t is centered by subtracting off the randomization probability; thus the working model for\n\n. The estimators \u03b1 \u0302, \u03b2 \u0302 minimize the least squares error:\n\n(\n\nwhere \u2119 N {f (X)}is defined as the average of f (X) over the sample.\n\nNote that from a technical perspective, minimizing the least squares criterion, (3), is reminiscent of a GEE analysis  [22]  with identity link function and a working correlation matrix equal to the identity. Thus it is natural to consider a non-identity working correlation matrix as is common in GEE. This, however, is problematic from a causal inference perspective. To see this suppose that the true conditional expectation is in fact , that is, the causal parameter, \u03b2(t) is equal to . Further suppose that the working correlation matrix has off-diagonal elements and that we estimate \u03b2 * by minimizing the weighted (by the inverse of the working correlation matrix) least squares criterion. In this case the resulting estimating equations include sums of terms such as for t > s. Unfortunately, both availability at time t, I t , as well as Y t+1 may be affected by treatment in the past (in particular, A s ), thus absent strong assumptions is unlikely to be 0. Recall that a minimal condition for consistency of estimators of (\u03b1 * ,\u03b2 * ) is that the estimating equations have expectation 0, thus absent further assumptions, the estimators derived from the weighted least squares criterion are likely biased. Another possibility is to include a time-varying variance term in the least squares criterion, that is the tth entry in (3) might be weighted by a . This would be useful in the data analysis, however for sample size calculations, values of these variances are unlikely to be available. Thus for simplicity we use the unweighted least squares criterion in  (3) .\n\nAssume that the matrices and are invertible. The least squares estimators, \u03b1 \u0302, \u03b2 \u0302 are consistent estimators of (  4 ) and  (5)  respectively. Furthermore if \u03b2(t) is in fact equal to for some \u03b2, then . This is the case even if . In the appendix (Lemma 1), we prove these results and also show that, under moment conditions, is asymptotically normal with mean 0 and variance \u03a3 \u03b2 =Q -1 WQ -1 where, and . To test the null hypothesis H 0 :\n\none can use a test statistic based on the alternative, e.g. (6)  where \u03a3 \u0302\u03b2 = Q -1 \u0174 Q -1 and Q \u0302 and \u0174 are plug in estimators. Note that this test statistic results from a GEE analysis with identity link function and a working correlation matrix equal to the identity matrix for which sample size formulae have been developed  [23] . We build on this work as follows. As Tu et al.  [23]  discuss, under the null hypothesis the large sample distribution of this statistic is a chi-squared with p degrees of freedom distribution. If N, the sample size, is small, then, as recommended by Mancl and DeRouen  [24] , we make small adjustments to improve the small sample approximation to the distribution of the test statistic. In particular, they recommend adjusting \u0174 using the \"hat\" matrix; see the formulae for the adjusted \u0174 as well as Q \u0302 in Appendix A. Also in small sample settings, investigators commonly suggest that instead of using a critical value based on the chi-squared distribution, a critical value based on the t-distribution should be used  [25] . As we are considering a simultaneous test for multiple parameters we form the critical value based on Hotelling's T-squared distribution  [26] . Hotelling's T-squared distribution is a multiple of the F distribution given by ; here we use d 1 = p and d 2 = N-q-p (recall q is the number of parameters in the nuisance parameter vector, \u03b1); see the appendix for a rationale. In the following, the rejection region for the test of H 0 : \u03b2(t) = 0, t = 1, \u2026 T based on (  6 ) is where \u03b1 0 is the desired significance level."

      "title": "Sample Size Formulae",
      "text": "As Tu et. al  [23]  have developed general sample size formulas in the GEE setting, here we focus on considerations specific to the setting of micro-randomized trials. To size the study, we will determine the sample size needed to detect the alternate, \u03b2(t) with: Working Assumptions: To derive the sample size formula, we use the form of the noncentrality parameter of the limiting non-central chi-squared distribution, along with working assumptions. The working assumptions are used to simplify the form of . In particular, we make the following working assumptions: a.\n\n, for some \u03b1 \u2208 \u211d q b. for some\n\nwhere, as before, . See appendix A (Lemma 2) for proof of variance formulas under these working assumptions. The above working assumptions are somewhat simplistic but as will be seen below the resulting sample size formula is robust to moderate violations. First, under these working assumptions the alternative hypothesis can be re-written as  (7)  where d is a p dimensional vector of standardized effects. Furthermore, \u03a3 \u03b2 is given by and thus c N is given by  (8)  To improve the small sample approximation, we use the multiple of the F-distribution as discussed above. Thus the sample size, N, is found by solving  (9)  where F p,N-q-p;c N is the noncentral F distribution with noncentrality parameter, c N and 1-\u03b2 0 is the desired power. The inputs to this sample size formula are , a scientifically meaningful value for d (see below for an illustration), the time-varying availability pattern, , the desired significance level, \u03b1 0 and power, 1-\u03b2 0 . Now we describe how the information needed in the sample size formula might be obtained when the alternative is quadratic (p = 3, (1)). In this case we first elicit the initial standardized proximal main effect given by . Second we elicit the averaged across time, standardized proximal main effect . Lastly we elicit the time at which the proximal main effect is maximal, i.e. . These three quantities can then be used to solve for d = (d 1 ,d 2 ,d 3 )\u2032. For example, in HeartSteps, we might want to determine the sample size to ensure 80% power when there is no initial treatment effect on the first day, and the maximum proximal main effect comes around day 29. We specify the expected availability, E[I t ] to be constant in t and Z t is given by (1). Table  I  gives sample sizes for HeartSteps under a variety of average standardized proximal main effects (d \u0304).\n\nIn the behavioral sciences a standardized effect size of 0.2 is considered small  [27] . Thus given the very small standardized effect sizes, the sample sizes given in Table  I  seem unbelievably small. Two points are worth making in this regard. First the use of the alternative parametric hypothesis  (7)  in forming the test statistic, implies that both betweensubject as well as within-subject contrasts in proximal responses are used to detect the alternative. To see this, note that if we focused on only the first time point, t = 1, and tested H 0 : \u03b2(1) = 0, then an appropriate test would be a two-sample t-test based on the proximal response Y 2 , in which case the required sample size would be much larger (akin to the sample size for a two arm randomized-controlled trial in which 40% of the subjects are randomized to the treatment arm). This two-sample t-test uses only between-subject contrasts in proximal response to test the hypothesis. The required sample size would be even larger for a test of H 0 : \u03b2(1) = 0, \u03b2(2) = 0 in which no relationship between \u03b2(1) and \u03b2(2) is assumed. Conversely the sample size would be smaller if one focused on detecting alternatives to H 0 : \u03b2(1) = 0, \u03b2(2) = 0 of the form H 1 : \u03b2(1) = \u03b2(2) \u2260 0. The use of the alternative, \u03b2(1) = \u03b2(2) \u2260 0, allows one to construct tests that use both between-subject as well as within-subject contrasts in proximal responses. Our approach is in between these two extremes in that we focus on detecting smooth, in t, alternatives to H 0 : \u03b2(t) = 0 for all t. This permits use of both within-as well as between-subject contrasts in proximal responses. The assumption of a parsimonious alternative enables the use of smaller sample sizes. A second point is that, at this time, there is no general understanding of how large the standardized effect size should be for these \"in-the-moment\" effects of a treatment. Thus these standardized effects may or may not be considered small in future."

      "title": "Simulations",
      "text": "We consider a variety of simulations with different generative models to evaluate the performance of the sample size formulae. In the simulations presented here, we use the same setup as in HeartSteps; see Appendix B for simulations in other setups (Table  4B ). Specifically, the duration of the study is 42 days and there are 5 decision times within each day (T = 210). The randomization probability is 0.4, i.e. \u03c1 = \u03c1 t = P(A t = 1) = 0.4. The sample size formula is given in (  8 ) and (  9 ). All simulations are based on 1,000 simulated data sets. The simulation results provided below illustrate that the sample size formula and associated test statistic are robust. For convenience we summarize the results here. When the working assumptions hold, then under a variety of availability patterns, i.e., time-varying values for \u03c4 t = E[I t ] (see Figure  1 ) the desired Type 1 error and power are preserved. This is also the case when past treatment impacts availability. Furthermore the sample size formula is robust to deviations from the working assumptions, that is, provides the desired Type 1 error and power; this is true for a variety of forms of the true proximal main effect of the treatment (see Figure  2 ), a variety of distributions and correlation patterns for the errors, and dependence of Y t+1 on past treatment. In all cases the above robustness occurs as long as we provide an approximately true or conservative value for the standardized effect, d and if we provide an approximately true or conservative (low) value for the availability, E[I t ].\n\nIn our simulations, we note several areas in which the sample size formula is less robust to the working assumption (c); this is when the error variance in Y t+1 varies depending on whether treatment A t = 1 or A t = 0 or with time t. In particular if the ratio of Var[Y t+1 |I t = 1,\n\n] varies greatly with time t, then the power is reduced. See below for details. Lastly as would be expected for any sample size formula, using values of the standardized effect size, d, or availability that are larger than the truth degrades the power of the procedure."

Neither the working assumptions nor the inputs to the sample size formula specify the error distribution, thus in the simulation we consider 5 distributions for the errors in the model for Y t+1 including independent normal, student's t and exponential distributions as well as two autoregressive (AR) processes; all of these error patterns satisfy . Furthermore neither the working assumptions nor the inputs to the sample size formula specify the dependence of the availability indicator, I t on past treatment. Thus we consider settings in which the availability decreases as the number of recent treatments increases. For brevity, we provide these standard results in the Appendix B (Tables  2B  and  3B ). The results are generally quite good, with very few Type 1 error rates significantly above .05 and power levels significantly below .80."

      "text": "Third, it is critical to use conservative values of d and availability E[I t ] in the sample size formula. It is not surprising that the quality of the sample size formula depends on an accurate or conservative values of the standardized effects, d, as this is the case for all sample size formulas. Additionally availability provides the number of decision points as which treatment might be provided per individual and thus the sample size formula should be sensitive to availability. To illustrate these points we consider two simulations in which the data is generated by where the \u03b5 t 's are i.i.d. standard normals and \u03b1(t) is as in the prior simulations. In the first simulation, suppose the scientist provides the correct availability pattern, , the correct time at which the maximal standardized proximal main effect is achieved (\n\n) and the correct initial standardized proximal main effect ( ) but provides too low a value of the averaged across time, standardized proximal main effect .

      "text": "In this paper, we have introduced the use of micro-randomized trials in mobile health and have provided an approach to determining the sample size. More sophisticated sample size procedures might be entertained. Certainly it makes sense to include baseline information in the sample size procedure, for example in HeartSteps, a natural baseline variable is baseline step count. The inclusion of baseline variables in B t in the regression (2) is straightforward.\n\nAn interesting generalization to the sample size procedure would allow scientists to include time-varying variables (in S t ) as covariates in B t in the regression (2). This might be a useful strategy for reducing the error variance.\n\nAn alternate to the micro-randomized trial design is the single case design often used in the behavioral sciences  [28] . These trials usually only involve 1 to 13 participants  [29]  and the data analyses focus on the examination of visual trends for each participant separately. For example during periods when a participant is on treatment the response might be generally higher than the height of the response during the time periods in which the participant is off treatment. An excellent overview of single case designs and their use for evaluating technology based interventions is  [30] . This paper illustrates the visual analyses that would be conducted on each participant's data. A critical assumption is that the effect of the treatment is only temporary (no carry-over effect) so that each participant can act as his own control. We believe that in settings in which treatments are expected to have sufficiently strong effects so as to overwhelm the within person variability in response (thus a visual analysis can be compelling), these designs provide an alternative to the micro-randomized trial design.\n\nAlthough this paper has focused on determining the sample size to detect the proximal main effect of a treatment with a given power, micro-randomized studies provide data for a variety of interesting further analyses. For example, it is of some interest to model and understand the predictors of the time-varying availability indicator. In the case of HeartSteps we will know why the participant is unavailable (driving a car, already active or has turned off the lock-screen messages) so we will be able to consider each type of availability indicator. Other very interesting further analyses include assessing interactions between treatments, A t and context, S t , past treatment A s , s < t on the proximal response, Y t+1 . Also there is much interest in using this type of data to construct \"dynamic treatment regimes\"; in this setting these are called Just-in-Time Adaptive Interventions  [13] . The sequential microrandomizations enhance all of these analyses by reducing causal confounding. . Furthermore, suppose i > j, then E[\u03b5 \u0303i\u03b5 \u0303j I i I j (A i -\u03c1)(A j -\u03c1)]= E[I i I j (A j -\u03c1)(A i -\u03c1)]\u00d7E[\u03b5 \u0303t\u03b5 \u0303s|I t = 1, I s = 1, A t , A s ] = 0, because A i \u2aeb{I i , I j , A j } and the first term is 0.W is then given by so that and ."
