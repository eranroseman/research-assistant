  "title": "Actual Telemedicine Needs of Japanese Patients with Neurological Disorders in the COVID-19 Pandemic",
  "abstract": "Objective During the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, many social activities have moved online using applications for digital devices (e.g. computers, smartphones). We investigated the needs of telemedicine and trends in medical status and social care situations of Japanese patients with neurological disorders in order to estimate their affinity for an online telemedicine application. Methods We designed an original questionnaire for the present study that asked participants what problems they had with hospital visits, how the COVID-19 pandemic had affected their lives, and whether or not they would like to receive telemedicine. Patients The present study included volunteer caregivers, participants with Parkinson's disease (PD), epilepsy, stroke, dementia, immune-mediated neurological disease (IMMD), spinocerebellar degeneration (SCD), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), headache, myopathy, and other neurological diseases from Okayama University Hospital. Results A total of 29.6% of patients wanted to use telemedicine. Patients with headaches (60.0%) and epilepsy (38.1%) were more likely to want to use telemedicine than patients with PD (17.8%) or stroke (19.0%). Almost 90% of patients had access to a digital device, and there was no association between favoring telemedicine, ownership of a digital device, hospital visiting time, or waiting time at the hospital, although age was associated with motivation to telemedicine use (52.6 vs. 62.2 years old, p<0.001). \n Conclusion We can contribute to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic and the medical economy by promoting telemedicine, especially for young patients with headaches or epilepsy.",

Due to the highly infectious nature of COVID-19, social distancing was recommended for daily life  (1) , a concept expressed as sanmitsu in Japanese, and many social activities consequently moved online using applications for computers or smartphones. In addition, in hospitals, patients have become more sensitive to avoiding hospital visits, and the Japanese government has allowed the indirect prescribing of drugs using a telephone, computer, or smartphone since April 2020. The style of medical care has changed dramatically around the world, especially for patients who are able to use digital devices  (2) . In the field of neurology, there have been several trials of telemedicine promotion, such as teleneurology  (3) , telerehabilitation (4), and telestroke  (5) .\n\nOkayama University Hospital is a core hospital in Okayama City, and our department has continued face-toface medical care for patients with neurological diseases throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. Since the early introduction of telemedicine may be key for controlling patients' visits, it is important to understand their actual attitudes pertaining to telemedicine prior to any policy implementation. 2-2.

Three cases each in the PD group (2.6%) and dementia group (4.5%) and 2 cases in the stroke group (2.5%) had the questionnaire answered by their caregiver. The clinical backgrounds of each patient group are shown in Table  1 . The mean age of all patients at the time of the examination was 59.5 years old. The ratio of men among total patients was 48.4%, which was larger than women among IMND (76.5%) and ALS (70.0%) patients and smaller than women among dementia (29.1%), SCD (29.2%) and headache (10.0%) patients.\n\nThe percentages of patients who wanted to use telemedicine varied in each group [total (n=142, 28.0%), PD (n=21, 17.8%), epilepsy (n=40, 38.1%), stroke (n=15, 19.0%), dementia (n=19, 28.4%), IMND (n=12, 28.6%), SCD (n=14, 34.1%), ALS (n=6, 30.0%), headache (n=12, 60.0%), and myopathy (n=3, 21.4%); Fig.  3 ].

In contrast, patients did not wish to use telemedicine mostly because they wanted to see the doctor directly (22.5%, n=82) and did not have the confidence to use the provided telemedicine tools (19.8%, n=72); few were concerned about leakage of personal information (1.9%, n=7)."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "We developed a questionnaire-based survey to reveal the needs concerning telemedicine among patients attending the outpatient clinic of the Department of Neurology at Okayama University Hospital during the COVID-19 pandemic. Patients with headaches were more likely to want to use telemedicine than others, followed by patients with epilepsy; patients with PD and stroke were less likely to use it. Although almost 90% of patients had access to digital devices (computers or smartphones), there was no association between ownership of digital devices and favoring telemedicine. Similarly, time spent visiting and waiting at the hospital were not related to the desire of a patient to use telemedicine. Patients with a decreased use of their family doctor or nursing care during the pandemic seemed to be likely to use telemedicine than those without a decreased use without significant difference. Only age was a significant factor, with younger patients wanting to use telemedicine more than older patients.\n\nOur finding is consistent with a previous study that found that several headache patients in Japan preferred telemedicine  (6) , with some medical institutes in Japan already starting to provide telemedicine services  (7) , an approach expected to be effective in preventing infection by suppressing the number of patients who leave their homes  (8) . Some stable patients with chronic headaches have prescriptions that have not changed over a long period of time. In addition, some anti-calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) antibody drugs, such as galcanezumab, erenumab, and fremanezumab, have recently been used for chronic migraine and have shown high therapeutic efficacy  (9, 10) . Fremanezumab in particular can reduce the number of hospital visits because of its long administration period of three months, which could be quite impressive if combined with telemedicine.\n\nSimilarly to headache patients, some hospitals or clinics in Japan have already started to use telemedicine for epilepsy patients as well. Even during the COVID-19 pandemic, expert epilepsy care through telemedicine was provided to patients living locally but lacking access to epilepsy experts  (11) . Generally, many stable epilepsy patients do not need to change their prescriptions for a long period of time  (12) , so telemedicine can be advantageous in such cases by further reducing patient visits. Interestingly, our findings suggested that patients with epilepsy did not want to use telemedicine mostly because they did not have confidence in using the tools necessary for telemedicine, not because of disease instability. More detailed analyses of the motor function or severe complications of patients will be needed.\n\nIn contrast to headaches and epilepsy, PD has seen few requests for telemedicine, possibly due to instability of symptoms, characteristic depression  (13) , and high dependence on medical services  (14) . As our study showed, PD patients tended to hope telemedicine would reduce the infection risk of COVID-19 (Table  3 ), which is understandable given the characteristic anxiety affecting such patients. Furthermore, patients with PD usually need frequent adjustment of drugs and have many complications, such as falls and dementia, leading to a deterioration in their general condition. Since frequent hospital visits can be associated with a good outcome in PD patients  (15) , telemedicine would be useful for monitoring their status. However, in terms of the examination and treatment, the benefits of telemedicine are likely to be limited in such a population. Most elderly patients with stroke, ALS, SCD, dementia, and PD have several complications, such as hypertension and diabetes, which require frequent blood tests or imaging analyses at the hospital. In addition, patients with IMND also need blood tests and medical treatments during hospital visits, so they would\n\nTable 3. Reasons Why Patients Wanted to Use Telemedicine.

The present study also showed that the motivation to visit a hospital or use nursing home facilities did not change remarkably over the study period, although few patients were aware of their deteriorating health condition, despite the COVID-19 pandemic. We believe that this is hopeful data compared to other reports  (16, 17) , suggesting that infection controls against COVID-19 in medical institutions in Japan have been relatively successful, allowing patients to feel safe even when visiting a hospital.\n\nThe main barriers against telemedicine may be incompatibility in medical facilities, such as antiquated medical record systems and low medical insurance points for telemedicine, or doctors' classic assumption that \"all patients want to see a doctor directly.\" However, our findings show that as many as 30% of patients wished to receive telemedicine, while only 22% outright rejected telemedicine because they wanted direct medical consulting. These problems can largely be solved by modifying the medical record system to suit telemedicine based on the results of accurate patient preference surveys, including our findings. Furthermore, the present data suggest that telemedicine can be smoothly introduced to young patients with headache or epilepsy, probably through a pilot installation of demo equipment. We believe that these approaches can contribute to the management of the COVID-19 pandemic and the medical economy by saving patients time and making their hospital visits more effective. Patients' interest in telemedicine has already reached a certain level, so we should continue efforts to meet patients' needs and fit current world trends toward the establishment of online medical services."
