  "title": "Efficacy of a text messaging (SMS) based intervention for adults with hypertension: protocol for the StAR (SMS Text-message Adherence suppoRt trial) randomised controlled trial",
  "abstract": "Background: Interventions to support people with hypertension in attending clinics and taking their medication have potential to improve outcomes, but delivery on a wide scale and at low cost is challenging. Some trials evaluating clinical interventions using short message service (SMS) text-messaging systems have shown important outcomes, although evidence is limited. We have developed a novel SMS system integrated with clinical care for use by people with hypertension in a low-resource setting. We aim to test the efficacy of the system in improving blood pressure control and treatment adherence compared to usual care. Methods/design: The SMS Text-message Adherence suppoRt trial (StAR) is a pragmatic individually randomised three-arm parallel group trial in adults treated for hypertension at a single primary care centre in Cape Town, South Africa. The intervention is a structured programme of clinic appointment, medication pick-up reminders, medication adherence support and hypertension-related education delivered remotely using an automated system with either informational or interactive SMS text-messages. Usual care is supplemented by infrequent non-hypertension related SMS text-messages. Participants are 1:1:1 individually randomised, to usual care or to one of the two active interventions using minimisation to dynamically adjust for gender, age, baseline systolic blood pressure, years with hypertension, and previous clinic attendance. The primary outcome is the change in mean systolic blood pressure at 12-month follow-up from baseline measured with research staff blinded to trial allocation. Secondary outcomes include the proportion of patients with 80% or more of days medication available, proportion of participants achieving a systolic blood pressure less than 140 mmHg and a diastolic blood pressure less than 90 mmHg, hospital admissions, health status, retention in clinical care, satisfaction with treatment and care, and patient related quality of life. Anonymised demographic data are collected on non-participants. Discussion: The StAR trial uses a novel, low cost system based on widely available mobile phone technology to deliver the SMS-based intervention, manage communication with patients, and measure clinically relevant outcomes. The results will inform implementation and wider use of mobile phone based interventions for health care delivery in a low-resource setting.",

      "text": "Globally, high blood pressure is the leading single risk factor for cardiovascular and related diseases  [1, 2] . Individual patient-level data have shown that usual blood pressure is \"strongly and directly\" associated with cardiovascular and overall mortality risk  [3] , and that lowering blood pressure reduces this risk  [4] [5] [6] . Controlling blood pressure at a population level may be associated with a decrease in cardiovascular disease regardless of the increasing burden of obesity and diabetes  [7] . The burden of disease associated with hypertension is greatest in low-resource settings  [2, 8] , where there is a need for better control of blood pressure  [9, 10] .\n\nTreatment to lower blood pressure includes drug and non-drug measures as well as modification of known life-style associated risk factors, such as smoking and alcohol intake  [6, 11, 12] . Long-term blood pressure control requires integrating medication taking into daily life to support adherence and persisting with treatment.\n\nA wide range of different strategies and interventions has been used to support patients in adhering to treatment plans, although results are not consistent  [13] . One strategy that may facilitate such support is the integration of a patient's mobile (or cellular) phone in the process of health care delivery. Globally, the mobile phone has become the preferred tool for communication and access to information bringing together communication and computing technology. Mobile-phone-based interventions could address individual-level factors in health by facilitating timely patient access to relevant health information and support, making patient-provider communication easier, and providing context-specific support and prompts to action  [14] .\n\nDespite widespread interest in the potential for mobile phone based interventions to deliver disease management and health-related behaviour change sustainably and at scale, published evidence of effectiveness is limited  [15] . SMS-text messages are available on all mobile phone platforms and with all providers. Text messages have the potential to provide information alone (informational) or provide two-way communication (interactive or bi-directional). Some but not all trials suggest that SMS text-message reminders may improve clinic attendance, retention in care, and selfreported medication adherence  [15] . Two trials in Spain with short follow-up periods have explored the efficacy of SMS-based interventions for people with hypertension to improve treatment compliance and blood pressure control. Although the trials results suggest potential for small to moderate effect sizes in improved compliance and blood pressure control, the effects were not statistically significant  [16] ."

The \"chronic diseases of lifestyle clinic\" services a caseload of about 500 patients per week. Patients with hypertension are managed by nurse practitioners and doctors in structured clinics. The local Department of Health provides medications for the treatment of hypertension in line with national and international hypertension management guidelines  [17] . Medications are provided either pre-packed from an off-site pharmacy, or dispensed on-site. Medications are usually provided for 28 days.

      "text": "This protocol presents the design a randomised controlled trial testing the efficacy of a text-messaging intervention to support patients in their treatment adherence and improve blood pressure control. This is the first controlled trial testing the efficacy of text messaging in a large population for hypertension, at low cost and in a low-resource setting. The technology support for this trial is innovative, based on open-source software, and not only supports an interactive messaging system using standard and widely available SMS messaging, but also integrates clinical care and trial management.\n\nIn addition to testing the efficacy of the intervention, this study will provide information to further develop clinical care in low-resource settings and maximise the usefulness of new technology at low cost. It will provide an evaluation of the feasibility and acceptability of integrating different aspects of clinical care through a delivery platform which uses the patient's mobile phone as an identifier and means of direct contact. The setting provides a particular challenge, set in a large peri-urban public sector clinic with a high patient load, typical of urban centres in Africa and the global south. We are recruiting participants from a clinic facility that are likely to be broadly representative of those receiving care for hypertension at primary care level.\n\nThe trial has been designed to address the limitations of previous studies of SMS text-messages to support treatment adherence for chronic diseases;  [30]  the intervention was developed using a formal process to synthesise existing evidence, the opinion of clinical staff, and patients with chronic diseases, and iteratively tested in pilot work. There is a large bank of possible messages, and the delivery system (including interactive bi-directional SMS text-messaging) is automated. The duration of the intervention and the length of follow-up will allow us to explore effects of the intervention on adherence and persistence with treatment, and to assess whether habituation to the intervention might moderate the effect. The outcomes include measurement of adherence, as a key explanatory variable associated with improved cardiovascular outcomes, and blood pressure as a clinically relevant outcome."
