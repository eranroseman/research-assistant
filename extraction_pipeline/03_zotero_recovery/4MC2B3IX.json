  "title": "Technology Interventions to Curb Obesity: A Systematic Review of the Current Literature",
  "abstract": "Obesity is a public health crisis that has reached epidemic proportions. Although intensive behavioral interventions can produce clinically significant weight loss, their cost to implement, coupled with resource limitations, pose significant barriers to scalability. To overcome these challenges, researchers have made attempts to shift intervention content to the Internet and other mobile devices. This article systematically reviews the recent literature examining technologysupported interventions for weight loss and maintenance among overweight and obese adults. Thirteen studies were identified that satisfied our inclusion criteria (12 weight loss trials, 1 weight maintenance trial). Our findings suggest that technology interventions may be efficacious at producing weight loss. However, several studies are limited by methodologic shortcomings. There are insufficient data to evaluate their efficacy for weight maintenance. Further research is needed that employs state-of-the-art methodology, with careful attention being paid to adherence and fidelity to intervention protocols.",

      "text": "More than 400 million adults worldwide and 90 million Americans are obese, reflecting a significant public health crisis  [1] [2] [3] . Although losing 5% to 10% of body weight has been shown to reduce the risk of significant morbidity and premature mortality  [3, 4] , few individuals are able to adhere to weight loss behaviors with consistency.\n\nIntensive behavioral interventions have been shown to produce clinically significant weight loss  [5] . Components of such interventions include 1) self-monitoring of diet, physical activity, and body weight, 2) reducing energy intake, and 3) increasing energy expenditure  [6] [7] [8] [9] . Furthermore, intensive interventions often incorporate a variety of skills, including stimulus control, stress management, and problem solving, which bolster individuals' ability to implement these behavioral changes across a variety of challenging contexts and situations. Unfortunately, these interventions are expensive, time consuming for both patients and providers, and often inaccessible, posing significant barriers to achieving population-level reach.\n\nResearchers and clinicians have capitalized on the use of technologies, such as the Internet and mobile devices (eg, PDAs, smartphones, cellular phones), to deliver weight management interventions. Such platforms are attractive because they help overcome resource and access barriers encountered when delivering traditional face-to-face individual or group interventions. Consequently, these platforms may enhance our ability to produce significant and healthy change in larger segments of the obese population.\n\nIn 2010, the American Heart Association commissioned a systematic review of technology interventions for weight loss and maintenance  [10] . It concluded that such interventions indeed hold promise; however, several caveats were noted: 1) successful technology interventions (eg, Internet, PDAs) contain elements of human contact (eg, e-mail support with behavioral coaches), 2) samples used in randomized control trials (RCTs) have been largely homogenous (ie, white and female), 3) researchers of several trials limited their analyses to participants with complete data, and 4) several trials reported high rates of attrition (20%-80%). Therefore, researchers were charged with the task of further study using more heterogeneous samples and employing state-of-the-art clinical trial methodology (eg, employing the intent-to-treat principle in all analyses and increased efforts to maximize participant retention). This article provides a review and update of technology-supported interventions for weight loss and weight maintenance among obese adults, focusing on the recent literature  (2010) (2011) . The authors also provide comment on their experiences developing technology interventions for weight loss and provide directions for future research."

      "text": "In September 2011, a comprehensive literature search was conducted of technologysupported interventions for weight loss or weight maintenance. At the outset, two lists of relevant keywords were generated that included both technology-related terms (eg, Internet, PDA) and weigh-trelated terms (eg, obese, weight loss). The two lists were intra-linked with \"OR\" and inter-linked with \"AND\" so that all candidate articles contained at least one relevant technology term and at least one weight-related term. For a full list of keywords used, please contact the corresponding author (M. Coons).\n\nOur search was executed in the following databases: PubMed, Medline, EMBASE, PsychINFO, CINAHL, Cochrane CENTRAL, and IEEE Xplore. Searches were limited to articles published in 2010 and 2011, of adult humans, and published in English. Four authors (AD, AP, JB, JS) performed the literature search and initial abstract reviews. After all duplicate titles were excluded, 48 full-text articles were collected. Candidate articles were evaluated for inclusion by two investigator dyads (MC + CP and JB + JD). A third independent reviewer resolved any discrepancies between the dyads.\n\nStudies were included in this present review if they satisfied all of the following criteria: 1) were a RCT (including at least one intervention and a comparison condition), 2) included a technology-supported intervention platform with participant interface (eg, Internet, PDA), 3) included weight loss outcome variable(s) (eg, weight, weight change, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference), 4) were published in a peer-reviewed journal, and 5) were published in English. Articles were excluded from our review if they were secondary analyses, conference presentations, dissertations, studies of pediatric or adolescent populations, or included specific subpopulations (eg, individuals with psychosis). Of the 48 full-text articles, 13 were included in the final review. For a detailed description of our search results, please refer to the consort diagram in Figure  1 ."

      "text": "A total of 48 abstracts were identified through our search. Thirteen studies satisfied our search criteria and were included in the present review (12 weight loss trials, 1 weight maintenance trial). These studies are summarized in Table  1 .\n\nTen trials tested Internet interventions and 3 trials tested handheld devices (eg, PDAs, armband with tri-axial accelerometer). Regardless of the technology platform, intervention components included 1) education about diet, physical activity, and weight management; 2) self-monitoring of diet, physical activity, and weight parameters (eg, weight, BMI, waist circumference); and 3) goal setting for diet and physical activity. Furthermore, several trials included elements of motivational enhancement  [11, 12]  and some provided social support through e-mail or Internet chat room contact with both coaches and peers  [13\u2022, 14-17] .\n\nSix of the 12 weight loss trials reported significantly greater weight loss among individuals randomized to technology interventions compared to controls  [13\u2022, 17, 18\u2022, 19, 20] . However, researchers of one trial conducted analyses exclusively on participants with complete data  [20] , and one trial lost 43% of their sample due to attrition  [17] . Of the remaining four positive trials that analyzed data using the intent-to-treat principle (ie, imputation of missing weight loss outcomes using either the last observation carried forward or baseline observation carried forward), three studies tested Internet-mediated interventions  [11, 13\u2022, 19]  and one study tested a mobile platform  [18] . Components of these successful interventions included self-monitoring (diet, physical activity, and weight), goal setting for calorie intake and physical activity, and feedback on current diet and activity behaviors relative to daily and weekly goals. Interestingly, these successful trials were implemented in a variety of settings, including the workplace [13\u2022], primary care 11], academic medical center [18\u2022], and the community  [19] . Furthermore, the proportion of individuals using technology interventions that achieved clinically meaningful weight loss (defined as achieving \u2265 5% of initial body weight) ranged from 37%  [19]  to 63%  [18\u2022] .\n\nUnfortunately, only one weight maintenance trial was included in our review  [21] . These authors reported no significant differences in weight between Internet intervention and control conditions. However, this trial was underpowered to detect a significant group\u00d7time interaction (n = 55), the intervention lacked sufficient intensity by being limited to monthly e-mail messages, and did not include key weight management interventions (eg, selfmonitoring, goal setting, and feedback).\n\nFive trials reported no significant difference in weight loss between intervention and control conditions  [12, [14] [15] [16] 22] ; however, all of these trials reported within-group weight loss. Surprisingly, one trial reported significantly greater weight loss in the control condition (ie, face-to-face group weight loss) compared to the intervention conditions (ie, Internet alone or hybrid conditions)  [23] . The authors of this trial attribute these findings to differences in perceived social support, with higher levels being noted in the face-to-face conditions compared to the Internet conditions. Further examination of these negative trials revealed that several included control conditions that contained potent intervention components (eg, face-to-face weight loss groups) that may have undermined the ability to detect significant between-group differences at post-treatment follow-up. Furthermore, only two of the trials reported data on adherence to the intervention  [14, 15] . Absence of these data in other negative trials challenges our ability to determine whether the lack of significant weight loss between groups was a result of treatment inefficacy or an artifact of non-adherence.\n\nReporting of adherence across trials was variable and differed by how adherence was defined (eg, session attendance, number of logins to intervention websites, self-monitoring behaviors). Of the studies reviewed, seven reported data on adherence to the intervention  [11, 13\u2022, 14, 17-19, 23] . Four studies reported a comparison of adherence between groups. Two studies reported no significant differences between groups on adherence measures  [19, 23] . One study reported better adherence in the technology group  [18\u2022 ] and another reported better adherence in the comparison group (eg, 34% of participants completed all sessions in the phone intervention group versus 18% in the technology group)  [17] . Three studies only reported adherence within the technology groups  [11, 13\u2022, 14] . Of these three trials, adherence to the technology-supported interventions was poor, ranging from 28% [13\u2022] to 41.2%  [14]  participant participation rates. Only one study reported any data on participant satisfaction and usability of the technology  [14] ; participants reported that they were highly satisfied with the website, finding it to be enjoyable and usable."

      "text": "The results of our review suggest that technology-supported interventions using Internetbased and mobile platforms may be efficacious in producing weight loss among overweight and obese adults. Four of the trials reviewed showed that technology interventions (ie, Internet, PDA) produced significantly greater weight loss compared to controls in a variety of treatment settings, including the workplace, primary care, academic medical center, and the community. However, several issues were identified that influence our conclusions. First, six of the trials reported attrition rates > 20% (ranging from 25% to 43%)  [12, [14] [15] [16] [17] 22] , which compromises the validity of the trial outcomes and power to detect significant between group differences. Second, three of the trials included in this review conducted completer analyses, rather than employing the intent-to-treat principle  [16, 20, 21] . Although this practice lends insight into the effect of the intervention on those who complete it, this undermines the effect of randomization, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn. Third, of the five negative trials that showed no significant difference in weight loss between groups, only two of these trials paid adequate attention to adherence to intervention components (eg, the extent to which individuals engaged with the technology to receive, process, and enact its content). Overall, only half of the trials reviewed reported adherence data, and the manner in which adherence was both defined and reported was variable across studies. Over half of the studies reviewed failed to report data on adherence to the interventions. Of those that did, a few of the trials reported low adherence rates in the technology groups. In the absence of adherence data or efforts to ensure fidelity to the interventions, we are unable to determine whether the results are attributed to an ineffective intervention, or non-adherence to treatment.\n\nUnequivocally, self-monitoring of diet and physical activity is paramount to successful weight loss and maintenance. However, until recently, behavioral weight loss interventions have been challenged with self-monitoring tools that are cumbersome and prone to inaccuracies  [24] . In particular, dietary self-monitoring using paper diaries is onerous for individuals to complete and maintain with consistency. Furthermore, individuals tend to under-report calorie intake and over-report physical activity  [25, 26] .Technologies such as smartphones and other devices hold considerable promise to minimize such barriers and ensure the accuracy of the data  [18] . Efforts to streamline the self-monitoring process may promote adherence to well-established weight loss behaviors. In our experience, user interfaces, regardless of their platform (Internet, mobile) need to be intuitive and engaging to ensure their use. Fortunately, the use of accelerometers overcomes the recall biases inherent in self-reporting of physical activity. With wireless communication abilities, such as Bluetooth transmitters, individuals are now able to receive objective information on their activity levels in real-time. When interfacing with smartphones, we are able to provide individuals with an integrated system to self-monitor their diet and activity and provide realtime feedback for decision support.\n\nThrough ongoing research in our laboratory, we are examining whether handheld technologies can improve adherence to, and outcomes of, intensive behavioral weight loss treatments. E-Networks Guiding Adherence to Goals in Exercise and Diet (ENGAGED) is an integrated smartphone weight loss intervention platform that implements a modification of the Diabetes Prevention Program  [8] . Participants are provided with an Android smartphone that is equipped with a customized software application that links with a comprehensive food database and Bluetooth enabled tri-axial accelerometer. Individuals are asked to use the application to electronically self-monitor their dietary intake and weight and to wear their accelerometers to objectively measure participation in moderate/vigorousintensity physical activity. Our software application provides real-time feedback on diet (ie, calories and fat) and physical activity (ie, minutes/week of moderate-vigorous intensity) through graphic and color-coded visualizations. Our interface is designed to provide \"in the moment\" decision support, connect participants to behavioral coaches and peers, and persuasively motivate healthy diet and activity choices.\n\nThe ENGAGED study was developed based on the Control Systems Theory (CST) of selfregulation. CST posits that behavior change occurs when an individual becomes aware of the discrepancy between their goals and current behaviors. Individuals are then motivated to reduce this discrepancy by making the necessary changes to their behavior  [27] . With our ENGAGED mobile interface, participants are provided with daily and weekly goals for calorie and fat intake as well as physical activity. These goals are intended to produce 5% to 10% weight loss over the course of the 12-month intervention. Our persuasive graphics display discrepancies between current diet and activity behaviors and daily and weekly goals. Participants are asked to reduce and minimize the discrepancies to promote adherence to the intervention, which in turn, facilitates weight loss. In light of research showing that social networks influence weight  [28] , the ENGAGED application also contains a virtual social network that links participants to a behavioral coach and a weight loss support group. Individuals can use this tool to solicit or provide social support, fostering frequent communication among teammates and behavioral coaches to promote adherence to behavioral goals and outcomes. The ENGAGED technology is currently being tested in our laboratory in an RCT sponsored by the National Institutes of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK) of the National Institutes of Health (NIH).\n\nAt present, many commercially produced software applications are available to consumers on a number of mobile platforms including Android, Apple (iPhone, iPad), and Blackberry. However, many of these products were designed for commercial distribution. Although some commercial weight loss programs have received empirical support, many of the mobile applications that are based on these programs have not yet been tested using welldesigned clinical trials. Although only three studies were identified during this review that tested mobile intervention platforms  [12, 15, 18 \u2022], we anticipate a proliferation in this area of research in the coming years. Smartphones have become ubiquitous across a variety of demographics  [29] , reducing the access barriers that have been typically encountered over this past decade. The development of efficacious and mobile weight loss intervention platforms will help to ensure the population-level reach that is needed to produce clinically significant weight loss in larger segments of the obese population."

      "title": "Future Directions",
      "text": "Despite our enthusiasm for the studies reviewed here, research is needed to address a variety of outstanding issues. First, although a limited number of well-designed positive trials included diverse samples and were tested in a variety of treatment settings, more studies enrolling diverse samples are needed to verify the results of positive trials. Second, although electronic tools to self-monitor dietary intake overcome many of the barriers encountered when individuals maintain paper diaries, self-monitoring of dietary intake still relies on selfreport. Consequently, efforts to develop objective measures of dietary intake will provide the most accurate information to ensure fidelity to weight loss interventions. These efforts are currently underway in several laboratories across the United States and abroad. For example, some researchers are developing technologies that capture real time images of foods that individuals consume using smartphones. Individuals take photographs of their food before and after meals, and these images are uploaded via smartphone to a remote server. These images are then analyzed using a software program to determine macronutrient composition. Although this technology remains under development, it holds the potential to both facilitate the process of dietary self-monitoring, and provide a more objective measure of dietary intake. Lastly, the intervention platforms reviewed in this article represent older-generation technologies including the Internet and PDAs. Smartphones hold the potential to revolutionize the delivery of behavioral weight loss interventions because they are mobile, streamline the self-monitoring process, enable the objective measurement of weight loss behaviors, and link individuals virtually to behavioral coaches and peers for social support. Future investigation of smartphone platforms, such as the ENGAGED system, lends excitement to forthcoming research."
