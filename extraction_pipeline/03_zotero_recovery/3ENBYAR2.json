  "abstract": "a b s t r a c t Dyslexia is a learning disability characterised by problems with accurate or fluent word recognition, poor decoding, and poor spelling abilities. Although several studies have addressed dyslexia and Web accessibility, less is known about how dyslexia affects information search. This study investigated whether the inclusion of icons in search user interfaces enhances performance among dyslexics. A total of 21 dyslexics and 21 controls completed 52 search tasks in 4 conditions: icons only, words only, and both icons and words in a grid layout and a list layout, while eye movements were recorded. Dyslexics took significantly longer than controls to locate targets in tasks containing text, but not in the icon-only condition. Dyslexics had longer fixation durations than controls in both icon and text based search arrays, suggesting higher mental load associated with search tasks generally. The addition of words to icon arrays led to faster search times within controls, but not dyslexics. Dyslexics also exhibited more fixations on dual-modality tasks, and longer scanpaths than controls in list layout. Both groups were fastest searching the list layout, with icons and words listed in columns. Results are discussed in terms of the design of accessible search interfaces for dyslexic users, taking into account mental load of dual-modality information display, and the arrangement of search items. Empirical data is provided for the design of accessible search results interfaces for dyslexics.",

      "text": "Dyslexia is related to impaired word recognition and decoding skills (American Psychiatric Association, 2013) and occurs in various forms and degrees  (Snowling, 2000) . Some dyslexics are fast but inaccurate readers, while others are slow and more accurate readers  (van der Schoot et al., 2000) . Dyslexia is usually discussed in educational contexts and in terms of teaching children how to read and write. However, dyslexics are also suggested to struggle with other activities, such as information retrieval  (MacFarlane et al., 2010; Habib et al., 2012) . Information search requires spelling skills in order to produce accurate and purposeful queries, and word recognition skills for exploring results and assessing documents for relevance. Either, or both aspects may present challenges for a dyslexic user.\n\nDyslexia occurs in 3-10% of the population  (Snowling, 2000) .\n\nNon-fluent and inaccurate reading is common  (Shaywitz and Shaywitz, 2005)  and reduced sequencing skills, concentration difficulties, impairments in word retrieval and a reduced shortterm memory capacity are also reported  (Snowling, 2001; Jeffries and Everatt, 2004; Mortimore and Crozier, 2006; Smith-Spark and Fisk, 2007; Hiscox et al., 2014) . Dyslexia is persistent and chronic, and difficulties remain throughout life  (Shaywitz and Shaywitz, 2005) , effecting not only education but everyday activities such as Web navigation  (Al-Wabil et al., 2007)  and information search  (MacFarlane et al., 2012) . Prevalence of dual diagnosis with dyslexia and other specific learning disabilities are not uncommon. Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) or Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD), characterised by excessive activity, impulsivity and a short attention span, are reported in 18-20% of the dyslexic population  (German\u00f2 et al., 2010) . The mathematical impairment dyscalculia is found in 4-7% of dyslexics  (Landerl et al., 2009) . Dysgraphia, a learning disability for writing, is also prevalent in the dyslexic population  (Nicolson and Fawcett, 1990) , as is dyspraxiaan impairment in the organisation of movement  (Gibbs et al., 2007) ."

      "title": "Accessible search interfaces",
      "text": "The design of accessible search results has been discussed in a general user context. Some features have been reported to work well, such as colour highlighting query terms, and sorting or categorising results according to attributes such as date, author, or category labels  (Hearst et al., 2002) . Other studies have addressed certain types of search, for example, faceted search  (Fagan, 2010)  or personalised search  (Sontag et al., 2012) . However, according to  Hepworth (2007)  and  MacFarlane et al. (2010) , cognitive variations such as dyslexia in the user population are usually not addressed in research on information search behaviour.\n\nSeveral studies have investigated Web accessibility and dyslexia in terms of ameliorating factors. Evett and Brown (2005)  investigated how to produce clear and more readable text for visually impaired and dyslexic users. Font types and sizes have also been investigated. Rello and Baeza-Yates (2013)  concluded that font types affect reading performance, and that italics should be avoided. It has also been suggested that dyslexics prefer font types without serifs  (Evett and Brown, 2005) .\n\nInformation layout is also discussed in the research literature. Zorzi et al. (2012)  reported that increasing letter-spacing improved reading performance among Italian and French dyslexic children. Rello et al. (2013b)  concluded that line spacing had no significant effect on reading performance, but font size had a significant effect. However, few studies have focused on search user interface design. Al-Wabil et al. (2007)  interviewed 10 dyslexics to investigate how dyslexia affects Web navigation. They found that dyslexics experienced significant navigational barriers online, and did not find internal search useful. Such barriers seem to effect online information production, too. Baeza-Yates and  Rello (2011)  used typical dyslexia-related writing errors to estimate the amount of texts written by dyslexics on the Web. They concluded that dyslexics were underrepresented as content producers, and that the implementation of natural language processing tools could improve Web accessibility.\n\nUniversal design has been much discussed in the context of the Web, and attempts have been made to develop guidelines which adequately accommodate user diversity. The most commonly applied guidelines today are the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, or WCAG, developed by the World Wide Web Consortium  (W3C, 2008) . WCAG has become the de facto standard applied by developers, designers and legislators. However, it is difficult to design guidelines which accommodate all users. These difficulties are addressed by W3C in their introduction to  WCAG (W3C, 2008) , where they claim that the guidelines may not meet the needs of users with specific cognitive, language, or learning issues. Richards and Hanson (2004)  and  R\u00f8men and Svanaes (2012)  also found that Web pages that are complying with WCAG may not offer sufficient accessibility to all user groups.\n\nWCAG does address issues such as ease of navigation and the importance of clear and understandable text, which applies to dyslexic users. However, since WCAG does not seem to adequately accommodate the needs of users with cognitive impairments, alternative guidelines directed particularly at dyslexic users have been suggested, for instance The British Dyslexia Association (n.d.) and  Zarach (2002) . Friedman and Bryen (2007)  reviewed 20 sets of guidelines directed at people with cognitive impairments, where three of these specifically addressed dyslexia. They found that the most frequently cited guideline for accommodating dyslexic users related to the use of pictures, icons and symbols in addition to text. This was mentioned in 75% of the literature reviewed. However, this recommendation is not included in WCAG (W3C, 2008). De Santana et al. (  2012 ) reviewed guidelines concerning accessible Web pages for dyslexic users and categorised these according to topic. One guideline, referring to images and charts, states that textual information should be complemented with images and pictures and includes discussion of icons. The justification given for this guideline is that dyslexics tend to place more emphasis on images than words.\n\nThe advantage of visual content for dyslexic users is supported by  Houts et al. (2006) , who found that pictures could accommodate users with reading impairment. However, others have concluded that pictures may distract attention away from the text and thereby negatively affect reading comprehension. For instance,  Beacham and Alty (2006)  found that material containing text-only is most beneficial to dyslexic readers. Similarly,  Brante et al. (2013)  found that integrated pictures in learning materials did not help dyslexic students to better understand the content. However,  Williams and Hennig (2015a)  reported that users with learning disabilities preferred designs with large text and images, although these conditions did not facilitate the fastest search times."

      "title": "Visual search and eye movement measures",
      "text": "Humans have high acuity, colour vision only in central vision, so that an area extending about 1.5\u00b0(the fovea) is available for detailed work such as reading or small object recognition, see for example  Fulton (2000) . Only 3-4 letters are thus visible in detail at any time during reading. However, parafoveal vision, extending out to about 5\u00b0from central vision, has higher acuity than the peripheral vision, and a parafoveal preview benefit is commonly reported in reading research (see e.g. Pollatsek, 2015 for a comprehensive review) . This means that visual information is only perceived in high detail at the centre of vision at any one time, and details of any sort will be increasingly more difficult to recognise with distance from central vision.\n\nInformation retrieval is an activity which involves visual search, especially during results assessment. Eye movements have been widely used to investigate cognitive processes during visual search (for review, see e.g. Rayner, 2009) . Most search tasks involve multiple fixations  (Findlay, 2004) . When the human eye is directed towards visual information, selected content is aligned to the central 2\u00b0of the retina; the fovea  (Wright and Ward, 2008) . The fovea provides the most detailed visual input, while visual acuity and colour information declines in the remaining \u2248 \u00b0\u00d7 \u00b0170 150 peripheral vision. Consequently, to process objects in detail, eye movements are necessary frequently and quickly.\n\nEye tracking has been applied in several studies related to visual search and dyslexia, and is a valuable method for studying cognitive processes during reading and attention generally  (Rayner, 2009) . Rello et al. (2013a)  used eye tracking to investigate cognitive load associated with different forms of number representation, and how different conditions affected understandability and readability for dyslexics. They found that numbers presented as digits were more readable than digits presented as words, and that percentages were faster to read than fractions. Kim et al. (2014)  applied eye tracking to investigate how dyslexics comprehend graphs. They analysed reaction times and gaze durations, and found that dyslexics were slower than controls in graph comprehension.\n\nBoth fixations (stops the eye makes in order to process information) and saccades (movements the eye makes to select a new area for high acuity inspection) have been related to search performance, and it has been suggested that fixation durations may reflect cognitive load or task difficulty across a range of cognitive activities, including visual search. Rayner (2009)  reported that fixation durations in visual search may vary from 180 to 275 ms, depending on the difficulty and density of the array.\n\nSaccades are also found to be larger in visual search than in reading, but shorter than in scene perception. Rayner (2009)  also emphasises the relationship between visual search and memory, and provides evidence that users do not usually revisit items that have been previously fixated. Ojanp\u00e4\u00e4 et al. (2002)  found that average fixation durations in visual search depended on the number of items within a span. Benjamins et al. (2009)  reported increasing search times with the number of distractor items in a display. Becker (2011)  found that dwell times (the total duration of all fixations on an item) may also be affected by the similarities between the target and the distractors, and the target size. Phillips and Edelman (2008)  suggested that improved search performance was more closely related to saccade metrics than fixation duration. Nothdurft (1999)  claims that in tasks where a pop out effect occurs, search times are reported to be independent of the number of objects, while search times increase according to set size in displays with more similar targets. It has been assumed that unfamiliar objects require more effort to evaluate, and will therefore result in longer search times. Greene and Rayner (2001)  reported that search rates are slow if both the target and the distractors are either both familiar, or unfamiliar. Niemel\u00e4 and Saarinen (2000)  found that search times in file search improved for general users when searching icons compared to words, but depended on both set-size and layout, namely whether icons were grouped or randomly positioned. This contradicts  Benbasat and Todd (1993) , who concluded that there were no advantages with icons compared to text-based representations. However,  Benbasat and Todd (1993)  studied interactions with computer systems, and not search tasks. Huang et al. (2002)  found that search performance depended on design criteria of the icons. Kacmar and Carey (1991)  investigated general users and menus including text, icons and dualmodality displays. They found no differences in search times, but concluded that menus with both content types had the least incorrect selections. Lindberg and N\u00e4s\u00e4nen (2003)  investigated how the size and space between icons affected visual search times. They found that search times increased with set-sizes, but that icon spacing did not affect search performance. However, when icons became smaller, search times increased significantly. They concluded that icons should always be displayed with a certain distance between them, with a preferable inter-element spacing of one icon.\n\nExpanded set-sizes are reported to increase mental load and adversely affect performance measures such as response times in general  (Jerde et al., 2011) . Moores et al. (2011)  reported that the performance of dyslexic users decreases as a function of the number of distractors. Vidyasagar and Pammer (1999)  found that dyslexics had significantly longer reaction times compared to controls when presented with a high number of distractors, and concluded that set-size may have a large negative effect on dyslexic users. Others have argued that impairment in visual search is only present in certain tasks, or that visual search deficits depend on specific characteristics within dyslexia. There is evidence that dyslexic users are generally impaired in visual search, for instance by  Sireteanu et al. (2008)  and de Boer-Schellekens and Vroomen (2012). Impairments are found in both adults  (Jones et al., 2008)  and children  (Huang et al., 2008) . However,  Vidyasagar and Pammer (1999)  found no significant differences in mean search times between dyslexics and controls with set-sizes of 10, 24 or 36 items, but a significant difference with 70 items. This suggests that increased set-sizes within a certain range may not be problematic for dyslexic users. Huettig and Brouwer (2015)  applied eye tracking to investigate whether auditory language processing related to word decoding abilities. Rello and Ballesteros (2015)  used eye tracking to test a statistical model to predict whether a person is dyslexic or not, based on eye movement measures, with the aim of automatically detecting dyslexia. They could predict dyslexic readers with an accuracy of 80.18%, and concluded that eye tracking has potential in developing more efficient diagnostic tools. The eye-movements of dyslexic users have received much attention, and it has been suggested that dyslexia may be associated with visual perceptual deficits  (Prado et al., 2007) . Iles et al. (2000)  suggested that dyslexics with motion coherence deficits are impaired in serial tasks, while dyslexics with normal motion coherence were not. Prado et al. (2007)  suggested that while atypical eye movements were documented among dyslexic users during reading, such eye movements were not found when searching letter-based stimuli. They concluded that performance in visual search is not related to atypical eye movements."

      "text": "Most result lists from Web search engines and library catalogues are text-based, typically containing hyperlinks, titles, excerpts from documents or metadata  (Teevan et al., 2011) . In contrast, modern operating systems and software applications often include icons in graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Typically, operating systems provide the option to display search results either as a detailed list or an array of icons. This study set out to explore whether it is expedient to include graphic content such as icons in information search result design, to accommodate navigation for users who struggle with word recognition or decoding.\n\nTextual interfaces may be extended by incorporating graphic content as navigational support. For instance, results may include icons to indicate content type, such as a newspaper for news pages or a loudspeaker representing audio content. An alternative is to add images such as logos to the result list. This study set out to ascertain if dual-modality results might reduce the mental load and/or performance disadvantage in information search for lowproficiency readers, or if there is a performance cost in adding another modality, due to increased set-size.\n\nIt has been suggested that processing icons generally requires more neurological resources than text. Huang (2012)  found that icons are not processed in a similar manner to logographic words, and require more neurological and mental effort to process icons. Nonetheless, despite the apparent extra effort, a preference for icons in information search is reported in the general population  (Niemel\u00e4 and Saarinen, 2000) .\n\nThis paper reports the results from a study where icons and words were used as targets and distractors to investigate whether graphic content could support dyslexics in visual search tasks. The novel contribution is empirical data on how to design accessible result list interfaces for dyslexics, which at the same time does not reduce the accessibility for non-dyslexics. A total of 21 dyslexics and 21 controls solved 52 search tasks each with four conditions: (a) icon arrays, (b) word arrays, and both icons and words in dualmodality displays in (c) an array and in (d) list layout.\n\nThe following hypotheses served as basis for this study:\n\nDyslexics will have longer search times than controls when targets include text. H 2 : Dyslexics locate targets more easily in search tasks displaying graphic content than in search tasks with only verbal content. H 3 : Dyslexics have a preference for icons over words when information is presented in both modalities. H 4 : Dyslexics navigate less effectively and experience more mental load in visual search tasks generally, as compared to controls. H 0 : Dyslexics do not differ from the general population in visual search performance or eye movement behaviour.\n\nThe general reading and word recognition difficulties reported among dyslexics  (Snowling, 2000)  was the basis for H 1 and H 2 . Nielsen and Levy (1994)  and others have found that performance metrics and user preferences are not always correlated. Williams and Hennig (2015b)  found that users with learning disabilities preferred designs with large text and images, although these options did not facilitate the fastest search times. H 3 was therefore included to investigate which content type dyslexics would explore when presented with the same information in both graphical and textual form.\n\nH 4 is justified according to the reduced word recognition and decoding skills, concentration difficulties, and reduced short-term memory capacity reported for dyslexics  (Smith-Spark and Fisk, 2007) . Studies have found that dyslexics generally struggle with navigation, e.g. Al-Wabil et al. (2007) . It is not known whether such effects result from other common specific learning disabilities in the dyslexic population or characteristics of dyslexia."

The students were recruited through announcements in classrooms, on websites, and through the special interest organisation Dyslexia Norway. Three dyslexics and one control were additionally diagnosed with ADHD or ADD, and one further dyslexic with dyscalculia. This was expected, since comorbidity with dyslexia is not uncommon. 14.3% of the dyslexics had ADHD/ADD and 4.8% has dylcalculia. This is representative of the general dyslexia population  (German\u00f2 et al., 2010; Landerl et al., 2009) .\n\nThe control group was also matched with the dyslexia group regarding field and year of study. Of the participants, 57.1% were female and 42.9% male. In the general population, dyslexia is more prevalent among men  (Hawke et al., 2009) .\n\nThe mean age of the dyslexia group was 24.0 years (SD \u00bc 5.1) and the control group was 23.4 years (SD \u00bc3.7). Mean year of study for both groups was 2.3 (bachelor students counted as year 1-3, master students 4-5, with SD \u00bc1.2 for the dyslexia group and SD \u00bc1.0 for controls).

      "title": "Screening",
      "text": "All participants were screened for dyslexia with a word chain test developed by  H\u00f8ien and T\u00f8nnesen (2008) . Although the dyslexic participants reported previous diagnosis by psychological or pedagogical professionals, the screening test eliminated the need for consulting sensitive medical records and allowed a measure of severity of dyslexia in the sample group. The test also ensured that no controls were dyslexic, since students may not be aware of their dyslexia  (Mortimore and Crozier, 2006) .\n\nThe word chain test is a standardised test applicable to the Norwegian language. It has been used in previous research (Solheim and Uppstad, 2011;  Dahle and Knivsberg, 2014) . A low score is considered indicative of dyslexia and diagnostic tests are recommended for adult scores below 43  (H\u00f8ien and T\u00f8nnesen, 2008) . Dyslexic participants scored significantly lower (M\u00bc39.3 points, SD \u00bc10.3) than controls (M \u00bc60.2 points, = ( )= < = SD t p d 10.0, 38 6.52, .001, 2.12), confirming the group affiliations.\n\nIt was assumed that reduced visual acuity could affect the outcome of the experiment. Landolt C charts were used for visual acuity testing, to ensure that all participants had normal or corrected to normal vision. The students were tested on 4 m for far sight and 40 cm for near sight, following the European standard  (ISO, 2009) . All students had at least an acuity of 0.6 on each eye separately and 0.8 with both eyes open, which is within the range regarded as normal vision according to  Zhang et al. (2011) ."

The 12 trials were completed in two six-trial blocks, and the trials were presented in a fixed order for all participants (see Fig.  1 ). Fixed presentation order ensured that no icons or words that had been the target of a previous search task, and hence had their valence altered, reappeared as targets in subsequent tasks. Testing was completed in 9.5 min on average."

Icons in search arrays subtended a minimum of 1.2\u00b0visual angle each, were spaced at minimum of 5.3\u00b0apart from each other. In dual modality arrays, the distance between icon and its accompanying word was approximately 3.2\u00b0of vision. In the list condition, the distance between icons and the start of its accompanying word was 5.1\u00b0d egrees of vision. Instructions were presented via pre-recorded sound files using speech synthesis, and were followed by a fixation cross presented onscreen. The fixation cross appeared either in the centre of the screen or in one of the corners, but never in an area where a search item would subsequently appear. The position of the fixation cross in relation to the array was consistent across subjects, and randomised across stimuli. This enabled valid scanpath length comparisons across subjects and conditions. Fixating on the cross for one second acted as a trigger for presentation of the trial. Participants were instructed to fixate on the search target when they found it, and push the space bar.\n\nThe search tasks were presented in four conditions: icon arrays (ICON), word arrays (WORD), or both modalities presented in an array (ICON/WORD-GRID) and in list-layout (ICON/WORD-LIST). The set-size was 24 items for one-modality tasks presented in a 6 \u00c2 4 grid and, if we consider the word representing each icon as a separate search item, 48 items for dual-modality tasks, presented either in a 6 \u00c2 8 grid (see Fig.  3 ), or a 2 \u00c2 24 list (see Fig.  4 ). The icons were monochrome, representing nouns and downloaded from The Noun Project (n.d.). An icon bank consisting of 99 icons and corresponding words was assembled. The icons (and their arrangement on screen) were screened by 64 students during pilot Fig. 3. ICON/WORD-GRID example scanpath displaying icon and word fixations.\n\ntesting. Only icons interpreted with a rater agreement of 100% were included. Search item size and inter-item spacing was adjusted according to the precision and accuracy levels in pilot testing, to ensure sufficient error margins between items.\n\nCommon Norwegian words equivalent to the nouns represented by the icons were used. Words were presented in 18 point Arial black font. Only words with similar visual lengths were used as targets since longer or shorter words cause a pop out effect, which affects search times  (Nothdurft, 1999) . Objects were randomly extracted from the icon/word-bank. Items could appear in several tasks, but did not reappear after being the target in a previous task. The object spacing in the grid-layouts ensured that participants processed only one item per fixation (see Fig.  3 ). Similar object spacing was not practical for list layouts (see Fig.  4 ). Thus, in list layout, items of the same modality were closer together and in the same column, resulting in one AOI for each modality."

The final dataset comprised of 2056 tasks: 514 for each condition, distributed equally across the two participant groups and the four conditions.\n\nDual-diagnosis of dyslexia with other specific learning disabilities is relatively common. In this subject group, dual diagnosis with ADHD and dyscalculia was present in levels representative of the population. According to  Bellocchi et al. (2013) , dual diagnoses such as ADHD must be taken into account when designing studies on dyslexia, since attentional problems related to ADHD may affect the results. Therefore, analysis was repeated excluding dual-diagnosis participants in all cases, to investigate whether observed differences were likely due to effects of other specific learning disabilities or were characteristic of dyslexia alone. Groups and conditions were compared via t-tests within and between subjects."

Ratios of time spent on icons vs. words were then calculated for each trial and individual. The purpose was to investigate user preferences when both modalities were available.

      "text": "Dyslexics took longer than controls to find targets in all conditions that contained text, but not in the icon-only condition. However, the ICON condition produced slower mean search times than other conditions for both groups (see Fig.  5 ). This is in accordance with  Benbasat and Todd (1993) , but contradicts  (Niemel\u00e4 and Saarinen, 2000) . This finding indicates that search performance deficits reported in dyslexics (for instance  Sireteanu et al., 2008; de Boer-Schellekens and Vroomen, 2012)  was not apparent in the only condition without words. There were no differences between groups in number of fixations in either of the singlemodality array conditions.\n\nThe control group was faster searching word arrays than icon arrays, with a large effect size, whereas the dyslexic group showed no performance advantage associated with either modality. This indicated that an advantage in locating targets in word-only displays over icons-only in the non-dyslexic population is not present in dyslexics. This contradicts the findings of  Niemel\u00e4 and Saarinen (2000) . Dyslexics had longer fixation durations and longer dwell times overall than controls, on both ICONs and WORDs, and shorter saccade amplitudes than controls on WORDs only (see Fig.  7 ). These effects were robust with medium-large effect sizes both with and without inclusion of participants with other specific learning disabilities. Since fixation durations are associated with mental load in processing search items  (Rayner, 2009) , this indicates that searching is in general more demanding for and that the effect seems not attributable to the presence of dual diagnoses such as ADHD. This may be consistent with the findings of  Sireteanu et al. (2008) and de Boer-Schellekens and Vroomen (2012) .\n\nIn conditions where both icons and words were presented, dyslexics spent significantly more time looking at icons than words when they were presented in list-format, and distance between modalities was > \u00b05 vision. However, they showed no significant preference for spending more time on icons vs. words in the dual-modality array, when words vs. icons were about 3\u00b0a part and so could be considered to occupy central vision concurrently. The main difference between dual-modality conditions was the layout. The dual-modality array, unlike the dual-modality list, seemed to be more distracting than helpful, and is also the only condition where dyslexics had significantly more revisits to items\n\n0.8, 28.96 3.30, .004, 1.2 . These results suggest that the presence of words alongside items may be distracting for dyslexics when presented as an array, which would be consistent with  Beacham and Alty (2006) . Another explanation may be that the increased set size of displaying items in both word and icon formats would produce even more differences between dyslexics and controls in measures of mental load and performance, which is coherent with  Benjamins et al. (2009) ,  Jerde et al. (2011), and Moores et al. (2011) . However, results indicate that in list format, with larger distance between modalities of information display than there are between items within modalities, a preference for spending time on icons, and task switching to text mostly to confirm the selection once target is located, is beneficial.\n\nIt was hypothesised that dyslexics would take longer locating targets in textual tasks than controls (H 1 ). The hypothesis was confirmed, although the effect size was reduced when subjects with dual-diagnoses were excluded from the analysis. This finding is in accordance with previous research, for instance  van der Schoot et al. (2000)  and  Snowling (2000) , who have reported that slow reading speed and difficulties with word decoding are typically associated with dyslexia. Shorter saccade amplitudes in WORD conditions may also suggest more fixations within single words, although the precision level of the data did not allow for analysis of fixation positions within words. Shorter saccades in dyslexics may just as likely be due to more corrective saccades in the WORD condition, if there was more overshoot in navigating around the array.\n\nThe second hypothesis assumed that dyslexics would locate targets more easily in tasks displaying graphic content than verbal content (H 2 ). Dyslexics and control participants solved the dual modality list condition faster than all other conditions, which seems to indicate that including words (or icons) can actually have a supportive effect for dyslexics (and non-dyslexics) over icons (or words) alone. This is consistent with  Houts et al. (2006) . However, this seem to apply only if the text information is outside central vision when scanning icon lists, and vice versa.\n\nThe third hypothesis stated that dyslexics would have a preference for icons over words. Decoding errors are common among dyslexic users  (Snowling, 2000)  which has led to suggestions that dyslexics focus more on images than words  (Houts et al., 2006; de Santana et al., 2012) . However, icons are suggested to demand more neurological effort than word processing in general  (Huang et al., 2015) , which may undermine H 3 . When searching ICON/ WORD-GRID, dyslexics had no significant preference for fixating on icons over words, which contradicted H 3 . However, ICON/ WORD-LIST revealed a strong icon preference. The preference for icons remained when dual-diagnosis participants were excluded from the analysis. H 3 is considered supported, but a moderating effect of arrangement on this preference, likely resulting from crowding effects on attention, is important to design for."

      "title": "List vs. array",
      "text": "Both groups had faster search times and longer mean fixation durations in dual-modality lists than dual-modality arrays. Dualmodality lists produced the fastest search times and longest fixation durations overall for both groups with a large effect size. However, effect sizes were reduced to medium when dual-diagnosis participants were excluded from analysis. The longer fixation durations in the list condition suggests a higher mental load  (Rayner, 2009) , but better search performance, when items in a single modality are close together and switching between icons and words requires a saccade outside parafoveal range. This suggests that adding a second modality can be useful and supportive for confirmation of target when it is found. Control participants were faster in word-only than word-plus-icon arrays, but were also faster in the list layout than any other display type. Dyslexics used more of their time on icons than words in this condition, whereas controls divided their time relatively equally across words and icons when both were available.\n\nDyslexics had a higher number of fixations than controls in both dual-modality conditions, but no significant differences in fixation durations. This lack of group differences in fixation durations when both icons and words are presented may be interpreted as a generally higher mental load for both groups, with different sources for each. Results suggest that presenting in list format with sufficient distance between visual and verbal content types may remove a distracting effect of dual-modality information, also in both groups.\n\nH 4 predicted that dyslexics would navigate less effectively and experience more mental load in visual search tasks generally. This hypothesis was somewhat supported by results. However, findings in this study also emphasise that this difference in performance can be modified or even removed depending on both the modality of the information and the layout.\n\nSaccade amplitude across dual-modality conditions was not analysed as it is confounded by distance between search items. However, dyslexics had significantly longer scanpaths than controls on lists, indicating that they covered more ground than controls on the way to finding the target. The dual-modality items in array layout produced more item revisits in dyslexics than controls, with a large effect size, and slower search times in both groups. Thus, the arrangement of items in dual modality conditions, and not the fact that they were dual modality vs. single modality, seems to be the source of performance disadvantage in the ICON/WORD-GRID condition.\n\nH 3 concerns user preferences. In this study, preference for icons over words was measured according to observed behaviour as the information was searched, rather than via interview, since selfreport of attentional deployment is unreliable compared to measuring it empirically. Some users may prefer systems that are not necessarily the most efficient in terms of time  (Nielsen and Levy, 1994; Williams and Hennig, 2015b) . Therefore, neither search times nor subjective reports of preference would adequately instruct interface design, when viewed in isolation.\n\nUsers were free to choose their strategy as they normally would, unconsciously, and were not required to explicitly metacognise cognitive processes and preferences. To do so via requiring self-report, or by making such processes conscious experimentally, would itself add cognitive load to the task and imply a change from regular strategic behaviour and cognition. Eye movement analysis can provide insight into how preferences for modes of information presentation and their arrangement interact. Eye movements can provide an objective and rich data-set from which to explore the effects of dyslexia, mental load, and information presentation, without introducing unnecessary complexity or bias associated with other measures.\n\nThe ICON/WORD-LIST-layout did not allow analysis of revisiting specific objects. However, an analysis was conducted regarding navigation between the icon-column and the word-columni.e. content-switching. Dyslexics displayed more content-switching than controls in this condition. This supports reports that dyslexics have more difficulties with efficient problem-solving strategies, which may affect organisation skills  (Levin, 1990) .\n\nThe content-switching was explored in more detail, to investigate whether they might be explained by participants using the second content type for verification purposes (see Fig.  10 ). Dyslexic users were observed to apply a strategy of checking target in the other modalities once it was found, although there was insufficient data for analysis. Content switching, when information is presented in this way, might be worth exploring in more detail in future research. Given the bias for first looking at what is on the left in western readers, future studies should systematically vary which mode is presented on the left, this study did not.\n\nIt is not surprising that dyslexics may want to verify a word if they trust their visual decoding abilities more reliable. Many of the controls stated that they found the icons distracting during debrief, yet felt compelled to look due to their presence. In terms of effects on performance, this seems to apply only to dual-modalities presented as array, and not to list, which had the best performance in both groups. The conclusion is therefore that list like arrangements, where modalities are spaced further apart than items within each modality, so that items in only one modality are within the central 5\u00b0of vision, is optimal."

      "title": "Limitations and future research",
      "text": "A possible limitation of this study may be that all participants can be considered high-functioning dyslexics, since they successfully have been admitted to higher degree programmes. As such, they may not be representative of all dyslexics in the population, and may in general have an advantage in cognitive tasks. However, this is also true of the control group. Another limitation is in the size of the sample. Ideally, group differences and performance differences in these novel tasks would be analysed based on a larger, normative sample. However, this study has comparable or even favourable number of participants when compared to similar research.\n\nFuture research should look into the effect of layout and the interaction with modality of information more closely via systematic variation of layout with mode of information presentation, especially in terms of item proximity when searching dual-modality results. Future research could also systematically investigate optimal distances between modalities in list format for search performance, and ways of facilitating accurate content-switching when modalities are further apart. Future research could find critical distances between information in each mode and search items themselves, to specify any crowding effects specific to dualmodality search interfaces. Results here suggest that Bouma's law  (Bouma, 1970)  for the effects of spacing on object recognition in parafoveal viewing, may be usefully applied in multi-modal display design for accessible information search."

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "In general, this study suggests that presenting icons and words in a list structure will benefit both dyslexics and non-dyslexic users in terms of search performance over any kind of array-like format. Presenting both modalities in typical array-like search results may actually have a deleterious effect on search performance, both for dyslexic and non-dyslexic users, and it seems that this is a problem due to the less preferred modality being within central vision concurrently. The problem is removed in a layout that separates modalities by more than 5\u00b0, and has items closer together.\n\nMental load, as measured by fixation durations, was highest in the search condition that produced best performance, for both groups. This can be interpreted as indicating less distraction effects, more focused search, and hence less orienting behaviour which typically involves shorter fixation durations. We could not validly compare scanpath length across dual-modality displays in this study. However, robust and consistent differences between dyslexics and controls in eye movement measures indicate that eye movement analysis is sensitive to processing and moment to moment behavioural differences between dyslexics and controls, and can be exploited to further understand and design for accessible interfaces and equal access to search information for this target group."
