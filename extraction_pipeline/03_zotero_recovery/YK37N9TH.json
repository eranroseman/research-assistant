      "text": "In the US, there are more than 34 million adults with type 1 or type 2 diabetes, representing 13% of the population.  1  Lifestyle modification, including physical activity and weight loss, have been demonstrated to improve diabetes control.  [1] [2] 2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7]  However, sustaining changes to these healthy behaviors can be challenging for many patients.  8, 9 mification is the use of game design elements, such as points and levels, that has increasingly been used to engage individuals in health promotion efforts.  [10] [11] 1] [12]  Many employers commonly use gamification in workplace wellness programs,  [13] [14] [15]  and game design elements exist in about two-thirds of the most popular health and fitness mobile applications.  16 Although gamification is used widely, designs often do not fully leverage insights from fields such as behavioral economics that could better address predictable barriers to behavior change.  10, 12, 16, 17 o previous randomized clinical trials  18, 19  demonstrated that behavioral economic principles and social incentives could be embedded within the design of a gamification intervention to significantly increase physical activity during 3-and 6-month interventions, with effects sustained during 3-month follow-up periods after the interventions were stopped. A pilot study was conducted to test these approaches for promoting weight loss.  20 However, these studies were relatively short and did not target patients with chronic disease.\n\nIn this study, our objective was to conduct a longer-term randomized clinical trial to test the effectiveness of gamification interventions that incorporated behavioral insights and used supportive, collaborative, or competitive social incentives to promote physical activity and weight loss among adults with overweight or obesity and uncontrolled type 2 diabetes. Patients were remotely monitored for 1 year by using wearable devices, a smart weight scale, and an automated technology platform.  21"

The trial was conducted between January 23, 2017, and January 27, 2020, and consisted of a 2-week run-in period, a baseline in-person visit, and then a 1-year remotely monitored intervention. Participants provided informed consent and received equipment for use during the study and financial compensation. Analyses were conducted between February 10 and October 6, 2020. Details of the study design and protocol have been published previously.  22 The trial protocol (Supplement 1) was approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board. This trial followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guideline.\n\nThe study was conducted using Way to Health,  21  a research technology platform at the University of Pennsylvania used previously for remote monitoring and behavioral interventions.  18, 19, [23] [24] 4] [25] [26] [27]  Participants used the study website to create an account, provide informed consent online, and complete baseline and validated survey assessments. Each participant selected whether to receive regular study communications by email, text message, or both. Eligible participants had laboratory testing and were mailed a wrist-worn wearable device (Withings Activite Steel; Withings Inc) that lasts about 6 months without charging, along with a replacement battery.\n\nParticipants used a smartphone application (Withings HealthMate) to connect their devices to the Way to Health platform for remote data collection and used the devices to track daily step counts.\n\nPrior work has demonstrated that these types of devices are accurate for tracking step counts  28  and have been used successfully in earlier studies.  13, 18, 19, 23 After completing the 2-week run-in phase, eligible participants had an in-person visit to receive a smart weight scale (Withings Body) and conduct their baseline weigh-in. Participants received $25 for completing baseline laboratory testing and $25 for enrolling in the trial. At 6 and 12 months, participants received $50 to obtain laboratory tests (hemoglobin A 1c [HbA 1c ] [to convert to proportion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01] and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol [LDL-C]) and conduct a virtual weigh-in at home via FaceTime (Apple Inc) or Skype (Microsoft Corp), as conducted in a prior study.  20 At 12 months, participants completed a survey on their experience in the study."

      "text": "Potential participants were identified from the electronic health records at Penn Medicine and invited to learn more about the study online. The study team conducted outreach to approximately 13 500 patients by email, mailed letter, or phone call. Recruitment occurred from January 23, 2017, to January 7, 2019. Study accrual progressed slower than anticipated and led to the body mass index (BMI) threshold being decreased from 30 to 25 (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared). This lowered lack of interest may have occurred because these patients were a less motivated group, and our primary recruitment strategy was a cold email from the study team.\n\nParticipants were eligible for the program if they were between ages 18 and 70 years; able to read and provide informed consent; had a diagnosis of type 2 diabetes with the most recent HbA 1c level greater than or equal to 8.0%; and, within the past 90 days, had a self-reported BMI greater than or equal to 25; and owned a smartphone or tablet compatible with the wearable device and a smart weight scale. Individuals were excluded if there was a condition that made their participation infeasible (eg, inability to provide informed consent or inability to speak, read, or write in the English language); if there was a condition that made participation unsafe (eg, pregnancy, previous diagnosis of an eating disorder, or history of unsafe weight loss practices); if they were already enrolled in another study targeting physical activity, weight loss, or glycemic control; or if any other medical conditions or reasons prohibited the individual from participating in the 1-year trial. Participants were informed that, depending on intervention arm assignment, they may be grouped with 2 other participants whom they did not previously know (n = 357). Because earlier work indicated that these interventions may be more effective if participants know each other,  20, 29  we encouraged participants to find a family member or friend to enroll with them as a group of 2 or 3 persons (n = 4)."

Participants randomly assigned to 1 of the 3 gamification interventions conducted goal setting during the in-person visit including selecting an HbA 1c reduction goal (1.5%, 2%, or 2.5%), a weight loss goal (6%, 7%, or 8%), and a step count increase (33%, 40%, 50%, or any goal \u05461500 steps above baseline). These options were based on prior work  [18] [19] [20]  ; participants were told to strive for these goals during the first 6 months and maintain them through 12 months. Participants were given a weekly weight target (about 1 lb or less) that gradually declined to the goal by 6 months. If a weekly goal was not achieved, the target remained the same for the following week. Similar to earlier work,  19  step targets increased gradually over 4 weeks.\n\nParticipants in the intervention arms were entered into a game with points and levels that ran automatically (participants did not have to actively play the game-just strive for their goals) and provided a daily notification on their progress. The design was based on previous work that incorporated principles from behavioral economics.  [18] [19] [20]  First, participants in the gamification arms signed a precommitment pledge to strive to achieve their goals during the 1-year trial.  31, 32 In earlier work,  18  step goal targets began immediately, which was challenging for some participants. Therefore, in this trial, participants had a ramp-up period during the first 4 weeks in which daily step goal targets increased by 25% per week from baseline to the goal. Participants were asked to strive for this step goal for the rest of the trial but could change the goal at any point as long as it was within the options provided.\n\nSecond, every Monday, the participant received 70 points (10 for each day of the week). If the participant did not weigh in on the prior day, they lost 10 points from their balance. This practice leverages prospect theory,  33  which has demonstrated that loss framing is more effective at motivating behavior change than gain framing.  25, 33 ird, at the end of each week, participants could move up or down levels (from lowest to highest: blue, bronze, silver, gold, and platinum). This design creates achievable goal gradients, a sense of social status, and progression through the game. If at the end of each week the participant had at least 40 points, achieved their weekly weight target, and averaged at or above their daily step goal, they would move up a level. Fourth, we leveraged the \"fresh start effect,\" which is the tendency for aspirational behavior around temporal landmarks, such as the beginning of the year, month, or week.  34 Similar to prior work,  [18] [19] [20]  participants started each week with a fresh set of 70 points. To help re-engage participants who were struggling to meet their goals at months 3, 6, and 9 (defined as being in the blue or bronze levels of the game), the study team called them to inquire about their progress in the study, reset them to the silver level, and offered them the opportunity to readjust their goals based on their initial options. Fifth, similar to an earlier study,  20  the participants' primary care physician was mailed a monthly report with data on their change in step counts, weight, HbA 1c level, and LDL-C level as a way of increasing social accountability.  35 A copy of this letter was also sent to the participant by email each month."

      "text": "Sixth, the game varied based on the social incentive arm as follows. In the support arm, participants were asked to identify a family member or friend who would be a support sponsor and be emailed a weekly report on the participant's performance in the game over the past week (goal attainment, points, and level) and their targets for the upcoming week (step counts, weight, and points). This sponsor was sent a message at the start of the trial to do their best to support the participant in their progress during the interventions.\n\nIn the collaboration arm, participants were placed into a team of 3 total participants. These individuals typically did not know each other before the study but were introduced to each other by email. Each day one of the members of the group was randomly selected to represent their team for that day, and that information was shared with the entire group. If the selected participant weighed in on the previous day, the team kept their points. If he or she did not, then the entire team lost 10 points. In this design, each person is accountable to the others on the team, and this strategy was intended to induce a collaborative effort to meet their daily goals. The entire team moved up a level only if the team had at least 40 points by the end of the week.\n\nIn the competition arm, participants were placed into a group of 3 total participants. These individuals typically did not know each other before the study but were introduced to each other by email. At the end of each week, the participants received an email with a leaderboard that ranked them on their cumulative points in the study thus far and displayed their level. This feedback was intended to encourage participants to compete for the top spot among the group."

For each patient on each day of the study (participant-day level), the number of steps achieved was obtained as a continuous variable. Weight, HbA 1c level, and LDL-C level were collected at 6 and 12 months as continuous variables. Missing data rates are available (eTable 1 and eTable 2 in Supplement 2) and were similar to those in earlier work.

At the end of the trial, most patients who responded to the survey reported satisfaction with the wearable device (80.2% [130 of 162]) and smart weight scale (85.8% [139 of 162]). Perceptions of the trial's effect on outcomes were similar across arms, with overall rates of satisfaction at 71.6% (116 of 162) for increasing physical activity, 50.6% (82 of 162) for helping with weight loss, and 56.8% (92 of 162) for improving diabetes control (eTable 4 in Supplement 2). Discussion In this trial of adults with overweight and obesity and uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, we found that gamification interventions with support or competition each significantly increased physical activity relative to the control group during the 1-year intervention. Increases in physical activity were sustained throughout 12 months among participants receiving gamification with competition but declined in the last 6 months among participants receiving gamification with support. Participants in all study arms had significant reductions in weight and HbA 1c levels from baseline, but none of the gamification interventions resulted in significant differences in these outcomes relative to the control group. To our knowledge, this is one of the only trials to test behaviorally designed gamification among patients with chronic disease over a 1-year period. Physical activity increases relative to the control group among participants who received gamification with support (503 steps more per day) or competition (606 steps more per day) represented a 12% to 13% increase from baseline. This percentage increase from baseline is similar to prior gamification trials that were conducted among families in the Framingham Heart Cohort (13%)\n\nand employees with overweight or obesity from a large consulting firm (15%).  18, 19 Recent evidence indicates that even small increases or light-intensity physical activity can lead to health benefits, particularly for more sedentary individuals.  [42] [43] 3] [44] [45]  LaCroix et al  45  found that increases in light-intensity physical activity were associated with reductions in cardiovascular disease events. Other studies noted that increasing daily step counts was associated with lower rates of mortality in direct relationship until about 7500 steps per day.  46, 47 Future studies could evaluate ways to create adaptive goal setting or combine with other interventions to increase effect sizes and monitor health outcomes over longer periods.\n\nResults from this and the 2 previous gamification trials  18, 19  revealed insights into the dynamic of social incentives that stakeholders should be taken into account when designing behavior change programs. Gamification with collaboration was effective in the trial with families from the Framingham Heart Cohort (support and competition were not tested in this study), but this trial was conducted in a setting in which members of each team knew each other well.  18 Among the trials conducted with consulting employees who had uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, competition and support were effective, but only competition had sustained effects.  19 Collaboration was not effective in either of these 2 trials. Collectively, these results may indicate that a collaborative social incentive works better when members of a group have strong preexisting social connections but otherwise may be relatively ineffective. In a clinical trial testing gamification with collaboration to promote weight loss, teams lost more weight if they lived together than if they lived separately (4.5 vs 2.7 kg),  20, 29  also supporting the notion that stronger social ties may be more responsive to collaborative social incentives. Gamification with support asks the participant to identify a family member or friend and notifies that person of progress, which may also leverage existing social connections.\n\nGamification with competition may be better suited for interventions that involve individuals grouped together who have weaker social connections. Future studies could directly test the effects of social incentives based on differences in social connections within a group.\n\nAlthough participants in 2 intervention arms had increases in physical activity, there were no significant changes relative to the control group in weight or HbA 1c levels. However, all trial arms had decreases in these measures from baseline. Participants in the control arm slightly gained weight in the last 6 months, but those in the intervention arms did not. Future studies could evaluate the longer-term effect on weight to identify whether gamification can help participants to maintain\n\nJAMA Network Open | Diabetes and Endocrinology Effect of Gamification Interventions on Lifestyle Modification in Adults With Diabetes JAMA Network Open. 2021;4(5):e2110255. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2021.10255 (Reprinted) May 24, 2021 11/15 Downloaded from jamanetwork.com by guest on 07/28/2025 weight loss. The lack of improvement in these other outcomes could represent regression to the mean or that other factors may have played an important role. For example, we did not have information on participants' diet or caloric intake. In addition, at baseline, 72.3% of the participants were receiving insulin and 39.9% were receiving an oral diabetes medication. Participation in the study and receipt of connected devices could have influenced medication adherence and be a reason that HbA 1c levels declined in all trial arms, including the control arm."

      "title": "Strengths and Limitations",
      "text": "This trial has several strengths. The sample was a high-risk population with uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, low baseline activity levels, and diversity in race/ethnicity, educational levels, and income.\n\nGamification interventions incorporated scientific principles from behavioral economics. The program used an automated technology platform and was remotely monitored, which makes it more scalable than personnel-intensive approaches. The intervention lasted 1 year, which, to our knowledge, is the longest clinical trial conducted to date testing behaviorally designed gamification.\n\nThis trial has several limitations. First, participants were from a single health system and needed access to a smartphone or tablet, which may limit generalizability. However, more than 80% of US adults now own a smartphone.  48 These interventions should be tested in other populations and settings. Second, we evaluated physical activity using step counts and did not have data on other measures of physical activity. Recent evidence and the current physical activity guidelines indicate that even small increases in light-intensity physical activity provide health benefits  [42] [43] [44] [45] 49  ; however, moderate to vigorous physical activity provides greater benefit and should be evaluated in future studies. Th rd, missing rates of step data varied by trial arm and were highest among the control group at about 40.5%. Fourth, we did not capture information on communications or interactions between the participants in the competition or collaboration groups and so are unable to further evaluate the success or lack thereof of these mechanisms in different groups. Fourth, although we adjusted our statistical threshold for multiple comparisons, we did not adjust for multiple primary outcomes. Fifth, this trial lasted 1 year, which, to our knowledge, is the longest of its kind. However, even longer-term evaluations are needed. Sixth, the interventions in this study were lighter touch digital approaches, and future studies may need to examine stronger ways to promote social incentives."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "In a remotely monitored randomized clinical trial of adults with overweight or obesity and uncontrolled type 2 diabetes, gamification interventions that encouraged social support or competition led to significant increases in physical activity relative to the control group during the 1-year intervention, but an intervention that encouraged collaboration among people who did not know each other did not. Gamification with competition had sustained increases of physical activity through 12 months, but activity levels in gamification with support declined in the last 6 months. All trial arms resulted in significant reductions in weight and HbA 1c levels from baseline, but none of the gamification interventions resulted in significant differences in these outcomes relative to the control group. The results of the iDiabetes trial indicate that gamification designed to incorporate behavioral insights and delivered through an automated and remotely monitored platform is a promising approach to increase physical activity among adults with type 2 diabetes but that gamification may need to be combined with other approaches to promote weight loss or changes in glycemic control."
