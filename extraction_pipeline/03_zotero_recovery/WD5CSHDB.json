  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE Close remote monitoring of patients following discharge for heart failure (HF) may reduce readmissions or death. OBJECTIVE To determine whether remote monitoring of diuretic adherence and weight changes with financial incentives reduces hospital readmissions or death following discharge with HF. \n DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS The Electronic Monitoring of Patients Offers Ways to Enhance Recovery (EMPOWER) study, a 3-hospital pragmatic trial, randomized 552 adults recently discharged with HF to usual care (n = 280) or a compound intervention (n = 272) designed to inform clinicians of diuretic adherence and changes in patient weight. Patients were recruited from May 25, 2016, to April 8, 2019, and followed up for 12 months. Investigators were blinded to assignment but patients were not. Analysis was by intent to treat. INTERVENTIONS Participants randomized to the intervention arm received digital scales, electronic pill bottles for diuretic medication, and regret lottery incentives conditional on the previous day's adherence to both medication and weight measurement, with $1.40 expected daily value. Participants' physicians were alerted if participants' weights increased 1.4 kg in 24 hours or 2.3 kg in 72 hours or if diuretic medications were missed for 5 days. Alerts and weights were integrated into the electronic health record. Participants randomized to the control arm received usual care and no further study contact. \n MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Time to death or readmission for any cause within 12 months. RESULTS Of the 552 participants, 290 were men (52.5%); 291 patients (52.7%) were Black, 231 were White (41.8%), and 16 were Hispanic (2.9%); mean (SD) age was 64.5 (11.8) years. The mean (SD) ejection fraction was 43% (18.1%). Each month, approximately 75% of participants were 80% adherent to both medication and weight measurement. There were 423 readmissions and 26 deaths in the control group and 377 readmissions and 23 deaths in the intervention group. There was no significant difference between the 2 groups for the combined outcome of all-cause inpatient readmission or death (unadjusted hazard ratio, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.74-1.13; P = .40) and no significant differences in all-cause inpatient readmission or observation stay or death, all-cause cardiovascular readmission or death, time to first event, and total all-cause deaths. Participants in the intervention group were slightly more likely to spend fewer days in the hospital. \n CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this randomized clinical trial, there was no reduction in the combined outcome of readmission or mortality in a year-long intensive remote monitoring program with incentives for patients previously hospitalized for HF.",

      "text": "eart failure (HF) management depends on a complex array of medications, lifestyle changes, follow-up care, and patient participation: a few missed doses of a diuretic medication or a small increase in dietary sodium can result in readmission.  1, 2 Clinicians need timely awareness of often subtle changes in weight or adherence to intervene before clinical deterioration, and yet those indicators are typically out of view.  3, 4 The result is a combination of awareness of the many potential opportunities for intervention along the pathway to HF readmission, and yet no efficient approaches to implement them.  [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]  A hope has been to engage patients in self-monitoring and efficiently engage clinicians in the care of those patients outside of office visits. New insights from the field of behavioral economics offer promise for sustaining this kind of patient engagement, for example, by offering rewards that not only provide immediate incentives for adherence but that are designed to harness known behavioral tendencies.  11 Daily lotteries have improved medication adherence and weight loss, and those that incorporate anticipated regret (people are notified whether they won or would have won) and variable rewards (frequent small payoffs and infrequent large payoffs) have been demonstrated to be engaging in a variety of contexts.  12 In addition, new technology allows important information from remote monitoring to be automatically integrated into the electronic health record (EHR), simplifying clinical workflows and presenting data in the context of care.\n\nHerein we report the main results of the Electronic Monitoring of Patients Offers Ways to Enhance Recovery (EMPOWER) trial, a pragmatic randomized clinical trial to evaluate whether an automated approach to patient engagement that incorporates behavioral economic principles can reduce readmissions in patients with HF discharged from the hospital."

      "text": "The EMPOWER trial was a 2-arm pragmatic randomized clinical trial comparing usual care in the management of patients discharged from the hospital after an admission for HF with a compound intervention comprising (1) daily automated assessments of weight and adherence to oral diuretic medications, (2) financial incentives and a support partner to encourage those assessments, and (3) reporting of substantial weight changes or nonadherence to diuretics to the managing clinician in the EHR. Participants provided verbal informed consent and received financial compensation. Patients were enrolled after discharge from a hospitalization for HF and were followed up for 1 year. The protocol and statistical analysis plan are reported in Supplement 1 and elsewhere.  13 The study was approved by the institutional review board of the University of Pennsylvania. This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guideline."

Eligible participants were aged 18 to 80 years, discharged from 1 of 3 Penn Medicine hospitals in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, with either a primary diagnosis of HF (preserved or reduced ejection fraction), a secondary diagnosis of HF with intravenous diuretics administered during their inpatient stay, or HF appearing on their problem list with intravenous diuretics administered during their hospital stay. Participants were eligible to enroll up to 30 days postdischarge if prescribed a daily diuretic and expected to have HF followed up by a Penn Medicine clinician (cardiology or primary care). Participants were excluded if they had kidney failure, required inotrope therapy, were listed for or receiving a heart transplant or ventricular assist device, were receiving palliative or hospice care, had a history of uncontrolled cognitive or psychiatric conditions that could affect study participation, or were participating in another telemonitoring program.\n\nWe enrolled patients with both preserved and reduced ejection fractions. Clinical practice guidelines recommend that all patients with HF be enrolled in a disease management program.  14 For both diseases, similar lifestyle changes and monitoring are recommended.\n\nPotentially eligible participants received up to 5 telephone calls from study staff. Participants providing verbal informed consent were then randomized to intervention or control in a 1:1 ratio stratified by hospital site. Investigators and data analysts were blinded to arm assignment; patients, study staff, and treating clinicians were not blinded. All enrolled participants received $25 for participation."

Support partners might directly encourage participant adherence or enhance it by creating known witnesses to it.  17, 18 n the intervention arm, participants' weights were automatically assessed against prespecified weight change thresholds of either 1.4 kg in 24 hours or 2.3 kg in 72 hours. Patients crossing either threshold were contacted by study staff to verify weights and answer a symptom questionnaire. Verified information was then posted as an abnormal result into the EHR and routed to the patient's managing clinician. Weekly, all verified weights were automatically imported into an EHR flowsheet in the participant's record.\n\nParticipants not weighing themselves or opening their pill bottle for 2 days received an automated message encouraging adherence; support partners also received the message. After 3 days of nonadherence, study staff called the participant; after 4 days, study staff called the support partner. After 5 days of nonadherence, study staff alerted the participant's clinicians through the EHR."

Preliminary data indicated an expected primary event rate at 1 year of approximately 47% in the control group; thus, the trial had approximately 80% power to detect a reduction in the primary event rate of 10 percentage points, to 37% in the intervention group. The primary hypothesis was tested with an unadjusted Andersen-Gill formulation of the standard Cox proportional hazards regression model to properly incorporate repeated events (ie, hospitalizations) within the same individual and account for their correlation.  19, 20 In sensitivity analysis, we applied standard Cox proportional hazards regression models to estimate HRs for time to first event. We also reported models adjusted for selfreported race and ethnicity, age, body mass index, ejection fraction greater than or equal to 40%, and income, using backward elimination augmented with a standard change-inestimate criterion, successively removing the least significant variable (other than the trial arm) until all remaining variables are significant or they cause a change in the estimate of arm by more than 10%.  21 o estimate total hospital days, we applied generalized linear models with a Poisson link function. We also assessed the likelihood of future events (readmission or death in the next 1, 2, or 4 weeks) as a function of earlier alerts using multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models fitted on data from patients in the intervention group. To assess subgroup effects, we interacted arm and a dichotomized indicator for baseline risk factors of interest (eg, ejection fraction at least 35%). Analyses were performed with SAS, version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc)."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "We aimed to reduce readmissions or death among patients discharged from the hospital after an admission for HF. We used a comprehensive intervention combining daily remote monitoring of weight and diuretic adherence, state-of-the-art behavioral economic techniques to encourage that monitoring, and low-friction ways to communicate potential patient problems to clinicians in the EHR. The patients in the intervention group did no better than those receiving usual care. Each of the components of the intervention was executed mostly as planned. Patients set up the remote monitoring devices. They largely maintained engagement, although that engagement decreased over 12 months. Alerts were read by monitoring clinicians, and a third of the alerts were responded to. No step along this pathway was executed perfectly, but this trial was pragmatic-testing a highly complex intervention in the context of usual care.  22 he results suggest that the combination of elements in this intervention when executed at this level of success was insufficient to alter these patients' trajectories. Perhaps trial enrollment and device set up occurred too late following the index discharge. Many HF readmissions occur in the early days following discharge; although the timing of trial enrollment was the same in both arms, if earlier admissions would be differentially prevented by the intervention, an overall effect could have been missed. Maybe adherence to diuretics or weight reporting needed to be even higher. Patient adherence was associated with outcome (eTable 2 in Supplement 2), but these associations can be attributed to a healthy user effect in which adherence is not the cause of better outcomes but is instead a marker for health-promoting behaviors more directly on the causal pathway toward them.  23 Nevertheless, the adherence seen in this study is lower than that previously associated with better HF outcomes.  24 Maybe the weight change thresholds were too insensitive. Perhaps clinicians responded to too few of the alerts, too late, or incorrectly. Or maybe the intervention was targeted at too broad a patient population-taking in, as it did, a generally unselected heterogeneous set of patients hospitalized with HF, whether with preserved or reduced ejection fraction. More generally, given that this study and another 12 revealed that many readmissions following discharge for HF are not related to HF (eTable 4 in Supplement 2), it is possible that interventions specifically targeted toward HF are too narrow.\n\nWe can speak to some of these issues. The alerts themselves were associated with increases in the events constituting our primary outcome. Although the generation of alerts is a postrandomization variable and such estimates can be subject to omitted variable bias, this finding is consistent with an earlier study suggesting that increasing weight is a risk factor for imminent HF hospitalization.  4 In addition, we found that adding alerts to the risk-adjusted model increased the model's discriminating power in predicting short-term events, so use of alerts as a component of a risk prediction algorithm may be warranted. These findings suggest that too few alerts may have prompted clinical responses.\n\nMost individual trials of structured telephone support have similarly not shown a benefit in outcomes; however, a Cochrane meta-analysis reported a significant reduction in HFrelated hospitalizations and all-cause mortality.  25 Most HF centers, including ours, incorporate such structured telephone follow up after hospitalization, and it is possible that our intervention did not show a significant benefit given this and other interventions that are already in place, resulting in a low"

      "text": "This study has limitations. First, it was conducted in a single academic health system, although across 3 hospitals and among a diverse set of patients. Second, the participants were recruited and observed over a 4-year period when great effort was being introduced into usual care to reduce readmissions and improve guideline-directed medical care for HF. However, we found no differences in effect size for patients recruited earlier in the study compared with later. This study also has strengths. It was a pragmatic randomized clinical trial against usual care. It captured a relevant patient population at a time that could have plausibly made a difference. It used the study period's best available technology and clinical and behavioral insights and the execution of the logistic elements succeeded. The reporting of alerts and daily weights was streamlined, leveraging the EHR and simplifying workflows for clinicians."
