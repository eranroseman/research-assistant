      "title": "I. INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "The Internet of Things (IoT) is a concept reflecting a connected set of anyone, anything, anytime, anyplace, any service, and any network. The IoT is a megatrend in next-generation technologies that can impact the whole business spectrum and can be thought of as the interconnection of uniquely identifiable smart objects and devices within today's internet infrastructure with extended benefits. Benefits typically include the advanced connectivity of these devices, systems, and services that goes beyond machineto-machine (M2M) scenarios  [1] . Therefore, introducing automation is conceivable in nearly every field. The IoT provides appropriate solutions for a wide range of applications such as smart cities, traffic congestion, waste management, structural health, security, emergency services, logistics, retails, industrial control, and health care. The interested reader is referred to  [1] -  [5]  for a deeper understanding of the IoT.\n\nMedical care and health care represent one of the most attractive application areas for the IoT  [6] . The IoT has the potential to give rise to many medical applications such as remote health monitoring, fitness programs, chronic diseases, and elderly care. Compliance with treatment and medication at home and by healthcare providers is another important potential application. Therefore, various medical devices, sensors, and diagnostic and imaging devices can be viewed as smart devices or objects constituting a core part of the IoT. IoT-based healthcare services are expected to reduce costs, increase the quality of life, and enrich the user's experience. From the perspective of healthcare providers, the IoT has the potential to reduce device downtime through remote provision. In addition, the IoT can correctly identify optimum times for replenishing supplies for various devices for their smooth and continuous operation. Further, the IoT provides for the efficient scheduling of limited resources by ensuring their best use and service of more patients. Fig.  1  illustrates recent healthcare trends  [7] . Ease of cost-effective interactions through seamless and secure connectivity across individual patients, clinics, and healthcare organizations is an important trend. Up-to-date healthcare networks driven by wireless technologies are expected to support chronic diseases, early diagnosis, real-time monitoring, and medical emergencies. Gateways, medical servers, and health databases play vital roles in creating health records and delivering on-demand health services to authorized stakeholders.\n\nIn the last few years, this field has attracted wide attention from researchers to address the potential of the IoT in the healthcare field by considering various practical challenges. As a consequence, there are now numerous applications, services, and prototypes in the field. Research trends in IoT-based health care include network architectures and platforms, new services and applications, interoperability, and security, among others. In addition, policies and guidelines have been developed for deploying the IoT technology in the medical field in many countries and organizations across the world. However, the IoT remains in its infancy in the healthcare field. At this stage, a thorough understanding of current research on the IoT in the healthcare context is expected to be useful for various stakeholders interested in further research. This paper examines the trends in IoT-based healthcare research and uncovers various issues that must be addressed to transform healthcare technologies through the IoT innovation. In this regard, this paper contributes by\n\n\u2022 Classifying existing IoT-based healthcare network studies into three trends and presenting a summary of each.\n\n\u2022 Providing an extensive survey of IoT-based healthcare services and applications.\n\n\u2022 Highlighting various industrial efforts to embrace IoT-compatible healthcare products and prototypes.\n\n\u2022 Providing extensive insights into security and privacy issues surrounding IoT healthcare solutions and proposing a security model.\n\n\u2022 Discussing core technologies that can reshape healthcare technologies based on the IoT.\n\n\u2022 Highlighting various policies and strategies that can support researchers and policymakers in integrating the IoT innovation into healthcare technologies in practice.\n\n\u2022 Providing challenges and open issues that must be addressed to make IoT-based healthcare technologies robust. It should be noted that R&D activities in the field of healthcare services based on the wireless sensor network (WSN)  [8] ,  [9]  can be considered as initial IoT-based healthcare research efforts. However, the ongoing trend is to shift away from registered standards and adopt IP-based sensor networks using the emerging IPv6-based low-power wireless personal area network (6LoWPAN). If WSNs become a core part of the Internet, then a careful analysis is necessary. To better understand the evolution of WSNs toward the IoT and thus their fundamental differences, the reader is referred to  [10] -  [12] ."

      "text": "The IoT healthcare network or the IoT network for health care (hereafter ''the IoThNet'') is one of the vital elements of the IoT in health care. It supports access to the IoT backbone, facilitates the transmission and reception of medical data, and enables the use of healthcare-tailored communications. As shown in Fig.  2 , this section discusses the IoThNet topology, architecture, and platform. However, it should be mentioned that the proposed architectures in  [13]  and  [14]  can be considered as a good starting point for developing insights into the IoT network."

      "title": "A. THE IoThNet TOPOLOGY",
      "text": "The IoThNet topology refers to the arrangement of different elements of an IoT healthcare network and indicates representative scenarios of seamless healthcare environments. Fig.  3  describes how a heterogeneous computing grid collects enormous amounts of vital signs and sensor data such as blood pressure (BP), body temperature, electrocardiograms (ECG), and oxygen saturation and forms a typical IoThNet topology. It transforms the heterogeneous computing and storage capability of static and mobile electronic devices such as laptops, smartphones, and medical terminals into hybrid computing grids  [15] .\n\nFig.  4  visualizes a scenario in which a patient's health profile and vitals are captured using portable medical devices and sensors attached to his or her body. Captured data are then analyzed and stored, and stored data from various sensors and machines become useful for aggregation. Based on analyses and aggregation, caregivers can monitor patients from any location and respond accordingly. In addition, the topology includes a required network structure for supporting the streaming of medical videos. For example, the topology in Fig.  4  supports the streaming of ultrasound videos through an interconnected network with worldwide interoperability for microwave access (WiMAX), an internet protocol (IP) network, and a global system for a mobile (GSM) network as well as usual gateways and access service networks. Similar conceptual structures are found in  [16] -  [19] . and display all collected data  [20] . A similar IoThNet topology is found in  [21] , which integrates clinical devices with the IoT healthcare enterprise infrastructure.\n\nIdentifying associated activities and roles in medical services is a fundamental factor in designing the IoThNet topology. Pre-, in-, and post-treatment processing involves healthcare services mainly from the perspective of healthcare service providers. Such healthcare activities have been demonstrated in the context of emergency medical services  [22] , and an IoThNet topology including cloud computing for pervasive health care has been proposed  [23] . This can be viewed as a conventional complete-mesh networking system with the omnipresence of internet connectivity. Then the topology must include a medical rule system in the case of a semantic medical monitoring system  [24] ."

      "title": "B. THE IoThNet ARCHITECTURE",
      "text": "The IoThNet architecture refers to an outline for the specification of the IoThNet's physical elements, their functional organization, and its working principles and techniques. To start, the basic reference architecture in Fig.  6  is presented for the telehealth and ambient assisted living systems recommended by Continua Health Alliance. The key issues have been identified for this architecture  [25] : the interoperability of the IoT gateway and the wireless local area network (WLAN)/wireless personal area network (WPAN), multimedia streaming, and secure communications between IoT gateways and caregivers.\n\nMany studies  [18] ,  [21] ,  [23] ,  [26] -  [33]  have justified that the IPv6-based 6LoWPAN is the basis of the IoThNet. As designed in  [34] , Fig.  7  shows the layer structure of the 6LoWLAN. According to the IoThNet concept, sensors and wearables use IPv6 and 6LoWPAN systems for data transmission over the 802.15.4 protocol. Data are then replied back by sensor nodes with the help of the user datagram protocol (UDP). However, the 6LoWPAN is limited in that it does not support mobile IPv6 (MIPv6), a subset of the IPv6 protocol with mobility. To introduce mobility provision to the 6LoWPAN, a protocol for exchanging messages between mobile patient nodes, base networks, and visited networks is proposed in  [26] .\n\nTo address mobility, four alternative procedures are considered in  [29] , including soliciting routers, waiting for a new directed acyclic graph (DAG) information object (DIO), attaching to other available parent nodes, and sending DAG information solicitation (DIS) messages. Among these, soliciting routers and sending DIS messages represent the fastest methods because they are initiated by the mobile node itself. A typical gateway protocol stack for community medical services is described in  [35] . This stack explicitly describes how periodic traffic, abnormal traffic, and querydriven traffic can be managed within the HetNet. A complex eHealth service delivery method consisting of three phases has been proposed in  [36] , including composition, signalization, and data transmission. Signalization protocols serve mainly as the basis of complex service composition, quality-of-service (QoS) negotiation, and resource allocation procedures in the IoThNet. Fig.  8  shows the state encountered in the QoS negotiation procedure, which is nothing but the creation of a connection to expected QoS values.\n\nMedical devices have been considered for vehicular networks, and captured health data have been examined through IPv6 application servers  [18] . Here the lightweight autoconfiguration protocol shown in Fig.  9  has introduced for vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications in the IoThNet. This protocol uses the IPv6 route as a default route in the routing table. This provides a set of IPv6 addresses for health devices in a vehicle. The extent to which big data can reshape the data structure in healthcare services is described in  [37] , and the question of how multiple communications standards can be coordinated to give rise to the IothNet is discussed in  [38] . The data distribution architecture is examined in the case of cloud computing integration in  [22] . The next subsection discusses this structure for the IoThNet platform because this involves both the architecture and platform."

      "title": "C. THE IoThNet PLATFORM",
      "text": "The IoThNet platform refers to both the network platform model and the computing platform. As shown in Fig.  10 , a service platform framework focusing on residents' health information is presented in  [39] . This framework shows a systematic hierarchical model of how caregivers or agents can access various databases from the application layer with the help of a support layer. A similar concept of data center platforms as the middleware between smart objects and the business layer can be found in  [40] .\n\nThe importance of standardizing interfaces across stakeholders of the IoThNet toward the design of an open platform is emphasized in  [41] . As shown in Fig.  11 , three categories of interface standardization to establish a cooperative ecosystem have been presented, including hardware and software interfaces, health data formats (electronic health record; EHR), and security schemes. This can eventually ensure associated interoperability. A big picture of an automating design methodology (ADM) platform for the IoThNet, particularly for rehabilitation purposes, is presented in  [42] . As shown in Fig.  12 , this design framework includes the human-machine interface, multidisciplinary optimization, and application management.\n\nThe feasibility of using VIRTUS, an event-driven middleware package, to support IoT healthcare applications is analyzed in  [43] , and reliable and scalable communications over the IoThNet have been found to be feasible through VIRTUS based on the XMPP, a protocol for instant messaging, even in the case of poor connectivity. A method to enable the IoT gateway to handle multiple users with multiple sensors is proposed in  [33] . This method provides an algorithmic approach to how the gateway reads raw health data received from an edge router and parses captured data in some predetermined format in the database. A three-layer cloud platform for accessing ubiquitous cloud data through the IoThNet is designed in  [22] . The tenant database layer stores multitenant databases. The resource layer is responsible for controlling data access, and the business layer performs required coordination for data sharing and interoperation. It should be noted that distributed health data are organized using a resource control mechanism.\n\nSome studies  [25] ,  [31] ,  [44] ,  [45]  have addressed IoThNet platform issues. Although these studies have not provided a comprehensive and generalized analysis of such models, some design issues are noteworthy in specific cases. A semantic platform architecture is introduced in  [46] . This architecture offers semantic interoperability across heterogeneous systems and devices and provides user  environments and domotic devices with some semantic capability. Its semantic layer can support four types of ontologies."

      "text": "IoT-based healthcare systems can be applied to a diverse array of fields, including care for pediatric and elderly patients, the supervision of chronic diseases, and the management of private health and fitness, among others. For a better understanding of this extensive topic, this paper broadly categorizes the discussion in two aspects: services and applications. Applications are further divided into two groups: single-and clustered-condition applications. A single-condition application refers to a specific disease or infirmity, whereas a clustered-condition application deals with a number of diseases or conditions together as a whole. Fig.  13  illustrates this categorization. Note that this classification structure is framed based on today's available healthcare solutions using the IoT. This list is inherently dynamic in nature and can be easily enhanced by adding additional services with distinct features and numerous applications covering both single-and clustered-condition solutions. This section introduces each of the services and applications shown in the figure."

      "title": "A. IoT HEALTHCARE SERVICES",
      "text": "The IoT is anticipated to enable a variety of healthcare services in which each service provides a set of healthcare solutions. In the context of healthcare, there is no standard definition of IoT services. However, there may be some cases in which a service cannot be objectively differentiated from a particular solution or application. This paper proposes that a service is by some means generic in nature and has the potential to be a building block for a set of solutions or applications. In addition, it should be noted that general services and protocols required for IoT frameworks may require slight modifications for their proper functioning in healthcare scenarios. These include notification services, resourcesharing services, internet services, cross-connectivity protocols for heterogeneous devices, and link protocols for major connectivity. The easy, fast, secure, and low-power discovery of devices and services can be added to this list. However, a discussion on such generalized IoT services is beyond the scope of this survey. The interested reader is referred to the literature for a more comprehensive understanding of this topic. The following subsections include various types of IoT healthcare services."

      "title": "1) AMBIENT ASSISTED LIVING (AAL)",
      "text": "In general, neither a smart home nor a typical IoT-based medical service is inevitably supposed to offer specialized  services to elderly individuals. That is, a separate IoT service is obligatory. An IoT platform powered by artificial intelligence that can address the health care of aging and incapacitated individuals is called ambient assisted living (AAL). The purpose of AAL is to extend the independent life of elderly individuals in their place of living in a convenient and safe manner. Solutions provided by AAL services can make elderly individuals confident by ensuring greater autonomy and giving them human-servant-like assistance in case of any problem. Several studies have discussed AAL based on the IoT. A modular architecture for automation, security, control, and communication is proposed for IoT-based AAL in  [26] . This architecture basically serves as a framework for providing healthcare services to elderly and incapacitate individuals. As the underlying technology for implementing this architecture, 6LoWPAN is used for active communications, and radio frequency identification (RFID) and near-field communications (NFC) are used for passive communications. This architecture has been extended by incorporating algorithms based on medical knowledge to detect problems facing elderly individuals. The question of how the central AAL paradigm over the IoT can be realized is discussed in  [47] , and it has been argued that a combination of keep-in-touch (KIT) smart objects and closed-loop healthcare services can facilitate AAL. Then this resultant infrastructure can employ the IoT to enable communication between stakeholders such as elderly individuals, caregivers, physicians, and family members. These efforts have motivated researchers to develop protocols for making KIT smart objects and closed-loop healthcare services function through the IoT. An open, secure, and flexible platform based on the IoT and cloud computing is proposed in  [25] . This platform addresses various limitations associated with interoperability, security, the streaming quality of service (QoS), and data storage, and its feasibility has been verified by installing an IoT-based health gateway on a desktop computer as reference implementation. Previous studies have highlighted the need for AAL and corresponding technological support and presented a tentative road map for state-of-the-art AAL technologies  [19] . Further, an IoT-based secure service for AAL-based medication control is examined in  [48] ."

In theory, m-IoT familiarizes a novel healthcare connectivity model that connects the 6LoWPAN with evolving 4G networks for future internet-based m-health services. Although m-IoT characteristically represents the IoT for healthcare services, it is worth mentioning that there exist some specific features intrinsic to the global mobility of participating entities. This leads to the conceptualization of m-IoT services. The use of m-IoT services has been examined based on the potential of m-IoT for the noninvasive sensing of the glucose level, and the m-IoT architecture, implementation issues, and challenges are addressed in  [28] . Context-aware issues and m-IoT ecosystems are two distinct challenges in m-IoT services  [19] .

This may happen after a single dose of a drug or its prolonged administration or as a consequence of a combination of two or more drugs. Because the ADR is inherently generic, that is, not specific to the medication for a particular disease, there is a need to separately design certain common technical issues and their solutions (called ADR services). An IoT-based ADR is proposed in  [51] . Here the patient's terminal identifies the drug by means of barcode/NFC-enabled devices. With the help of a pharmaceutical intelligent information system, this information is then coordinated to sense whether the drug is compatible with its allergy profile and electronic health record. The iMedPack has been developed as part of the iMedBox to address the ADR  [20]  by making use of RFID and controlled delamination material (CDM) technologies."

In this regard, a specialized service called community health care (CH) is inevitable for meeting collective technical requirements as a package. A cooperative IoT platform for rural healthcare monitoring has been proposed and found to be energy-efficient  [52] . Here a distinct authentication and authorization mechanism should be incorporated because it is a cooperative network. A community medical network is proposed in  [35] . This network integrates multiple wireless body area networks (WBANs) to materialize CH. The structure of a community medical network can be viewed as a ''virtual hospital.'' A resident health information service platform based on a a functional framework of a four-layer structure has been considered, and a method for sharing data between medical facilities and the service platform for obtaining health records and accessing remote medical advice is presented in  [39] ."

Therefore, the integration of aforementioned sensors into wearable products is apparent. However, the heterogeneous nature of wearable products and medical sensors uncovers numerous challenges for researchers and developers working toward the said integration. In this context, a dedicated service called wearable device access (WDA) is required. The integration of wearable devices into applications based on WSNs for IoT scenarios is presented in  [56] . This method introduces a prototype system that can be used in a wide variety of healthcare applications through various mobile computing devices such as smartphones and smart watches. An activity recognition method based on mobile devices for the remote monitoring of patients is proposed in  [57] , an IoT-based remote activity monitoring system using wearable devices is demonstrated in  [43] , and the question of how Bluetooth low energy (BLE) can enable a WBAN for wearable devices is addressed in  [30] ."

Therefore, it is difficult to identify and predict all possible vulnerabilities, threats, and attacks associated with the IoT medical domain. Nonetheless, when security specialists work to find tentative security solutions for apparent and predictable problems, such security schemes should have the capability to mitigate unseen or unpredictable issues that have yet to emerge. To achieve this security goal, security services should be designed with dynamic properties. That is, they should have the ability to reach decisions on unnoticed problems based on experience and knowledge.\n\nConsider a scenario in which a security scheme includes services that can detect and evade two types of attacks on message integrity. However, now suppose that, with the expansion of health devices, networks, and applications, an attacker initiates a new type of attack that also threatens medical information integrity. In this case, existing security services are expected to be capable of at least identifying this new type of attack by using dynamic algorithms or those based on artificial intelligence. To address this issue, this paper proposes a security model for IoT-based healthcare services. This intelligent security model is collaborative in nature and uses the most recent knowledge base. Fig.  19  presents the collaboration scheme for the following three security services: Protection services are designed to reduce attacks. Detection services receive activity data from healthcare applications, devices, and networks and analyze captured health data, eventually detecting any anomaly. With the aid of defense mechanisms, reaction services help health entities survive all attacks.\n\nThese security services are designed using dynamic algorithms, and there is strong collaboration between these services to defend against present, possible, and unseen attacks. Upon intrusion detection, detection services issue action commands to reaction services and share their anomaly detection experience with protection services to minimize further attacks. In response to action commands from detection services, reaction services eliminate system malfunction risks and then share their action experience with both detection and protection services. In this inter-service collaboration is achieved."

Here the introduction of electronic medical records, ePrescription, and telemedicine is considered a key initiative driving the use of ICT in the healthcare sector  [184] . In February 2014, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) commissioners discussed policy and regulatory implications of the IoT. The FTC has focused on two major areas of the IoT, namely the provision of notice and choice for non-consumerfacing network devices and the question of how devices that are part of the IoT can be ensured to have reasonable data security.\n\nUpon the European Commission's request, RAND Europe has worked to devise a European policy for the IoT. A research team has evaluated policy challenges to be addressed by policymakers from mid-and long-term perspectives and made some recommendations after assessing policy options for stimulating the development of the IoT in Europe [185]. In June 2010, the European Parliament proposed a resolution to help create the IoT. The E.U. parliament recommended the thorough assessment of any effects of this technology on health, privacy, and data protection. Under this resolution, a consumer enjoys the right to opt for a product that is not equipped or connected  [180] . The European Council endorsed the eHealth Action Plan in 2004  [182] , which is the first formal commitment expressed by all member states to cooperate in the area of eHealth.

To address device diversity, immediate efforts are required. For example, a dedicated group can standardize IoT-based healthcare technologies. This standardization should consider a wide range of topics such as communications layers and protocol stacks, including physical (PHY) and media access control (MAC) layers, device interfaces, data aggregation interfaces, and gateway interfaces. The management of various value-added services such as electronic health records is another standardization issue. This management comes in various forms, including access management and healthcare professional registration. Various mHealth and eHealth organizations and IoT researchers can work together, and existing standardization bodies such as the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation (IETF), the Internet Protocol for Smart Objects (IPSO) alliance, and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) can form IoT technology working groups for the standardization of IoT-based healthcare services."
