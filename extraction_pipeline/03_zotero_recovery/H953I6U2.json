  "title": "Digital Health Interventions to Prevent Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus: Systematic Review",
  "abstract": "Background: Digital health interventions (DHIs) have rapidly evolved and significantly revolutionized the health care system. The quadruple aims of health care (improving population health, enhancing consumer experience, enhancing health care provider [HCP] experience, and decreasing health costs) serve as a strategic guiding framework for DHIs. It is unknown how DHIs can impact the burden of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), as measured by the quadruple aims. Objective: This study aimed to systematically review the effects of DHIs on improving the burden of T2DM, as measured by the quadruple aims. Methods: PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, and Web of Science were searched for studies published from January 2014 to March 2024. Primary outcomes were the development of T2DM, hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c ) change, and blood glucose change (dysglycemia changes). Secondary outcomes were consumer experience, HCP experience, and health care costs. Outcomes were mapped to the quadruple aims. DHIs were categorized using the World Health Organization's DHI classification. For each study, DHI categories were assessed for their effects on each outcome, categorizing the effects as positive, negative, or neutral. The overall effects of each DHI category were determined by synthesizing all reported positive, neutral, or negative effects regardless of the number of studies supporting each effect. The Cochrane risk-of-bias version 2 (RoB 2) tool for randomized trials was used to assess the quality of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), while the ROBINS-I (risk of bias in nonrandomized studies of interventions) tool was applied for nonrandomized studies. \n Results: In total, 53 papers were included. For the T2DM development outcome, the effects of DHIs were positive in 1 (1.9%) study and neutral in 9 (17%) studies, and there were insufficient data to assess in 4 (7.5%) studies. For the dysglycemia outcome, the effects were positive in 23 (43.4%) studies and neutral in 24 (45.3%) studies, and there were insufficient data in 6 (11.3%) studies. There were mixed effects on consumer experience (n=13, 24.5%) and a lack of studies reporting HCP experience (n=1, 1.9%) and health care costs (n=3, 5.7%). All studies that reported positive population health outcomes used a minimum of 2 distinct categories of DHIs. Among these successful studies, the one that reported delaying the development of T2DM and 16 (69.6%) of those reporting improvements in dysglycemia involved HCP interaction. Targeted communication with persons (TCP), personal health tracking (PHT), and telemedicine (TM) showed some evidence as a potentially useful tool for T2DM prevention and dysglycemia.",

      "text": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a growing health problem worldwide that affects all income levels and puts a heavy burden on health care systems  [1] . The increased prevalence of T2DM is largely due to changes in diet, rising obesity rates, and decreased physical activity  [2] . Therefore, improving lifestyle can potentially help prevent T2DM  [1] . Diabetes prevention programs (DPPs) and other lifestyle modifications strategies have been applied worldwide, demonstrating that such changes can effectively reduce the risk of developing T2DM  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] .\n\nDigital health interventions (DHIs), the application of digital technologies in health care  [7] , have transformed how health care is provided and experienced, leading to great health system efficiencies and clinical benefits  [7] [8] [9] . Given the diverse communities involved in DHI (ie, technologists, researchers, clinicians, consumers, and government stakeholders), there is a need to establish a common language among these groups  [7] . To address this need, the World Health Organization (WHO) developed a DHI classification system to provide a shared framework for naming, grouping, and evaluating DHIs. According to this classification, each DHI is categorized into groups based on primary users: persons, health care providers (HCPs), health system managers, and data services  [7] .\n\nDHIs have been extensively applied in chronic disease management, showing clinical outcome improvements, better management, and cost savings  [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . During the past 10 years, DHIs are being increasingly applied in T2DM prevention, such as text messaging, web-based systems, telemedicine (TM), mobile health, software, wearables, and artificial intelligence (AI)  [16, 17] . A systematic review by Van Rhoon et al  [18]  in 2020 demonstrated that DHIs significantly reduce weight, enhance dysglycemia, and decrease T2DM incidence. According to the systematic review by Nguyen et al  [19]  in 2024, DHIs show further enhanced efficacy in preventing T2DM, highlighting the success of computer-based and mobile health in weight reduction, hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c ) improvement, and T2DM incidence reduction.\n\nThe quadruple aims of health care are the overarching goals focusing on improving population health, enhancing consumer experience, improving HCP experience, and decreasing health costs  [20] . The quadruple aims have been regarded as a strategic compass in guiding DHIs in different contexts, such as chronic disease prevention  [21] , diagnosis and treatment  [22, 23] , health care delivery  [24] , planning or decision-making  [25] , and managing unique health care challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic  [26] .\n\nThe impacts of DHIs on improving the burden of T2DM, as measured by the quadruple aims, still remain largely unknown. Our aim was to systematically review the current literature to examine the effects of DHIs on reducing the burden of T2DM, as measured by the quadruple aims."

The protocol of our systematic review was prospectively registered at PROSPERO (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews; registration number CRD42024512690). Minor changes were made to the registration information: the title was updated, the quadruple aims were added to the objectives, and WHO's DHI classification was included in the data synthesis."

Building, testing, and finalizing the search approach were performed by the research team, in consultation with 2 research librarians from the University of Queensland (Multimedia Appendix 2).\n\nInclusion and exclusion criteria are listed in Table  1 . The intervention of interest was defined as the use of DHIs in support of the prevention of T2DM in individuals with monitored blood glucose or HbA 1c . Given our focus on assessing the effects of DHIs on preventing or delaying the onset of T2DM, and considering that the diagnostic criteria for T2DM include HbA 1c , blood glucose, and clinical criteria, our primary outcomes were the development of T2DM, HbA 1c change, or blood glucose change (dysglycemia changes). Secondary outcomes were consumer experience, HCP experience, and health care costs. Quantitative and qualitative data were included in our review. Studies were excluded if individuals or populations had known diabetes (T2DM, type 1 diabetes, or gestational diabetes, as described by authors of specific studies) or outcomes that did not report the development of T2DM, HbA 1c change, or blood glucose change."

However, a few studies (n=7, 77.8%) had a high risk of bias or some concerns in the T2DM development outcome. This was mainly due to discrepancies observed in the measurement of the T2DM development outcome between groups and bias resulting from missing outcome data. There were no high risks of bias in consumer experience and health care cost outcomes, with the majority having low risks (n=37, 70%, and n=35, 66.7%, respectively).

Our findings enhance other recent studies, such as Nguyen et al  [19] , by offering a more comprehensive insight into the outcomes that are measured (and not measured), and the effects of DHIs on each outcome, in alignment with the quadruple aims of health care. This contributes to an evidence-based foundation for the future successful customization and implementation of DHIs for T2DM prevention. This is also the first systematic review of T2DM prevention using WHO's DHI classification, which significantly aids in a mutually comprehensible language for various communities involved in digital health for T2DM prevention, such as technologists, researchers, clinicians, and consumers.\n\nOur review highlights several important findings. First, there is emerging evidence supporting the effectiveness of DHIs in preventing T2DM; however, the evidence remains limited. Although only 1 study  [39]  reported positive effects, 9 studies indicated neutral effects and no studies reported negative effects. This is consistent with the findings by Nguyen et al  [19] . Despite this, most of these neutral studies still demonstrated clinical improvements in T2DM development, though these improvements did not reach statistical significance. The evidence is clearer on dysglycemia, where the effects were positive in nearly half of the studies and neutral in the other half. Further research will need to conclusively determine the effectiveness of DHIs in preventing T2DM.\n\nSecond, the duration of DHI may play an important role in the effects on the population health outcome. All studies successful in improving dysglycemia had a DHI duration of at least 3 months, while the study successful in T2DM prevention had a duration of 12 months  [39] . Among the 10 studies with a low risk of bias in all outcomes and an intervention duration of at least 1 year, a high percentage of studies (70%) demonstrated positive effects of DHIs on dysglycemia. Comparable results about dysglycemia were reported by Van Rhoon et al  [18]  and Donevant et al  [85] . This can be because habit formation usually takes 2-3 months  [86] , and significant HbA 1c changes require at least 3 months  [87] . However, recent evidence from DPPs that have proven to be successful shows that long intervention durations are required for delaying T2DM  [88] , with the National Health Service recommending at least 9 months and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention suggesting 12 months. For effective T2DM prevention, a minimum DHI duration of 9-12 months may be ideal. Future research should validate these findings.\n\nThird, there was no evidence that DHIs are effective in preventing T2DM without HCP interaction, and most studies (69.6%) successful in improving dysglycemia involved HCP interaction (75% remote, 12.5% in person, and 12.5% both). Comparable results were reported in the review by Grock et al  [89] , which highlighted the importance of social interaction for successful diabetes prevention interventions. The meta-analysis by Schippers et al  [90]  reported that mobile apps with personal interaction tools (messages, calls, email, or in-person meetings) are more effective for weight loss than automated interaction. This underscores the critical role of HCP interaction in preventing T2DM, while also revealing the promising potential of replacing in-person HCP interactions with remote interactions for effective DHIs for T2DM prevention.\n\nNext, all studies that reported positive population health outcomes used a minimum of 2 distinct categories of DHIs. These findings share similarities with the systematic review by Van Rhoon et al  [18] , which suggested that interventions with a larger number of passive and interactive digital features are more effective. In our review, TCP, which involves transmitting health information or health alerts and reminders to patients, was adopted in all included studies, demonstrating its widespread use and simplicity. TCP was used in combination with other DHI categories, such as PHT, TM, PCP, or DCP.\n\nPHT showed evidence as a potentially useful tool for T2DM prevention and dysglycemia improvement in our review. Similarly, many studies showed that PHT successfully increases physical activity and decreases a sedentary lifestyle  [91] [92] [93] . The effect of PHT on consumer experience was mixed. Automatic data capture in wearables and medical devices received more positive feedback than manual data capture, which had only neutral or negative effects. This is likely because data capture is more aligned with manual tasks, whereas wearables and medical devices are designed for automatic data collection. This result aligns with the study by Kim et al  [94]  on self-tracking via a web-based platform. Participants using devices with automatic data entry engaged with the platform 4 times longer than those who manually entered data  [94] . This evidence strongly suggests that PHT, particularly automated tracking devices, could play a pivotal role in the prevention strategies for T2DM.\n\nOur review suggests that TM may be effective in preventing T2DM and managing dysglycemia. This aligns with the review by Nguyen et al  [19] . TM consists of remote consultations through calls and messages, and remote health monitoring. This monitoring can be achieved either automatically or manually via PHT tools, such as wearables, medical devices, or web-based apps. Consequently, there is a significant correlation between TM and PHT. Our review also shows evidence that the combination of TM, PHT, and TCP is effective in T2DM prevention. This suggests that such DHIs should not only be embraced but also be integrated with other DHIs in T2DM prevention.\n\nAlthough PPC or DCP did not prove effective in preventing T2DM, they showed evidence of improving dysglycemia. PPC may be beneficial in glycemic control for diabetes management  [95, 96] .\n\nThere is evidence that using DCP (look-up tools, human-like conversations) is helpful in diabetes prevention and management. In our review, AI used with wearables showed positive effects on glycemic status  [46, 56] . Similarly, evidence indicates that using AI technology in diabetes management is effective when combined with wearable technologies  [97] . Advanced algorithms and data from everyday participants' activities allowed AI to provide lifestyle recommendations, which were real time, personalized, and contextual for each participant, contributing to delivering patient-centered care  [98] . VR was used in 1 study, providing an immersive experience that increased participant engagement and enjoyment  [99] . This highlights an advantage of VR technology. Further studies are needed to explore the potential of PPC, AI, and VR in T2DM prevention.\n\nHealth records and HCP DS were the least common in our review, with only 1 included study showing neutral effects. These DHIs target HCPs rather than consumers. Since preventing T2DM requires participants to modify lifestyles for a long period, DHIs that motivate and engage consumers may be more beneficial than DHIs targeting HCPs alone. Further studies should explore combining these DHIs with consumer-targeted interventions.\n\nFinally, there were insufficient studies assessing HCP experience (1 study) and health care costs (3 studies). For other topics, there were several studies focusing on the effects of DHIs on HCP experience. Lampickien\u0117 et al [100] concluded that HCPs mostly report positive experiences with digital consultations, which have advantages for HCPs and patients. Studies that reported health care costs of DHIs were sparse; all 3 studies in our review indicated no positive cost outcomes in DHIs. According to a systematic review of DHIs by Gentili et al [101], there is convincing evidence of the cost-effectiveness of DHI in health care. They indicated that several types of DHIs, such as videoconferencing systems, messaging, calls, mobile apps, and web-based platforms, help reduce health care costs. Although the findings in our review were different, the small number of studies suggests that it may still be feasible to implement DHIs that are cost-effective in T2DM prevention. Further studies implementing DHIs should assess not only population health outcomes and consumer experiences but also HCP experiences and health care costs."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "There are some limitations of our review. The diagnosis criteria for T2DM varied slightly across studies. This is because of different guidelines, resources, and clinical considerations. Although our study reflected a real-world scenario, the variation in diagnosis criteria could potentially lead to data inconsistencies, because different diagnosis criteria may classify the same participant differently.\n\nThe inclusion criteria of our study permitted a wide range of variability in aspects, such as study design, study population, DHIs, and duration. DHIs are intended for real-life implementation, and the condition of RCTs is unlikely to match those routine settings, while before-and-after studies or cohort studies can provide valuable insights into special populations, such as patients with chronic liver disease  [57]  or renal transplant  [58] , groups that are often difficult to enroll in RCTs. This diversity, while inclusive, posed challenges in drawing direct comparisons and made it unfeasible to conduct a meta-analysis or certainty-of-evidence assessment.\n\nThe intervention duration fluctuated between 1 month and 48 months. Chronic diseases, such as T2DM, develop over a long period  [102] . Short-term studies may not allow for the comprehensive effects of DHIs to show a clear impact on disease progression. More studies with longer durations are needed. Our study did not summarize the intensity and frequency of the DHI used in each included study. To provide a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of DHIs, further reviews and studies should examine the intensity and frequency of DHIs, rather than solely focusing on their duration. Finally, our inclusion criteria included papers in English only. This may have potentially excluded some relevant studies."

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "The findings from this systematic review demonstrate that the effects of DHIs on the quadruple aims in T2DM prevention have proven benefits for population health, mixed results for consumer experience, and insufficient studies on HCP experience and health care costs. Further studies should prioritize improving consumer experience, while also addressing HCP experience and health care costs.\n\nAlthough evidence supporting the effectiveness of DHIs in reducing the burden of T2DM remains limited, it is clear DHIs are effective in improving dysglycemia. To maximize their effectiveness in preventing T2DM and managing dysglycemia, DHIs should be strategically integrated with in-person or remote HCP interaction. The incorporation of health information transmission, alerts, and reminders for targeted individuals, along with TM and PHT strategies, is paramount. Peer group support, look-up tools, AI, and VR hold promising potential for future exploration in this field. We anticipate the advancement in these technologies will significantly influence the prevention of T2DM in the future."
