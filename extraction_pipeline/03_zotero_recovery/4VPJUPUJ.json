  "title": "HEARTEN KMS -A knowledge management system targeting the management of patients with heart failure",
  "abstract": "The aim of this work is to present the HEARTEN Knowledge Management System, one of the core modules of the HEARTEN platform. The HEARTEN platform is an mHealth collaborative environment enabling the Heart Failure patients to self-manage the disease and remain adherent, while allowing the other ecosystem actors (healthcare professionals, caregivers, nutritionists, physical activity experts, psychologists) to monitor the patient's health progress and offer personalized, predictive and preventive disease management. The HEARTEN Knowledge Management System is a tool which provides multiple functionalities to the ecosystem actors for the assessment of the patient's condition, the estimation of the patient's adherence, the prediction of potential adverse events, the calculation of Heart Failure related scores, the extraction of statistics, the association of patient clinical and non-clinical data and the provision of alerts and suggestions. The innovation of this tool lays in the analysis of multiparametric personal data coming from different sources, including for the first time breath and saliva biomarkers, and the use of machine learning techniques. The HEARTEN Knowledge Management System consists of nine modules. The accuracy of the KMS modules ranges from 78-95% depending on the module/functionality.",

      "text": "Heart Failure (HF) is characterized as a complex syndrome, rather than a disease, impairing the heart ventricle to fill or eject blood. It is a progressive, life threatening condition associated with high mortality rates, poor quality of file and increased direct and indirect healthcare costs. The increasing prevalence of HF in combination with the escalated costs and the above mentioned severe consequences: (i) transform HF to an epidemic in Europe and worldwide, (ii) intensify the need for effective, efficient and personalized management, (iii) necessitate the empowerment of the HF patients to be adherent to medication treatment, nutrition and physical activity suggestions provided by the experts (experts include the healthcare professional, the nutritionist, the physical activity expert and the psychologist). HF patients receive treatment suggestions related to medication, nutrition and physical activity. Lack of adherence is common, resulting to destabilizations, re-hospitalizations and adverse events including death  [1] . Towards this direction, several studies focusing on HF management have been presented in the literature, either based on machine learning approaches which address (separately or in combination) early diagnosis of HF  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] , HF subtype recognition  [19] [20] [21] , severity estimation  [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] , prediction of adverse events  [24, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] , adherence estimation  [48]  or mHealth solutions developed for the monitoring and management the of HF patients  [1] .\n\nIn most of the studies the diagnosis of HF has been achieved mainly by utilizing only heart rate variability (HRV) measures  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] , while some studies combine HRV measures with anamnestic and instrumental data  [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . The above mentioned data are given as input to different classifiers, such as Support Vector Machines, Classification and Regression Trees, Random Forests, etc.. The characterization of the type of HF (HF with reduced ejection fraction vs. HF with preserved ejection fraction) is addressed as a two class classification problem. The studies presented in the literature do not include in the datasets patients belonging to the so called \"gray zone\" (i.e. HF with mid-range ejection fraction) or they merge this group of patients with one of the other types of HF mentioned above  [19] [20] [21] . The severity estimation is expressed either as mild, moderate, severe or in terms of New York Heart Association (NYHA) classes. The definition of the characterizations as mild, moderate and severe is differentiated between the studies depending on how the merging of the NYHA class has been performed. For example, in some studies patients with severe HF belong to NYHA class III or IV, while in some other belong to NYHA class IV only  [15, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . The prediction of HF adverse events has gained the interest of researchers that developed predictive models for destabilization, re-hospitalization and mortality of HF patients. In those studies for each category of prediction, as well as between the different categories, the time frame of prediction varies from short term (one to three months) to long term (up to 5 years)  [24, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] . A detailed review and comparison of those studies is presented in  [49] .\n\nThe evolution of mHealth solutions for HF management and other chronic diseases is based on the uptake of information and communication technologies and the advent of mobile solutions. mHealth solutions allow the collection of a variety of data (lifestyle, sensor, biosensor, health-related and environmental information), the analysis of these data, the extraction of meaningful information, the transformation of the information to actionable knowledge for the HF disease. A review the available mHealth solutions, in the form of the commercial applications, research projects, or related studies is provided in  [1] . According to this review, it is evident that mHealth: (i) offers personalized services for predictive, collaborative and preventive care, (ii) contributes to more accessible, better and reliable disease management, and (iii) is able to transform and improve the traditional delivery of healthcare through continuously monitoring the heart condition of the patient. However, several challenges concerning patients, healthcare professionals, payers, providers, and regulatory bodies should be addressed. The fragmented use of information in existing approaches does not allow mHealth to reveal its real potential. On the other side, the use of personal data directly from individuals can significantly support the adoption of such systems and, consequently, patient empowerment. The application of a multidisciplinary approach can contribute significantly towards the tackling of the above mentioned challenges and can maximize the impact of the mHealth solutions.\n\nIn this framework, the HEARTEN Knowledge Management System (KMS), a part of the HEARTEN platform, is a novel multi-purpose and multifunctional computational platform that is based on a variety of HF related data, among of which, are biomarkers extracted from saliva and breath biosensors, a major novelty of the proposed KMS. It enables the users to effectively assess and exploit real patient data. The HEARTEN KMS includes advanced data-driven techniques incorporated with expert-knowledge techniques towards effectively, automatically assessing the HF patient condition and risks and enhancing patient adherence. With this aim, data processing and mining approaches have been designed, tested and implemented into an integrated environment that provides multiple functionalities to the users to optimize the management of the HF patients. These functionalities cover all the patient pathways, starting from the first visit to the healthcare professional until the monitoring of the daily activities and the follow up visits and they are provided through nine different modules.\n\nThe HEARTEN KMS modules are capable to perform computational processes and support the healthcare community employing data mining techniques on a large amount of patient-specific sensor, biosensor, clinical and personal data. Through data mining/analysis techniques, the HEARTEN KMS effectively combines different types of patient data collected by other components of the HEARTEN platform and provides estimations on the patient health status (through an objective, data driven estimation of NYHA class), the risk of non-adherence, the actual adherence levels (in terms of medication, nutrition and physical activity), and the risk for adverse events. It also allows for statistical analysis, hypothesis testing and supports research. Alerts are generated when needed (e.g. patient deterioration, adverse event prediction, etc.) and sent to the relevant ecosystem actors including of course the patient himself when this is considered appropriate following a specific protocol.\n\nThe proposed KMS is evaluated on a dataset of 136 patients. The performance of each module is presented in the results section and it is compared with other existing in the literature studies which address the same problems (evaluation of HF severity, estimation of adherence profile of the patients, evaluation of treatment adherence, early prediction of adverse events etc.), either separately or in combination. Comparison confirms that the major innovations of the proposed KMS are the use of the saliva and breath biomarkers, the incorporation of several heterogeneous data, some of them recorded in a daily basis and the objective estimation of patient condition and adherence levels through machine learning techniques. In this way, the patients' daily life-status information is collected and processed, and the patient gets empowered having a central role in (self-) managing of his/her disease.\n\nThe following sections provide a short description of the HEARTEN platform, a detailed presentation of the HEARTEN KMS, information about the dataset that is utilized for the evaluation of the HEARTEN KMS, and the results that are produced from each module. Finally, a discussion section presenting a comparison of the HEARTEN KMS with relevant studies in the literature is provided."

      "text": "HEARTEN is an integrated mHealth collaborative platform that engages all ecosystem actors: the HF patients, their caregivers, the experts. It facilitates their intercommunication and tight collaboration for effective and efficient monitoring and management of the HF patients. HEARTEN aims at improving the management of HF, empowering the patient and increasing adherence to treatment plan. HEARTEN uses sensors to record patient vital signs and activity, novel saliva and breath biosensors to monitor the status of the disease and knowledge management/machine learning techniques to evaluate the patient status based on sensor, biosensor and clinical data. Data collection is done at a home environment and a mobile application serves as the main interaction interface with the patient while the respective actors (i.e. patient, clinician, caregiver, nutritionist, physical activity expert, etc.) are informed on the patient status, progress and adherence, accordingly.\n\nThe architecture of the HEARTEN platform is depicted in Fig.  1  and includes: (i) the wearable sensors, (ii) the biosensors, (iii) the two databases (Relational database and NoSQL database), (iv) the mobile application, (v) the web application, (vi) the Cloud infrastructure, (viii) the Knowledge Management System, and (vii) the Dynamic Patient Communication Protocol (DynPCP).\n\nIn order to monitor the HF patient, different wearable sensors as well as saliva and breath biosensors are employed in the home environment. Specifically, the wearable sensors record the blood pressure, the heart rate and potential arrhythmias (type o arrhythmias) along with the respiratory rate, the body temperature, the body weight and other relevant features (body fat percentage, skeletal muscle percentage, body mass index, resting metabolism), etc. and the physical activity (note: the CE marked Winmedical Winpack  [50]  system is used). The biosensors measure the concentration of acetone in breath and the TNF-\u03b1 and cortisol in saliva. The Mobile Application acts as the mean of collecting information, providing alerts, notifications and educational information to the corresponding users through usable, clean and simple to use interfaces. The Mobile Application is the communication tool between the HEARTEN ecosystem actors. The Web Application provides to the experts extended functionality for data management. The Databases host the heterogeneous data collected in the HEARTEN platform. More specifically, a Relational database hosts the data related to the users and a\n\nNoSQL database stores all the data retrieved from the sensors and biosensors. The Cloud infrastructure, supporting scalability and performance, is composed of 6 virtual machines for the KMS server, the Web Application server, the DynPCP server, the MySQL database server, the MongoDB server and the REST server. The Knowledge Management System analyses the multi-disciplinary data and transforms them to clinical meaningful knowledge, whereas the Dynamic Patient Communication Protocol (DynPCP) combines the output of KMS with patient data and produces messages, notifications, alerts to the corresponding actors of the HEARTEN platform by using the predefined patient communication protocols."

      "title": "Adherence risk module",
      "text": "The Adherence risk module provides an estimation of the adherence profile of the patient. More specifically, the module informs the experts about the expected levels of adherence in terms of medication and overall adherence (medication, nutrition and exercising). This information allows them to pay attention to this specific patient according to the expected adherence and modify the treatment plan in terms of frequency of exams, schedule of visits etc.. Furthermore, the caregiver of the patient taking into account the output of the Adherence risk module can adjust the frequency and the intensity of care-attention which must be provided to the patient. In order this to be achieved, the Random Forests algorithm is employed classifying the patient as low, medium or high non-adherence risk, in terms of medication and overall.\n\nThe medication adherence has been poorly studied in the past through the utilization of a machine learning approach. Son et al.  [48]  identified predictors of adherence, related to socioeconomic factors, which are used as input to Support Vector Machine classifier to classify a patient as medication adherent or not. However, the Adherence risk module is differentiated from the above mentioned study, since it examines the contribution of additional factors, such as the medical condition, the clinical examination, the lab measurements, as well as socio-demographic information. Furthermore, it addresses the adherence estimation as a three class problem estimating not only if the patient is adherent or not but also the level of adherence (low, medium, high)."

NYHA class detection is addressed as a three class classification problem (NYHA II, NYHA III and NYHA IV). The module runs at the end of every day taking as input not only the baseline data during the first visit but also using the everyday wearable sensor and biosensor data measurements."

      "title": "Treatment adherence module",
      "text": "Non-adherence of HF patients to treatment suggestions (suggestions regarding medication, nutrition and physical activity exercising) has been proven a significant contributor to the presence of HF adverse events  [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] . In order the effects of non-adherence to be avoided and the management of HF patients to be optimized, the Treatment adherence module evaluates if the patient is adherent or not to the suggestions provided by the experts. Based on this estimation, encouragement and motivation offered to the patient can be adjusted. The functionality of the module is depicted in Fig 4 . The Nutrition adherence is estimated based on information extracted from the adherence of the patient in the Mediterranean diet score  [62]  and on two separate questions that concern the consumption of salt and water/fluids. The score value is translated to \"low\", \"medium\" or \"high\" characterization, while the answers provided by the patient, through the HEARTEN mobile application, on salt and water consumption are compared with the experts recommendations. In order to combine the three different subtypes of adherence in an overall nutrition adherence estimation, specific weights on the importance of each subtype have been estimated using a multi-criteria method, namely the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP)  [63] . AHP has been employed to a group of experts using a specific questionnaire. Based on their pairwise comparison the importance/weight of each nutrition component (i.e. Mediterranean diet, salt consumption, water consumption) has been calculated. The obtained weights of each factor are presented in Table  1 , where it is clear that water and salt consumption are of upmost importance for the experts. Ordinal values (low, medium, high) are transformed to numerical values and aggregated to overall adherence score with the use of weights. Thresholds, provided by experts, are employed for the classification of the overall nutrition adherence into low, medium or high.\n\nTable 1: Weights of each sub-type of nutrition adherence used for the calculation of the overall adherence. Nutrition Sub-type Weight Mediterranean diet 0.067 Salt consumption 0.467 Water 0.467\n\nThe Physical Activity adherence is extracted by comparing the activity performed by the patient with the activity suggestion from the expert. It is characterized as (rules defined by the experts): (i) High: performed >80% of the suggestions of the experts, (ii) Low: performed <20% of the suggestions of the experts, (iii) Medium: performed 20-80% of the suggestions of the experts.\n\nThe Medication adherence is estimated by applying a classification model not only to the baseline data,\n\nas the Adherence risk estimation module, but also to information extracted from the wearable sensors' and biosensors' data, the output of the Adherence risk estimation, the NYHA class and the Score module.\n\nThe overall adherence is determined according to Table  2 , where the aggregation of the different adherence types follows a transformation process similar to the nutrition case (from ordinal values to numerical; aggregation; transformation to ordinal values). Weights were derived again through the application of AHP to a group of experts.\n\nTable 2. Overall treatment adherence characterization. Medication adherence Nutrition adherence Activity adherence Overall Low Low Low Low Low Low Medium Low Low Low High Low Medium Low Low Low Medium Low Medium Low Medium Low High Low High Low Low Medium High Low Medium Medium High Low High Medium Low Medium Low Low Low Medium Medium Low Low Medium High Low Medium Medium Low Medium Medium Medium Medium Medium Medium Medium High Medium High Medium Low Medium High Medium Medium High High Medium High High Low High Low Medium Low High Medium Medium Low High High Medium Medium High Low Medium Medication adherence Nutrition adherence Activity adherence Overall Medium High Medium High Medium High High High High High Low High High High Medium High High High High High\n\nThe importance/weight of each type of adherence (i.e. medication related, nutrition related, physical activity related) to the estimation of the overall adherence score is presented in Table  3 , where the focus of experts (as reflected on the obtained weights) on medication and nutrition adherence is clear.\n\nTable 3: Weights for each sub-type of the overall adherence.

Existing prediction models combining different sources of information (e.g. socio-demographic, clinical examination, medical condition, lab tests, medication intake, phenotypic data, sensor data) along with machine learning techniques are presented in  [24, [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] 49] .

The Event prediction module aims to inform the experts about the possible presence of adverse events (relapses and mortality): (i) by introducing saliva and breath biomarkers into the adverse event prediction process, (ii) based on a machine learning approach (presented in the Classification -Prediction models section), (iii) taking place non -invasively (which in a future setting can be performed at home  [86] ), (iv) taking into account the medication adherence profile of the patient (as an outcome of the Treatment Adherence module)."

More specifically, the following time and frequency domain features are extracted from each ECG channel: (i) the fraction of total RR intervals which are classified as normal-to-normal (NN) intervals (NN/RR), (ii) the average of all NN intervals (AVNN), (iii) the standard deviation of all NN intervals (SDNN), (iv) the standard deviation of the averages of NN intervals in all 5-minute segments of a 24-hour recording (SDANN), (v) the mean of the standard deviations of NN intervals in all 5-minute segments of a 24-hour recording (SDNNIDX), (vi) the square root of the mean of the squares of differences between adjacent NN intervals (rMSSD), (vii) the percentage of differences between adjacent NN intervals which are larger than 50ms (pNN50), (viii) the total spectral power of all NN intervals up to 0.04 Hz (TOTPWR), (ix) the total spectral power of all NN intervals up to 0.003 Hz (ULF PWR), (x) the total spectral power of all NN intervals between 0.003 and 0.04 Hz (VLF PWR), (xi) the total spectral power of all NN intervals between 0.04 and 0.15 Hz (LF PWR), (xiii) the total spectral power of all NN intervals between 0.15 and 0.4 Hz (HF PWR),(xiv) the ratio of low to high frequency power(LF/HF).\n\nThe WinMedical sensors  [50] , utilized in the HEARTEN platform, record the heart rate, the respiration rate, the diastolic pressure, the systolic pressure, the mean arterial pressure, the type of arrhythmias, the breath per minute, the pressure beats per minute, the body temperature, the body position and the number of steps performed. The body position is grouped in two categories: rest and activity. The max, min, mean and standard deviation values are extracted for each one of the above mentioned features and for each category of body positions, as well as the overall values. Finally, a standard weight scale measures the patient's weight, the body fat percentage, the skeletal muscle percentage and the body mass index (BMI).\n\nAfter processing the sensor data, a total set of 295 features is extracted for each patient, while after the data cleaning step, 246 features are retained."

      "text": "The HEARTEN KMS was built using the JDK 1.\n\n8 API on the NetBeans development studio. The development was based on the Java Server Faces 2.2 (JSF 2.2) by using the PrimeFaces 5.3 component library. Furthermore, the RESTfull services were built using the Java API for RESTful Web Service (JSR-311) and also were supported by the Jersey RESTfull services framework. The Jackson 2.7 library for JSON data processing and parsing was also used. The Oracle GlassFish Application Server (AS) is used for the deployment of the KMS in the cloud platform. Glassfish is sponsored by Oracle\u00ae Corporation as an open source application server that hosts JAVA EE applications and provides security control, access management, resource management and data monitoring. The AS can host with enhanced security Enterprise JavaBeans, Servlets, Java Server Pages, RESTfull web services, JavaServer Faces and the Java Persistence API as its major technologies. It also provides performance, portability and scalability to all phases of application development. Concurrent users can use connection pools to handle their data that can are hosted in any database system; this is an important feature also for the KMS that provides transparency in the development and database storage."

The classification models incorporated in the NYHA class, the Adherence risk, the Treatment adherence and the Event prediction modules are evaluated using the 10-fold stratified cross validation approach. The features retained from the second step of the machine learning approach (i.e. the feature selection) are presented in Table  7 , while the results of the classification models are presented in Table  8 . To test, verify and evaluate the prediction and classification ability of the above mentioned models after their integration to the HEARTEN KMS, the input values and the results were tested against the original models.\n\nTable 7.

A clinical explanation of the correlations-associations between the retained features and the output of each module follows.\n\nNYHA class estimation: The Diabetes mellitus is expected to be associated with higher NYHA class and depression. Orthopnea is associated with higher NYHA class, while there is no any evidence of the correlation between HDLc and NYHA class. The relation of Calcium with NYHA class is not well established; however a study  [90]  associated hypercalcemia with higher NYHA class without an obvious reason. A possible explanation could be the underlying hidden association with serum proteins and vitamin D. The increase in the white blood cells value is associated with a NYHA class worsening, although the presence of very low values of white blood cells could be also be related to worse NYHA.\n\nFinally, the higher cardiac troponin value, the higher the NYHA class is."

      "title": "Event prediction:",
      "text": "The prognosis of HF in men is worst compared to women, while the presence of COPD is linked with more events. The performance of physical activity results in better prognosis. Lower values of heart rate variability are linked with the onset of an event. The high values of the two saliva and the single breath biomarkers should be correlated with more events. Finally, the more adherent the patient is, the possibility of an adverse event is reduced.\n\nAs already mentioned, it is the first time that variables related to the medical condition and lab measurements are used as predictors of medication and overall adherence. Thus, the explanation of the correlations and related associations should be further validated employing larger datasets.\n\nAdherence risk estimation-Medication: Married patients are considered in general more adherent to medication treatment due to the support of their spouse. Dyspnea at rest and jugular ingurgitation are expected to have reverse association with medication adherence (i.e. a patient who is less adherent s/he would have more dyspnea at rest and jugular ingurgitation). There is no direct explanation of the association between prior myocardial infarction and left ventricular ejection fraction, so this is a correlation to be investigated. Finally, higher self-reported adherence is expected to be associated with higher medication adherence, considering also additional factors as well.\n\nAdherence risk estimation -Overall: It is expected that decreased overall adherence results in the presence of more edemas and increased hospitalizations. A reverse association is also expected between microalbumin in urine and overall adherence. It is interesting to examine how the presence of oncological disease and the values of partial pressure of carbonic is related to overall adherence. The better knowledge about the disease (Dutch Heart Failure Knowledge score) and the low medication adherence, the greater overall adherence is expected.\n\nTreatment adherence: A reverse association is expected to be present between, STDDEV OVERALL HR, STDDEV_OVERALL_RR, rMSSD (i.e. the higher the treatment adherence, the higher rMSSD values), biomarkers values (i.e. the higher the treatment adherence, the lower the values of biomarkers), NYHA class (i.e. the higher the treatment adherence, the lower NYHA class) and treatment adherence of the patient. The higher medication adherence, the higher treatment adherence should be. Moreover, usually patients who are adherent to medication are also adherent to diet and exercise.\n\nThe combination of the different types of data derives the best classification outcomes in all three relevant cases (i.e. NYHA class estimation, Event prediction, Treatment adherence-medication).\n\nprediction of adverse events have already been addressed as classification problem. A comparison of the proposed models with those reported in the literature is presented in Tables 10-12, respectively.\n\nTable 10.

Given the different types of data/measurements and the large amount of features examined, a three step approach is followed in order the models to be built: (i) data cleaning, (ii) feature selection, (iii) classification. Features with more than 60% missing values, as well as features in which the distribution between the different values is larger than 80% are removed. Then, the Wrapper algorithm  [88]  is applied for the identification of features that can act as discriminators between the classes of the four classification problems addressed in the HEARTEN KMS modules (Table  4 ), in combination with the classifiers employed in the third step. The features retained for each classification problem are presented in Section 3. For the classification (third step), nine classifiers are tested  [88] : (i) Random Forests, (ii) Logistic Model Trees, (iii) J48, (iv) Rotation Forest, (v) Support Vector Machines, (vi) Radial Basis Function Network, (vii) Bayesian Network, (viii) Na\u00efve Bayes, (ix) Simple CART.\n\nHowever, as different exploitation scenarios (e.g. with or without biosensors; with or without sensors, etc.) can be considered, several configurations have been tested, as it is presented in Table  9 . In general, performance is quite in most of the configurations which indicates different exploitation options."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "We present the HEARTEN KMS, a novel system supporting HF patient management allowing for automated risk stratification, severity estimation, adverse event prediction and adherence estimation. Classification models are built for each of the KMS modules. Literature review reveals relevant approaches for the estimation of the severity of HF, the estimation of medication adherence and the The proposed models are differentiated from those reported in the literature since: (i) they incorporate relevant clinical information from saliva and breath biomarkers, in addition to other physiological mainly data, (ii) they estimate the severity of HF in terms of NYHA II, III and IV without merging the different NYHA classes, (iii) they provide the level of patient's medication adherence, and (iv) they provide an estimation of the risk of medication (non)adherence. In addition, for the first time, an estimation of the overall adherence risk of the patient has been studied as a classification problem. It should be noted that the direct comparison of the Event prediction module of the HEARTEN KMS with other relevant studies reported in the literature is not feasible since the proposed module predicts the presence or not of an HF event without focusing on a specific type of event, which is the case for the relevant literature.\n\nStill, Table  12  presents this comparison.\n\nThe results reported in Table  9  indicate the prediction and classification power of the three measured biomarkers (Cortisol, TNF-\u03b1, Acetone). The future evolution of the sensing devices is expected to allow for easy, non-invasive, home collection of these measurements which in turn can make the HEARTEN KMS and the HEARTEN platform a valuable tool for HF patient (self-)management supporting adherence and providing the patients with the ability to become more active in managing their own care."
