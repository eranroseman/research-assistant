  "title": "Effectiveness of digital health interventions on adherence and control of hypertension: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
  "abstract": "Background: Hypertension, a risk factor for developing cardiovascular disease, is becoming increasingly prevalent worldwide. Digital health is now widely utilized for hypertension management, and numerous studies have assessed its effectiveness. Objective: The review aims to analyse the effectiveness of digital health (i.e., mobile health (mHealth), telehealth, and the combination of mHealth & telehealth) on hypertensive patients, concerning three key areas: clinical outcomes, medication adherence, and adherence to lifestyle changes, as compared to standard care. \n Methods: The review followed the PRISMA framework. Eight electronic databases were scanned for randomized control trials focusing on the effects of mHealth or telehealth on hypertensive patients, published between 2010 and 2023. All processes were conducted by the first two authors independently. A meta-analysis was conducted for quantitative data, while a narrative synthesis was conducted for qualitative data. Results: In total, 74 studies involving 92 686 participants were identified. The meta-analysis favoured the interventions, revealing a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure for mHealth, telehealth and mHealth & telehealth groups. Nevertheless, medication adherence showed improvement only in the mHealth group, while blood pressure control showed improvement in both mHealth and mHealth & telehealth groups, and BMI showed improvement only in the mHealth group. Evidence for adherence to physical activity and DASH diet/salt intake remained inconclusive. \n Conclusion: In general, mHealth and telehealth have demonstrated their merits in improving the clinical outcomes of hypertensive patients.",

      "text": "H ypertension, an increasingly prevalent condition, affects an estimated 1.3 billion people globally  [1] . Effective management of hypertension through non-pharmacological lifestyle changes and pharmacological antihypertensive drugs has been shown to reduce blood pressure, cardiovascular complications, and mortality rates  [2] . Non-pharmacological approaches include maintaining a body mass index below 25 kg/m 2 , engaging in at least 30 min of dynamic exercise 5-7 days per week, and restricting sodium intake to 5-6 g per day  [3, 4] . A 10 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure can reduce the risk of coronary heart disease by 17%, stroke by 27%, and heart failure by 28%, which can be achieved through a combination of lifestyle changes and antihypertensive medications  [5] ."

      "title": "Explanation of the condition",
      "text": "Despite hypertension being easily treatable  [6] , global control rates remain dismally low, with less than 20% of patients achieving optimal blood pressure control  [1] . Often referred to as the ''silent killer,'' hypertension may be asymptomatic, leading to underdiagnosis and delayed management  [5] . Medication non-adherence has been identified as a major contributing factor to the inability of patients to control their hypertension  [7] . Reports indicate that pharmacotherapy adherence is less than 50% in patients suffering from hypertension one year after initiating pharmacotherapy  [8, 9] ."

      "title": "Explanation of the intervention",
      "text": "In the era of technological advancements, the realm of digital health, encompassing mobile health  (mHealth)  and telehealth, has emerged as a transformative force within healthcare institutions, offering innovative modalities that extend beyond conventional approaches  [10] . Mobile health, or mHealth, involves using mobile devices such as smartphones and portable devices such as wearables to monitor and manage health, offering the convenience of both remote tracking and timely interventions for conditions like hypertension  [11] . Conversely, telehealth is the use of communication technologies to deliver healthcare services remotely  [12] . It allows healthcare professionals to consult with patients from different locations, offering convenient and effective ways to manage hypertension without leaving home  [13] ."

      "title": "Importance of this review",
      "text": "Such innovative approaches have gained widespread adoption among hypertension patients, standing out as prominent digital health tools  [13] . The Global Observatory for eHealth (GOe) survey indicates a rising adoption of mHealth programs within countries, with many nations incorporating up to six such initiatives  [14] . Highlighting this trend, over 180 mobile applications dedicated to monitoring blood pressure have been developed, showcasing the surge in mHealth program adoption  [15] . Similarly, telehealth applications have been embraced by 7 million patients, benefiting 80% of cardiology patients in Europe  [12] . By defining these technologies in simpler terms, it becomes evident how mHealth and telehealth offer advantageous and accessible solutions for managing hypertension in today's digital era.\n\nWhile both mHealth and telehealth leverage technology to improve clinical outcomes, their core functionalities cater to distinct user groups. This distinction has often led to separate research silos. mHealth primarily tackles individual self-management, empowering users to track health metrics, engage in educational programs, and manage behaviours through personal devices and apps  [13, 14] . Telehealth, on the other hand, encompasses a broader spectrum of professional healthcare delivery, including consultations, diagnosis, treatment monitoring, and more, often involving direct interaction with healthcare providers  [12] . This focus on individual self-management versus clinician-driven intervention has naturally led to separate research and review trajectories. Our review aims to bridge this gap by providing a holistic view that examines both approaches. This holistic approach not only reveals potential synergies between the two, but enables future research into their combination and effectiveness in hypertension patients.\n\nIn addition, current systematic reviews that have assessed both mHealth and telehealth interventions are scarce and face its limitations. Lv, Meina et al.'s systematic review  [16]  conducted in 2021 is confined to stroke patients, who are treated for hypertension for the secondary prevention of adverse cardiovascular outcomes."

The PRISMA checklist and Review Protocol are available in Supplement 1,  http://links . lww.com/HJH/C517 and Supplement 2,  http://links.lww . com/HJH/C518, respectively.\n\nWe performed a comprehensive search on eight electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, Medline, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, and PsycINFO. An extensive search strategy was developed based on five primary keywords and MeSH terms: hypertension, telehealth or mHealth, medication adherence, lifestyle changes adherence, and clinical outcomes. The searches were conducted on 12 th and 13 th of February 2023, using filters for Randomized Controlled Trials and full-text reviews, with publication dates ranging from 2010 to 2023. The selection of 2010 as the starting year for the search was based on the increasing popularity of mHealth in 2010  [13] .

Statistically significant differences between intervention and control groups were determined by a P-value smaller than 0.05. The extent of statistical heterogeneity was determined via the I 2 statistic, with values of 25%, 50% and 75% indicating low, moderate, and high levels of heterogeneity, respectively.

The trial duration ranged from 1 month to 2.6 years, with most studies lasting for 12 months (22.9%). Over 90% of the studies (n \u00bc 67 trials) demonstrated that their interventions were effective.\n\nThe mean age for the mHealth and telehealth intervention group was 55.2 years, and 58.8 years for the standard group. The gender proportion was balanced in both intervention and standard care groups (50.9% and 51.9% females, respectively). Only 17 trials reported ethnicity; Caucasian/White is the most common, comprising 66% and 64.1% of the intervention and control groups respectively. The most common study duration were 3 months for the mHealth group, 12 months for the telehealth group and 6 months for the mHealth & telehealth group. On average, 21 participants (1.7%) withdrew from the trials, and an average of 5.3 adverse events were observed.\n\nThe average initial systolic blood pressure was 144.8mmHg in the intervention groups and 144.6mmHg in the standard care group, whereas the average initial diastolic blood pressure was 87.0mmHg in the intervention groups and 86.6mmHg in the standard care group. Education was the most common feature (54.1%), followed by reminders (28.4%), diagnosis & remote monitoring (23.0%), telehealth (13.5%), attitudinal (12.0%), communication (5.0%) and decision-making (5.0%).

Our pooled analysis showed significant improvements in blood pressure with mHealth, telehealth, and mHealth & telehealth compared to standard care, affirming the potential of these novel modalities. The interventions was effective in improving clinical outcomes, including systolic and diastolic blood pressure, as well as medication adherence. mHealth Through our meta-analysis, we demonstrated that the use of such features in mobile phones helped patients improve their blood pressure in terms of clinical outcomes such as systolic and diastolic blood pressure; and medication  adherence. Despite variability in results related to lifestyle changes such as physical exercise, it could be postulated that mHealth's multifaceted features provided a platform to empower patients in self-managing hypertension, aligning with the Motivational Technology Model's principles of relatedness, autonomy, and competence  [96] . However, our narrative synthesis indicated mixed results for adherence to physical activity and the DASH diet/salt intake, suggesting that mHealth interventions alone may not be sufficient to modify these aspects. To optimize effectiveness, the integration of mHealth with complementary interventions, such as patient education and motivational interviewing, as recommended by the 2018 European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines, is proposed  [97] .\n\nNevertheless, the engagement of patients in self-management of their hypertension has been seen to be effective in increasing patients' understanding and involvement in their treatment  [6] , thereby improving patient's overall adherence."

      "title": "Limitations and future studies",
      "text": "Despite these positive findings, there were some limitations to this review. Many studies included in this review had a medium to high risk of bias, and hence conclusions drawn from this review should be deemed preliminary. The majority of studies were not double-blinded, and studies involving measurement of adherence such as 8-MMAS often were self-reported, leading to potential selection and selfreporting/information biases. Further studies can conduct sensitivity analysis to reduce the risk of bias in the results. Studies included in this review had standard care as their comparator, however, there is a high complexity of comparing standard cares across multiple intervention groups, given the varying standard of care worldwide. This could have led to high heterogenicity amongst studies. In addition, studies often had a short trial duration, limiting the results to the short term. This review also does not consider the cost-effectiveness of mHealth and telehealth, limiting the scope of the review, especially considering that a visit to a specialist may be required when the use of these interventions is restricted. Withdrawal rates were higher in the telehealth (10.1%) and mHealth & telehealth group (9.2%) compared to the mHealth group (1.09%), and a potential explanation is due to the higher costs of telehealth, such as video conferencing software, secure communication platforms, and potentially additional personnel for live consultations, compared to mHealth  [97] , as well as the longer duration of telehealth and mHealth & telehealth group's studies. However, the statistical significance of these findings is still unknown, as the impact of these differences is unclear. Further research should be conducted to truly understand the cost-effectiveness of such programs, as well as the impact of the duration of the study on the withdrawal rates.\n\nAdditionally, the definition of blood pressure control used in this review adhered to the 2013 guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC), which set the target at systolic blood pressure below 140mmHg and diastolic blood pressure below 90mmHg  [95] . However, updated ESC guidelines from 2018 recommend even lower targets, with systolic blood pressure below 130mmHg and diastolic blood pressure below 80mmHg. Future studies should adhere to these more recent guidelines for a more accurate assessment of blood pressure control  [98] .\n\nLastly, hypertensive patients frequently present with concurrent conditions such as metabolic syndrome or insulin resistance, necessitating a comprehensive and multifaceted approach to their care  [99] . Beyond the specific focus on hypertension therapy, it becomes imperative to recognize and address the health factors that are associated with high blood pressure. Effective healthcare for hypertensive individuals extends beyond singularly targeting blood pressure, and involves addressing the intricate interplay of related health factors through comprehensive and regular assessments  [99] . Therefore, future research should focus on more parameters involving metabolic syndrome such as waist circumference, triglyceride & LDL, fasting blood glucose  [99] .\n\nGiven the limitations of this review, future research should focus on the effectiveness of the combination of interventions. Future randomized control trials should compare the combination of mHealth features and assess their effectiveness to identify an optimal mHealth intervention for hypertensive patients in the future."

      "title": "CONCLUSION",
      "text": "In conclusion, based on the available evidence, this systematic review and meta-analysis underscores the potential effectiveness of mHealth and telehealth interventions in the management of hypertension, and show that patients in the intervention group tend to report a larger decrease in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. These interventions have demonstrated their potential to reduce blood pressure levels and improve patient adherence to medication and lifestyle changes, which are crucial for hypertension outcomes. mHealth and telehealth interventions present a promising approach for further enhancing patient care and hypertension management. By leveraging the strengths of both modalities, healthcare providers can create personalized and comprehensive treatment plans that engage patients in their own health management and improve overall treatment efficacy. This is in line with the conclusion by  Omboni et al. [100] , who suggest that the most effective intervention would involve the use of such digital health interventions together with multi-disciplinary teams, allowing them to monitor vital signs and medication adherence remotely, and provide remote consultations educating patients on hypertension. Therefore, further research on the combination of functions of mHealth interventions is needed to determine the best mHealth intervention, particularly in promoting physical activity among hypertensive patients.\n\nAs technology progresses, mHealth and telehealth interventions will undoubtedly play an indispensable role in the future of hypertension management. Embracing these innovative approaches will empower patients, improve healthcare delivery, and ultimately contribute to better hypertension control and patient well-being. In light of these findings, healthcare practitioners and policymakers should consider integrating mHealth and telehealth interventions into routine hypertension management practices. As we move forward, continuous evaluation and refinement of these interventions are essential to ensure their continued effectiveness and sustainability. By embracing the potential of these technologies, healthcare systems can provide more patient-centred and efficient care, leading to better hypertension control and improved overall clinical outcomes for patients."
