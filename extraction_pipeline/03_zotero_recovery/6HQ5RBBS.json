  "title": "An Automated Text Messaging Program to Inform Postoperative Opioid Prescribing",
  "abstract": "A multidisciplinary group at the University of Pennsylvania Health System built, deployed, and tested an automated text messaging program for postoperative patient engagement. Patients provided e-consent immediately following surgery and then self-reported acute opioid use and pain intensity over 3 weeks. When brought to scale, this system provided a way to capture patient-reported outcomes and opioid use in real time. Next steps will focus on using the data to develop patient-informed and procedure-specific short-term opioid guidelines aimed at reducing the number of unused opioid tablets following surgery. \n KEY TAKEAWAYS \u00bb The implementation of this approach in routine surgical care is novel in that it facilitates: (1) immediate and proactive remote follow-up; (2) remote consent; and (3) remote patientreported data collection. \u00bb Mobile engagement provides a scalable means of collecting real-time patient-reported outcomes and is inherently designed to be translated to other areas of health care. \u00bb Remote patient engagement and data capture using digital technologies require collaboration with platforms, dynamic and iterative processes, and continuous quality assessment. \u00bb Organizations that work to include key stakeholders, offload clinical providers, and develop feedback mechanisms can drive design and change in learning health systems.",

      "text": "There continue to be significant opportunities to reduce excessive opioid prescribing, with one systematic review demonstrating that 42% to 71% of opioids that are prescribed for acute pain remain unused.  1  These prescriptions have also been associated with persistent use and misuse.  [2] [3] ] [4] [5] [6]  In the United States, a median of 20 opioid tablets is prescribed following common surgical procedures, compared with a median of one tablet in other countries.  7 To address this issue, state policies have been implemented to limit the number of opioids that can be prescribed acutely; however, these policies have been criticized as a one-size-fits-all approach that is disconnected from patient needs, potentially leading to uncontrolled pain.  [8] [9] 10] [11]  The challenge confronting clinicians centers on an attempt to balance pain management and opioid stewardship. Currently, clinicians lack pragmatic, patient-centered data to help them understand pain and opioid use in order to inform future prescribing practice. Research based on phone calls or paper surveys of patients' postoperative experiences can inform procedure-specific prescribing guidelines; however, such approaches are labor intensive, are not suited for continuous quality improvement, and are not scalable for the coverage of a breadth of prescribing indications.  [12] [13] [14] [15]  A gap persists in developing scalable methods that can both proactively engage patients to collect real-time data and support strategies to inform future care on a continuous basis. The Institute of Medicine's vision for learning health systems provides a framework for clinical challenges in which science, informatics, incentives, and culture align with improvement and innovation, with best practices seamlessly embedded in the delivery of care.  16 Digital technologies, such as text messaging, provide approaches to collect just-in-time data, to identify trends, and to address concerns early,  [17] [18] [19]  but applications for the promotion of opioid stewardship are limited.\n\n\" While clinicians do not wish to leave patients with intractable pain, they also do not intend to prescribe high numbers of prescription opioids. We believe that empowering providers with meaningful and actionable data, specific to their practice, is a key motivator for behavior change.\"\n\nWe hypothesized that: (1) text messaging would provide a simple approach to understanding patients' use of short-term opioids and allow for real-time monitoring of postoperative pain; and (2) these data ultimately could be used as a feedback mechanism and inform future prescribing. We hoped that such a strategy could effectively replace clinical intuition with patient-and procedurespecific information for short-term opioid prescribing and, more generally, that this approach could provide a framework for rapid, real-time data capture to inform health systems across a variety of clinical contexts."

      "text": "Our initial efforts focused on the feasibility of collecting patient-reported data that included the intensity of pain, the ability to manage pain, and the use of opioid analgesics. We started by calling patients within the first week after orthopedic procedures in order to assess whether they would be receptive to discussing their pain and the use of opioids immediately after surgery. On the basis of 80 telephone-based conversations, we quickly realized that: (1) patients were open to such discussions; and (2) the number of opioid tablets actually being used was lower than the number that had been prescribed.  20 While these findings were important, the process of making the calls, following up, and transcribing data was very labor intensive. Additionally, we knew that many more data would be needed to sufficiently identify central tendencies and reliably inform broader prescribing guidelines.\n\nA \"Fake Back-End\" Approach\n\nWe then focused on developing a digital approach to capture these data from a larger population.\n\nGiven the ubiquity of text messaging,  21, 22  we translated our telephone script into a text-friendly format and tested it with the use of a \"fake back-end\" that simulated a computerized system; during this testing period, patients perceived that they were interacting with an automated system but, in reality, were simply texting with our team. This approach allowed our team to pilot the script, to iterate in real time, and to identify issues that otherwise would have resulted in poor or inconsistent data when brought to scale.\n\na member of the research team on the basis of weekly surgical scheduling data, and their mobile phone number, procedure, and opioid prescription are uploaded.

Uptake of in-person consent was slow (as was expected given the new approach), but, despite multiple efforts, enrollment and consent did not improve. We uncovered multiple roadblocks to obtaining consent: (1) the necessary documentation was not always present or easily accessible; (2) providers had short appointment windows; (3) providers lacked interest or simply forgot; and (4) signed consent forms were lost or were not scanned into the record.\n\n\" We hypothesized that: (1) text messaging would provide a simple approach to understanding patients' use of short-term opioids and allow for real-time monitoring of postoperative pain; and (2) these data ultimately could be used as a feedback mechanism and inform future prescribing.\"\n\nThus, obtaining patient consent in the office was a burden and a significant barrier. As a result, we partnered with our health system's leadership and legal and privacy offices to design a process that would ensure both patient privacy and secure data collection. The process begins with an introductory text message that contains no health information and allows patients to provide consent with a simple \"yes\" or \"no\" reply. The ability to decrease the logistic burdens placed upon already busy clinical staff and obtain e-consent has transformed our ability to scale our efforts."

To address this issue, we built in prompts that directed patients to their clinicians with a simple one-tap phone call. Last, we noticed an unexpected drop in response rates as cellular carriers blocked hyperlink formats. Such hurdles reflected the need for continuous human quality assessment of the system for bounce notifications or unexpected drops in response rates."

We also partnered with senior leadership from the areas of legal affairs, privacy, and data security in order to develop the methodology of reaching out to patients and obtaining consent digitally via text messaging. A clear and collaborative relationship with the text messaging platform services was also important, because flexibility in terms of content, timing, formatting, and data collection was key to the program's success."

Eligible individuals included adults (18 years of age or older) with a mobile device who had undergone a procedure in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery and had received a prescription for an acute opioid. The primary outcome measures included the proportion of patients approached, the consent rate, and the response rate over time. Prior to e-consent, we were only able to identify and reach out to approximately one half of eligible patients; this limitation was attributed primarily to the challenges of having clinical staff attempt to approach patients.\n\n\"\n\nThe system includes several built-in scenarios to address clinical concerns (high pain, poor ability to manage pain, or high opioid use) and directs patients to contact their provider.\"\n\nThe creation of e-consent allowed us to reach out to all eligible patients, and the automated data collection system facilitated consistent participant engagement over time (Figure  3 ). Figure  4  displays the proportion of patients providing consent (47.2%) as well as the proportions of participants responding during the postoperative intervals (ranging from a low of 69% on day 7 to a high of 95% on day 21).

      "text": "The success of our initiative hinged on a clear need, early collaboration with clinical providers, and health system leadership. It is important to note that while clinicians do not wish to leave patients with intractable pain, they also do not intend to prescribe high numbers of prescription opioids. We believe that empowering providers with meaningful and actionable data, specific to their practice, is a key motivator for behavior change.\n\n\"\n\nThe creation of e-consent allowed us to reach out to all eligible patients, and the automated data collection system facilitated consistent participant engagement over time.\"\n\nWith the support of our health system, we were able to obtain the appropriate legal and IT support that allowed us to work behind the scenes on enrollment, data capture, and analytics and thereby decrease the burden on clinical providers. Table  2  summarizes several key organizational and technical factors that learning health systems should consider when developing scalable methods for patient engagement and data collection. Adopting similar initiatives at other organizations will require early investments in these relationships in order to support long-term success. It should also be noted that our multidisciplinary team has a dedicated and shared focus on addressing the opioid epidemic. This type of strategic alignment helps foster collaboration across the health system. Table 2. Key Steps in Developing Scalable, Automated Data Collection for Patient-Reported Outcomes Organizational Technical Consensus building with key stakeholders Collaboration with platforms in iterative design Offloading clinical providers from consent processes Clear messaging that can be dynamically updated Focusing on privacy and security using digital methods Continuous human quality assessment Providing patient-reported data feedback to clinicians for quality improvement and guideline development Integrated data organization and reporting Source: The authors.
