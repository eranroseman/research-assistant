INTRODUCTION \"Use whatever means possible to remove a set amount of money from your bank account each month before you have a chance to spend it\" -advice in New York Times \"Your Money\" column [1993]. Many people place a premium on the attribute of self-control. Individuals who have this capacity are able to stay on diets, carry through exercise regimens, show up to work on time, and live within their means. Self-control is so desirable that most of us complain that we do not have enough of it. Fortunately, there are ways to compensate for this shortfall. One of the most widely used techniques is commitment. For example, signing up to give a seminar is an easy way to commit oneself to write a paper. Such commitments matter since they create constraints (e.g., deadlines) that generally end up being binding. Strotz [1956]  was the first economist to formalize a theory of commitment and to show that commitment mechanisms could be potentially important determinants of economic outcomes. He",

      "text": "showed that when individuals' discount functions are nonexponential, they will prefer to constrain their own future choices. Strotz noted that costly commitment decisions are commonly observed:\n\n. . . we are often willing even to pay a price to precommit future actions (and to avoid temptation). Evidence of this in economic and other social behaviour is not difficult to find. It varies from the gratuitous promise, from the familiar phrase \"Give me a good kick if I don't do such and such\" to savings plans such as insurance policies and Christmas Clubs which may often be hard to justify in view of the low rates of return. (I select the option of having my annual salary dispersed to me on a twelve-rather than on a nine-month basis, although I could use the interest!) Personal financial management firms, such as are sometimes employed by high-income professional people (e.g. actors), while having many other and perhaps more important functions, represent the logical conclusion of the desire to precommit one's future economic activity. Joining the army is perhaps the supreme device open to most people, unless it be marriage for the sake of \"settling down.\" The worker whose income is garnished chronically or who is continually harassed by creditors, and who, when one oppressive debt is paid, immediately incurs another is commonly precommiting. There is nothing irrational about such behavior (quite the contrary) and attempts to default on debts are simply the later consequences which are to be expected. Inability to default is the force of the commitment.\n\nStrotz's list is clearly not exhaustive. In general, all illiquid assets provide a form of commitment, though there are sometimes additional reasons that consumers might hold such assets (e.g., high expected returns and diversification). A pension or retirement plan is the clearest example of such an asset. Many of these plans benefit from favorable tax treatment, and most of them effectively bar consumers from using their savings before retirement. For IRAs, Keogh plans, and 401(K) plans, consumers can access their assets, but they must pay an early withdrawal penalty. Moreover, borrowing against some of these assets is legally treated as an early withdrawal, and hence also subject to penalty. A less transparent instrument for commitment is an investment in an illiquid asset that generates a steady stream of benefits, but that is hard to sell due to substantial transactions costs, informational problems, or incomplete markets. Examples include purchasing a home, buying consumer durables, and building up equity in a personal business. Finally, there exists a class of assets that provide a store of illiquid value, like savings bonds, and certificates of deposit. All of the illiquid assets discussed above have the same property as the goose that laid golden eggs. The asset promises to generate substantial benefits in the long run, but these benefits are difficult, if not impossible, to realize immediately. Trying to do so will result in a substantial capital loss.\n\nInstruments with these golden eggs properties make up the overwhelming majority of assets held by the U. S. household sector. For example, the Federal Reserve System publication Balance Sheets for the U. S.  Economy 1945-94  reports that the household sector held domestic assets of $28.5 trillion at yearend 1994. Over two-thirds of these assets were illiquid, including $5.5 trillion of pension fund and life insurance reserves, $4.5 trillion of residential structures, $3.0 trillion of land, $2.5 trillion of equity in noncorporate business, $2.5 trillion of consumer durables, and at least $1 trillion of other miscellaneous categories. Finally, note that social security wealth and human capital, two relatively large components of illiquid wealth, are not included in the Federal Reserve Balance Sheets.\n\nDespite the abundance of commitment mechanisms, and Strotz's well-known theoretical work, intrapersonal commitment phenomena have generally received little attention from economists. This deficit is probably explained by the fact that commitment will only be chosen by decision-makers whose preferences are dynamically inconsistent, and most economists have avoided studying such problematic preferences. However, there is a substantial body of evidence that preferences are dynamically inconsistent. Research on animal and human behavior has led psychologists to conclude that discount functions are approximately hyperbolic  [Ainslie 1992 ].\n\nHyperbolic discount functions are characterized by a relatively high discount rate over short horizons and a relatively low discount rate over long horizons. This discount structure sets up a conflict between today's preferences, and the preferences that will be held in the future. For example, from today's perspective, the discount rate between two far-off periods, t and t \u03e9 1, is the long-term low discount rate. However, from the time t perspective, the discount rate between t and t \u03e9 1 is the short-term high discount rate. This type of preference change is reflected in many common experiences. For example, this year I may desire to start an aggressive savings plan next year, but when next year actually rolls around, my taste at that time will be to postpone any sacrifices another year. In the analysis that follows, the decisionmaker foresees these conflicts and uses a stylized commitment technology to partially limit the options available in the future.\n\nThis framework predicts that consumption will track income. Second, the model explains why consumers have a different propensity to consume out of wealth than they do out of labor income. Third, the model explains why Ricardian equivalence should not hold even in an economy characterized by an infinitely lived representative agent. Fourth, the model suggests that financial innovation may have caused the ongoing decline in U. S. savings rates, since financial innovation increases liquidity and eliminates implicit commitment opportunities. Finally, the model provides a formal framework for considering the proposition that financial market innovation reduces welfare by providing \"too much\" liquidity.\n\nThe body of this essay formalizes these claims. Section II lays out the model. Equilibrium outcomes are characterized in Section III. Section IV considers the implications of the model for the macroeconomic issues highlighted above. Section V concludes with a discussion of ongoing work."

      "text": "The large number of commitment devices, discussed above, is good news for consumers. They have access to a wide array of assets that effectively enable them to achieve many forms of commitment. However, from the perspective of an economist, the abundance poses a challenge. It is hard to model the institutional richness in a realistic way without generating an extremely burdensome number of state variables.\n\nI consider a highly stylized commitment technology that is amenable to an analytic treatment. Specifically, I assume that consumers may invest in two instruments: a liquid asset x and an illiquid asset z. Instrument z is illiquid in the sense that a sale of this asset has to be initiated one period before the actual proceeds are received. So a current decision to liquidate part or all of an individual's z holding will generate cash flow that can be QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS consumed no earlier than next period. 1 By contrast, agents can always immediately consume their x holdings.\n\nConsumers in this model may borrow against their holdings of asset z. Like asset sales, such borrowing takes one period to implement. If a consumer applies for a loan at time period t, the associated cash flow will not be available for consumption until time period t \u03e9 1.\n\nIn later sections I embed consumers in a general equilibrium model in which prices will be endogenous. Now, however, I consider the consumer in isolation, and assume that the consumer faces a deterministic sequence of interest rates and wages. For simplicity, I assume that asset z and asset x have the same rate of return. 2  The consumer makes consumption/savings decisions in discrete time t \u02a6 {1, 2, . . . , T}. Every time period t is divided into four subperiods. In the first subperiod, production takes place. The consumer's liquid assets x t\u03ea1 and nonliquid assets z t\u03ea1 -both chosen at time period t \u03ea 1-yield a gross return of R t \u03ed 1 \u03e9 r t , and the consumer inelastically supplies one unit of labor. In the second subperiod the consumer receives deterministic labor income y t and gets access to her liquid savings, R t \u22c5 x t\u03ea1 . In the third subperiod the consumer chooses current consumption, c y Rx\n\nt t t t + \u2264 -1 . In the fourth subperiod the consumer chooses her new asset allocations, x t and z t , subject to the constraints, y R z x c z x x z t t t t t t t t t\n\nThe consumer begins life with exogenous endowments x 0 , z 0 \u0546 0. The consumer may borrow against her illiquid assets by giving a creditor a contingent control right over some of those assets. In exchange, the consumer receives liquidity that can be consumed. Such a loan is formally represented as a reallocation of assets from the illiquid account to the liquid account. I assume that a loan, i.e., asset reallocation, which generates consumable liquidity in period t \u03e9 1 must be initiated in period t. Specifically, 1. One could alternatively assume that instantaneous access to asset z is possible with a sufficiently high transaction cost.\n\n2. The qualitative results do not hinge on the identical returns assumption."

      "text": "the asset reallocation occurs in subperiod 4 of period t, thereby providing consumable liquidity in period t \u03e9 1. Such asset reallocations are subsumed in the consumer's choice of x t and z t in subperiod 4.\n\nIn the framework introduced above, an uncollateralized loan has occurred if an asset reallocation leaves the illiquid account negative. Creditors are unwilling to make such loans because a consumer who received such a loan would not have an incentive to repay. Hence, I assume that z t \u0546 0.\n\nFinally, the constraint x t \u0546 0 rules out forced savings contracts. If the consumer could set x t to any negative value, then she could perfectly commit her future savings behavior and hence her consumption level (or at least commit to any upper bound on tomorrow's consumption level). For example, if she foresaw a high level of labor income next period, she could set x t negative to force tomorrow's self to save some of that income (recall that c t\u03e91 \u0545 y t\u03e91 \u03e9 R t\u03e91 x t ). A negative x t value would be interpreted as a contract with an outside agent requiring the consumer to transfer funds to the outside agent, which the outside agent would then deposit in an illiquid account of the consumer. 3 The constraint x t \u0546 0 effectively rules out such contracts. Two arguments support this implicit assumption against forced savings contracts.\n\nFirst, such contracts are susceptible to renegotiation by tomorrow's self, and in any finite-horizon environment, the contract would unwind. (In the second to last period renegotiation would occur, implying renegotiation in the third to last period, etc.) Second, such contracts are generally unenforceable in the United States. 4 To make such a contract work, tomorrow's self must be forced to pay the specified funds to the outside agent or be penalized for not doing so (note that the transfer is not in the interest of tomorrow's self). However, U. S. courts will generally not enforce contracts with a penalty of this kind. 5   3. Mortgage payments are an example of a contract that x t \u0546 0 rules out. However, even though mortgage payments may be interpreted as forced savings contracts, they do not have the necessary flexibility to achieve the full commitment solution. Mortgage contracts generally do not make mortgage payments contingent on the level of labor income flows.\n\n4. I am indebted to Robert Hall for pointing out this fact to me. 5. U. S. contract law is based around the \"fundamental principle that the law's goal on breach of contract is not to deter breach by compelling the promisor to perform, but rather to redress breach by compensating the promisee\"  [Farnsworth 1990, p. 935] . Hence, courts allow contracts to specify \"liquidated damages\" which reflect losses likely to be experienced by the promisee, but courts do not allow \"penalties\" which do not reflect such losses."

Consumers are assumed to have a discount function of the type proposed by  Phelps and Pollak [1968]  in a model of intergenerational altruism, and which is used here to model intrapersonal dynamic conflict: 6   (1)\n\nI adopt equation  (1)  to capture the qualitative properties of a generalized hyperbolic discount function: events periods away are discounted with factor (1 \u03e9 \u2423) \u03ea\u2425/\u2423 , with \u2423, \u2425 \u03fe 0. 7 This class of discount functions was first proposed by  Chung and Herrnstein [1961]  to characterize the results of animal behavior experiments. 8 Their conclusions were later shown to apply to human subjects as well (see  Ainslie [1992]  for a survey).\n\nHyperbolic discount functions imply discount rates that decline as the discounted event is moved further away in time  [Loewenstein and Prelec 1992] . Events in the near future are discounted at a higher implicit discount rate than events in the distant future.\n\nGiven a discount function \u0192(), the instantaneous discount rate at time is defined as Applying the principle of 'just compensation for the loss or injury actually sustained' to liquidated damage provisions, courts have . . . refused enforcement where the clause agreed upon is held to be in terrorem-a sum fixed as a deterrent to breach or as security for full performance by the promisor, not as a realistic assessment of the provable damage. Thus, attempts to secure performance through in terrorem clauses are currently declared unenforceable even where the evidence shows a voluntary, fairly bargained exchange  [Goetz and Scott 1977, p. 555 ].\n\nIn our case, the promisee-the outside agent-experiences no loss if the consumer fails to make the payment. Hence, penalties or liquidated damages specified in such contracts are not enforceable, so the contract is incapable of compelling tomorrow's self to make the payment. For a more extensive discussion of these issues, see  Farnsworth [1990, pp. 935-46] ,  Goetz and Scott [1977] , and  Rea [1984] . 6. Zeckhauser and Fels [1968]  provide an altruism-based microfoundation for the Phelps and Pollak preferences. Akerlof [1991]  analyzes a special case of the Phelps and Pollak preferences (\u2426 \u03ed 1). Akerlof assumes consumer myopia, while my analysis assumes that consumers foresee their future preference reversals.\n\n7. See  Loewenstein and Prelec [1992]  for an axiomatic derivation of this discount function.\n\n8.

The preferences given by equation (  1 ) are dynamically inconsistent, in the sense that preferences at date t are inconsistent with preferences at date t \u03e9 1. To see this, note that the marginal rate of substitution between periods t \u03e9 1 and t \u03e9 2 from the perspective of the decision-maker at time t is given by u\u0408(c t\u03e91 )/(\u2426u\u0408(c t\u03e92 )), which is not equal to the marginal rate of substitution between those same periods from the perspective of the decision-maker at t \u03e9 1: u\u0408(c t\u03e91 )/(\u2424\u2426u\u0408(c t\u03e92 )).\n\nTo analyze equilibrium behavior when preferences are dynamically inconsistent, it is standard practice to formally model a consumer as a sequence of temporal selves making choices in a dynamic game (e.g.,  Pollak [1968] ,  Peleg and Yaari [1973] , and  Goldman [1980] ). Hence, a T-period consumption problem translates into a T-period game, with T players, or \"selves,\" indexed by their respective periods of control over the consumption decision. (Note that self t is in control during all of the subperiods at time t.) I look for subgame perfect equilibrium (SPE) strategies of this game.\n\nIt is helpful to introduce some standard notation that will be used in the analysis which follows. Let h t represent a (feasible) history at time t, so h t represents all the moves that have been made from time 0 to time t \u03ea 1: {x 0 , z 0 , (c , x , z ) t\u03ea1 \u03ed1 }. Let S t represent the set of feasible strategies for self t. Let S \u03ed \u2338 T t\u03ed1 S t represent the joint strategy space of all selves. If s \u02a6 S, let s|h t represent the path of consumption and asset allocation levels from t to T which would arise if history h t were realized, and selves t to T played the strategies given by s. Finally, let U t (s|h t ) represent the continuation payoff to self t if self t expects the consumption and asset allocation levels from t to T to be given by s|h t ."

      "text": "This section characterizes the equilibrium strategies of the game described above. Recall that the agent faces a deterministic (time-varying) sequence of interest rates and a deterministic (time-varying) labor income sequence. Unfortunately, for general interest rate and labor income sequences, it is not possible to use marginal conditions to characterize the equilibrium strategies. This nonmarginality property is related to the fact that selves who make choices at least two periods from the end of the game face a nonconvex reduced-form choice set, where the reducedform choice set is defined as the consumption vectors which are attainable, assuming that all future selves play equilibrium strategies. The nonconvexity in the reduced-form choice set of self T \u03ea 2 generates discontinuous equilibrium strategies for self T \u03ea 2, which in turn generate discontinuities in the equilibrium payoff map of self T \u03ea 3. This implies that marginal conditions cannot be used to characterize the equilibrium choices of selves at least three periods from the end of the game. 9  I have found a restriction on the labor income process that eliminates these problems:\n\nThis restriction constrains the sequence { y t } t\u03edT t\u03ed1 to lie in a band whose thickness is parameterized by the value of \u2424; the closer \u2424 is to zero, the wider the band. Calibration of the model reveals that A1 allows for substantial flexibility in the deterministic income process. Ainslie [1992]  reviews evidence that the one-year discount rate is at least 1/3. This suggests that \u2424 should be calibrated in the interval (0, 2/3) (assuming that \u2426 is close to unity).\n\nTo see what this implies, consider the following example. Assume that R t \u03ed R for all t, \u2426R \u03ed 1, and u(\u22c5) \u03ed ln(\u22c5). Then A1 is satisfied if, for all t, y t \u02a6 [y, (1/\u2424)y]. If \u2424 \u03ed 2/3, this interval becomes [y, (3/ 2)y], and as \u2424 falls the interval grows even larger.\n\nBefore characterizing the equilibria of the game, it is helpful to introduce the following definitions. First, we will say that a joint strategy, s, is resource exhausting if s|h T\u03ea1 is characterized by z T \u03ed x t \u03ed 0, for all feasible h T\u03ea1 .

This theorem establishes that the consumption game has a unique equilibrium, and the theorem characterizes this equilibrium.\n\nTHEOREM 1. Fix any T-period consumption game with exogenous variables satisfying A1. There exists a unique resourceexhausting joint strategy, s* \u02a6 S, that satisfies P1-P4, and this strategy is the unique subgame perfect equilibrium strategy of this game.\n\n(All proofs appear in the Appendix.) Theorem 1 implies that the equilibrium consumption path is resource exhausting and satisfies P1-P4. It is straightforward to see why the equilibrium path is resource exhausting: the final self-self T-consumes all liquid resources in period T, and self T \u03ea 1 makes certain that all wealth is liquid in period T (i.e., z T\u03ea1 \u03ed 0). Hence, no wealth goes unconsumed in equilibrium.\n\nProperties P1-P4 are also intuitive. It is important to interpret them in light of the strategic self-control behavior that arises in the intrapersonal consumption game. In this game, early selves prevent late selves from splurging. Self t \u03ea 1 uses the illiquid asset z t\u03ea1 to limit the liquidity available for consumption in period t. Note that self t cannot consume the illiquid asset during its period of control, c t \u0545 y t \u03e9 R t x t\u03ea1 . On the equilibrium path, each self is endogenously liquidity constrained by the allocation choices of earlier selves. Property P1 is simply a standard Euler equation relation for an environment in which liquidity constraints exist. The inequality arises because marginal utility can be too high relative to future marginal utilities, but it cannot be too low since consumers always have the option to save. Property P2 reflects another standard Euler equation intuition: when marginal utility is strictly too high, the liquidity constraint must be binding. Properties P3 and P4 reflect the strategic decisions that self t makes when it chooses asset allocation levels (x t and z t ). P3 implies that self t will limit self t \u03e9 1's liquidity as much as possible (x t \u03ed 0) if consumption at time t \u03e9 1 is expected to be high relative to what self t would prefer it to be. P4 implies that self t will not limit self t \u03e9 1's liquidity at all (z t \u03ed 0) if consumption at time t \u03e9 1 is expected to be low relative to what self t would prefer it to be. Note that the equations associated with P3 and P4 do not contain the \u2424 term. This omission arises because, from the perspective of self t, utility trade-offs between period t \u03e9 1 and any period after t \u03e9 1 are independent of the value of \u2424."

      "text": "tion-income comovement. Carroll [1992]  proposes a buffer-stock theory of savings in which impatient consumers with a precautionary savings motive hold little wealth and choose optimal consumption policies in which consumption and income move together over the life-cycle. Gourinchas and Parker [1995]  simulate an extended version of this model. Attanasio and Weber [1993]  argue that demographic dynamics explain much of the consumption-income comovement.\n\nThe golden eggs model provides a new explanation for the observed comovement in consumption and income. In the model, self t \u03ea 1 chooses x t\u03ea1 to constrain the consumption of self t. In this way \"early\" selves manipulate the cash flow process by keeping most assets in the illiquid instrument. Hence, at any given moment the consumer is effectively liquidity constrained, though the constraint is self-imposed. In equilibrium consumption is exactly equal to the current level of cash flow: c t \u03ed y t \u03e9 R t x t\u03ea1 (see Lemma 3 in the Appendix for a formal proof ). However, this does not imply by itself that consumption will track labor income. Note that x t\u03ea1 is endogenous, and in equilibrium x t\u03ea1 covaries negatively with labor income. Self t \u03ea 1 varies x t\u03ea1 to try to offset the predictable fluctuations in y t . When y t is large, self t \u03ea 1 will make x t\u03ea1 small in an effort to prevent self t from overconsuming.\n\nHowever, there are limits to the ways in which \"early\" selves can constrain the choices of \"later\" selves. Self t \u03ea 1 can only deny self t access to assets that have been accumulated in the past. Self t \u03ea 1 cannot deny self t access to y t , labor income at time t. So when y t is particularly high (i.e., cash flow at time t is particularly high), consumption at time t will also be high. This implies that on the equilibrium path, predictable movements in income will tend to be reflected in movements in consumption.\n\nAn example may help to make this more concrete. Let the horizon be infinite. Assume that labor income follows a trending high-low process: y t \u03ed ye gt when t is odd, y t \u03ed ye gt when t is even. Assume that the interest rate is constant and exp(g) \u03ed \u2426R. (This last relationship is motivated by the steady state results below.) Assume that { y t } \u221e t\u03ed1 satisfies A1.

First, the illiquid asset is exclusively used to augment consumption in the even periods, i.e., in the periods with relatively low labor income. However, this increase is not sufficient to smooth consumption. A regression of \u232c ln c t on \u232c ln y t yields a coefficient of .40. Since the income process is completely deterministic, this implies that predictable changes in income are associated with changes in consumption. Hence, consumption tracks income despite the fact that the consumer in this example controls a substantial asset stock (K/Y \u0d20 3)."

Such relatively high discount rates, however, tend to imply relatively low levels of capital accumulation in general equilibrium (see  Aiyagari [1992] ). The golden eggs model generates consumption-income comovement even when actors are wealthy. This is because in equilibrium decisions to dissave out of the illiquid asset stock do not depend on \u2424. Self t is not able to consume the illiquid asset immediately, so self t does not consider tradeoffs between consumption today and consumption tomorrow when dissaving from the illiquid instrument. Instead self t considers trade-offs between consumption at t \u03e9 1 and consumption at periods after t \u03e9 1. The value of \u2424 is superfluous for such a decision-from self t's perspective-and hence the steady state capital stock is independent of \u2424.\n\nThe following general equilibrium analysis formalizes this intuition.

Thaler divides consumer wealth into three categories: current income, net assets, and future income. He cites a wide body of evidence which suggests that \"the MPC from [current income] is close to unity, the MPC from [future income] is close to zero, and the MPC from [net assets] is somewhere in between.\" Thaler explains this behavior by postulating that consumers use a system of nonfungible mental accounts to guide rule-of-thumb decision-making. By contrast, the golden eggs model predicts that even fully rational consumers will exhibit asset-specific MPCs.  13 n the golden eggs model the current self is always endogenously liquidity constrained on the equilibrium path.

Small perturbations to the illiquid asset stock are not sufficient to stop the current self 's liquidity constraint from being binding.

Unfortunately, the value of \u2202x t /\u2202(R t z t\u03ea1 ) can take on any value between zero and one.

      "text": "The golden eggs model may help to explain the decline in U. S. savings rates during the 1980s. I pursue two approaches in this subsection. The first explanation is driven by the fact that during the 1980s a relatively large proportion of national income was realized as cash flow to consumers. However, I am unsatisfied with this first story for reasons that I describe below. Hence, I focus most of my attention on a second explanation that is driven by developments in the consumer credit market. Hatsopoulos, Krugman, and Poterba [1989]  document the ob-servation that cash flow to consumers (as a percentage of NNP) was high during the 1980s relative to the 1970s. They report that from 1970-1979 cash flow averaged 77.9 percent of NNP, while the corresponding number for the 1980-1987 period was 80.8 percent. They trace this increase to several sources, notably higher interest income (4.5 percentage points), higher transfers (2.2 percentage points), and higher after-tax cash from takeovers (0.6 percentage points). 14  Using aggregate data,  Hatsopoulos, Krugman, and Poterba [1989]  estimate a high marginal propensity to consume out of current cash flow. Coupling this result with the higher cash flow levels, they are able to explain most of the savings decline in the 1980s. However, they do not explain why consumers should have such a high propensity to consume out of cash flow. The golden eggs model complements their analysis by providing a model that explains the high MPC. However, note that the golden eggs model can only explain the high MPC out of cash flow; the model cannot explain why the cash flow was high in the first place. Hence, application of the golden eggs model may only relabel the puzzle, changing it from a consumption puzzle to a cash flow puzzle.\n\nThe golden eggs model suggests a second explanation for the low level of savings during the past decade. The 1980s was a period of rapid expansion in the U. S. consumer credit market. Increasing access to instantaneous credit has reduced the effectiveness of commitment devices like illiquid assets. The golden eggs model predicts that the elimination of commitment devices would lower the level of capital accumulation. I will show that if the credit market were to become sufficiently sophisticated that consumers could instantaneously borrow against their illiquid assets, then the steady state capital-output ratio would fall. I calibrate this fall at the end of the subsection.\n\nThe rapid expansion of the U. S. consumer credit market provides the starting point for the argument summarized in the previous paragraph. One example of the expansion in instantaneous credit has been the growth in credit cards. 15 In 1970 only 16 percent of all U. S. families had a third party credit card (e.g., prede-14. Offsetting falls in cash flow occurred in labor income (\u03ea0.3 percentage points), noninterest capital income in disposable income (\u03ea2.0 percentage points), and taxes (\u03ea2.1 percentage points).\n\n15. Another important development in the U. S. credit market has been the expanded use of home equity lines of credit. Before the mid-1980s home equity lines of credit were almost unheard of. By 1993 By -1994 8.3 8.3  percent of homeowners had a home equity line of credit. See  Canner and Luckett [1994] , p. 572."

Large retailers did not accept credit cards during the 1970s. In 1979 J. C. Penney broke ranks with its competitors and became the first major retailer to accept third party credit cards. By the end of the 1980s almost all large retailers accepted third party cards. The growth of ATMs (automatic teller machines) augmented the impact of the credit card expansion by enabling credit cardholders to readily receive cash advances. Regional and national ATM networks first began to form in the late 1970s and early 1980s. 17 Altogether these developments led to an explosion in revolving credit, which is principally composed of credit card debt. From 1970 to 1995, revolving credit grew from 3.7 percent to 36.3 percent of total consumer credit. 18 No single year stands out as the date at which most consumers experienced a sharp increase in their personal access to instantaneous credit. However, it is safe to say that by the mid-1980s most families had a third party credit card, and this card could be used in most large retail stores, or could be used in ATMs to receive cash advances to make purchases in the stores that still did not accept credit cards. Together these observations suggest that the mid-1980s represents the first time that a representative U. S. family had instantaneous access to consumer credit, or could rapidly apply for such access.\n\nIntroducing instantaneous credit into the golden eggs model dramatically changes the equilibrium analysis. (Recall that the original model had credit which could be accessed with a oneperiod delay.) In the original model consumption was bounded above by cash on hand:\n\nWith instantaneous access to credit, consumption is now constrained to lie below the sum of cash on hand and the value of all credit lines that can be instantaneously set up or are already set  16.

The payment level is reported in Table  II , where it is normalized by the level of output at time of payment. 22 Note that a positive payment implies that the consumer needs compensation to induce her to willingly switch to the instantaneous credit scenario.

EVALUATION AND EXTENSIONS I have analyzed the consumption problem of a dynamically inconsistent decision-maker who has access to a crude commitment mechanism. The model helps to explain many of the empirical puzzles in the consumption literature, notably consumptionincome tracking and asset-specific MPCs. However, the model has several drawbacks that suggest four important areas to pursue extensions.\n\nFirst, the golden eggs model does not explain how consumers accumulate assets in the first place. Note that consumption is always greater than labor income on the equilibrium path. However, this is less of a problem than it might first appear. Although there is evidence that individuals often consume less than they earn in labor income, most of this saving is nondiscretionary (e.g., pension contributions, life-insurance payments, mortgage payments, and other payments to creditors). Bringing such \"nondiscretionary savings\" into the model can be done very simply. For example, the consumer could elect to take on a 30-period mortgage obligation at time zero, represented by a mortgage payment of m for the next 30 periods. Then the consumer's cash flow at time t \u0545 30 would be y t \u03e9 R t x t\u03ea1 \u03ea m, which would be less than y t if m were greater than R t x t\u03ea1 . A related way to model nondiscretionary savings would be to let the consumer set x t\u03ea1 itself less than zero, (e.g., x \u0545 x t\u03ea1 , where x \u03fd 0).\n\nA second problem associated with the model is the anomalous prediction that consumers will always face a binding selfimposed liquidity constraint. For example, the golden eggs model predicts that after making their consumption choice, consumers should have no liquid funds left in their bank accounts. This prediction contradicts many consumers' experiences. However, this problem can be readily addressed by introducing a precautionary savings motive for holding liquidity. For example, consider a continuous-time analog of the golden eggs model, and assume that instantaneous liquidity needs arrive with some hazard rate. Then in equilibrium the consumer will only rarely completely exhaust her liquidity.\n\nA third problem with the golden eggs model is that some con-"

Consumers may have internal self-control mechanisms, like \"will power\" and \"personal rules.\" In  Laibson [1994a]  I analyze an infinite-horizon consumption/savings game with no external commitment technology and find a multiplicity of Pareto-rankable equilibria. I interpret this multiplicity as a potential model for self-control and willpower. However, this approach raises problematic and as yet unresolved equilibrium selection problems. More work is needed to develop theoretically robust models of internal self-control mechanisms, and to empirically validate such models.\n\nThe fourth problem with the golden eggs model is that some consumers may have access to an array of \"social\" commitment devices that are far richer than the simple illiquid asset proposed in this essay. In  Laibson [1994b]  I analyze the problem of a consumer who can use social systems like marriage, work, and friendship to achieve personal commitment. Future work should try to identify the most important mechanisms that consumers use to overcome the self-control problems induced by hyperbolic preferences."

Note that program II is a convex program with linear GOLDEN EGGS AND HYPERBOLIC DISCOUNTING constraints, so the Kuhn-Tucker first-order conditions are necessary and sufficient for a global optimum. I will return to this fact later in the proof.\n\nThe following notation will be used to prove the lemma. Let \u2340 represent the set of all real vectors, \u03ed {c\n\nt , x t , z t } T t\u03ed1 . Let C I \u029a \u2340 (C II \u029a \u2340) represent the subset of vectors in \u2340 which satisfy the constraints of program I (II). Let C* I \u029a \u2340 (C* II \u029a \u2340) represent the subset of vectors in \u2340 that are solutions to program I (II). The first step in the proof is to show that C I \u029a C II . Fix any \u02a6 C I , and let \u03ed {c t , x t , z t } T t\u03ed1 . Note that the first five constraints of program I are identical to the first five constraints of program II. Also note that if {c t , x t , z t } T t\u03ed2 satisfies P1-P4, then by Lemma 1, c 2 \u0546 y 2 , and by Lemma 3, c t \u03ed y t \u03e9 R t x t\u03ea1 \u2200 t \u0546 3.

Fix any \u0408 \u02a6 C* II , and let \u0408 \u03ed {c t , x t , z t } T t\u03ed1 . Define x \u02c61 such that c 2 \u03ed y 2 \u03e9 R 2 x \u02c61. Let \u0409 be equivalent to \u0408 except that x 1 is replaced by x \u02c61, and I am now ready to complete the proof of the lemma.\n\nLet be a solution to program I, and let \u03ed {c t , x t , z t } T t\u03ed1 . So {c t , x t , z t } T t\u03ed2 satisfies P1-P4. Since C* I \u029a C* II , must also satisfy the necessary and sufficient Kuhn-Tucker conditions of program II. Combining these constraints, it is straightforward to show that {c t , x t , z t } T t\u03ed1 satisfies P1-P4. \u25ab Proof of Theorem 1. Suppose that there exist two resourceexhausting joint strategies, s A , s B \u02a6 S, that satisfy P1-P4. Fix any period t, and any feasible history h t . Let s A |h t \u03f5 {c A t\u03e9 , x A t\u03e9 , z A t\u03e9 } T\u03eat \u03ed0 , s B |h t \u03f5 {c B t\u03e9 , x B t\u03e9 , z B t\u03e9 } T\u03eat \u03ed0 . By resource exhaustion and Lemma 2, c A t\u03e9 \u03ed c B t\u03e9 \u2200 \u0546 0. Hence, by Lemma 3, x A t\u03e9 \u03ed x B t\u03e9 \u2200 \u0546 0. This in turn implies that z A t\u03e9 \u03ed z B t\u03e9 \u2200 \u0546 0, as QUARTERLY JOURNAL OF ECONOMICS a result of the savings constraints. Because the proof started with arbitary h t , we can conclude that s A \u03ed s B proving that there exists a unique resource-exhausting joint strategy, s* \u02a6 S, that satisfies P1-P4. The second part of the theorem follows from this uniqueness result, Lemma 4, and a standard induction argument. \u25ab Proof of Proposition 1. If a steady state satisfies A1, then exp(g) \u0546 R\u2426. Moreover, it is easy to construct a steady state at which exp(g) \u03ed R\u2426. Suppose that there exists a steady state at which exp(g) \u03fe R\u2426. Then by P1-P4, lim t\u2192\u221e z t \u03ed lim t\u2192\u221e x t \u03ed 0, which implies that no such steady state could exist. \u25ab Proof of Proposition 2. By P1, u\u0408(c t ) \u0546 \u2424\u2426 (\u2338 i\u03ed1 R t\u03e9i ) u\u0408(c t\u03e9 ) \u2200 t \u0546 2, \u0546 0. Suppose that this inequality is satisfied exactly for some t, pair. Then x t\u03ea1 \u03ed 0 by P3. Hence, u y u c R u c R u y t t t i i t t i i t\n\n\u0408 \u0408 \u0408 \u0408 ( ( ( ) ( ) ) by Lemma 3 by assumption ) by Lemma 3. = = \u220f \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \u2264 \u220f \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8f6 \uf8f8 + = + + = + \u03b2\u03b4 \u03b2\u03b4 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u03c4 \u03c4 1 1\n\nBut u\u0408( y t ) \u0545 \u2424\u2426 (\u2338 i\u03ed1 R t\u03e9i ) u\u0408(y t\u03e9 ) violates A1, (since A1 is assumed to hold strictly). So WLOG, assume that u\u0408(c t ) \u03fe \u2424\u2426 (\u2338 i\u03ed1 R t\u03e9i ) u\u0408(c t\u03e9 ) \u2200 t \u0546 2, \u0546 0. Hence, for sufficiently small |\u2440| \u03fe 0, u\u0408(c t \u03e9\u2440) \u03fe \u2424\u2426 (\u2338 i\u03ed1 R t\u03e9i ) u\u0408(c t\u03e9 ) \u2200 t \u0546 2, \u0546 0. So by P3 and the uniqueness result of Theorem 1, in the subgame starting after any sufficiently small perturbation to the liquid asset stock, the equality c t \u03ed y t \u03e9 R t x t\u03ea1 continues to hold, and hence, \u2202c t /(\u2202(R t x t\u03ea1 )) \u03ed 1. \u25ab Proof of Proposition 3. WLOG, assume that u\u0408(c t ) \u03fe \u2424\u2426 (\u2338 i\u03ed1 R t\u03e9i ) u\u0408(c t\u03e9 ) \u2200 t \u0546 2, \u0546 0 (see Proof of Proposition 2). Hence, for sufficiently small |\u2440| \u03fe 0, u\u0408(c t ) \u03fe \u2424\u2426 (\u2338 i\u03ed1 R t\u03e9i )u\u0408 (c t\u03e9 \u03e9 (\u2338 i\u03ed1 R i )\u2440) \u2200 t \u0546 2, \u0546 0. So current consumption does not change when z t\u03ea1 is perturbed. \u25ab Proposition 4 is proved with two intermediate lemmas.\n\nLEMMA 5. Fix the economy described in Proposition 4. On the equilibrium path of this game u\u0408(c t ) \u03ed (\u2426R) u\u0408(c t\u03e9 ) \u2200 t \u0546 2.\n\nProof of Lemma 5. Suppose that u\u0408(c t ) \u03fd (\u2426R) u\u0408(c t\u03e9 ) for some t \u0546 2. Then P3 implies x t\u03ea1 \u03ed 0, implying that Note that u\u0408( y t ) \u03ed (\u2426R) u\u0408( y t\u03e9 ), follows from the assumptions. So the previous inequalities imply that x t\u03e9\u03ea1 \u03fe 0, which together with P3 implies that u\u0408(c t\u03e9 ) \u0546 sup n\u05461 (\u2426R) n u\u0408(c t\u03e9\u03e9n ). In addition, x t\u03e9\u03ea1 \u03fe 0, implies that z t\u03ea1 \u03fe 0, which together with P4 implies that u\u0408(c t ) \u0545 sup n\u05461 (\u2426R) n u\u0408(c t\u03e9n ). So there exists a finite t \u02c6\u02a6 {t \u03e9 1, t \u03e9 2, . . . , t \u03e9 \u03ea 1}, such that u\u0408(c t \u02c6) \u03fe sup n\u05461 (\u2426R) n u\u0408(c t \u02c6\u03e9n ). Hence, by P4, z t \u02c6\u03ea1 \u03ed 0, contradicting the result that x t\u03e9\u03ea1 \u03fe 0. \u25ab LEMMA 6. Fix the economy described in Proposition 4. On the equilibrium path of this game x t\u03e9 \u03ed exp(g)x t , z t\u03e9 \u03ed exp(g)z t , \u2200 t \u0546 1.\n\nProof of Lemma 6. By Lemma 5, u\u0408(c t ) \u03ed (\u2426R) u\u0408(c t\u03e9 ) \u2200 t \u0546 2. Combining this with Lemma 3 implies that u\u0408( y t \u03e9 Rx t\u03ea1 ) \u03ed (\u2426R) u\u0408(y t\u03e9 \u03e9 Rx t\u03e9\u03ea1 ). The assumptions, exp(g) \u03ed \u2426R and y t\u03e9 \u03ed exp(g)y t , can be used to simplify the previous equation, yielding, x t\u03e9\u03ea1 \u03ed exp(g)x t\u03ea1 \u2200 t \u0546 2. Note that resource exhaustion and Lemma 3 together imply that  Proposition 4.  To prove this proposition, I consider two games: an original game, and a perturbed game. The perturbed game is identical to the original game except that in the perturbed game illiquid assets are higher at time zero. Let \u232ca represent the difference between variable a in the perturbed game and variable a in the original game.
