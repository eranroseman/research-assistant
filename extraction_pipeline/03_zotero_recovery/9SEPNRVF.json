  "title": "Digital Health Interventions Are Effective for Irritable Bowel Syndrome Self-Management: A Systematic Review",
  "abstract": "Background Digital health interventions (DHIs) could be a valuable self-management tool for patients with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), but little research exists on IBS-focused DHIs and their effectiveness. This review aimed to identify DHIs for IBS and evaluate their characteristics, effectiveness, and feasibility. Methods Our study team, including patient partners, conducted a systematic review using Medline, PsycINFO, Embase, Web of Science, and CINAHL from database inception to May 2024. Experimental and observational studies evaluating DHIs designed for use by IBS patients were included. Data extraction and assessment included study and DHI characteristics, effectiveness outcomes (symptom severity, quality of life, psychological indices, patient empowerment), and feasibility measures (adherence, usability, user satisfaction). Study quality and bias were assessed using a modified checklist of Downs and Black. Results Of the 929 identified, 13 studies of DHIs were included and deemed good quality on average (21,510 total participants) with six primary areas of focus: education, diet, brain-gut behavior skills, physiological support, health monitoring, and community engagement. Most DHIs were self-directed and reported statistically significant improvements in most effectiveness outcomes. Evidence suggests that DHIs focusing on brain-gut behavior skills or health monitoring may be most effective compared to other types of DHIs. However, their feasibility remains unclear, and the generalization of their impacts is limited. Conclusion This review underscores the potential of DHIs in supporting IBS patients and improving their outcomes. However, additional research is warranted for continued intervention use in this population, including assessments on feasibility, safety, cost-effectiveness, and patient empowerment and experiences.",

      "text": "Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a disorder of gut-brain interaction, characterized by abnormal changes in bowel habits, abdominal pain and bloating, and associated psychiatric conditions and an estimated prevalence of 9.2% worldwide  [1, 2] . Self-management-through consistent adherence to dietary modifications and psychological and pharmacological therapies-could effectively mitigate IBS symptoms, alleviate healthcare burden, and improve patient quality of life  [3] [4] [5] .\n\nDigital health interventions (DHIs) developed for persons are defined as discrete digital technologies designed to be functionally capable of addressing personal challenges, such as members of the public who are potential or current users of health services and caregivers of individuals experiencing challenges with receiving health services  [6, 7] . DHIs have become valuable resources for patients to self-manage symptoms and comorbidities in the form of mobile applications and web-based programs, providing them access to clinical and actionable content to improve disease-related knowledge and outcomes  [8] . The design and function of DHIs typically fall into one or multiple categories: symptom tracking, patient-and community-based resources, telemedicine, and connection to digital and wearable devices  [9] .\n\nDespite growing research interest in the relationship between DHIs and GI health, existing reviews do not fully capture DHIs or their impacts on IBS, specifically. A 2018 systematic review and 2021 meta-analysis assessed the effectiveness of DHIs for participants with GI-related health conditions  [10, 11] . Both studies measured certain patient outcomes, providing a partial understanding of the effects of DHIs. A recently published systematic review assessed the current landscape of novel digital therapeutics for IBS that primarily focused on brain-gut behavior therapies  [12] , thus excluding DHIs that support other aspects of IBS self-management, such as diet and lifestyle changes  [13] . Furthermore, feasibility is another crucial component in assessing the relevance and sustainability of an intervention  [14] , yet it was not explored in any of the mentioned reviews.\n\nTo our knowledge, there is no recent systematic review that identifies, summarizes, and evaluates the feasibility and effectiveness of DHIs in IBS. This systematic review aimed to address this knowledge gap by: (1) identifying existing IBS-specific DHIs in the literature,  (2)  assessing their effectiveness and feasibility in managing IBS, and (3) exploring potential correlations between DHI characteristics and effectiveness outcomes. Primary outcomes included IBS-related symptom severity, quality of life (QOL), psychological indices, patient empowerment, and feasibility-related measures (e.g., user satisfaction, adherence). We hypothesized that DHIs may significantly improve IBS patient outcomes and reflect high levels of feasibility. A better understanding of DHIs for self-management can inform patients, providers, researchers, and developers in advancing the quality, effectiveness, and accessibility of the current and future resources to improve patient outcomes."

Data were retrieved from inception to May 24, 2024, using five electronic databases: Medline (OVID), PsycINFO, Web of Science, EMBASE (OVID), and CINAHL. The search strategy used a combination of the following MeSH headings and key terms (e.g., IBS, irritable bowel, mobile, digital, and eHealth), utilizing the \"OR\" and \"AND\" Boolean operators to broaden and narrow the search results, respectively (Supplementary File 1). Reference lists from eligible studies were examined to identify potential studies not captured from the search strategy, although none satisfied the inclusion criteria. Excluded protocols were also further examined to identify potential articles that were subsequently published but were not captured from the search strategy."

After removing duplicate records, two reviewers [NH and CW] independently screened the titles and abstracts using an inclusion criteria (Supplementary File 2): experimental and observational studies that evaluated DHIs and their effectiveness outcomes, regardless of whether the DHI was developed by the respective study team or was a public or commercial product. The Population, Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO) characteristics for eligibility  [17]  were as follows: (P) adults diagnosed with IBS; (I) DHIs designed for IBS patient use; (C) controls receiving no intervention (e.g., wait-list or usual care) or were included in a different program; and (O) quantitative, patient-reported effectiveness outcomes. Disagreements between the two reviewers were resolved by consensus, and the remaining conflicts were resolved by a third party  [AD] . Abstracts satisfying the inclusion criteria by both reviewers were selected for full-text review.\n\nThe full-text review was conducted independently by the same two reviewers, using an exclusion criteria (Supplementary File 2): (P) non-IBS patients, healthcare professionals, pediatric patients or caregivers of IBS, or adult patients in which their IBS diagnosis was not the primary focus of the study, (I) non-DHIs, DHIs that are not interventional, DHIs that were intended to compare different modes of delivery for the same treatment, DHIs of which are not the primary focus of the study itself, or internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapies (iCBT) in the form of DHIs, (C) healthy populations, the use of other DHIs as controls, or the same treatment in a different mode of delivery, and (O) qualitative-based outcomes. Although iCBTs can be considered as DHIs, existing literature and reviews have already thoroughly assessed their effects on IBS  [12, 18] . Disagreements were resolved by consensus or escalated by a third party [AD] for a final decision."

Characteristics of the study design collected include author, year, country, sample size, participant demographics, effectiveness outcomes, and significant findings. The primary outcomes of interest included IBSrelated symptom severity, QOL, psychological indices, patient empowerment, and feasibility-related measures (e.g., adherence, user satisfaction). A p value less than 0.05 indicates a statistically significant difference in the values of the outcome measures  [19] . DHIs were assessed for their characteristics, including the primary area of focus (education, diet, health monitoring, brain-gut behavior skills, physiological support, community engagement) (Table  1 ), features to prompt tool usage, professional support available for participants and their level of involvement (selfdirected or hybrid support), and level of personalization. Categorization of a DHI's \"level of personalization\" was defined by the study team as the DHI's capacity to allow data input and to generate personalized recommendations for IBS management; level \"1\" indicated no capacity to personalize (e.g., self-guided handbooks, educational resources, structured sessions), \"2\" indicated some capacity (e.g., health journals), and \"3\" indicated total capacity (e.g., artificial intelligence-based personalization, two-way communication with an involved professional)."

Most DHIs were accessed through mobile devices (n = 9), the web (n = 3), or both (n = 1). The majority of DHIs included features to prompt and encourage participant engagement with the DHI and study (n = 7). Primary focus areas identified in the DHIs include education (n = 1), diet (n = 4), brain-gut behavior skills (n = 3), physiological support (n = 2), health monitoring (n = 2), and community engagement (n = 1).\n\nBoth health monitoring DHIs focused on pain and symptoms, although Zia et al. included diet tracking  [27, 33] . The evaluated DHIs varied in levels of personalization and were largely self-directed. DHIs that primarily focus on brain-gut behavior skills and health monitoring were all associated with statistically significant improvements in effectiveness outcomes. Dietfocused DHIs indicated partially positive effects on the outcomes, although none assessed for psychological indices; symptom severity and quality of life were the common measures for diet-focused DHIs. These DHIs either focused  on food triggers and elimination diets  [25, 26] , which have reported conflicting results in IBS symptoms or on food items with low fermentable oligo-, di-, and monosaccharides and polyols (FODMAP)  [21, 30] , which yielded consistently positive results. Physiologically focused DHIs indicated conflicting effects on effectiveness outcomes. Four DHIs were categorized as level \"1\" for their rigid and limited interface for users to input individualized data  [24, 28, 29, 31] . Five DHIs were categorized as personalization level \"2\"  [21, 22, 26, 27, 33] ; these interventions had some components of health monitoring to allow users to input and track their data. Lastly, three DHIs were considered level \"3\"; they included artificial intelligence technology to provide individualized recommendations  [25]  and hybrid, two-way engagement designs to directly connect participants with a professional or person knowledgeable of the DHI or study  [23, 30] .\n\nThere were no observed differences in effects between self-directed and hybrid interventions on effectiveness outcomes. Compared to DHIs with levels \"2\" or \"3\" in personalization, the DHIs categorized as level \"1\" were consistent in demonstrating statistically significant improvements for IBS symptoms, QOL, and psychological indices; three focused on brain-gut behavior skills  [24, 28, 29]  and one on education  [31] . No other notable correlations were observed between the effectiveness outcomes and the following aspects: incorporation of features to prompt and maintain user engagement; the type of DHI platform; and whether the DHI was self-directed or hybrid."

Measures were grouped into two categories: (1) adherence, compliance, and attrition and (2) usability and satisfaction with the DHI. Adherence, compliance, and attrition were measured using mathematical calculations and thresholds established by study teams, although one study based their questionnaire on the NHANES food frequency questionnaire  [56] . Conversely, measurements on usability and satisfaction were more consistent; the System Usability Scale (SUS)  [57] , User Burden Scale (UBS)  [58] , and net promoter scale  [59]  were used to quantify the DHIs' usability, burden, and user satisfaction, respectively. Adherence and compliance were determined by the completion percentage or the activity frequency. Nine studies reported varying rates of adherence and attrition with the DHI over time  [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] 33] . Oerlemans et al. considered the completion of their PDA health diary feasible for the short term (4 weeks) but not in the long term (3-month follow-up) due to a high participant dropout rate  [27] . Similarly, Pathipati et al. and Peters et al. reported high attrition of users over the course of their studies  [28, 29] . Hunt et al. also reported a low average of completed modules and significant attrition associated with more severe scores of visceral sensitivity and fear of food within the eight-week period  [24] . However, they noted that the 14 additional participants who were lost to follow-up prior to the 3-month assessment correlated with improved psychological indices  [24] .

Compared to previous systematic reviews on DHIs for IBS, this review is the first to collectively assess symptom severity, QOL, psychological indices, patient empowerment, and feasibility and explore potential correlations between DHI characteristics and effectiveness outcomes. There is supporting evidence for the use of DHIs for IBS patients in improving GI-related symptoms, QOL, and psychological indices; conversely, there is limited and conflicting evidence to support feasibility and improvements in patient empowerment. Since research on IBS is limited and underrepresented, our comparisons are made to other chronic GI conditions that have been researched more extensively."

      "text": "Findings from our review indicate that DHIs effectively improve IBS symptoms and QOL, which is consistent with reviews on IBD-focused DHIs that share similar features, particularly symptom monitoring  [60] . Similarly, other systematic reviews and meta-analyses among patients with IBD, celiac disease, and chronic pain found significant improvements in QOL  [61] [62] [63] [64] , while one study did not  [65] . The evidence is supportive of improvements in psychological distress as demonstrated by four of the five included studies  [24, 27, 28, 32] , although these outcomes were not extensively evaluated compared to IBS symptoms and QOL. In contrast, Rohde et al. reported conflicting and limited evidence to suggest DHIs improve psychological distress in the IBD population, but these outcomes warrant further investigation  [11] . Interestingly, two of the three studies reported conflicting evidence of improvements in patient empowerment, specifically user knowledge and activation, regardless of study quality. Conversely, a mixed-methods systematic review on IBD participants indicated that, despite reported challenges of using DHIs, most conferred their benefits, including improved disease-related knowledge, enhanced communication with their providers, and a greater sense of reassurance  [62] . Although patient empowerment is an essential catalyst for promoting self-management practices and behaviors  [66, 67] , evaluation of this outcome is limited, and further research is needed to address this knowledge gap."

      "text": "The positive improvements in effectiveness outcomes observed in patients using DHIs designed for brain-gut behavior skills and health monitoring were consistent with previous studies  [10, 12] . Conversely, outcome improvements from the use of diet-based DHIs were inconsistent despite diet being a crucial component of IBS management. However, the limited number of studies poses a challenge in evaluating the full extent of the impacts of such interventions. Furthermore, studies have not looked at psychological indices in relation to diet-based DHIs, as this would include GI-specific psychological processes that are likely to be relevant for diet-based interventions (e.g., fear of food, GI-specific anxiety, pain catastrophizing). This relationship between food and emotional and mental well-being has been reported in people living with IBD in a recent study led by patient research partners with lived experience  [68] . Further research into their psychological impacts on IBS patients is critical in understanding the relationship and effectiveness of diet-based DHIs as self-management tools in comparison to other DHIs.\n\nLastly, examining these relationships is further complicated by the fact that some DHIs included in this review have more than one focus area. Assessments based solely on a singular aspect of a DHI restricts our ability to fully understanding their impacts, and further exploration on the dynamics between multiple focus areas and effectiveness outcomes are needed."

      "title": "Personalization",
      "text": "Due to the heterogeneity of symptoms and patient treatment preferences, IBS management is multi-faceted and should be personalized when possible  [69] . Despite our anticipations that more personalized and customizable DHIs would correlate with significant improvements in effectiveness outcomes, the evidence suggests otherwise. Four of the nine DHIs categorized as personalization levels \"2\" or \"3\" noted insignificant improvements, whereas all four DHIs categorized as level \"1\" yielded significant improvements in effectiveness outcomes. This result conflicts with other literature supporting features of and the desire for personalization in DHIs  [70, 71] . However, it is important to acknowledge that the three of four \"level-1\" DHIs are affiliated with brain-gut behavioral skills; certain focus areas might confound our results when evaluating effectiveness outcomes in the context of personalization level. It is challenging to gauge the impacts of personalization and customization of DHIs in isolation, as the focus areas may dictate the design and functions of the DHI to achieve the best outcomes."

To our surprise, there were no observed differences in effects between self-directed and hybrid interventions on effectiveness outcomes, suggesting that incorporating patient-provider communication does not significantly impact the effectiveness of DHIs for IBS self-management. Contrary to our findings, interventions that aim to improve patient-provider communication have demonstrated improvements in population health and patient and provider experiences  [73] . However, Drossman et al.'s assessment comprised mostly provider-focused studies, which contrasts with the selected studies and results from this review. Including both medical professionals and IBS patients in the development of DHIs is crucial to ensure relevancy, safety, and validity of the information and assess usability and satisfaction, respectively. However, more research is needed to understand the patients' perspectives and priorities regarding the implementation of a hybrid, two-way communication approach to fully optimize such features and their benefits."

      "title": "Feasibility",
      "text": "Usability and desirability scored highly, yet adherence and attrition varied greatly. Of the studies that assessed for feasibility, studies with DHIs that focused on brain-gut behavior skills and had no capacity for personalization indicated high attrition or low completion rates  [24, 28, 29] . Considering that this type of DHI was associated with improved effectiveness outcomes, in addition to the correlation found between attrition and psychological indices  [24] , this finding could indicate a relation between structured brain-gut behavioral therapies, effectiveness outcomes, and attrition rates. Although evidence suggests that adherence and attrition of DHIs do not significantly affect effectiveness outcomes, it could be that effectiveness outcomes from brain-gut behavioral therapies, instead, affect adherence and attrition. However, considering the contrast in effectiveness outcomes between the attrited participants before the eightweek and three-month assessments  [24] , further investigations are needed to fully understand this relationship.\n\nIt should also be noted that most DHIs assessed in this review were developed by the research teams and under short term, controlled environments free from external factors. It is important to consider patients' decision-making in the prolonged use of DHIs in the real-world context, such as motivation, cost, and user system fit,  [74] [75] [76] . Digital health literacy, a skill reflective of patients' sociodemographic factors  [77] , can also pose a barrier for some in understanding or operating DHIs  [78] , and by extension, maintaining their engagement. Thus, interpretations of the influences of attrition using real-world data are complex and multi-faceted. While higher attrition could indicate the intervention's effectiveness and success  [79] , it could, alternatively, be a repercussion of behavioral and sociodemographic factors  [75] .\n\nOur findings on feasibility reflect existing issues of the gap in research-specifically qualitative investigations, realworld longitudinal data, and implementation science-on the utility of DHI for IBS patients in real-world practice. There have been encouraging efforts to explore these topics in research  [80] . However, should these questions remain unaddressed, it will be difficult to ascertain the full extent of the efficacy and application of DHIs, which could have detrimental effects on the clinical value, trust, and uptake of these tools among IBS patients."

      "text": "This review included a rigorous methodology using thorough literature searches, multiple databases, and various MeSH terms for digital health. This specific search strategy is important, given a lack of universal MeSH terms indexing for digital health. In addition to the database search, we screened reference lists of excluded articles to include potentially relevant studies on the topic. Study selection, extraction, and quality assessment were also completed in duplicate. Our results highlight the potential value of DHIs in IBS self-management and the need for future research to further explore how to develop and implement the most effective and feasible DHIs.\n\nThe results of this review should also be interpreted with several limitations in consideration. Study samples may not be representative of the IBS population and thus, results may not be generalizable. Participant eligibility criteria, for example, may be biased toward those interested in health technology, have strong digital literacy and skills, or are proficient in English. Furthermore, the overall safety of the DHIs was not evaluated due to the limited number of studies that have explored this outcome. Aspects of safety include associated risks from inaccurate, conflicting, and inadequate information or response from the intervention. If not addressed, such safety concerns could result in repercussions and harm patients' physical and emotional well-being  [81] .\n\nAlthough DHI features identified in this review aligned with the common aims of GI-specific mHealth apps  [82] , the large heterogeneity among the DHIs restricted our ability to conduct a meta-analysis and resulted in more descriptive findings for this review. Similarly, the heterogeneity in outcome measures requires careful interpretation when making definitive conclusions about the effectiveness of any specific intervention, especially when based on the small number of studies and limited data.\n\nDHIs were designed with multiple features such that it was not possible to compare single-and multi-focused interventions. Comparisons would require exploring potential correlations between intervention features and effectiveness outcomes."

The development and testing stages of the intervention should consider experimental studies with sufficient power and control groups to detect differences between groups and follow-up periods to examine maintenance or sustained use. Based on the current studies, it is unknown whether participants continued using DHIs, to what extent, and how longterm use could impact their outcomes.\n\nAll pertinent parties, including patients, should be at the center of the development and iteration of DHIs. Patient involvement could be achieved through co-designing and user testing; qualitative studies on IBS patient experiences are also valuable in enriching our understanding and improving interventions for future iterations. Studies should also include assessments of safety, cost-effectiveness, use of the healthcare resources (e.g., primary care provider and emergency department visits), and the role of user behavior change and maintenance of behavior to broaden adoption and uptake of DHIs in IBS.\n\nIt is also important to note that digital health technology is an emerging field. Nine studies (69%) included in our review were conducted within the past four years, with the earliest study published in 2011. As more DHIs are developed and evaluated, an increased understanding of their impact will follow. Further research is warranted to examine effect moderators and identify potential mechanisms underlying effective DHIs that could improve patients' selfmanagement practices and overall well-being."

Nevertheless, further research examining DHIs in IBS is warranted to determine which interventions are most acceptable to patients while also demonstrating the effectiveness and sustainability of their use, particularly in a clinical setting."
