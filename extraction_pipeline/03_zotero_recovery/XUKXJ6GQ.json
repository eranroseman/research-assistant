  "title": "Federated Learning with Pareto Optimality for Resource Efficiency and Fast Model Convergence in Mobile Environments \u2020",
  "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) is an emerging distributed learning technique through which models can be trained using the data collected by user devices in resource-constrained situations while protecting user privacy. However, FL has three main limitations: First, the parameter server (PS), which aggregates the local models that are trained using local user data, is typically far from users. The large distance may burden the path links between the PS and local nodes, thereby increasing the consumption of the network and computing resources. Second, user device resources are limited, but this aspect is not considered in the training of the local model and transmission of the model parameters. Third, the PS-side links tend to become highly loaded as the number of participating clients increases. The links become congested owing to the large size of model parameters. In this study, we propose a resource-efficient FL scheme. We follow the Pareto optimality concept with the biased client selection to limit client participation, thereby ensuring efficient resource consumption and rapid model convergence. In addition, we propose a hierarchical structure with location-based clustering for device-to-device communication using k-means clustering. Simulation results show that with prate at 0.75, the proposed scheme effectively reduced transmitted and received network traffic by 75.89% and 78.77%, respectively, compared to the FedAvg method. It also achieves faster model convergence compared to other FL mechanisms, such as FedAvg and D2D-FedAvg.",

The International Data Corporation has predicted that the amount of data generated through Internet of things (IoT) devices will reach 79.4 ZB in 2025  [1] , exceeding the capacities of IoT and mobile devices worldwide  [2] . Most of the data generated by a device are processed locally or in a remote cloud server. However, this process involves three main problems pertaining to the constraints associated with real environments and remote cloud servers  [3] :\n\n1.\n\nNetwork Congestion: network congestion on a remote cloud server occurs when numerous user devices simultaneously send data to the server. 2.\n\nPrivacy Leak: private user experience data may be leaked due to malicious network attacks during transmission."

      "text": "FL is an alternative distributed ML method. FL differs from conventional distributed ML in that it involves an extremely large number of clients with heterogeneous and unbalanced local data distributions. A key task of FL is the generation of learning models using the data collected from clients. These data are stored in local devices, which can help prevent privacy leaks and avoid model divergence due to insufficient data and failure to participate owing to a lack of resources (e.g., wireless channel subcarriers, bandwidth, computing performance, and battery life). The convergence of a learning model and resource consumption in FL exhibit a trade-off relationship. Thus, many researchers have attempted to improve the efficiency of FL by simultaneously optimizing its performance aspects.\n\nFederated averaging (FedAvg)  [11] , which is the most conventional FL mechanism, adjusts the batch size and epochs of federated stochastic gradient descent to average the gradient descent generated from a learning process, thereby significantly reducing the overall number of communication rounds by iterating more local updates on a client device. FedAsync  [12]  is an asynchronous FL mechanism for updating global models, in which the mixing weight is adaptively set as a function of staleness. Notably, in  [11, 12] , experiments were conducted on non-iid data, i.e., data that are not independently and identically distributed. However, a theoretical guarantee could not be realized in a convex optimization setting. In  [13] , convergence guarantee for FedAvg was ensured without the impractical assumptions that the data are iid and all clients are available.\n\nA large number of participating clients in FL may lead to server-side congestion and bottlenecks in aggregating client model parameters. Additionally, a large number of participating clients can affect the model convergence for non-iid data  [13] . By appropriately selecting the participating clients, the above-mentioned problems can be solved, and model convergence can be improved. Unlike FedAvg, in which clients are randomly selected, certain researchers  [14]  considered clients with high loss values and proved that biased client selection is directly related to model convergence. The FedCS FL protocol was developed  [15]  for selecting clients within a deadline to manage the resources of heterogeneous clients. This method employed biased client selection; however, it did not ensure the convergence of models for non-iid and heterogeneous data. Furthermore, stragglers may be present in a mobile communication or IoT environment, which cannot participate in FL because the network connection is not persistent or a client device has shut down. The presence of stragglers may hinder model convergence. Therefore, the FLANP FL framework was proposed  [16]  to alleviate the effect of stragglers by adaptively selecting clients in different communication rounds according to their computation speeds.\n\nFL mechanisms with various structures have been proposed. In the hierarchical FL (HFL) mechanism proposed in  [17] [18] [19] , a client and server communicated through an intermediate medium rather than a direct communication structure. In  [19] , the hierarchical edge federated learning (HED-FL) model enhances traditional FL with a multi-layered edge node architecture for energy-efficient learning. Two heuristic methods were also introduced to assess the effects of static and dynamic round execution across these layers. Moreover, a hierarchical cluster-based structure was developed  [17] , which divided clients into several clusters based on resource constraints. A leader node (LN) was elected, which was similar to an intermediate server. Only the LN directly communicated with a PS. Thus, the bottleneck that may have occurred in the PS was eliminated, and the consumption of communication resources was reduced. Similarly, an edge server was deployed between a PS and the clients  [18] . The edge association problem was solved using an evolutionary game between the clients and the edge server. The communication resource allocation problem between the edge server and PS was solved using a Stackelberg differential game.\n\nD2D and peer-to-peer (P2P) communication has been introduced to reduce the communication overhead for the efficient transmission of model parameters. Certain researchers  [20]  examined a social attribute that was used for k-means clustering in D2D communication. A software-defined networking controller was used for clustering by calculating the social attributes between devices, rather than clustering with an unspecified majority. Other researchers proposed algorithms for D2D communication with resource allocation  [21] , which could efficiently manage resources and interference. Zhang et al.  [22]  proposed a D2D-assisted hierarchical FL scheme to reduce the communication overhead in D2D environments. Semi-decentralized federated edge learning (SD-FEEL)  [23]  proposes a structure that aggregates clients' model parameters and exchanges model parameters with neighboring edge servers, followed by broadcasting the updated models. Two timescale hybrid FL (TT-HF)  [24]  extends the FL architecture through aperiodic local and global model consensus procedures based on D2D communications, proposing a new model of gradient diversity and an adaptive control algorithm. In another framework  [25] , clients communicated with one another without a server for aggregating model parameters in FL. Moreover, topology construction was conducted through deep reinforcement learning for P2P FL  [26] .\n\nThe novelty of our framework lies in the following aspects: In  [22, 24, 25] , they propose FL utilizing D2D communication, and  [23]  forms clusters for aggregating clients' model parameters, similar to our work. However, we have introduced the k-means clustering technique for the formation of D2D communication networks. This approach enables the selection of leader clients located in optimal positions without exceeding the communication distance threshold. By collecting and transmitting model parameters within clusters, it offers an ideal solution to alleviate server-side bottleneck issues. In  [27] , Min-Max Pareto optimization was used to manage the trade-off relationship between the algorithmic fairness and performance inconsistency for each client. FedMGDA+  [28] , which is similar to the framework proposed in  [27] , realizes the multi-objective optimization of robustness, fairness, and accuracy through the Pareto stationary solution. In contrast, we consider that the model performance is proportional to the client's resource consumption. Therefore, we solve the target problem by using the Pareto optimality and considering the trade-off relationship between the model convergence and resource consumption. In this manner, the proposed method is different from those described in  [27, 28] : A comparative analysis of FL methods, including FedPO, is encapsulated in Table  1 , which delineates the distinct communication method, hierarchical architecture, and client selection strategies employed by each technique."

After training, the updated model parameters are sent to a PS. The PS updates a global model by aggregating the model parameters trained by each client and calculating the weighted averages according to the number of data samples of each client. The model is defined as the loss function generated by model parameter vector w as f i (x i , y i , w), where i denotes the input data, x i is a feature, and y i is a label.

      "text": "The Pareto principle, named after Italian economist Vilfredo Pareto, posits that 80% of all outcomes result from 20% of the causes. Originally observed in the early 20th century to describe the unequal distribution of wealth in Italy-where 20% of the population owned 80% of the land. In business, it is often used to focus on the most profitable products or the most engaged customers;\n\nIn the context of FL, we leverage this principle to allow a smaller but more crucial subset of clients to make significant contributions to the model's convergence while also alleviating some communication issues. This principle has shown us that not all clients contribute equally, but it does not offer guidance on how to strike a balance between various factors such as computational power, data quality, and contribution to model accuracy.\n\nThat is where the concept of Pareto optimality, which asserts that a society achieves maximum satisfaction when no individual can be made better off without making another individual worse off  [29] , comes into play. In contrast to the Pareto principle, which highlights inequality in contributions, Pareto optimality provides a framework for making trade-offs among competing objectives.\n\nFor instance, focusing solely on clients with high computational power could expedite the model's convergence but at the cost of underrepresenting clients with lower resources, thereby creating a biased model. Pareto optimality seeks to mitigate this by identifying a set of clients that provides the most balanced trade-off between model accuracy and representational fairness."

More local training or communication rounds for aggregation are required to increase the convergence speed of the model, resulting in the consumption of large amounts of network and computational resources. We use a method  [14]  that selects clients with a high loss value to accelerate model convergence. Specifically, we select the client with the optimal state of model convergence (high loss value) and resources, following Pareto optimality. We assume a two-dimensional Euclidean space R 2 , ordered by a Pareto cone R 2 + , to solve a Pareto optimality point for resources and loss. In addition, we assume that E is a locally convex space, and C E is a convex pointed cone that defines a partial order (\u2265C E ) in E  [29] ."

The groups of LCs are expressed as LeaderClients = {lc 1 , . . . , lc j }. In a cluster, the client whose location is the closest to the centroid is selected as an LC, which acts as an intermediate server for HFL as certain clients are selected. Thus, LCs aggregate the updated model parameters of clients and transmit them to the server. The PS updates the global model using the weighted average of the aggregated model parameters, w LC , received from all LCs. The PS calculates Pareto optimality to select the clients that will participate in the next round of training for the LCs. In addition, in accordance with the Pareto principle, the proposed method involves fewer clients compared with those in conventional FL, thereby ensuring model convergence for heterogeneous data and the efficient transmission of model parameters. The details of the proposed method are presented in the following text. . . , distortion j }, where j does not exceed K/2 as the pairing for D2D communication.

Figure  2  shows the accuracy of biased and unbiased client-selection methods in FL. On the MNIST and FashionMNIST datasets, biased client selection leads to faster model convergence in the initial stage, and its accuracy is higher than that of unbiased client selection. This result can be interpreted considering the Pareto principle: a small number of clients selected through biased client selection can produce sufficient outcomes. Furthermore, we select clients in accordance with the Pareto optimality function based on two criteria: loss value and resource state. Therefore, according to the convergence analysis in  [14] , the loss value is adopted as the criterion for using Pareto optimality for client selection. The other criterion is the state of client resources because all clients have finite network and computational resources in actual environments."

      "text": "Resource Efficiency. The proportion of traffic transmitted and received by the serverside of the trained model is shown in Figure  4a ,b, respectively. The number of participating clients is |K| = 100, iterations are performed for T = 1000 rounds, and the traffic values of FedAvg, D2D-FedAvg, and FedPO are compared. Figure  4a  shows that for FedAvg, the transmission traffic is similar for all prate values, because the model parameters are transmitted to all clients in every round. Furthermore, in the case of D2D-FedAvg, as the number of participating clients in FL increases according to prate, residual clients that cannot participate in the grouping process for D2D communication and thus communicate directly with the PS emerge, leading to slightly higher amounts of transmission traffic compared with those of FedPO. This phenomenon occurs because FedPO has a fixed amount of server-side transmission due to the use of location-based k-means clustering for the clients. The same result can be observed in Figure  4b , which represents the amount of traffic received. In the case of FedAvg, the number of clients sending data to the PS increases as prate increases. In contrast, both D2D-FedAvg and FedPO have an intermediate transmitter (e.g., MUE and LC) in the communication process, resulting in less traffic received by the server. This configuration can partially alleviate the potential bottleneck and delay problems, depending on the amount of data received by the PS. The exact ratios corresponding to Figure  4  are listed in Table  3 . In terms of the transmitted traffic from the server, the results in Table  3  show that D2D-FedAvg and FedPO have lower overhead than FedAvg, which transmits the parameters to all clients. D2D-FedAvg shows a slight increase in overhead with increasing participation rate, with values of 23.57%, 28.05%, and 37.99%. In contrast, FedPO maintains similar levels of overhead for all participation rates, with values of 23.73%, 23.67%, and 24.11%. In terms of the received traffic from the server, both D2D-FedAvg and FedPO exhibit similar overhead as that of FedAvg with a participation rate of 0.75. These results indicate the superiority of D2D-FedAvg and FedPO.\n\n(a) (b)  In FL, the clients play a crucial role in the learning process as they consume both computational and communication resources.

Figures  6  and  7  show the model accuracies of FedAvg, D2D-FedAvg, and FedPO, where the LR and LSTM learning models are trained using the MNIST dataset with prate = 0.25, 0.50, and 0.75. We set a small number of clients (|K| = 20) to clearly demonstrate that biased client selection is superior to unbiased client selection. Figure  6  shows the results of the first 100 rounds out of 1000 rounds to demonstrate the initial convergence with the LR training model. When prate = 0.25, the accuracy of the initial training differs by that T = 100 by 14%. For the remaining values of prate, similar model accuracy is obtained as the number of participating clients increases. Figure  7  shows the accuracy of the LSTM training model for T = 1000 rounds on the MNIST dataset. Unlike that for the LR, the effectiveness of FedPO is considerably higher than those of FedAvg and D2D-FedAvg when prate = 0.25 and 0.50. The results for FashionMNIST are shown in Figure  8 .

Furthermore, although we use Pareto optimality to select clients based on their loss and resource state, a wider range of considerations, such as battery life, connectivity, and computational capabilities of devices in real-world settings, may be considered for client selection.

K-means clustering for D2D communication: Compared with short-distance wireless communication [9], D2D communication effectively reduces resource consumption and network delay. We use D2D communication for transmitting the model parameters, training loss, and resource state of clients to the LCs for HFL. The PS builds an intranetwork for D2D communication using k-means clustering, based on the locations of clients. distortion j is the average communication distance between intraclients according to the number of clusters j: Distortion = {distortion 1 , .. . , distortion j }, where j does not exceed K/2 as the pairing for D2D communication.

The amounts of resources consumed and remaining for each client after each round represent important criteria for client participation and selection in the next round. To analyze the effect of different FL methods on the resource states of the clients, Figure 5 shows the sum of the remaining resources of clients in each round. We compare FedPO with FedAvg as both D2D-FedAvg and FedAvg have similar algorithms and resource consumption levels. FedPO outperforms FedAvg in terms of the resource conservation of clients. This phenomenon occurs owing to the Pareto optimality-based client selection method used in FedPO, which takes into account the client's available resources and loss during training. Consequently, FedPO selects those clients who will participate in FL without compromising their resources and model convergence and increases the remaining resources of the clients."

K-means clustering for D2D communication: Compared with short-distance wireless communication [9], D2D communication effectively reduces resource consumption and network delay. We use D2D communication for transmitting the model parameters, training loss, and resource state of clients to the LCs for HFL. The PS builds an intranetwork for D2D communication using k-means clustering, based on the locations of clients. distortion j is the average communication distance between intraclients according to the number of clusters j: Distortion = {distortion 1 , .. . , distortion j }, where j does not exceed K/2 as the pairing for D2D communication. Additionally, we consider that at least two clients exist in each cluster.

The amounts of resources consumed and remaining for each client after each round represent important criteria for client participation and selection in the next round. To analyze the effect of different FL methods on the resource states of the clients, Figure 5 shows the sum of the remaining resources of clients in each round. We compare FedPO with FedAvg as both D2D-FedAvg and FedAvg have similar algorithms and resource consumption levels. FedPO outperforms FedAvg in terms of the resource conservation of clients. This phenomenon occurs owing to the Pareto optimality-based client selection method used in FedPO, which takes into account the client's available resources and loss during training. Consequently, FedPO selects those clients who will participate in FL without compromising their resources and model convergence and increases the remaining resources of the clients."
