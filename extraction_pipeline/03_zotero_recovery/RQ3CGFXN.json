  "abstract": "Background Access to mobile phones continues to increase exponentially globally, outstripping access to fixed telephone lines, fixed computers and the Internet. Mobile phones are an appropriate and effective option for the delivery of smoking cessation support in some contexts. This review updates the evidence on the effectiveness of mobile phone-based smoking cessation interventions. \n Objectives To determine whether mobile phone-based smoking cessation interventions increase smoking cessation in people who smoke and want to quit. \n Search methods For the most recent update, we searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group Specialised Register in April 2015. We also searched the UK Clinical Research Network Portfolio for current projects in the UK, and the ClinicalTrials.gov register for ongoing or recently completed studies. We searched through the reference lists of identified studies and attempted to contact the authors of ongoing studies. We applied no restrictions on language or publication date. \n Selection criteria We included randomised or quasi-randomised trials. Participants were smokers of any age who wanted to quit. Studies were those examining any type of mobile phone-based intervention for smoking cessation. This included any intervention aimed at mobile phone users, based around delivery via mobile phone, and using any functions or applications that can be used or sent via a mobile phone. \n Data collection and analysis Review authors extracted information on risk of bias and methodological details using a standardised form. We considered participants who dropped out of the trials or were lost to follow-up to be smoking. We calculated risk ratios (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) for each included study. Meta-analysis of the included studies used the Mantel-Haenszel fixed-effect method. Where meta-analysis was not possible, we presented a narrative summary and descriptive statistics. 1 Mobile phone-based interventions for smoking cessation (Review)",

      "text": "This updated search identified 12 studies with six-month smoking cessation outcomes, including seven studies completed since the previous review. The interventions were predominantly text messaging-based, although several paired text messaging with in-person visits or initial assessments. Two studies gave pre-paid mobile phones to low-income human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive populations -one solely for phone counselling, the other also included text messaging. One study used text messages to link to video messages. Control programmes varied widely. Studies were pooled according to outcomes -some providing measures of continuous abstinence or repeated measures of point prevalence; others only providing 7-day point prevalence abstinence. All 12 studies pooled using their most rigorous 26-week measures of abstinence provided an RR of 1.67 (95% CI 1.46 to 1.90; I 2 = 59%). Six studies verified quitting biochemically at six months (RR 1.83; 95% CI 1.54 to 2.19)."

      "title": "Authors' conclusions",
      "text": "The current evidence supports a beneficial impact of mobile phone-based smoking cessation interventions on six-month cessation outcomes. While all studies were good quality, the fact that those studies with biochemical verification of quitting status demonstrated an even higher chance of quitting further supports the positive findings. However, it should be noted that most included studies were of text message interventions in high-income countries with good tobacco control policies. Therefore, caution should be taken in generalising these results outside of this type of intervention and context."

      "text": "This is the second update of a review of the evidence on the effectiveness of mobile phone-delivered smoking cessation support. Since the previous review, the use of mobile phones globally has continued to increase at an exponential rate, far exceeding access to the Internet or fixed telephone lines in many regions. The International Telecommunications Union (ITU) estimated that there were more than seven billion mobile phone subscriptions in 2015; approximately 96.8 per 100 inhabitants, ranging from 120.6/100 in high-income countries to 91.8/100 in low-income countries.\n\nAccess to mobile broadband is also growing fast, with an estimated 47% of the world's population subscribing to mobile broadband, compared with the 29% who have fixed broadband subscriptions  (ITU 2015) . The smartphone (mobile phone with a computer operating system) is fast becoming the computer of choice, or at least the most accessible computer, in many countries. It is reported that about 45% of global mobile phone subscriptions are associated with smartphones and that, with 75% of new sales of mobile phones being smartphones, this will continue to increase  (Ericsson 2015) .\n\nMobile phones are increasingly useful in health information and healthcare delivery around the world. Text messaging has been used for health service appointment reminders, preventive activities and medication adherence (Free 2013). Mobile phones have also been used in monitoring and the self management of chronic disorders such as diabetes (Holtz 2012). In addition, smartphone applications for health and wellness are proliferating, although there is little published research in this area (Abroms 2011).\n\nSmoking cessation services internationally are using mobile phones to deliver support, particularly as adjuncts to other services. In 2014, the UK's National Health Service rolled out text messaging integrated into routine clinical practice and in 2013 almost half of US quitlines offered text messaging in addition to phone counselling services  (Abroms 2015) . The potential benefits of mobile phone-based smoking cessation interventions include: the ease of use anywhere at anytime; cost-effective delivery and scalability to large populations, regardless of location; the ability to tailor messages to key user characteristics (such as age, sex, ethnicity); the ability to send time-sensitive messages with an 'always on' device; the provision of content that can distract the user from cravings; and the ability to link the user with others for social support.\n\nIt is likely that the use of mobile phones for smoking cessation will continue to grow as they become even more ubiquitous and as technological advances increase the number of applications and functions available. While mobile technology continues to change, it is important to review the body of research on interventions using mobile phones regularly to support people to stop smoking. This is particularly so, given the exponential increase in access to mobile phones in high-income countries  (ITU 2015) , where the burden of tobacco-related morbidity and mortality is predicted to be greatest (Jha 2014)."

For this update of our review, the literature search identified 37 new studies. Many were unrelated and were immediately excluded, leaving 21 potentially relevant papers. Some of these were not focused around delivery via mobile phone  (Fraser 2014; Mehring 2014; Peng 2013; Skov-Ettrup 2013; Stanczyk 2014) ; one was not randomised  (Pechmann 2015) ; one was a pilot study with only two-month follow-up ( Bricker 2014); four only followed participants up to three-months  (Buller 2014; Mehring 2014; Shi 2013; Vilaplana 2014) ; one was investigating gradual reduction of smoking in pregnant women, rather than quitting (Pollak 2013); and one compared tailored with untailored text messages (Skov-Ettrup 2014) (see Discussion). Approaching authors of ongoing studies revealed several that were in the process of being finalised or submitted for publication. We were able to get data directly from the authors of five studies -two of which we included  (Ferguson 2015; Shelley 2015) ; however, one study was not eligible, with only three months' follow-up (Jordan 2015), and a further two were focused on cardiovascular disease secondary prevention rather than smoking cessation (Chow 2012; Dale 2014). Details of excluded and ongoing studies can be found in the Characteristics of excluded studies and Characteristics of ongoing studies tables. In this update, our literature search identified seven new randomised controlled trials (RCT) with six-month outcomes  ( Abroms 2014; Bock 2013; Ferguson 2015; Gritz 2013; Haug 2013; Naughton 2014; Shelley 2015) ."

      "text": "Almost all of the included trials used text messaging (SMS) as a central component of the intervention. A major exception to this was Gritz 2013 who gave pre-paid mobile phones to participants, which were used to provide cognitive behavioural and motivational counselling, and access to a reactive telephone helpline. The intervention was based on US guidelines around cognitive-behavioural and motivational interviewing techniques over the mobile phone  (Fiore 2008) . Shelley 2015 also gave mobile phones to participants in a three-arm trial comparing standard pharmacotherapy, with pharmacotherapy plus text messages, and with pharmacotherapy plus text messages and phone counselling. We included this as the pre-paid mobile phone was specifically provided as part of the study to facilitate the interventions (indicating it could not have been delivered without the mobile phone), and this was very similar in concept to the Gritz 2013 study. Whittaker 2011 sent SMS containing links to theoretically driven video messages from 'ordinary' role models coping with quitting.\n\nSeveral studies paired SMS with in-person visits or assessments  (Bock 2013; Gritz 2013 , Haug 2013; Naughton 2014; Shelley 2015) . The remainder were purely text messaging interventions  (Abroms 2014; Borland 2013; Ferguson 2015; Free 2009; Free 2011; Rodgers 2005; Whittaker 2011) . Many of the studies stated that their interventions were theory based  (Abroms 2014; Bock 2013; Gritz 2013; Naughton 2014; Whittaker 2011; Haug 2009) . In Haug 2013, the intervention was said to be based on cognitive behavioural components, stages of change and the social norms approach, with an online assessment that allowed tailoring based on stage of change and other baseline data.\n\nBock 2013 conducted an initial counselling session then randomised participants to an eight-week intervention based on national guidelines, social cognitive theory and the stages of change. The programme was tailored to stage of readiness, starting with either 'not ready' or 'prepared to quit', that could change according to text message questions and answers. There were also ondemand components. The text messaging intervention in Rodgers 2005 was developed in New Zealand, and later adapted for the UK and tested in a pilot study  (Free 2009) , and then a large randomised controlled study  (Free 2011) . Messages commenced prior to quitting and were based on effective brief interventions including quitting advice and motivational messages. Interactive components included the ability to text in for more support (in the instance of cravings or lapses) and an optional Quit Buddy in Rodgers 2005. A cost-effectiveness analysis was also conducted as part of the Free 2011 trial (Guerriero 2013). This showed that the cost of textbased support per 1000 enrolled smokers was GBP278 per quitter. When the future health service costs saved (as a result of reduced smoking) were included, text-based support was considered to be cost saving, with 0.5 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained per quitter. In Borland 2013, participants received offers of support via a personalised tailored Internet programme, an SMS programme, both programmes, a choice of all three or a minimal control. The SMS programme provided advice on strategy and motivational messages relevant to their stage of readiness for quitting, plus messages on demand. For the purposes of meta-analyses, we compared the SMS group with the control group. In Naughton 2014, the intervention group received the 'usual care' received by the control group (described below), as well as a fourpage tailored advice report and a tailored theoretically based SMS message programme for 90 days, with interactive components (i.e. they could text for help when in difficult situations, or if they had lapsed)."

This support included setting a quit date within 14 days, a prescription for pharmacotherapy, the opportunity for multiple follow-up visits and routine measurement of carbon monoxide (CO) in expired breath."

      "title": "Context and participants",
      "text": "The settings and recruitment methods, and therefore the participants, varied considerably across studies. Two studies targeted young people  (Haug 2009; Whittaker 2011) . Bock 2013 found usual in-person recruitment methods slow and shifted to online recruitment methods during the study. Borland 2013 and Abroms 2014 also used online recruitment via Internet advertisements. In Abroms 2014, this initially led to some fraudulent participants who were discovered and disqualified, and extra procedures were put in place to prevent this from happening again. Naughton 2014 was set in primary care practices in the UK with trained smoking cessation advisors providing smoking cessation advice. The Gritz 2013 study recruited in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive, multi-ethnic, low-income population. Participants in this study were 76% African American, 79% unemployed, with high levels of depression and other alcohol/ drug problems. Shelley 2015 similarly recruited from urban HIV clinics in a different region of the US.\n\nHaug 2013 recruited in vocational schools and differed from the other studies by allowing the inclusion of occasional smokers (at least four cigarettes in the past month or at least one in the preceding week). All other studies used a definition related to daily smoking. Where recorded, participants in most of the studies had similar degrees of nicotine dependence, although in Whittaker 2011, the 'Hooked on Nicotine Checklist' mean scores of 8 indicated a more highly addicted group  (Wellman 2006) . Participants in three trials were younger (mean age 18.2 years in  Haug 2013, 22  years in Rodgers 2005, and 27 years in Whittaker 2011) than in the other trials (means ranged from 30.7 years in Bock 2013 to 44.8 years in Gritz 2013). Most trials had slightly more women than men, with the exception of Gritz 2013 with 70% male participants. The Characteristics of included studies table gives further details on the included studies."

      "title": "Risk of bias in included studies",
      "text": "Randomisation was adequate in all trials. Haug 2013 was the only cluster randomised trial, and recruited via vocational schools. The vocational school class was the unit of randomisation, stratified by school and with randomly permuted blocks of four cases. In all trials except for Borland 2013, participants were not blinded to treatment assignment, although research staff were blind to allocation at follow-up data collection. As seen in Figure  1 , all trials but Rodgers 2005 were at low risk of bias in all domains. In Rodgers 2005, incentives for providing final follow-up data differed between groups -one month of free text messaging was received by the control group on completion of follow-up whereas the intervention group had already received their month of free text messaging from their Quit Day and did not receive a further incentive at follow-up. This may have caused the differential loss to follow-up seen at six months (69.4% providing data at six months in the active group compared with 79% in the control group), which in turn may have affected the long-term results of this study. The authors also suggested that some participants in the control group may have thought their month of free text messaging depended on reporting quitting. This could account for an unexpected increase in control group participants reporting quitting from six weeks (109 participants) to six months (202 participants reporting no smoking in the past seven days). Both of these elements may have potentially led to an underestimation of the effect of the intervention. Two papers stated that they had difficulty recruiting their target sample size  (Haug 2013; Whittaker 2011) . Both targeted a younger population and, as a result, did not recruit their target sample size. All studies presented long-term outcomes at six months, either as self reported point prevalence (no smoking in past seven to 28 days) or repeated measures of point prevalence abstinence ( Abroms 2014; Bock 2013; Gritz 2013) (or both), or continuous abstinence, defined as no smoking since quit day, but with up to three lapses (Rodgers 2005), or five cigarettes (Free 2009; Free 2011; Whittaker 2011), allowed. Seven of the trials sought biochemical verification of self reported six-month abstinence with salivary cotinine (Abroms 2014; Free 2009; Free 2011; Gritz 2013; Rodgers 2005) or expired CO (Ferguson 2015; Shelley 2015). Those reporting response rates for verification varied from 39% in Rodgers 2005 to 92% in Free 2011, with little difference between intervention and control groups within studies. Of those participants that were tested, 76% in Abroms 2014 and 72% in Free 2011 were verified as abstinent. The proportion was lower in Rodgers 2005 (55% in the intervention group and 33.3% in the control group) and Free 2009 (53% (8/15) in the intervention group and 40% (6/15) in the control group). Naughton 2014 also verified quitting but only at fourweek and not at six-month follow-up. All trials conducted ITT analyses, where participants with missing data were assumed to be smokers. Any differential loss to followup by group can create potential bias when all are inferred to be smokers. Sensitivity analyses were used to test the effects of other potential reasons for drop out. Free 2011 and Haug 2013 used multiple imputation, by using the observed predictors of outcomes and the predictors of loss to follow-up to impute missing outcome data. A further potential source of bias could be any differential use of other cessation interventions. In Borland 2013, where use of the studied interventions was low, it is possible that participants were motivated to try other cessation programmes. The Characteristics of included studies table provides details of risk of bias judgements for each domain of each included study. Figure 1 illustrates judgements for each included study."

      "text": "See: Summary of findings for the main comparison Mobile phone-based interventions for smoking cessation Standard ITT analyses are presented here, with all participants lost to follow-up counted as continuing smokers. This may differ from how results were presented by the individual studies due to variations in primary outcomes and in analytic methods used. For example, Free 2011 used multiple imputation by chained equations, and the Bock 2013 paper reported a significant main effect of a two (treatment groups) x three (time points) generalised estimating equations (GEE) repeated measures analysis with higher odds of point prevalence abstinence compared with a control group (odds ratio (OR) 4.52, 95% CI 1.24 to 16.53). However, individual time point comparisons did not show significant differences. Although Naughton 2014 did not find a significant difference in their primary outcome (of two-week point prevalence) at eight weeks (45.2% with intervention programme versus 40.3% with control programme; OR 1.22, 95% CI 0.88 to 1.69), by six months there was an effect on self reported prolonged abstinence (15.1% with intervention programme versus 8.9% with control intervention; OR 1.81, 95% CI 1.09 to 3.01) and using a continuous abstinence measure that included outcomes at four weeks, eight weeks and six months (11.4% with intervention programme versus 6.3% with control programme; OR 1.92, 95% CI 1.07 to 3.45).\n\nWe undertook meta-analyses on the 12 included studies  (Abroms 2014; Bock 2013; Borland 2013; Ferguson 2015; Free 2009; Free 2011; Gritz 2013; Haug 2013; Naughton 2014; Rodgers 2005; Shelley 2015; Whittaker 2011) . First, we pooled all 12 studies using their most rigorous 26-week measures of abstinence, giving an RR of 1.67 (95% CI 1.46 to 1.90; 12 studies; 11,885 participants; I 2 = 59%) (Analysis 1.1; Figure  2 ). Both the Free 2009 pilot study and the Whittaker 2011 study were underpowered and individually did not find an effect. When we removed these two studies from the analysis, the results produced an RR of 1.81 (95% CI 1.57 to 2.09; I 2 = 32%; 10 studies; 11,459 participants). In addition, we carried out this main analysis, removing Haug 2013, to see if the result was sensitive to the inclusion of this cluster randomised controlled trial. However, this had very little impact on the result (RR 1.69, 95% CI 1.47 to 1.94; I 2 = 62%; 11 studies; 11,130 participants). Due to the amount of heterogeneity detected, we also made a post-hoc decision to re-calculate the main analysis using a random-effects model. This resulted in an RR of 1.42 (95% CI 1.11 to 1.83; 12 studies; 11,885 participants), and therefore none of the adjustments had an impact on the interpretation of the results, and none of the sensitivity analyses accounted for the majority of the heterogeneity."

The first systematic review in 2009 showed short-term benefits, but found no long-term effects, of mobile phone-only interventions.\n\nThe second update, with five studies, showed an overall longterm benefit of mobile phone interventions for smoking cessation, though there was a high level of statistical heterogeneity in the pooled result. This update of 12 studies also suggested a positive effect of mobile phone interventions on smoking cessation at six months in comparison with 'usual care', although there was still significant unexplained heterogeneity. Our findings appeared to have been strengthened by the highest quality studies, that is, those studies using stricter outcome definitions, including biochemical verification. The benefits were large, and similar in size to those seen using of other effective treatments such as nicotine replacement therapy (Stead 2012)."

      "title": "Overall completeness and applicability of evidence",
      "text": "Our review currently includes 12 studies with 11,885 participants.\n\nThere has been a steady increase in the number of studies eligible for this review over time. All of the studies included were conducted in high-income countries with mature tobacco control policies; although two studies specifically recruited from low-income populations  (Gritz 2013; Shelley 2015) . This means that it is possible that text messaging interventions may not be appropriate or effective in other contexts, or alternatively they may be even more effective in those settings where cessation information and support is relatively new. Clearly there is a major gap in the current evidence. We also found 25 ongoing studies. As the body of evidence supporting the effectiveness of text messaging in high-income countries grows, it is hoped that some of these are being conducted in other contexts or with different populations. It is interesting to note that there were no trials of smartphone 'app'-based interventions that met our eligibility criteria despite the proliferation of available cessation apps. In 2011, one review of available smoking cessation apps found them to be lacking in adherence to cessation guidelines or theory (Abroms 2011).\n\nThere is as yet little research into the different functional components, message content, mediators and moderators of mobile phone programmes, in order to learn what type of programmes work best for whom. Skov-Ettrup 2014 conducted a study, based on an ongoing online programme, of untailored messages compared with tailored messages. Participants were randomised first and then offered text messages on top of the online programme.\n\nOverall, there was no significant difference between groups in long-term quit rates; however, when restricted to only those who chose to receive the text messages, there was an effect of tailored over untailored messages (OR 1.45, 95% CI 1.01 to 2.08; 1,809 participants). As the tailored messages were also more frequent, it is not clear whether this effect was due to intensity, tailoring or both."

      "title": "Quality of the evidence",
      "text": "The studies included varied in size from 60 to 5800 participants, but were generally all of a reasonable quality with a low risk of bias. They were all randomised controlled trials, with one cluster randomised trial (the result of analyses were not sensitive to removal if this study), and with similar outcomes measures. Substantial heterogeneity was detected across analyses; however, a post hoc decision to conduct the main analysis using a random-effects model resulted in no difference in the interpretation of findings.\n\nHalf of the included studies attempted to biochemically verify self reported quitting outcomes. When we pooled these studies separately, the result was similar, if not more strongly in favour of the intervention.\n\nTwo studies reported that they were unable to recruit their target sample sizes, both of which were targeting a younger population  (Haug 2013; Whittaker 2011) . Both studies found no statistically significant effect of the intervention, but were reported to be slightly underpowered. More research is needed in young adults to determine the acceptability and effectiveness of mobile phone based interventions. Overall, we are moderately confident in the main effect estimate generated through our analysis (Summary of findings for the main comparison)."

It is not yet clear whether this translates to other contexts, such as low-or middle-income countries, and younger people; however, many are proceeding to implement such programmes anyway. High-quality evaluations of these implemented programmes will be valuable."

There is also a lack of research into the effectiveness of individual components of programmes, in order to determine what works best for whom. There does not appear to be any rigorous trials of smartphone-based programmes published as yet. Due to their widespread availability, it would be useful to know if the broader functionality available in apps can be harnessed effectively to support cessation."

Intervention included motivational messages and behaviour-change techniques.\n\nThe programme was also personalised with an algorithm based on demographic and other information gathered at baseline, such as smoker's concerns about weight gain after quitting. The core programme consisted of 186 messages and the personalised messages were selected from a database of 713 messages. For instance, by texting the word \"lapse\", participants received a series of 3 text messages that encouraged them to continue with their quit attempt. Participants could also request the mobile phone number of another trial participant so that they could text each other for support. Participants in the intervention group using pay-as-you-go mobile phone schemes were given a \u00a320 top-up voucher to provide sufficient credit to participate in the intervention Control: fortnightly, simple, short, text messages related to the importance of trial participation"

The control group did not receive anything else Outcomes Primary outcome: 7-day point prevalence smoking abstinence at 6 months Secondary outcomes: 4-week point prevalence smoking abstinence, the number of cigarettes smoked/day, stage of change and number of attempts to quit smoking Notes The study did not reach the target sample size of 910 participants due to smaller class size than expected and time restrictions.

Primary care practices were those that had smoking cessation advisors (primary care nurses or healthcare assistants) providing level 2 cessation advice. Participants were self referred or referred by a health professional. 47% men, mean age 41. 8 years (range 18-75 years), able to read English and provide written informed consent, Naughton 2014 (Continued) with a mobile phone and familiar with sending and receiving text messages and not enrolled in another formal smoking cessation study or other cessation programme Interventions Intervention: usual care plus a tailored advice report and a 90-day programme of tailored text messages generated by the iQuit system (number of messages sent each day varied from 0 to 2, mean/day over 90 days 1.2). The messages were designed to advise smokers on their quit attempt, provide information about the consequences of smoking and expectations for quitting, provide encouragement, boost self efficacy, maintain motivation to quit and remind smokers how to cope with difficult situations Control: 'usual care' consisted of routine 'level 2' smoking cessation advice delivered by smoking cessation adviser. This included a brief discussion about smoking habits and history, measurement of expired-air CO, brief advice to quit, setting a QD within the next 14 days, options for pharmacotherapy, a prescription and arranging a follow-up visit. Usually the opportunity for multiple follow-up visits was offered Outcomes Primary outcome: self reported 2-week point prevalence abstinence at 8 weeks Secondary outcomes: CO-verified abstinence at 4-week for at least 2 weeks, assessed by a smoking cessation adviser (a CO reading assessed 25-42 days from QD that was < 10 ppm), self reported 3-month prolonged abstinence at 6 months, 6-month prolonged abstinence at 6-month follow-up and a strict continuous abstinence measure using all outcome time points: CO-validated 2-week point prevalence abstinence at 4 weeks, 4week point prevalence abstinence at 8 weeks and 6-month prolonged abstinence at 6 months Notes Outcomes used in this meta-analysis were self reported.

Participant nominated QD and received regular personalised text messages with advice, support and distraction, with a countdown to QD, intensive 4 weeks of 5 or 6 messages/day then maintenance phase of 1 message/2 weeks. Messages selected from database matched to participant characteristics. Free month of text messaging from QD. Optional Quit Buddy and Text Crave (messages on demand). Interactive polls and quizzes Control: 1 text message/fortnight Outcomes Primary outcome: point prevalence abstinence (no smoking in past 7 days) at 6 weeks' post-randomisation (approximates 4 weeks post-QD).

Possibly due to incentive being offered to control group for follow-up, may in turn have affected long-term results of study (by underestimating effect) Other bias High risk The authors suggested that some participants in the control group may have thought their incentive at follow-up (month of free text messaging) depended on reporting quitting. This could account for an unexpected increase in control group participants reporting quitting from 6 weeks (109 participants) to 6 months (202 participants reporting no smoking in the past 7 Rodgers 2005 (Continued) days), which could have led to an underestimation of the effect of the intervention Shelley 2015 Methods 3-arm RCT in US Participants Participants aged \u2265 18 years recruited from large urban HIV clinics in the USA Inclusion criteria: current patient of the clinics, current or regular smoker (\u2265 5 cigarettes/ day), CO \u2265 8 ppm, willing to set a QD within the next 2 weeks, willing to use a mobile phone and able to read text messages, and eligible to take varenicline Exclusion criteria: alcohol dependence and active drug abuse, and conditions that would prevent the use of varenicline Interventions Intervention: participants received standard care (see below) and 2 text messages/day for 12 weeks. 1 message reminding them to take their medication and 1 motivational message regarding cessation Control group: received standard care, which consisted of a self help information sheet, tailored to HIV-positive smokers and an offer of varenicline for 12 weeks according to the standard dosage schedule. Participants needed to return to the clinic each 4 weeks to receive further medication. All participants were provided with a pre-paid mobile phone -the control group received phones to facilitate their ability to call the quit line and receive text message appointment reminders only A third arm received standard care, text messages, plus behavioural therapy delivered via 7 proactive mobile phone-delivered counselling sessions over a 6-week period. These combined cognitive behavioural therapy and motivational interviewing techniques Outcomes Primary outcome: 7-day point prevalence abstinence verified by CO < 8 ppm at 24 weeks, also measured at 1, 4, 8 and 12 weeks Notes Unpublished -we did not have the participant characteristics tables Risk of bias Bias Authors' judgement Support for judgement Random sequence generation (selection bias) Low risk Computer-generated randomisation schedule, stratified by people smoking 5-10 and people smoking > 10 cigarettes/day Allocation concealment (selection bias) Low risk After consent and baseline data collected, the research assistant called to receive the assignment Blinding (performance bias and detection bias) All outcomes Unclear risk Participants self complete questionnaires through audio computer-assisted self interviewing Shelley 2015 (Continued) Incomplete outcome data (attrition bias) All outcomes Unclear risk 21 participants in the control group, 19 in the text message group (and 24 in the text message + phone counselling group) did not complete 24-week follow-up visits.

Advertising particularly targeted young adults. 47% female, 24% Maori (indigenous population), mean age 27 years and appeared to be highly addicted due to the Hooked on Nicotine Checklist mean scores of 8 (SD 1.9) out of 10 Interventions Intervention group: received an automated package of video and text messages over 6 months that was tailored to self selected quit date, role model and timing of messages.\n\nVideo messages were video diary-style from a selected 'ordinary' person going through a quit attempt in advance of the participant. Frequency of messages varied from 1/day in the lead up to QD, 2/day from QD for 4 weeks, then reducing to 1 every 2 days for 2 weeks and then 1 every 4 days for about 20 weeks until 6 months after randomisation. Extra messages were available on demand to beat cravings and address lapses. Additional website for intervention group participants to review video messages they had been sent (and rate them if desired), change their selected time periods and change (or add to) their selected role model Control: also set a QD and received a general health video message sent to their phone every 2 weeks Outcomes Self reported continuous abstinence -no more than 5 cigarettes smoked since the start of the abstinence period at 6 months of follow-up"
