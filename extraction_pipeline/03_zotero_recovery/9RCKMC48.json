Segre B y the time \"Mia\" found her way to the resident director's office at the end of her first semester, it was too late: she had decided to leave the university. As her resident director listened, Mia explained that she had switched rooms early in the semester because no one on her floor would eat with her. However, students on her new floor had already formed friendships in the first few weeks, and she never quite felt like she belonged. Although the resident director tried to persuade her to give the university one more chance, Mia had decided to drop out; she was going back home to rethink what she wanted to do.\n\nMia's story will likely feel familiar to practitioners who work daily with college students. Stories of student isolation have captured the attention of popular media, from viral stories of loneliness (e.g., Bauer-Wolf, 2017) to offers of advice for students (e.g.,  Bergmann, 2018; Cohan, 2017) , or for parents (e.g.,  Nesbit, 2016) . Faculty and student affairs staff witness firsthand both the excitement and the nervousness that new students carry with them when they set foot on campus. We know how important it is in those early weeks for incoming students to make friends and find places where they feel like they belong.\n\nA great deal of campus energy is invested in welcoming each new cohort of students and planning events to facilitate a sense of belonging. Resident advisors take time to meet each member of their floor, hold meetings, and coordinate trips to the dining hall. Yet, while some students quickly find their way, others struggle with the transition. Staff make every effort to identify and intervene with these students, but sometimes-as in Mia's case-they fall through the cracks.\n\nSocial connectedness is a critical factor in student retention  (Braxton, 2000; Mayhew, Rockenbach, Bowman, Seifert, & Wolniak, 2016; Melguizo, 2011) , and colleges and universities have a vested interest in identifying and providing assistance as early as possible when students are struggling to fit in. Much of this is accomplished through networks of staff and faculty who watch for struggling students, but institutions are increasingly turning to \"early alert\" survey systems, such as Mapworks  (Skyfactor, 2016) , to better predict who might need additional support. These tools gather a wealth of important information, but they also require significant investments of student time to complete"

      "text": "\u2022 Colleges and universities are increasingly turning to \"early alert systems\" that use surveys and institutional data to identify students who might be struggling to adjust to college.\n\n\u2022 A new measure called the meal-index (m-index) uses dining hall swipe data to estimate social connectedness, which plays a critical role in adjustment.\n\n\u2022 The m-index is strongly and positively associated with retention and graduation outcomes; this relationship occurs even when using data from just the first week of the first semester.\n\n\u2022 The link between students' dining patterns and graduation outcomes is consistent for many different student groups, with some variation by race and international status.\n\n\u2022 These results suggest implications for using data that are commonly gathered but often underexplored as a predictor of student outcomes.\n\nsurveys and staff time in gathering, analyzing, and following up on students' responses. Whether an institution develops its own assessment or uses one of the available products on the market, a substantial investment of financial resources is often required in adopting a formal early alert system.\n\nIn responding to this issue at the University of Iowa, we sought an alternative measure that could be calculated easily, inexpensively, and shortly after students begin their first semester. We ultimately drew on information that is readily available at many colleges and universities: meal swipes into the dining hall. This swipe card database contains information about exactly when and where students ate every on-campus meal, which we can examine to identify students who entered the same dining hall in close proximity to each other.\n\nWe used this data to construct a measure called the meal index (or m-index) that provides a measure of social connectedness over a defined period of time (e.g., the first week of term, halfway through the term). We examined m-indices assessed at several points in time and found that we could predict retention and even graduation with an m-index measured as early as the first week of classes  (Bowman, Jarratt, Polgreen, Kruckeberg, & Segre, 2019) , thereby making it a useful tool for campuses working to improve supports for student retention."

      "title": "What is the m-Index?",
      "text": "Simply put, the m-index provides an overview of a student's social connectedness. It represents a combination of the breadth of that student's potential social network and how frequently they engage with each person in their network. Using data from meal swipes in the dining hall, the m-index comprises an estimate of the number of dining partners a student has, based on swiping into the dining hall within a short timeframe of one another and the number of times the student has done so with each of those partners.\n\nSuppose we wanted to construct an m-index for Mia, the student from the beginning of this article. We would start by looking at all the times she used her meal card to eat in the dining hall. For each time she swiped, we would then figure out which other students swiped within a short timeframe of Mia at the same dining hall. Each of these students would be \"paired\" with Mia in our data as a possible dining partner. Once these pairs were identified, we would calculate how many times Mia was paired up with each of these other students.\n\nSo, what exactly counts as a \"short timeframe\"? A narrow window makes it less likely that we include students who just happen to show up around the same time as presumed dining partners. However, a smaller window also means that we are more likely to miss students who decided to meet at the dining hall but did not walk over together; using a larger window reduces this concern. We have found that the relationship between a student's m-index and their retention/ graduation tends to be similar regardless of this decision about length of time, but we would recommend testing different windows to determine whether one approach is most effective for predicting student success.\n\nThese calculations form the basis of the m-index. Once all the possible pairs and the number of possible dining encounters have been identified for a student, we then look at the information in the aggregate. Students can be arranged from those who have \"shared\" the most meals with Mia to those who have \"shared\" the least. The goal is to identify the maximum number of pairs (m) with whom Mia swiped at least m times.\n\nThe calculation of the m-index may be easiest to understand through some examples. Table  1  shows several different scenarios in which we have constructed an m-index for Mia.\n\nIn the first column, Mia swiped in proximity with one person three times and another person two times; other potential dining partners only swiped at the same time as Mia once each. In this example, Mia's m-index is 2, because she appears to have eaten at least two times with two people. The second example is the most basic: three people each swiped around the same time as Mia on three occasions, and another person did so fewer than three times. As a result, Mia has an m-index of three in this example. The last example shows that the number of times you swipe with your most frequent potential dining partner does not affect the m-index; in this scenario, the result is the same whether you have had 4, 20, or 40 meals with that person. She still has an m-index of three, because she has swiped at least three times with three people. To attain an m-index of four, Mia would need to have swiped with four people at least four times each, which would require additional swipes with at least two more students."

      "title": "What the m-Index Tells Us (and What It Does Not)",
      "text": "Although this measure can provide such an early indication of students' social connectedness, a few limitations should be noted. The m-index provides an overview of a particular period of time; like a photograph, not all of the information is included within the frame. For example, students may have off-campus friendships that are not at all reflected in the m-index. Moreover, students who do live on campus may eat with one another outside of the dining hall, which would not be reflected within their swipe card data. And a habit of dining together does not necessarily equate to close, intimate friendship. Therefore, it is important to think of the m-index as a proxy, an indirect measure of a student's social network. That indicator can be brought into conversation with other institutional data for more holistic understanding of student experiences and needs and, therefore, more comprehensive support strategies.\n\nWe also recognize that the m-index is only one possible metric that can be created from dining hall swipe-card data. As noted above, this combination of the breadth and frequency of engagement with a student's social network may not capture one or two very strong relationships. Therefore, to understand the m-index's usefulness, we compared the results from the m-index to two other possible measures from these data: (a) the total number of campus meals eaten, and (b) the number of campus meals eaten with students' most frequent dining partner. This first alternative measure is important, because students who eat more meals are likely on campus more often, so this may provide another indicator of belonging and social connectedness. On the other hand, the second alternative measure indicates that a student may be very close with someone, and the strength of that single friendship may serve to bolster retention.\n\nWhen we examined these alternative dining measures individually, we found that they were both related to greater retention and graduation. However, when we placed either of these measures in the same analysis as the m-index, we found that the m-index was the stronger predictor by far. In many cases, the alternative measure (number of meals eaten or most frequent dining partner) was not even significantly related to retention or graduation when accounting for the m-index within the analysis. These results were generally similar regardless of whether the m-index was assessed over a short period of time (several weeks or fewer) or a longer period of time (at least half of a semester)."

      "title": "Is the m-Index Useful for All Students?",
      "text": "While there seems to be a clear relationship between the m-index and retention outcomes for the entire first-year student cohort  (Bowman, Jarratt, et al., 2019) , important variation may exist when we consider these relationships for different groups of students. The present study explored this issue using the dining-hall meal swipes of 4,063 firstyear students during their first semester in Fall 2009. These data come from a public research university with a highly residential campus; over 95% of this first-year student cohort had meal plans. Working with the university's housing and dining office, we were able to link information about the 479,390 on-campus meals eaten by these students to data from the registrar's office.\n\nWe examined whether the m-index is more strongly related to retention and graduation rates among certain groups of students. All of our analyses accounted for student demographics (race/ethnicity, sex, socioeconomic status, in-state residency), high school achievement and preparation (high school grade point average [GPA], ACT/SAT score, Advanced Placement [AP] credits, transfer credits), and college experiences that were available from the registrar (first-year seminar, learning community, college transition course, and online introduction to campus resources). Therefore, our results convey how well the m-index predicts student success above and beyond these \"traditional\" predictors of student success. We used a reasonably large window to assess the social relationships in this study (4 minutes) so that we are more likely to identify students who may have met one another at the dining hall.\n\nWe found that the link between the m-index and students' retention and graduation outcomes was similar regardless of students' sex, socioeconomic status (as measured by estimated family contribution [EFC] from Free Application for Federal Student Aid [FAFSA] forms), high school GPA, standardized test scores, and in-state residency. Therefore, it appears that the m-index is useful for a wide variety of students.\n\nNote. Students who are low on the m-index are defined as being one standard deviation below the mean, whereas students who are high on the m-index are defined as being one standard deviation above the mean. These figures are adjusted for other predictors of graduation in the statistical model: sex, estimated family contribution, high school GPA, ACT/SAT score, AP credits, transfer credits, in-state residency, first-year seminar, learning community, college transition course, and online introduction to campus resources. Some of these differences are very large: Black students who are high on the m-index are 29 percentage points more likely to graduate than those who are low on the m-index. These disparities are also large for Latinx students (20 percentage points), White students (15 percentage points), and Asian American students (12 percentage points).\n\nHowever, we did find differences by race/ethnicity and nationality. We used the IPEDS race variable, so international students were coded separately from domestic students. We provide results here (Figure  1 ) for the groups that had a sizable number of students in our sample: Black/African American (n = 89), Asian American (n = 125), Latinx/ Hispanic (n = 190), international (n = 259), and White/ Caucasian (n = 3,245). Figure  1  compares graduation rates for students who are low versus high on the m-index in Week 1 by race/ethnicity. Domestic students who are high on the m-index are more likely to graduate than their peers who are low on this index: high m-index Asian American and Black students have an advantage of 11 percentage points over their peers, while Latinx and White students have an 8-point advantage. However, international students have a 12 percentage-point difference in the opposite direction; students who are low on the m-index actually have higher graduation rates than students with high m-indices. All of these gaps are evident despite the fact that this m-index only accounted for the first 8 days that students were living on campus.\n\nWe tested various lengths of time for the m-index, and the general patterns were similar. Consistent with our initial findings  (Bowman, Jarratt, et al., 2019) , the m-index becomes more strongly related to graduation rates when it is measured over a longer period of time. Figure  2  shows this same pattern for the m-index assessed at the end of the fall semester.\n\nSome of these differences are very large: Black students who are high on the m-index are 29 percentage points more likely to graduate than those who are low on the m-index. These disparities are also large for Latinx students (20 percentage points), White students (15 percentage points), and Asian American students (12 percentage points). Once again, the m-index patterns are reversed for international students; those who have low m-indices are 10 percentage points more likely to graduate than students with high m-indices.\n\nLong-standing inequities in graduation rates are explained, in part, by disparities in the m-index. In Figure  2 , the gap between Black students and White students is fairly small among students who are high on the m-index (less than 5 percentage points), but it is quite large among students who are low on the m-index (19 percentage points). This issue is a notable problem, since White students tend to have higher m-indices than students from other racial/ethnic groups within our sample. In fact, students from several privileged groups tended to have higher m-indices, including White students, male students, students with higher EFCs, Note. Students who are low on the m-index are defined as being one standard deviation below the mean, whereas students who are high on the m-index are defined as being one standard deviation above the mean. These figures are adjusted for other predictors of graduation in the statistical model: sex, estimated family contribution, high school GPA, ACT/SAT score, AP credits, transfer credits, in-state residency, first-year seminar, learning community, college transition course, and online introduction to campus resources. 0.4 0.45 0.5 0.55 0.6 0.65 0.7 0.75 0.8 0.85 0.9\n\nBlack/African American Latinx/Hispanic White/Caucasian Asian American International Low M-Index High M-Index and out-of-state residents (who can afford to attend despite the higher tuition rates). High school GPA is also positively associated with the m-index, which illustrates how precollege academic preparation may predict social adjustment in college."

      "title": "Implications for Campus Practice",
      "text": "While the m-index will not likely supplant the need for surveys and additional assessment, institutions may want to consider adding dining hall data into their student retention snapshots for several reasons. Data are already collected automatically, meaning that there is no additional cost and no need to spend time reminding students and incentivizing participation. Information also becomes available as early as the first few days of the semester, much earlier than other available diagnostics. Additionally, this measure relies on observed student behavior-swiping into the dining hallrather than students' self-reported perceptions.\n\nTo be clear, however, increasing a student's m-index should not be the goal in and of itself. Rather, the m-index should be viewed as a signal to assist staff in directing support to students who may be struggling to find their place. As an early signal, it may be especially useful in guiding preemptive interventions like floor dinners or facilitating meal partners. However, the effectiveness of employing this measure likely depends on how well it is integrated into a more holistic understanding of students' experiences.\n\nThese results evoke questions about data that are already available on our campuses and what stories they might reveal if we were to look at them more closely. On most residential campuses, dining swipe data are readily available, and yet we are unaware of other examples where this information has been used beyond basic reporting or logistical planning (although this certainly might exist). How else might these data help us to support student outcomes? Additionally, although the m-index is probably best suited for residential campuses with dining halls, comparable measures may exist on various types of campuses. Perhaps the student recreation center, the campus library, attendance at sporting events, and late-night door swipes might provide useful information.\n\nYet each of these pieces of information on their own can only tell us so much. In our experience, data like these are often collected, managed, and stored by discrete departments and in discrete systems. An extra level of effort is necessary to bring these data together or to integrate them into a single index within \"early alert\" systems. However, this integration is essential to create a more complete understanding of who might be struggling to find their place and how we can best intervene with structured support. This broader picture may also reveal systemic barriers in our institutional culture and structure, allowing us to reimagine practices for the betterment of all. That said, we need to do more thinking about the ethical implications of a \"big brother\" campus that is watching student behavior so closely.\n\nThe strength of the relationship between the m-index and retention outcomes, even in the first week of classes, adds weight to evidence that the early weeks in a student's transition to college can be the most crucial in their decision to persist. This finding echoes recent work that illuminates the role of early friendship and roommate/floormate relationships as well as the development of belonging during the first three weeks of classes (e.g.,  Bowman, Jang, Jarratt, & Bono, 2019) . The more institutions can do to identify and intervene early for students who are struggling socially, the better chance to prevent stories like Mia's.\n\nYet each of these pieces of information on their own can only tell us so much. In our experience, data like these are often collected, managed, and stored by discrete departments and in discrete systems. An extra level of effort is necessary to bring these data together or to integrate them into a single index within \"early alert\" systems. However, this integration is essential to create a more complete understanding of who might be struggling to find their place and how we can best intervene with structured support.\n\nHowever, additional work is needed to understand how these relationships take shape and the ways in which social relationships may develop differently across various groups of students. The m-index is a useful measure to predict retention and graduation for many groups of students, in part because it sheds light into racial disparities. In particular, the gaps between domestic Students of Color and White students are often smaller among those with high m-indices than those with low m-indices, and future work should continue to explore how these disparities develop.\n\nThe negative relationship between the m-index and graduation outcomes for international students engenders more questions. This pattern may be a function of the potentially unique pattern of housing assignments for international students that was prevalent at the time of the study: many firstyear international students were housed in an apartmentstyle residence hall farther away from campus (and from the two campus dining facilities). Because of the geographic distance and the availability of kitchens in that residence hall, it is quite possible that they built social relationships and community through eating in their own building. It may also be that international students often develop social networks through other means than the campus dining hall.\n\nWhatever the cause, the pattern here urges us away from adopting a \"one size fits all\" strategy for identification and intervention with students who may be struggling. That said, the use of swipe card data shows substantial promise as an early indicator of student integration and connection. Students' m-indices can be calculated with little cost for colleges and universities, and they provide useful information for retention efforts as early as the first week of classes. When brought into conversation with a more holistic understanding of students' experiences, the m-index has the potential to inform practical early intervention so that Mia, and so many other students, receive timely support to persist.
