  "title": "Digital Health Technology in Diabetes Management in the Asia-Pacific Region: A Narrative Review of the Current Scenario and Future Outlook",
  "abstract": "Diabetes is a growing global health concern with a high prevalence in the Asian and Western Pacific regions. Effective diabetes management mainly relies on self-care practices. However, glycemic control remains poor, especially in developing nations where healthcare access is limited. Low physician density and minimal healthcare funding exacerbate the challenges faced by people with diabetes in Asia. Digital health technologies offer promising solutions to bridge these gaps. These technologies enhance patient engagement, improve medication adherence, and promote healthier lifestyles. Mobile apps provide tools for self-management, such as monitoring physical activity and dietary intake, while telemedicine platforms and electronic medical records facilitate patient data management and remote consultations. Despite the advantages provided by digital health technologies in managing diabetes, barriers to their adoption include infrastructure limitations, regulatory challenges, and issues with data security. Some Asian countries have made major strides in the adoption of digital health tools with national strategies and regulatory bodies to manage digital health options; however, disparities in digital health readiness persist. Effective implementation of these technologies requires addressing these barriers, including enhancing infrastructure, improving app usability, and ensuring regulatory compliance. While digital",

      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "In 2021, diabetes affected 537 million people globally, with the top five countries located in Asia, while the Western Pacific region alone accounted for 38% of global cases. The numbers are expected to escalate to 152 million by 2045 in the Southeast Asian region alone  [1] . Effective management of diabetes hinges on self-care practices by people with diabetes (PwD)  [2] . Research indicates that glycemic control in PwD has been consistently poor in developing nations  [3] . In addition, limited access to healthcare resources exacerbates the problem. In Asia, there are only approximately 1.4 physicians per 1000 people, underscoring the region's significant healthcare workforce challenges  [4] . The proportion of gross domestic product (GDP) allocated to healthcare in several Asian countries is also relatively low, averaging 5.5%, which contributes to inadequate healthcare infrastructure and resources  [5] . High costs associated with diabetes care (including medications and physicians' fees), geographical barriers, low levels of literacy (particularly health literacy), and limited access to knowledge on diabetes self-management, further exacerbate the issue  [3, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] .\n\nOn a positive note, digital health technology is emerging as a crucial tool in bridging these gaps, transforming the landscape of diabetes care. Patient engagement can be enhanced by integrating digital solutions into routine care. Improved medication adherence and healthier lifestyles for PwD can be promoted through these tools  [10] . Mobile applications (apps) are effective in reinforcing education and skills needed for diabetes self-management  [11] . Additionally, electronic medical records (EMRs), telemedicine, and decision support systems are emerging as viable options for standardized interventions in primary care. These technologies enable data collection, expand access to resources, and provide flexible care options  [2, 10] . With recent advancements in healthcare delivery technologies using machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI), there is substantial potential to promote greater patient engagement and optimize diabetes care  [12, 13] . This paper reviews current digital health solutions, evaluates their benefits for diabetes management, and examines the barriers to their implementation in the Asia-Pacific region, particularly in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). It also discusses strategies to enhance the usefulness of apps and explores future perspectives."

Users of OneTouch Reveal\u00ae experienced a 1.04% reduction in HbA1c within 12 weeks, proving its efficacy in glucose monitoring  [43, 45, 50] . Apps that focus on delivering educational content, including real-time health coaching and goal-setting features, as seen in NexJ\u00ae Systems Health Coach and Wellthy CARE\u2122, exhibited improved glycemic control and quality of life  [48, 56] . Apps providing tools for insulin dose adjustment showed a reduction in HbA1c by as much as 1.12%  [51, 57] . Overall, the use of apps resulted in a reduction in HbA1c levels, ranging from 0.39% to 1.95%. Apps like mySugr\u00ae, Wellthy CARE\u2122, My Star Dose Coach\u2122, and Welltang demonstrated sustained user engagement  [46, 56, 60, 61] . Moreover, Welltang (China) and Wellthy CARE\u2122 (India) provide culturally relevant features and educational content that may further enhance user engagement. Glucose Buddy\u2122, an app with customizable graphs and data export features, may also appeal to users seeking adaptable diabetes management tools. While this assessment summarizes the efficacy of these apps, factors such as group heterogeneity, differing study designs, and differences in app applicability should be considered when interpreting these findings."

Lack of services such as stable internet connectivity hinders the effective implementation of digital health technologies in developing countries. Many privately developed apps lack essential self-management functionalities and provide limited interactions between disciplines  [64] . Most apps fall short of providing comprehensive educational resources, either due to nonadherence to clinical guidelines or due to the lack of a patient-centered outlook  [25, 33] . Apps offering clinical decision support are still in the nascent stages of development and need improved integration and device compatibility  [35] . The use of incompatible healthcare systems makes it difficult to share patient records efficiently, leading to errors and inefficiencies in care  [65] ."

      "text": "Regulatory frameworks often struggle to keep pace with the diverse tools and rapid advancements in digital health technologies  [70, 71] . Inadequate cybersecurity and data privacy regulations pose serious threats, especially in developing nations  [70] . Successful digital health promotion includes addressing unfair data practices and improving responsible technology governance, especially in LMICs  [72] . The Global Digital Health Partnership (GDHP) was established internationally in 2018 as a collaborative effort among 33 countries and territories, the World Health Organization (WHO), the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), and the International Digital Health & AI Research Collaborative (IDAIR). The partnership seeks to improve healthcare safety, quality, and effectiveness through digital health services  [73] .\n\nIn addition to this, the Centre of Regulatory Excellence (CoRE), Singapore 2020 focuses on efforts to address healthcare data policies, data security, and digital health regulation in ASEAN (Association of Southeast Asian Nations) and Asia-Pacific regions. It prioritizes establishing a secure framework for managing healthcare data, including standardized data-sharing protocols and improved transparency. It also seeks to keep pace with the rapidly evolving digital health landscape, while promoting international cooperation to align standards and streamline regulatory processes. Among Southeast Asian countries, Malaysia stands out with a well-administered legal framework for data security. This framework comprehensively addresses data storage, transmission, and utilization  [74] . The Infocomm Media Development Authority of Singapore and the Personal Data Protection Commission are involved in data protection and governance in Singapore  [74] .\n\nA software solution meeting the \"medical device\" definition is classified as Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) and must be further categorized. This classification is crucial as it determines the regulatory requirements before and after the product enters the market  [75] . In most ASEAN countries, there is no specific guidance for SaMD, which is regulated using general medical device regulatory frameworks. However, regulatory authorities in Australia, Japan, and Singapore have been proactive in developing and advancing SaMD-specific regulatory frameworks. These agencies have implemented international best practices, providing opportunities for pre-submission consultations with innovators and developing regulatory review approaches tailored to the unique needs of digital health products  [74] .\n\nAs an example, the SaMD classification approach by the Singapore Health Sciences Authority (HSA) is illustrated below  [75] : 1. Low risk: Software/app that does not measure patient parameters but only displays parameters derived from another monitor (e.g., patients' monitors) 2. Moderate risk: Apps that measure heart rate, echocardiogram, and episodes of hypoglycemia 3. High risk: Apps used for direct continuous monitoring\n\nThe Ministry of Health, Singapore and HSA regulate the approval of health apps as medical devices before release. This information is publicly available on the HSA and HealthHub websites  [76] .\n\nAdditionally, the International Medical Device Regulators Forum (IMDRF) AI Working Group is involved in developing guidance documents on standardized AI terminology and definitions for AI medical devices. It includes WHO representatives and regulatory agencies from China, Japan, Singapore, and South Korea, among other nations  [74] .\n\nImplementing secure data storage solutions like private clouds (as seen in Singapore), educating users and healthcare providers about data security practices, and protecting personal health information are needed for the successful adoption of digital health technologies  [10, 77] . Cybersecurity practices could include applying endpoint management tools and perimeter defenses like antivirus and firewalls, restricting technology use to comply with regulations such as the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA), and securing remote environments with multifactor authentication. Raising security awareness through comprehensive training and updating policies to support new technologies is also crucial, alongside implementing incident reporting frameworks like the Care Computer Emergency Response Team (CareCERT) alerts for effective cyber threat management  [78] ."
