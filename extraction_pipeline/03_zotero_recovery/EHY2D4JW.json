  "title": "Digital behavior change interventions to promote physical activity and/or reduce sedentary behavior in older adults: A systematic review and meta-analysis",
  "abstract": "Background: Physical activity and sedentary behaviour are modifiable risk factors for noncommunicable disease and healthy ageing, however the majority of older adults remain insufficiently active. Digital behaviour change interventions have the potential to reach many older adults to promote physical activity and reduce sedentary time. Methods: A systematic review of major databases from inception to 03/2018 was undertaken. Randomised controlled trials (RCT) or pre-post interventions assessing effects of digital behaviour change interventions on physical activity and/or sedentary behaviour in older adults (\u226550 years) were included. Random effects meta-analyses were carried out. Results: Twenty-two studies were included, including 1757 older adults (mean age=67 years, %male=41). Random effects model meta-analyses suggested that digital behaviour change interventions increased total physical activity among RCT studies (SMD=0.28; 95%CI 0.01, 0.56; p=0.04) and pre-post studies (SMD=0.25; 95%CI 0.09, 0.41; p=0.002), increased moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (SMD=0.47; 95%CI 0.32, 0.62, p<0.001; MD=52min/week) and reduced sedentary time (SMD=-0.45; 95%CI -0.69, -0.19; p<0.001; MD=58min/day). Reductions in systolic blood pressure (-11bpm; p=0.04)  and improvements in physical functioning (p=0.03) were also observed. Conclusions: Digital behaviour change interventions may increase physical activity and physical functioning, and reduce sedentary time and systolic blood pressure in older adults.",

      "title": "1.. Introduction",
      "text": "Older adults (age \u2265 50 years) comprise approximately 35% of the population in the United States of America (USA)  (Statistica, 2018)  and 40% of Europe  (Eurostat, 2018) , and the proportion of older adults is projected to continue to increase (Office for National  Statistics, 2017) . Despite people today living longer than their predecessors, quality of life and health are not guaranteed to be better  (Beard et al., 2016)  and many are living more years with disability  (James et al., 2018) . In order to complete everyday tasks such as climbing stairs, many older adults function close to their maximum capacity, meaning that further decline or physical setback could increase their risk of falling and/or becoming dependent on carers  (Deandrea et al., 2010; Rikli, 1999) . Non-communicable diseases (NCD), such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, certain cancers and chronic respiratory diseases, are the leading cause of death in older age globally  (Beard et al., 2016)  and also impact quality of life (QoL) and ability to live independently  (Sazlina et al., 2012) .\n\nLow levels of physical activity (PA) and excessive sedentary behaviour (SB) are independently associated with multiple NCDs in older adults  (Chad et al., 2005; Wirth et al., 2017) . For instance, lower levels of PA have been shown to be associated with musculoskeletal, respiratory, heart, circulatory, digestive and kidney/bladder/urinary conditions  (Chad et al., 2005) . Moreover, higher levels of PA are associated with healthy ageing  (Daskalopoulou et al., 2017)  and protective against aging-related decline in physical function  (Tak et al., 2013) . A systematic review found positive correlations between SB and body mass index (BMI), fat mass, cholesterol and insulin levels in older adults  (Wirth et al., 2017) . Therefore, regular and sustained engagement in PA and reduction in SB has the potential to improve health, QoL and independence in older adults  (Chad et al., 2005; Daskalopoulou et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2015; Tak et al., 2013)  and are influential in the prevention and/or management of NCD (Global Advocacy for Physical Activity (GAPA) and the Advocacy Council of the International Society for Physical Activity and Health (ISPAH), 2012).\n\nDespite these benefits, a large proportion of older adults fail to meet recommendations for PA. In the USA, the prevalence of older adults doing no activity beyond baseline activities of daily living was 25.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 25 -25.9) in older adults aged  [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] ) in those aged 65-74 years and 35.3% (95% CI 34.5 -36.1) in those aged \u2265 75 years old  (Watson et al., 2016) . Across Europe, one in eight older adults \u2265 55 years (12.5%) were found to be physically inactive (defined as never or almost never engaging in MVPA)  (Gomes et al., 2017) . A systematic review showed that 67% of older adults aged \u226560 years spend \u22658.5 hours per day sitting when objectively measured  (Harvey et al., 2013) . A cross-sectional study in Scotland found older adults \u2265 65 years old spend an average of 59.2% of their day in SB (range 28.3% -94%), averaging 14.2 hours/day  (Leask et al., 2015) .\n\nInterventions to promote sustainable PA and reduce SB in older adults have achieved limited success particularly over the long term  (Chad et al., 2005; Daskalopoulou et al., 2017; van der Bij et al., 2002) . Traditional face-to-face approaches promoting health behaviours are typically resource intensive, time-limited, require participants to travel to specific locations and lack appropriate techniques for monitoring daily fluctuations in health behaviours  (Hekler et al., 2011) . Many interventions to promote PA and/or reduce SB are only beneficial in the short term, not cost effective and require professional expertise in delivering behaviour change techniques (BCTs)  (Lyons et al., 2014) . Thus, there is a need for potentially scalable, low cost and less staff intensive interventions to help address the low levels of PA and high SB in older adults.\n\nDigital behaviour change interventions (DBCI) use technologies such as mobile applications (apps) and websites to remotely deliver behaviour change interventions  (Roberts et al., 2017) . DBCI have previously been used in the promotion of PA participation and dietary behaviours  (Flores Mateo et al., 2015; Middelweerd et al., 2014; Rabin et al., 2011) , rehabilitation programmes  (Rawstorn et al., 2016) , medication adherence  (Mistry et al., 2015) , management of long-term conditions  (Jackson et al., 2016; Puszkiewicz et al., 2016; Su et al., 2016; Vinding et al., 2016)  and promoting smoking cessation  (Spohr et al., 2015) .\n\nIn the USA, 74% of older adults aged 50-64 years old and 42% aged \u2265 65 years old own a smart phone  (Pew Research Centre, 2017) ; similarly in the UK 51% of older adults aged \u226555 years old have a smartphone and 48% have a tablet device  (Ofcom, 2018) . The average amount of time spent online on a smartphone per day in adults \u2265 55 years old is 1 hour 42 minutes in males and 2 hours 18 minutes in females  (Ofcom, 2018) . A survey conducted in the USA found that of smartphone users aged \u2265 50, 26% have software on their phones to track or manage their health, which is comparable to those aged 18 -29 years old at 24%  (Fox and Duggan, 2012) . DBCI have previously been used by older adults and are deemed relevant and acceptable for use in this population  (Kim and Glanz, 2013; Kolt et al., 2007; Martinson et al., 2010) . Despite this, the overall efficacy of using DBCI to improve health outcomes in older adults has yet to be established. This is an important question, since DBCIs present a novel and scalable approach towards providing tailored behaviour change interventions  (Forberger et al., 2017; King et al., 2013) . (Roberts et al., 2017) , even for isolated older adults who have limited contact with traditional person(s) or print based PA interventions  (Norman et al., 2007) .\n\nThus, DBCIs have the potential to revolutionise the ways individuals can monitor and improve their health behaviours by improving outcomes, reducing costs and improving patient experience  (Michie et al., 2017) . Despite this, to our knowledge, no systematic review or meta-analysis has assessed the efficacy of DBCI interventions targeting PA and/or SB in older adults (\u2265 50 years). Therefore, we conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis with the aim of assessing the efficacy of DBCI interventions in older adults (\u2265 50 years) on PA and SB. Secondary aims were to explore any effects of DBCI on physical health, mental health and social outcomes, and explore the theoretical underpinning of studies included."

In addition, studies had to be published in an electronic journal article and written in English. PA was defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that results in energy expenditure  (Caspersen et al., 1985) . SB was defined as any waking behaviour characterised by an energy expenditure of \u2264 1.5 Metabolic Equivalents (METs) whilst in a sitting or reclining posture  (Tremblay et al., 2017) . DBCI were defined as devices and programs using digital technology to foster or support behaviour change  (Yardley et al., 2016) , which include but are not limited to websites, mobile phones, smartphone applications (apps), wearable devices, video games, virtual and augmented reality devices. Randomised/controlled clinical trials that used any control condition (e.g. vs. usual care, treatment as usual or non-digital behaviour change interventions) and pre and post-test studies versus no control group were included."

For RCTs, the JBI checklist contained 13 items that were graded either 'yes', 'no', 'unclear' or 'not applicable' (see appendix B). The checklist for quasi-experimental studies contained nine items and was used for pre-post studies, containing nine items that were graded either 'yes', 'no', 'unclear' or 'not applicable' (see appendix C). Discrepancies between the review authors were resolved by discussion, with involvement of a third review author where necessary. A greater number of 'yes' items indicated higher quality studies, thus lower risk of bias  (Tufanaru et al., 2017) ."

      "title": "2.6.. Statistical analysis",
      "text": "The meta-analysis aimed to: i) establish the effects of DBCI on PA and SB on older adults by extracting a pooled effect sizes (described below); ii) establish the effects of DBCI on physiological measures (e.g. weight, heart rate) by extracting a pooled effect size, iii) identify potential modifiers through meta-regression analysis, and iv) assess the influence of publication bias on reported effects.\n\nRandom effects meta-analyses calculating standardized mean difference (SMD), mean difference (MD) and 95% CI were conducted for RCT studies for total PA, steps, MVPA and total SB. For RCT studies meta-analyses investigating total PA and steps, studies were moderated by when measurement was taken -either immediately at the end of the intervention (EI) or at a later follow up (FU) -to allow differentiation between intervention and maintenance effects. Random effects meta-analysis calculating SMD, MD and 95% CI were conducted for pre-post studies for total PA and steps. Where possible, sources of heterogeneity and moderators were investigated with meta-regression analyses including; the number of BCTs used in the DBCI, type of PA measurement, age (years), sex (% males), year of publication, region (USA/non-USA), setting (community-based/ non-communitybased) and intervention duration (weeks) were examined. Heterogeneity was assessed with the Cochrane Q and I\u00b2 statistics for each analysis  (Higgins et al., 2003) . Values \u2265 50% indicated large heterogeneity and values \u2265 75% very large between studies heterogeneity  (Higgins and Thompson, 2002; Ioannidis et al., 2007) . Publication bias was assessed through a three-step process. First visual inspection of funnel plots for each analysis were assessed. Second, the Begg-Mazumdar Kendall's tau  (Begg and Mazumdar, 1994)  and Egger bias test  (Egger et al., 1997)  to quantify publication bias were calculated. Since a visual inspection of a funnel plot is somewhat subjective and interpretive, priority was given to quantitative testing of publication bias. Third, we conducted a trim and fill adjusted analysis to remove the most extreme small studies from the positive (or negative) side of the funnel plot, recomputing the effect size at each iteration, until the funnel plot is symmetric about the (new) effect size. All analyses were performed using Comprehensive meta-analysis (CMA, version 3) software (Biostat, New Jersey, USA)."

Seven studies were deemed lower risk of bias  (Keogh et al., 2014; Knight et al., 2015; Leutwyler et al., 2015; O'Brien et al., 2015; Strand et al., 2014; Tiedemann et al., 2015; Williams, 2016) , 12 moderate risk of bias  (Ashe et al., 2015; Broekhuizen et al., 2016; Cadmus-Bertram et al., 2015; Cook et al., 2015; Frederix et al., 2015; King et al., 2007; King et al., 2014; Kullgren et al., 2014; Lyons et al., 2017; M\u00fcller et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2009; Wijsman et al., 2013)  and three higher risk of bias  (Bickmore et al., 2013; Ruiz et al., 2012; Vidoni et al., 2016)  (see appendix D).\n\nIn RCT studies, true randomisation for assignment to groups was present in five studies  (Ashe et al., 2015; Cook et al., 2015; Frederix et al., 2015; Kullgren et al., 2014)  (see appendix D). Other studies were randomised but stratified by age  (Cadmus-Bertram et al., 2015) ,sex  (Broekhuizen et al., 2016; King et al., 2007; King et al., 2014; Nguyen et al., 2009; Wijsman et al., 2013) , BMI  (Cadmus-Bertram et al., 2015) , clinic site and health literacy status  (Bickmore et al., 2013)  or enrolling with or without their spouse  (M\u00fcller et al., 2016) . Allocation to groups was concealed in eight studies  (Ashe et al., 2015; Broekhuizen et al., 2016; Frederix et al., 2015; Lyons et al., 2017; M\u00fcller et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2009; Vidoni et al., 2016; Wijsman et al., 2013) , was unclear in four studies  (Cadmus-Bertram et al., 2015; King et al., 2007; King et al., 2014; Ruiz et al., 2012)  and was not possible in three studies  (Bickmore et al., 2013; Cook et al., 2015; Kullgren et al., 2014) . Groups were similar at baseline in 11 studies  (Bickmore et al., 2013; Broekhuizen et al., 2016; Cadmus-Bertram et al., 2015; Cook et al., 2015; Frederix et al., 2015; King et al., 2007; King et al., 2014; Lyons et al., 2017; M\u00fcller et al., 2016; Ruiz et al., 2012; Wijsman et al., 2013) , was unclear in one study  (Nguyen et al., 2009) , and were not similar in three studies due to weight at baseline  (Ashe et al., 2015) , number of steps walked at baseline  (Kullgren et al., 2014) , and cognitive impairment (with/without) and average weekly step count at baseline  (Vidoni et al., 2016) . A common feature was the inability to blind participants (n = 14)  (Ashe et al., 2015; Bickmore et al., 2013; Broekhuizen et al., 2016; Cook et al., 2015; Frederix et al., 2015; King et al., 2007; King et al., 2014; Kullgren et al., 2014; Lyons et al., 2017; M\u00fcller et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2009; Ruiz et al., 2012; Vidoni et al., 2016; Williams, 2016)  and deliverers (n = 15)  (Ashe et al., 2015; Bickmore et al., 2013; Broekhuizen et al., 2016; Cadmus-Bertram et al., 2015; Cook et al., 2015; Frederix et al., 2015; King et al., 2007; King et al., 2014; Kullgren et al., 2014; Lyons et al., 2017; M\u00fcller et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2009; Ruiz et al., 2012; Vidoni et al., 2016; Williams, 2016)  to group assignments due to the nature of the interventions. In addition, in seven of the RCT studies  (Bickmore et al., 2013; Broekhuizen et al., 2016; Cadmus-Bertram et al., 2015; Cook et al., 2015; Ruiz et al., 2012; Vidoni et al., 2016; Wijsman et al., 2013)  it was unclear whether the outcome assessors were blinded to group assignment and in two it was not possible  (Lyons et al., 2017; M\u00fcller et al., 2016) . Groups were treated identically in 12 studies  (Ashe et al., 2015; Bickmore et al., 2013; Broekhuizen et al., 2016; Cadmus-Bertram et al., 2015; Cook et al., 2015; King et al., 2007; King et al., 2014; Kullgren et al., 2014; Lyons et al., 2017; M\u00fcller et al., 2016; Nguyen et al., 2009; Vidoni et al., 2016; Wijsman et al., 2013)  and was unclear in two studies  (Frederix et al., 2015; Ruiz et al., 2012) . All 15 studies critically appraised using the RCT checklist adequately described and analysed differences in groups at follow up, analysed participants in the groups they were randomised, measured outcomes in the same way for all groups, outcomes were measured in a reliable way, used appropriate statistical analysis and the trial design was appropriate and accounted for any deviations.\n\nUsing the quasi-experimental (non-randomised) tool, all seven studies had clear cause and effect variable, participants in comparisons were similar and received similar treatment, multiple measures of outcomes were taken pre and post intervention, completed follow up and if not adequately described and analysed differences, measured outcomes in the same and a reliable way, and appropriate statistical analysis was conducted  (Keogh et al., 2014; Knight et al., 2015; Leutwyler et al., 2015; O'Brien et al., 2015; Strand et al., 2014; Tiedemann et al., 2015; Williams, 2016)  (see appendix D). Six studies did not have a control group; however, one study did have a control group  (Keogh et al., 2014) ."

      "title": "4.. Discussion",
      "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effects of using DBCI to target PA and/or SB in older adults (\u2265 50 years old). The current meta-analyses suggested that DBCI increased total PA among older adults (\u2265 50 years) in RCT (End Intervention) studies and pre-post studies, increased MVPA by approximately 52 minutes per week and reduced sedentary time by approximately 58 minutes per week.\n\nReductions in systolic blood pressure and improvements in physical functioning were also identified.\n\nDBCI increased total PA in both RCT and pre-post study designs when measured immediately at the end of the intervention, however from the two follow-up RCT studies it appears this was not maintained long-term. Similarly, in a systematic review of reviews, Zubala et al.\n\n(2017) found non-digital PA interventions often resulted in increases in PA in older adults (\u2265 50 years), but effective maintenance beyond one year was unclear. It appears that DBCI have the potential to increase total PA in older adults, but may face similar problems to traditional methods regarding maintenance, although this is still unknown. Between-groups differences were seen between objectively and subjectively measured total PA in both RCT (End Intervention) and pre-post studies, however, these results must be interpreted with caution due to very low numbers of studies in subgroups. Self-reported PA often overestimates actual PA levels  (Colbert et al., 2011; Prince et al., 2008)  and this was evident in the metaanalysis, with the subjectively measured study reporting a larger increase in total PA than objectively measured.\n\nIncreases in MVPA were shown in the present meta-analysis, equivalent to 52 min/week. This is important as it represents 35% of the 150 min/week recommendation for older adults  (Public Health England, 2014) . Similar increases were shown in a meta-analysis conducted by  Roberts et al. (2017) , who found MVPA increased by approximately 40 min/week in cancer survivors when they engaged with a DBCI to promote PA. Additionally, a multilevel PA intervention in older adults (\u2265 65 years), including group walks, individual counselling and self-monitoring with pedometers, increased MVPA by 56 minutes per week  (Kerr et al., 2018) . The present study found between-groups differences in MVPA in RCT (End Intervention) studies when measured objectively vs. subjectively; however, it must be noted that only one study measured MVPA subjectively thus statistical significance should be interpreted with caution. Similarly, a previous random effects meta-analysis of RCT studies using wearable and smartphone apps in adults (\u2265 18 years) showed improvements in objectively measured MVPA but not in subjectively measured MVPA  (Gal et al., 2018) . This suggests that objective PA measurement is required to accurately assess the efficacy of such interventions.\n\nNo effect was found on daily step count in either RCT or pre-post designs, although nonsignificant, greater increases were shown in the short term and attenuated at follow up.\n\nUnexpectedly, a reduction in the number of steps taken per day equivalent to 737 steps per day was found in the MD of pre-post studies, despite indications of increases in total PA and MVPA. An explanation for this could be due to low numbers of studies and participants in the calculations, or that total PA and MVPA increased due to non-ambulatory activities such as cycling or swimming. Conversely, a previous meta-analysis of non-digital PA interventions in older adults (\u2265 65 years) showed an increase of 620 more steps/day in the intervention group compared with the control group  (Chase, 2015) . Previous random-effects meta-analysis of RCT studies showed that smartphone apps and wearable interventions significantly increased daily step counts in adults (\u2265 18 years)  (Gal et al., 2018) . DBCI may have potential to increase daily step counts in older adults, particularly in the short term, but more research is required.\n\nThe present meta-analyses showed DBCIs were associated with a significant reduction in SB, equivalent to 58 min/day. Similarly, a goal-setting-based non-digital intervention to reduce SB in older adults (\u2265 60 years) showed significant reductions in total sitting time of 51.5 minutes per day  (Lewis et al., 2016) . Reduction in SB was seen in the present study when SB was measured objectively but not subjectively, although only one study measured SB subjectively so effect sizes must be interpreted with caution. Subjective measurement has previously been shown to significantly underestimate SB in older adults  (Copeland et al., 2017; Van Cauwenberg et al., 2014) , therefore future studies should aim to measure SB objectively when possible.\n\nOne of the most common BCTs in the present review was social support, and evidence suggests older adults are more likely to engage in PA if meaningful motivators such as social and environmental support and enjoyment are present, rather than purely cognitive strategies or BCTs  (Zubala et al., 2017) . In the present review, goal setting and feedback on behaviour were also commonly present. Similarly, goal setting, feedback and self-monitoring behaviours were common in DBCI in cancer survivors  (Roberts et al., 2017)  and in eHealth interventions -using information and communication technologies for health -in older adults (\u2265 55 years)  (Muellmann et al., 2017) . These BCTs were common among apps and wearables showing the most significant improvements in behavioural and health outcomes  (Schoeppe et al., 2016) . Therefore, the BCTs goal setting, feedback, self-monitoring and social support should be considered when designing future DBCI for older adults.\n\nSecondary outcome meta-analysis showed no change in weight, DBP or QoL. Explanations for this could be due to the limited number of studies measuring these outcomes, the DBCI were too short-term to influence these factors, or extraneous factors (such as diet or mental health) impacted these outcomes. Nevertheless, engaging in DBCI reduced SBP by approximately 11bpm, but did not affect DBP. Similarly, a multilevel non-digital PA programme in older adults (\u2265 65 years) showed significant reductions in SBP (6.8 bpm; SD = 3.2) and DBP (2.5 bpm; SD = 1.9) at 6 months into the intervention  (Kerr et al., 2018) .\n\nIncreases in PA may induce post-exercise hypotension  (MacDonald, 2002) , thus may be important for helping to manage blood pressure in older adults. Physical functioning was significantly increased by DBCI in the present meta-analysis, which may be due to improvements in stamina, strength, balance, coordination or increased movement confidence associated with increased PA, and have been documented previously in older adults engaging in exergames  (De Queiroz et al., 2017; Howes et al., 2017; Molina et al., 2014; Pope et al., 2017; Skjaeret et al., 2016) , web-based  (Irvine et al., 2013)  and non-digital PA and exercise programmes  (Barnett et al., 2003; Chodzko-Zajko et al., 2009; Taylor et al., 2004) . This suggests that DBCI designed to increase PA and/or reduce SB can also improve physical functioning, even if this is not the targeted outcome.\n\nDBCI have the potential to increase PA and physical functioning, and reduce SB and SBP in older adults. This can lead to the prevention and/or maintenance of NCD and greater independence associated with healthy ageing  (Chad et al., 2005; Daskalopoulou et al., 2017; Smith et al., 2015; Tak et al., 2013) . As future populations comprise greater proportions of older adults and life expectancies continue to increase, it is important that health, QoL and years lived without disability are maximised, for the individual and for society."

      "title": "4.1.. Strengths and limitations",
      "text": "Strengths of this review include that it is the first systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effectiveness of DBCI on PA and/or SB in older adults aged \u2265 50 years, and was conducted and reported in line with PRISMA guidelines  (Moher et al., 2009) . The inclusion of studies using exclusively older adults aged \u2265 50 years ensured our findings were completely relevant to this specific population. One limitation of this review is the relative infancy of the topic area meaning many studies are feasibility focused with small sample sizes, which may impact efficacy estimates. Many studies in this review were short-term interventions with no follow-up, thus we cannot be sure of the long-term effects of DBCI on PA and SB in older adults. In addition, some meta-analyses reported moderate to high heterogeneity and potential publication bias, although potentially due to variability in the type of DBCI and specific intervention content  (Roberts et al., 2017) , should be interpreted with caution. It was not possible to compare DBCI to a wait-list/no intervention control vs. a non-digital intervention due to the lack of studies, which may statistically impact effect sizes. In addition, BCTs for control conditions were not coded, but may elicit behaviour change or show overlaps with the DBCI, potentially influencing effect sizes. Due to insufficient quantity of studies, it was not possible to conduct meta-regression analysis on most outcomes. Only studies reported in English were reviewed, meaning eligible studies in other languages may have been missed. The terms 'web-based', 'internet' and 'pedometer' were actively excluded from the search methodology, as in pilot searches this elicited unmanageable volumes of results, however may mean some eligible papers may have been missed. The grey literature search should have helped minimise this.\n\nFuture research should continue to investigate the efficacy of DBCI compared with nondigital control conditions as well as wait-list/no intervention control conditions, and investigate longer-term interventions with follow-ups to investigate the maintenance of PA post-intervention. More information regarding which BCTs make a DBCI more or less effective in promoting PA and/or reducing SB in older adults is also needed. Investigators should continue to use objective measures of PA and SB where possible."

      "title": "4.2.. Conclusion",
      "text": "In conclusion, there is evidence that DBCI to promote PA and/or reduce SB result in increases in total PA, MVPA and physical functioning, and reductions in SB and SBP in older adults aged \u2265 50 years, at least in the short term. Further research is required to investigate medium-and long-term interventions, maintenance effects and DBCI compared with no intervention and non-digital interventions control groups. Differences between objective and subjectively measured PA and SB were shown, thus future researchers should aim to objectively measure these where possible. DBCI used with older adults commonly feature the BCTs social support, goal setting and feedback, however future research is needed to identify specifically the effectiveness of each BCT, which will enhance DBCI design. Researchers should also consider coding BCTs from control groups as there may be overlaps with the DBCI, which could influence effect sizes."
