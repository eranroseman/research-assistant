  "title": "Five-year follow-up of a randomized weight loss trial on a digital health behaviour change support system",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The weight regain after successful weight loss is a common challenge. This study aimed to assess the long-term effectiveness of a web-based health behaviour change support system (HBCSS) utilizing persuasive systems design (PSD) and methods of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). We have previously demonstrated the two-year effectiveness of the HBCSS. METHODS: In total, 532 participants with overweight or obesity (BMI 27-35 kg m -2 ) were split into three groups with different intensities of intervention: CBT-based group counselling, self-help guidance (SHG), and usual care. These groups were further divided into HBCSS and non-HBCSS groups. The HBCSS was a 52-week programme. The follow-up took five years in total. RESULTS: Mean weight change (%) (95% CI) from baseline among HBCSS and non-HBCSS users was 1.5 (-0.02 to 2.9), p = 0.056 and 1.9 (0.3-3.3), p = 0.005, respectively, at five years. Of the six groups, the SHG group without HBCSS had a statistically significant increase in weight (%) from baseline at five years (3.1, 95% CI 0.6 to 5.6, p = 0.010). The other groups did not have a significant increase in weight. There was no significant difference between groups at five years in weight. Fewer blood pressure medications were started over the five-year period in HBCSS group (p = 0.046). CONCLUSION: The 12-month HBCSS intervention was not able to maintain reduced weight better than non-HBCSS at 5 years. However, there were significant weight difference favouring HBCSS over the whole 5-year period. The decrease in the need for antihypertensives suggests that the significant weight loss by HBCSS at early years has a health-promoting legacy effect.",

      "text": "The challenge in treating overweight and obesity is to sustain reduced weight. Obesity should be approached as a chronic condition requiring longer-term support and treatment  [1] . Lifestyle interventions are effective in achieving weight loss in the short term, but preserving the results is often challenging  [2] [3] [4] . Better weight management methods are needed to ensure long-term weight maintenance. Currently, there is no universally effective approach to weight maintenance  [4] .\n\nDigital technologies have significant potential for engaging people with health behaviour change and helping weight reduction  [1, 5] . Mobile application is an easily accessible and potential platform for obesity treatment as most adults own a smartphone and half have downloaded a health-related mobile app  [5, 6] . There is evidence that web-based interventions may be useful in weight loss and maintenance in the short term  [1, 3] . A meta-analysis showed that digital interventions may be more effective in weight loss than a non-digital intervention in the short-term  [7] . Some studies have shown that interactive technology interventions help reduce weight and maintain weight loss for up to two years  [3, 8] . Currently, personal contact intervention, including telephone and face-to-face contact, seems to be the most effective both in weight loss and maintenance  [3, 9] .\n\nWe previously performed a randomized clinical trial on the effectiveness of a web-based health behaviour change support system (HBCSS) that utilizes persuasive systems design (PSD) and methods of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT). We had six intervention groups: CBT-based group counselling, self-help guidance-based group counselling (SHG), and usual care further divided into the HBCSS and non-HBCSS groups  [8] . The trial demonstrated that one-year treatment with HBCSS was effective for weight loss, and remarkably, the weight loss result was maintained for one year after the intervention, even when HBCSS was utilized without any face-to-face counselling  [8] . Weight reduction in CBT-based counselling with HBCSS was 4.1% at 12 months and 3.4% at 24 months. HBCSS alone achieved a 1.6% weight reduction at 24 months.\n\nHere we report the five-year outcome of the HBCSS and/or group counselling treatment. Our primary aim was to assess the long-term effectiveness of HBCSS in weight control."

      "text": "An invitation letter was sent to 11,400 people aged 20-60 living in Oulu, Finland, and 1065 volunteers were assessed for eligibility. The inclusion criteria were BMI (27-35 kg m -2 ), access to the internet, no health-related restrictions to losing weight, and no other treatment for obesity. After exclusions due to significant illness or abnormal laboratory values, 532 participants were randomized into six groups in two phases (Fig.  1 ). First, participants were divided into three groups, one control group and two groups with different face-to-face group counselling methods. Secondly, these three groups were divided into web-based HBCSS users and non-users.\n\nAt baseline, 532 participants were randomly assigned to the study arms. Between the baseline and five-year visits, 129 participants (24.2%) dropped out. The completers are the participants measured at baseline and the 5-year visit. All randomized participants (except for one) were approached and invited to the five-year visit, even if they had not visited the research centre after the baseline visit."

Treatment aims were to (1) lose and maintain 5% weight loss, (2) improve eating behaviour, and (3) decrease health risks related to overweight and obesity (e.g., diabetes, cardiovascular diseases). Group counselling with SHG included two sessions with a registered nurse. The sessions were based on Elvira counselling model, which utilizes constructive learning theory and stages of change model  [10, 11] . The sessions aimed to help with lifestyle changes and eating behaviour. The control group received usual care usually given in primary health care, including information about health and weight management and metabolic syndrome (a leaflet and personal laboratory results).\n\nThe web-based HBCSS was a 52-week programme based on PSD combined with CBT methods. The programme guided the participants towards a better lifestyle, weight loss, and a healthier state. The system included motivative functions, e.g., the possibility to set goals and follow progress. It also provided information about health and healthy lifestylerelated topics. Software features implemented in the system supported users to carry out their primary task, computer-human dialogue, perceived credibility, and social influence. These included specifically design principles of self-monitoring, reduction, tunnelling, tailoring, praise, reminders, suggestion, liking, verifiability, social learning, and social facilitation  [12, 13] . Detailed information about HBCSS, treatment arms and sample size calculations are presented in the previous publication  [8] ."

Changes in weight from baseline to five years were compared in six groups among all participants based on the intention-to-treat principle.\n\nA linear mixed-effect model (LMM) (as primary analysis), where (six) group and time were fixed effect factors was used to examine the differences in weight from baseline to 5 years adjusting for age and sex  [14] . Group and time interaction was included in the model to examine whether mean change over time was different between groups. Data included some missing values, but they were assumed to be at random. The same model was used with imputed values (both the Last Observation Carried Forward (LOCF) and Return-To-Baseline (RTB)) where data were missing and for completers as sensitivity analyses. Primary analysis and sensitivity analyses were based on intention-to-treat principles. Primary analysis was also used to examine the differences between HBCSS groups and non-HBCSS groups.\n\nFurthermore, the supplementary net incremental Area-Under-the-curve (AUC) analysis was used to compare weight changes during the five years of follow-up in HBCSS and non-HBCSS groups. The AUC analysis visualises and outlines the weight change trend over the five-year period and was therefore performed as an off-protocol analysis. The calculations of The flowchart represents all groups, either with or without HBCSS. The completers are the participants measured at baseline and the 5-year visit. Detailed changes in participants, including the 1-and 2-year visits, are presented in a previous publication  [8] .\n\nincremental AUCs subtracted the baseline weight from the weight at oneyear, two-year, and five-year time points. If the subtraction of the baseline from the subsequent time point resulted in a negative value, leading to a negative peak in incremental AUC calculation, the resulting negative peak area was subtracted from the positive peak area (net area calculation). The inclusion criteria for AUC analysis were that the baseline and at least one other time point measurement were available. The five-year measure got a value of 0 (no change in weight) if missing. The net areas from AUC analysis were run by analysis of variance (ANOVA). Intragroup changes were analysed with One-Sample T Test. IBM SPSS Statics version 26.0 (IBM Corp., Armonk, NY, USA) was used for the analyses. GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad Software Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was utilized for the AUC analyses.\n\nIn addition, differences in the weight change proportions between study arms were calculated with Chi-square analysis. The changes in the number of lipid, cardiovascular and diabetes medications between HBCSS and non-HBCSS groups were analysed with the Chi-Square Test. p-values less than 0.05 were considered statistically significant."

      "text": "We have previously shown that a 52-week-long web-based HBCSS intervention effectively reduces weight for up to two years  [8] . Our current extended follow-up study demonstrates that the non-HBCSS group showed significant weight gain from baseline at five years. This is in accordance with previous observational studies showing an average weight gain of about 400 g per year  [15] . Among HBCSS users the weight gain was less extensive although there was no statistical difference between the combined HBCSS group and the combined non-HBCSS group. The net area under the curve analysis (AUC) showed differences in weight favouring the HBCSS intervention groups during the totality of five-year follow-up, reflecting the previously demonstrated effectiveness of the HBCSS intervention for weight loss at two years. After five years, the best results among the three HBCSS groups in the AUC analysis were achieved in the CBT + HBCSS group. There is evidence that the benefits of weight loss associated with the risk of type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular diseases, and other obesity and overweight related conditions are remarkable at over 5% weight loss  [16, 17] . Also, more moderate weight loss (from 2% to 5%) is associated with improved fasting glucose and HbA1c levels  [17] . Thus, using the HBCSS intervention combined with CBT-based group counselling may lead to a better state of health because the weight remains lower for a longer time. In addition, our finding of the decrease in the need for antihypertension therapy may indicate that the significant weight loss by HBCSS in the early years, as indicated by AUC analyses, has a health-promoting legacy effect reflected on the better blood pressure control.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that weight maintenance is a significant problem in treating overweight and obesity  [1] . Shortterm lifestyle changes can be very successful  [2] [3] [4] . The patterns of curves from two to five years among the HBCSS users indicate that additional support may be required for sustained lifestyle change results and to prevent regaining weight. To maintain the results in the long term, e.g., face-to-face, or web-based counselling could be needed if weight is regained. One of the potential options is to repeat the HBCSS intervention a few years after the first intervention period. It should be noted that the weight-regain process is also a result of physiological processes, for example, metabolic adaptation and hormonal changes, in addition to psychological and lifestyle-related factors  [18] .\n\nOur study searched for an effective, low-cost method for treating overweight and obesity. From a public health perspective, webbased interventions in lifestyle change might be desirable because of the excellent opportunity to treat many individuals at a time at a low cost. Also, in the future, the focus must be on preventing overweight and obesity. Prevention of weight gain and maintaining a healthy weight are considered less challenging, less expensive, and potentially more effective than treatment of obesity  [19] .\n\nThe exceptionally long follow-up period, the original randomized trial design, the number of participants, and the anthropometric measurements performed by study personnel support the reliability, quality, and uniqueness of this study. Considering that only 129 (24.2%) participants dropped out between the baseline and five-year visit, the participants were well committed to the trial. The large number of completers increases the reliability of the results of this study. The practical experience and the previous scientific evidence of the difficulty of maintaining weight loss are also in line with our findings. This study did not include an analysis of the factors influencing the weight gain of the subjects, such as hormonal changes, psychological factors, and life situations."

      "text": "Our extended follow-up study shows that the previously demonstrated 2-year weight benefits of the 12-month HBCSS intervention were not maintained at 5 years better than with the non-HBCSS control intervention. However, there were significant weight differences favouring HBCSS over the whole 5-year period, with HBCSS + CBT-based group counselling having the most beneficial effect on weight among the three HBCSS groups. The legacy effect on the need of blood pressure medications supports the benefits of the HBCSS when aiming to lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases. In the future, there is a particular need for an effective tool for maintaining weight loss."
