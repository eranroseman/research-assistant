  "title": "Recommendation systems to promote behavior change in patients with diabetes mellitus type 2: A systematic review",
  "abstract": "A C T Type 2 diabetic patients benefit significantly if the disease is well controlled through behavioral changes, namely adopting a healthy lifestyle. Currently, there is some evidence that technological strategies can help patient selfmanagement. However, few studies have specifically targeted individuals who solely engage in automatic and personalized self-management practices. This study aims to synthesize the literature regarding personalized feedback recommendation systems to promote behavior change without health professionals' direct intervention for the management of type 2 diabetes and to verify if the use of these systems improves health-related outcomes. A systematic review was performed from inception to April 13, 2021, based on a search conducted in six databases. According to the defined search expression, studies addressing type 2 diabetic patients and recommendation systems were included. In total, 2186 papers were initially identified, but only 22 met the specific inclusion criteria after screening. Discrepancies in the selection of studies were discussed in consensus meetings. To assess the quality of the articles, two tools were employed according to the types of articles retrieved. Selected papers were summarized regarding specific characteristics such as clinical and technological outcomes. Studies incorporating a recommendation system into their technological solution showed a positive effect on the evaluated outcomes, except for those with longer duration, where the effect was not statistically significant. Although most studies did not report the type of system used, expert systems (rule-based) were found to be the most prevalent among those that did. As behaviors are often difficult to change quickly, it is recommended that future studies extend their follow-up timeframe. Nevertheless, the data obtained suggest that technological solutions incorporating a recommendation system show potential to improve health-related outcomes and demonstrated good usability.",

      "title": "1.. Introduction",
      "text": "The disease burden of diabetes has increased significantly and is estimated to continue to grow in the coming decades  (Cho et al., 2018; X. Lin et al., 2020b) . Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes, with about 90-95% of people with diabetes having this type and the elderly being the most common patients. However, it has become increasingly frequent in younger individuals due to lifestyle changes  (Kharroubi & Darwish, 2015) . Several modifiable risk factors are known for developing diabetes type 2, such as unhealthy eating habits, physical inactivity, smoking, alcohol consumption, and obesity  (Djouss\u00e9, Driver, Gaziano, Buring, & Lee, 2013) . In addition to being one of the ten leading causes of death globally, diabetes also contributes, in many cases, to a reduction in the quality of life of diabetic patients (X. Lin et al., 2020b) . However, even with the disease established, adopting a healthy lifestyle contributes to reducing complications and hospitalizations associated with the disease, such as retinopathy, nephropathy, cardiovascular symptoms, foot ulcers, and in more severe cases, amputations (American Diabetes  Association, 2014) .\n\nIn this sense, proper management of the disease is essential. Health professionals can monitor diabetes control through the measurement of some clinical parameters. They also usually advise on managing the disease, but patients do not always follow their recommendations. However, patients self-monitoring of the disease is essential, but they must acquire knowledge, motivation, and experience (van den  Arend, Stolk, Krans, Grobbee, & Schrijvers, 2000) . But literature indicates that most diabetic patients do not have the knowledge or ability to manage their disease  (Norris, Lau, Smith, Schmid, & Engelgau, 2002) , so poor adherence to the treatment is very common  (World Health Organisation. (2003 ), 2003) . Self-management of the disease may be challenging and, most of the time, implies a behavioral change  (Klein, Mogles, & van Wissen, 2014)  because diabetic patients should have a healthy diet, they need to practice exercise regularly, take the medication prescribed by their doctor, and measure their blood glucose at the intervals specified by their doctor  (Koenigsberg & Corliss, 2017) .\n\nHowever, technology can be a good ally in the management of diabetes. Technology-based intervention tools that enable assistance in selfmanagement of the disease by type 2 diabetic patients have increased over time, following the growing evolution in digital technology, particularly in mobile health (mHealth)  (Cao, Lim, Sengoku, Guo, & Kodama, 2021) . This started to play an important role in managing diabetes, helping patients and health professionals in decision-making, complementing the abovementioned approaches. However, the evidence that mHealth can contribute to improving patient outcomes is still limited  (Marcolino et al., 2018)  and Rowland and colleagues consider that this type of improvement, according to the published literature, only exists in a small number of clinical scenarios  (Rowland, Fitzgerald, Holme, Powell, & McGregor, 2020) . However, although many mobile health applications are related to type 2 diabetes, not all apps and systems have tailored recommendations built on user-entered data  (El-Gayar, Timsina, Nawar, & Eid, 2013; Josekutty Thomas, Masthoff, & Oren, 2017) .\n\nIn this sense, many approaches exist to process domain-specific knowledge  (Caramazza & Shelton, 1998)  and user data. Expert systems are inevitably highlighted among these approaches as one of the most well-known branches of applied artificial intelligence. Such system model task-specific knowledge is obtained through human expertise, which is then transferred to a computer. This knowledge can then be used to infer and conclude appropriate advice and recommendations  (Shu-Hsien, 2005) .\n\nThe recommendation aspect in the healthcare context is fundamental to provide more personalized and relevant feedback to the patient, which could possibly be translated into a better experience for the user and, at the same time, an improvement in the clinical condition. Currently, recommendation systems have been widely used in the healthcare field and are applied to support patients and also health professionals to make better health-related decisions  (Tran, Felfernig, Trattner, & Holzinger, 2021) , thus allowing patients with specific pathologies to take advantage of technologies for the benefit of more precise and accurate monitoring, and as a result, promote healthier lifestyles (M. M.  Khan, Ibrahim, & Ghani, 2017) .\n\nAnother relevant approach that should also be discussed is the development of recommender systems designed as programs to process user data and recommend suitable products or services according to their interests  (Lu, Wu, Mao, Wang, & Zhang, 2015) . Different techniques have been proposed in this context, such as collaborative, content-based, or hybrid filtering. In the content-based filtering technique, the recommendation is made based on the user's profile, through history, using resources extracted from the content of items that the user has evaluated in the past. Those items that are related to positive rating items will be recommended to the user. In this case, having profiles of other users is unnecessary, as they do not influence the recommendation. If a user profile changes, the content-based filtering technique adjusts to the recommendations within a short period  (de Gemmis, Lops, Musto, Narducci, & Semeraro, 2015) . Collaborative filtering is domainindependent filtering or evaluation, according to other people's opinions, that cannot be simply described through metadata. It concludes that people with similar preferences assign similar ratings to a given element. This process uses profiles to specify the relationship or similarity between users and starts by creating a matrix of user elements and their preferences. It then calculates the similarity between user profiles to detect and obtain users with common interests to recommend  (Zhang et al., 2019) . The hybrid filtering technique combines algorithms that provide more accurate and effective recommendations than a single algorithm. The combination of approaches can be done in one of two ways: separate implementation of algorithms and combination of the result, using content-based filtering in the collaborative approach or through collaborative filtering in the content-based approach, creating a unified recommender system that includes both mentioned approaches  (Tarus, Niu, & Kalui, 2018) .\n\nA health recommendation system provides appropriate health information to healthcare professionals and patients. A scoping review found that the most recommended items in this type of system are personalized motivational messages, personalized physical activity and diet, personalized insulin bolus, and disease-related information  (Cai, Yu, Kumar, Gladney, & Mostafa, 2022) . A systematic review conducted by Yera et al. about food recommender systems detected that even though several studies focused on the development of healthy food recommendations, in the particular case of diabetes, there is a lack of works specifically focused on this domain. A large number of the approaches that consider diabetes disease in their food recommender systems do not consider the pathology as a main component of the research, considering it only as one of its dimensions or with a low personalized nature  (Yera, Alzahrani, Mart\u00ednez, & Rodr\u00edguez, 2023) . Many of the existing recommendation systems in the medical field are aimed at supporting the health professional in their complex decisionmaking, considering the patient's medical history  (Larsen et al., 2022; Sutton et al., 2020) . Although, they are not so directed to be used independently by the patients. Those that are most commonly available in the literature and there are somehow directed towards patients, using, for example, reminders to the patients have a health professional as an intermediary in providing messages or feedback  (Baptista, Wadley, Bird, Oldenburg, & Speight, 2020; Katz, Mesfin, & Barr, 2012; Stueve & Schnell, 2019; Zhai & Yu, 2020)  and the literature seems to show that having direct feedback from a health professional is very important for disease management and has a consequent improvement in outcomes  (Holbrook et al., 2005; Porter, Huggins, Truby, & Collins, 2016) .\n\nHowever, few studies focus only on studying recommendation systems in which there is a knowledge base, such as expert systems, and whether these can also contribute to the improvement of health-related outcomes. Therefore, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first systematic review that aims to describe the existing recommendation systems that convey personalized feedback for the management of type 2 diabetes and verify if there is any improvement in health-related outcomes and whether they are effective without the direct presence of a healthcare professional."

The studies were excluded if they included only patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus and/or gestational diabetes, were not peer-reviewed, or the full-text paper was unavailable even after contact with the authors.\n\nPapers that included both patients with diabetes type 1 and type 2 were also included, but only the section regarding diabetes type 2 was considered for this work. We included all types of studies that are original research, as long as there was an approach in which the recommendation system presented could be tested or evaluated. Systematic reviews were not included in this work.\n\nStudies that had a feedback system but, upon reading its description, appeared to be systems that only provided feedback in the form of general messages for all users or at a specific time of the day, every day, for instance, and which do not depend on the input of health data introduced or where feedback was not personalized were also excluded. However, studies that were not clear in this distinction (automatic or personalized feedback) or in which personalized feedback was performed by the health professional and was only transmitted by the system were also excluded. Additionally, studies were excluded if they only focused on glucose monitoring. References regarding articles that were included in this work were not checked or additionally included."

      "text": "There are some available tools to assess the quality of the papers  (Jadad et al., 1996; Ma et al., 2020; Shea et al., 2017) . Due to the heterogeneity of the types of studies included in this review, the choice of the tool was complex. In this way, two checklists were used that allowed the inclusion of quality items that were transversal to most types of articles and commonly used in the literature to assess the quality and risk of bias of the papers included, two checklists were used. For randomized controlled trials, the most commonly used tool for this type of study was applied, that is, the Risk of Bias 2 (RoB 2)  (Sterne et al., 2019) , and for the other non-randomized studies, the Risk Of Bias In Nonrandomized Studies of Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool was employed  (Sterne et al., 2016) . The latter, despite possibly not being the most suitable tool for some of the included studies, is a tool that assesses several vital domains related to the quality of studies. Both tools analyzed the risk of bias based on some domains, namely confounding, selection of the participants, classification of the interventions, deviations from the intended interventions, missing data, outcome  measurement, and the reported result selection. The RoB2 also assessed bias from the randomization process, and ROBINS-I also evaluated bias arising from the confounding, selection of the participants, and classification of the interventions. The first one has three levels of risk of bias: low, some concerns, and high, and the ROBINS-I tool has four levels: low, moderate, serious, and critical. A final overall risk of bias was then determined based on the risk assigned in each assessment domain, particularly regarding the primary outcome. All reviewers performed this task, and each article was reviewed by two researchers simultaneously and independently. Discrepancies were analyzed and resolved in peer consensus meetings."

However, some articles we consider may simultaneously meet more than one criterion, particularly, review articles and protocols that are also not intervention studies.\n\nThe supplementary table shows the characteristics of each of the included papers. The studies were predominantly from the following countries: the USA (n = 4)  (Alrige, Alharbey, & Chatterjee, 2020; Batch et al., 2021; Hartzler et al., 2016; Quinn et al., 2011) , Australia (n = 3)  (Adu et al. 2020b (Adu et al. , 2020a;; Gong et al., 2020) , Spain (n = 2)  (Fico et al., 2019; Fioravanti, Fico, Salvi, Garc\u00eda-Betances, & Arredondo, 2015) , Japan (n = 2)  (Kobayashi et al., 2019; Waki et al., 2015) , India (n = 2)  (Shamanna et al., 2020; Sunil Kumar et al., 2021) , South Korea  (Lim et al., 2011 (Lim et al., , 2016) )  and one study from China (J. Lin et al., 2020a) , Portugal  (Balsa et al., 2020) , United Kingdom (Bailey, Mugridge, Dong, Zhang, & Chater, 2020), Canada  (Desveaux et al., 2018) , Norway  (Holmen et al., 2014) , Iran  (Norouzi et al., 2018)  and Ireland  (Byrne, Caulfield, Lowery, Thompson, Smith, & Griffin, 2018) . All articles are dated about ten years ago (the oldest article is dated 2011) and half of the papers included are from 2020 and onwards. The participants of the studies were type 2 diabetes mellitus patients with a mean age range from about 43 to 71 years old. The number of participants in the studies ranged from 5 to 14,085 and of the studies that contained information on the gender of the participants (n = 15), most of the participants were male, except in two studies where the participants were mainly female  (Adu, Malabu, Malau-Aduli, & Malau-Aduli, 2020b; Alrige et al., 2020; Hartzler et al., 2016)  and another two who had a similar ratio  (Batch et al., 2021; Norouzi et al., 2018) .\n\nHowever, more than half of the articles had a sample size of fewer than 100 participants, and of these, almost all were not randomized clinical trials, with the exception of two articles  (Bailey et al., 2020; Fioravanti et al., 2015) . This discrepancy in the sample size could be because the included studies had different outcomes and study designs. Different types of study designs were included, with randomized clinical trials being the predominant type of study (n = 9)  (Bailey et al., 2020; Fioravanti et al., 2015; Gong et al., 2020; Holmen et al., 2014; Kobayashi et al., 2019; Lim et al., 2011 Lim et al., , 2016;; Quinn et al., 2011; Sunil Kumar et al., 2021) . Considering the other papers, four had a pre-post study design  (Adu, Malabu, Malau-Aduli, Drovandi, & Malau-Aduli, 2020a; Alrige et al., 2020; Batch et al., 2021; Byrne et al., 2018) , two had a retrospective design (J. Lin et al., 2020a; Shamanna et al., 2020) , five were cross-sectional studies  (Adu et al., 2020; Balsa et al., 2020; Hartzler et al., 2016; Norouzi et al., 2018; Waki et al., 2015) , and one qualitative study  (Desveaux et al., 2018) . This table contains two types of information regarding the number of participants, the first is related to the number of participants recruited, and the second to the number of participants who completed the study (N recruited/N final), if this type of information exists. The studies were carried out in the context of primary health care, clinical centers, hospitals, and some in more than one setting, including diabetes education centers or treatment care."

      "title": "3.2.. Interventions",
      "text": "Of the total 22 studies, 13 studies  (Alrige et al., 2020; Batch et al., 2021; Byrne et al., 2018; Desveaux et al., 2018; Gong et al., 2020; Holmen et al., 2014; Kobayashi et al., 2019; Lim et al., 2016; Lim et al., 2011; J. Lin et al., 2020a; Quinn et al., 2011; Shamanna et al., 2020; Sunil Kumar et al., 2021)  had as the main outcome the difference in glycemic control after the end of the study, more specifically, the value of the glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), namely the mean change between the beginning and the end of the study period. On the other hand, most of the remaining papers had as the main objective the assessment of the usability, feasibility, and acceptability of the mobile app  (Adu et al., 2020a; Bailey et al., 2020; Balsa et al., 2020; Fico et al., 2019; Fioravanti et al., 2015; Hartzler et al., 2016; Norouzi et al., 2018; Waki et al., 2015) , which can often be considered a proxy for app usage, as if people consider that the mobile apps have good usability, they can generally use it for a longer period of time, and the frequency of involvement with diabetes self-management activities  (Adu et al., 2020a) . The articles with usability as the main outcome were those with a smaller sample size, except for one study (J. Lin et al., 2020a) , which included 14,085 participants in a retrospective study. Usability studies do not require a large number of participants, as assuming a problem occurrence of 30% and to discover 85% of problems, a sample size of just about five people is considered enough to draw conclusions  (Lewis, 2001; Turner, Lewis, & Nielsen, 2006) . This outcome was fundamentally assessed by filling in validated questionnaires or some questions related to satisfaction with using the app and how it could be improved based on the user's perspective.\n\nThe duration of the included studies ranged from 7 days to 1 year. A clear distinction between the longer studies and the planned outcome, as well as the adopted study design, was verified, that is, the studies that had at least a duration equal to or greater than three months  (Alrige et al., 2020; Batch et al., 2021; Byrne et al., 2018; Desveaux et al., 2018; Fioravanti et al., 2015; Gong et al., 2020; Holmen et al., 2014; Kobayashi et al., 2019; Lim et al., 2016; Lim et al., 2011; J. Lin et al., 2020a; Shamanna et al., 2020; Sunil Kumar et al., 2021)  intended to evaluate the effect of the mobile application use on glycemic control, while the studies with a shorter duration (less than two months)  (Adu et al., 2020a (Adu et al., , 2020b;; Bailey et al., 2020; Balsa et al., 2020; Fico et al., 2019; Fioravanti et al., 2015; Hartzler et al., 2016; Norouzi et al., 2018; Waki et al., 2015)  presented simpler study designs and had focused fundamentally on the evaluation of usability and acceptability of the application. In nearly all studies, participants were required to have access to a mobile phone or at least to know how to use it, in other words, to have some technological literacy.\n\nRegarding the results obtained by the analysis of the primary outcomes evaluated, ten authors  (Alrige et al., 2020; Desveaux et al., 2018; Gong et al., 2020; Holmen et al., 2014; Kobayashi, Tsushita et al., 2019; Lim et al., 2016; Lim et al., 2011; J. Lin et al., 2020a; Quinn et al., 2011; Shamanna et al., 2020; Sunil Kumar et al., 2021)  (2 studies are from the same author and related to the same system) found significant reductions concerning the values of glycated hemoglobin, either comparing with the baseline or otherwise with the control group, which in most studies was compared with usual care. However, the studies conducted by  Batch et al., Holmen et al., and Gong et al. (Gong et al., 2020; Holmen et al., 2014)  did not find significant differences and, curiously, these last two studies had a longer duration (1 year), which suggests that the improvements found by the other authors may not be verified when the study period is extended.\n\nConsidering the other study outcomes, an improved educational level regarding the disease was identified  (Fioravanti et al., 2015) , as well as improvements in health-related outcomes  (Byrne et al., 2018)  and reduced sitting times  (Bailey et al., 2020)  with the use of the assessed technologies. Regarding usability outcomes, the authors reported good acceptability and usability  (Hartzler et al., 2016) , and a score between 73.75 and 75 was also described, which is considered good  (Balsa et al., 2020; Hartzler et al., 2016) . The patients also reported satisfaction with the performance, content, size of the items, and app content  (Adu et al., 2020b) . A study that intended to assess whether the new version of the app was better than the previous one found that the patients recognized that the meal input through photos was improved  (Waki et al., 2015) .\n\nIn addition to primary outcomes, about a third of the studies also reported the assessment of secondary outcomes, namely diabetes distress  (Batch et al., 2021; Quinn et al., 2011) , glucose control (J. Lin et al., 2020a; Shamanna et al., 2020) , cardiometabolic health  (Bailey et al., 2020; Shamanna et al., 2020) , clinical values  (Gong et al., 2020; Quinn et al., 2011; Shamanna et al., 2020) , dietary habits  (Holmen et al., 2014) , physical activity  (Batch et al., 2021; Holmen et al., 2014; Shamanna et al., 2020) , depressive symptoms  (Holmen et al., 2014; Quinn et al., 2011) , quality of life  (Holmen et al., 2014) , hypoglycemia (J. Lin et al., 2020a)  and medication adherence  (Batch et al., 2021) . Many of these outcomes did not differ significantly from the baseline or control group. However, in the study by  Shamanna et al. (Shamanna et al., 2020) , the authors found a significant reduction in the secondary outcomes analyzed (insulin resistance, glucose, C-peptide, heart rate, number of steps taken per day), except for the number of hours of sleep. Similarly, diabetes self-efficacy  (Batch et al., 2021)  and selfmanagement  (Holmen et al., 2014)  were improved, as well as a medium effect in the percentage of body fat and glucose tolerance was identified  (Bailey et al., 2020) . Lastly, Lin et al. also identified a significant decrease in the incidence of hypoglycemia compared to baseline and the proportion of patients achieving the fasting blood glucose target. Some results were also unexpected, as mentioned in the study by  Holmen et al.,  where they found that the older participants (patients more than 63 years old) were more likely to use the mobile app compared to the younger participants (below 63 years old)  (Holmen et al., 2014) .\n\nThough type 2 diabetes is a disease in which changing behaviors, namely the adoption of a healthy lifestyle contributes to an improvement in associated complications and many of the articles mention that behavioral changes must be carried out, the truth is that few of them mention if their strategy was based on a theory of behavior change  (Adu et al., 2020a (Adu et al., , 2020b;; Bailey et al., 2020; Balsa et al., 2020; Fioravanti et al., 2015; Gong et al., 2020; Holmen et al., 2014)  (the authors assumed that if they were not described in the paper, then a theory of behavior change was not followed). In addition, although some articles not described that a particular behavioral theory was used, their authors stated that they used strategies related to behavior change or the behavioral change component was in charge of a company specialized in the matter  (Batch et al., 2021; Byrne et al., 2018; Fico et al., 2019) . Of the papers that explicitly mention a behavior change theory, the theories most commonly used were the Transtheoretical model of behavior change, the Information Motivation Behavioral skills (IMBS) model, the Behavior change wheel (BCW) framework, and the Theory of Planned Behavior."

      "title": "3.3.. Recommendation systems",
      "text": "All applications focused essentially on three main categories, namely food (n = 19), physical activity (n = 15), and medication (n = 9). However, most applications had more than one category at a time.\n\nTherefore, the functioning of the application and, consequently, the application's recommendation system is related to its main focus/category of action. The majority of the apps provided tailored recommendations regarding their main focus, related to the food consumed by the user, their practice of physical activity, medication taken, or their blood glucose levels. In this way, the coaching provided depends on the user's data entered into the app. The users of the included apps can receive feedback  (Adu et al., 2020a (Adu et al., , 2020b;; Balsa et al., 2020; Batch et al., 2021; Fico et al., 2019; Fioravanti et al., 2015; Gong et al., 2020; Holmen et al., 2014) , motivational messages and supportive advice  (Fico et al., 2019; Holmen et al., 2014; Kobayashi et al., 2019; J. Lin et al., 2020a; Quinn et al., 2011; Waki et al., 2015) , personalized recommendations  (Desveaux et al., 2018; Gong et al., 2020; Hartzler et al., 2016; Kobayashi et al., 2019; Lim et al., 2011 Lim et al., , 2016 ), reminders at a specific time of the day  (Byrne et al., 2018; J. Lin et al., 2020a)  and also alerts when some values exceed the recommended limit  (Bailey et al., 2020; Sunil Kumar et al., 2021) . Additionally, but less frequently, the existence of conversational agents  (Balsa et al., 2020; Gong et al., 2020)  and recipe and food suggestions  (Alrige et al., 2020; Norouzi et al., 2018; Shamanna et al., 2020)  were identified. Only two works reported using gamification techniques in their apps  (Batch et al., 2021; Gong et al., 2020) , particularly the achievement of points when a task was completed and the creation of several challenges in the form of games.\n\nRegarding the type of recommendation used, only the study by Nourozi et al. explained that their snack recommender system used collaborative filtering, a knowledge-based approach, constraint-based reasoning, and a roulette wheel algorithm  (Norouzi et al., 2018) . In the other papers, the proposed systems are essentially based on the inference of logical rules, so they are considered expert systems. Additionally, the authors did not specify the nomenclature of the type of recommendation system used, however, the authors of this systematic review through the identification of some terms, such as \"evidencebased\"  (Quinn et al., 2011)  knowledge-based\"  (Adu et al., 2020a) , \"rules engine\"  (Adu et al., 2020b; Alrige et al., 2020; Balsa et al., 2020; Fico et al., 2019; Fioravanti et al., 2015) , \"clinical decision support system\"  (Lim et al., 2011 (Lim et al., , 2016)) , \"according to the recommendations/guidelines\"  (Gong et al., 2020)  classified the systems included in these papers as an expert system (rule-based). As there is no clear explanation for the remaining systems in this regard, it was assumed that they did not report this information and that it was missing."

      "text": "Regarding the assessment of the quality of the articles included in this systematic review, it appears that there is some variability between studies. Only two articles with a study design, such as a randomized controlled trial, had a low risk of bias rating (Table  2 ). Table  3  shows that most of the other study types had at least a rating of moderate risk of bias or some concerns, indicating that their methodological quality is not comparable to a clinical trial. These results are in line with two umbrella reviews that aimed to consolidate the evidence of the effectiveness of mHealth interventions for patients with diabetes and verified that the methodological quality of the systematic reviews in that field was suboptimal  (Kitsiou, Par\u00e9, Jaana, & Gerber, 2017; Marcolino et al., 2018) ."

      "title": "4.. Discussion",
      "text": "We performed a systematic review to assess recommendation systems that intended to promote behavior change without direct human intervention at the time the feedback is provided and to verify if their use improves health-related outcomes. Of the 2186 papers initially identified in the query, 22 met inclusion criteria, although three papers were related to the same study/recommendation system but with different aims.\n\nThere is some evidence that direct intervention by healthcare professionals is essential to achieve the desired clinical efficacy in mHealth strategies  (Muralidharan, Ranjani, Anjana, Allender, & Mohan, 2017) . Therefore, with this work, we intended to assess whether these interventions were equally effective when there is no human intervention and consequently the personalized feedback is automatically provided. So, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study that synthesizes information regarding recommendation systems in the field of diabetes type 2 with systems that provide personalized feedback, have a behavioral component, and where the health professional does not interact directly with the patient. Only studies in which health professionals did not participate directly when the feedback was provided to the patient were included. Papers that only included apps with an educational purpose were not included because they needed to provide recommendations based on the individual's interaction with the app. For this systematic review, we included all types of studies without quality restrictions, thus resulting in a comprehensive search, multi-database, and a comprehensive query, which we consider to be a strength of this work.\n\nIt must be pointed out that in some of the papers, more than one population was included, that is, not just type 2 diabetics but also type 1 diabetes or prediabetes patients. Hence, in the studies where there was a clear distinction in the number of participants who were type 2 diabetics, only this number was considered since this was our population of interest. All the 22 included papers referred to the last decade, showing that the development of these recommendation systems in the previous years is increasing, in particular, regarding diabetes type 2 disease, perhaps due to the development of mobile technologies. Additionally, the interest in the scientific community has been growing since about half of the papers date from the year 2020. Articles from practically all continents except Africa were identified despite only 22 papers being included in this systematic review. The USA had the most significant number of articles, showing that this type of system is applied worldwide. However, it can be concluded that this type of system is still not recurrent in low-income countries, as previously identified by  Marcolino et al. (Marcolino et al., 2018)  and by a recent bibliometric analysis  (Pinto, Martinho, Vieira, Ramalho, & Freitas, 2022) . As there are two papers on the same technology for three different apps, in particular, from Spain  (Fico et al., 2019; Fioravanti et al., 2015) , South Korea  (Lim et al., 2011 (Lim et al., , 2016)) , and Australia  (Adu et al., 2020a (Adu et al., , 2020b)) , these countries should only count one time, considering the ranking of publishing countries.\n\nConsidering the results, the majority of the papers have documented an improvement in the evaluated outcomes, in particular regarding the values of the HbA1c, however, three authors did not find significant differences  (Batch et al., 2021; Gong et al., 2020; Holmen et al., 2014) . These latter, despite having focused on a behavioral theory (which could help achieve better results), exhibited a longer period of study duration (one year), which suggests that when the duration of the study is longer, it becomes more challenging to observe the differences that were found in other studies with shorter durations  (Pradal-Cano et al., 2020) . Additionally, these papers were classified as having some bias in their elaboration, which may have affected the results obtained (i.e., no observation of significant differences), and the use of the ROBINS I tool may have had some limitations in its use, due to the diversity of types of articles included. The less favorable results could also be because type 2 diabetic patients are often older since the disease usually develops in the fourth or fifth decade of life (M. A. B.  Khan et al., 2020) . In this way, these individuals may have fewer technological skills  (Martinho, Carneiro, Corchado Rodr\u00edguez, & Marreiros, 2020) . To confirm this hypothesis, in future studies, it would be interesting to evaluate the knowledge of the participants in dealing with technologies and assess if those who drop out more are those who have less technological literacy, as according to Skrovseth and colleagues the most common reason for quitting the use of mobile apps is related to difficulties to use the Table  2  Risk of bias of randomized controlled trials according to RoB2. smartphone  (Skr\u00f8vseth, \u00c5rsand, Godtliebsen, & Hartvigsen, 2012) . However, a study developed by  Fico et al. (Fico et al., 2019)  identified that type 2 diabetic patients achieved a comparable level of of the mobile app compared to type 1 diabetic patients, which were younger. The same occurred in the study conducted by Holmen et al., who presented that those over 63 years old are more likely to use the app than the younger participants  (Holmen et al., 2014) . This suggests that these technologies may be equally or at least successful in older individuals.\n\nThe evaluation of usability in studies of this kind is also essential since, when gathering user feedback, the mobile application can be developed according to their needs, thus contributing to better usability and acceptability. This systematic review found that, in general, of the included studies, users who participated in this type of study considered that the usability was good.\n\nThis work also identified recommendation systems that provide personalized feedback through motivational messages, customized recommendations, reminders, alerts, and conversational agents. These findings were in line with the work of Marcolino et al., who found that the most popular mHealth interventions intended to change behavior through direct user feedback, using text messaging, and notifications, among others  (Marcolino et al., 2018) . Another relevant factor is that the most common recommendation system was the expert system through the creation of a rule-based decision-making, often associated with nutritional recommendations, physical activity, or clinical guidelines for diabetes. This was in line with a study that concluded that in the diabetes field, this type of system is quite common  (Tran et al., 2021)  and with a scoping review that concluded that the most popular applied algorithm of the recommendation technologies in the domain of health recommender systems was the knowledge-based approach  (Cai et al., 2022) . However, most of the authors should have reported more information regarding the functioning of the systems, and they should be more explicit since there was a lack of information both at a conceptual level and in the development of the system itself. Authors should include a more precise definition of algorithms, techniques, and even the knowledge itself considered, which in many cases was simply mentioned and not detailed.\n\nDespite the authors of the papers not specifying the used type of system, the authors of this systematic review, through a careful reading of the papers, according to some information provided in the text, concluded that the majority of these articles displayed an expert system based on rules. However, the lack of information regarding this topic hampered a clear extraction of information regarding this matter, which means that in about half of the works it was not possible to extract relevant information."

Most of them highlight the small sample size and the limited duration of the study to verify changes in the outcome (for example, HbA1c) as well as the short period of use for the case of studies that evaluated the usability of the mobile applications. In addition, selection bias was identified (only patients interested in the investigation, patients who knew how to use smartphones, and who had access to the internet could be included).

      "text": "Risk of bias of non-randomized controlled trials according to ROBINS-I.\n\ninability of the study to be blind to the participants were also identified as potential limitations. Moreover, the authors of this work also highlight some other limitations. First, some relevant literature could have been missed, or publication bias led to underreporting, considering our study questions. Second, many studies could have adjusted their outcomes to confounding variables, for example, studies that specifically monitored diet and physical activity could have assessed whether the individual was simultaneously being monitored by a nutritionist or attending a gym while participating in the research or even if they use another fitness app, since the results obtained may not have been an exclusive result of the application and its recommendation system. Third, while the studies included a recommendation system to improve study outcomes, not all explicitly followed a behavioral theory, a limitation previously recognized by  Kitsiou et al. (Kitsiou et al., 2017)  in their work. Fourth, as there was significant heterogeneity between the studies in terms of duration, the number of participants, location, and the average age of participants, it becomes challenging to make a clear comparison between studies and extract information that can be extrapolated. Fifth, the selection of participants was based on technological literacy criteria since most participants had to have a smartphone and the knowledge to use it. In this way, the results may not be generalized to the entire diabetic population but to those with similar characteristics. Although, this selection bias may have contributed to a greater relevance of the study to the participants  (Porter et al., 2016)  and may have contributed to a decrease in follow-up losses. Finally, a meta-analysis was not performed as we identified a substantial heterogeneity between the study outcomes and characteristics. Thus, all these limitations may impact the generalization of the results, that is, the external validity. However, this work highlights important and relevant results on the topic of analysis. We acknowledge that not all the articles presented an excellent quality assessment, necessitating a cautious interpretation of our findings, particularly those related to the improvement of health outcomes. Despite this, it is noteworthy that the sum of the participants across these studies exceeds thousands, which may bolster the reliability of our conclusions. However, we deem it of utmost importance that more high-quality research be conducted to corroborate these findings. Specifically, additional studies with a longer duration would provide valuable contributions to this field of research."

      "title": "5.. Conclusion",
      "text": "Most studies integrating a recommendation system into their technological approach have reported positive effects. However, these effects did not maintain statistical significance in long-term investigations, reflecting the complexities inherent in such interventions. Yet, these findings remain encouraging. Future research necessitates a rigorous and comprehensive approach, one that extends beyond the clinical component to incorporate key explanatory variables at the behavioral level. Given the myriad of factors that could influence the observed outcomes, or lack thereof, this broader perspective is essential. Additionally, the study design should strive for an extended follow-up period, ideally through robust frameworks like randomized controlled trials. This consideration is of paramount importance, as behavioral changes are challenging to achieve in a short time frame. Establishing a new routine, and consequently observing expected results, may take several months. In conclusion, while our systematic review underscores the potential of recommendation systems in promoting behavioral change among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus, it also highlights the urgent need for more comprehensive, long-term research. The future success of these systems depends on our ability to understand the broad spectrum of influencing factors, thereby informing the development of more effective, patient-centric interventions."
