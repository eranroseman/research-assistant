  "title": "Effectiveness of a mHealth Lifestyle Program With Telephone Support (TXT2BFiT) to Prevent Unhealthy Weight Gain in Young Adults: Randomized Controlled Trial",
  "abstract": "Background: Weight gained in young adulthood often persists throughout later life with associated chronic disease risk. Despite this, current population prevention strategies are not specifically designed for young adults. Objective: We designed and assessed the efficacy of an mHealth prevention program, TXT2BFiT, in preventing excess weight gain and improving dietary and physical activity behaviors in young adults at increased risk of obesity and unhealthy lifestyle choices. Methods: A two-arm, parallel-group randomized controlled trial was conducted. Subjects and analyzing researchers were blinded. A total of 250 18-to 35-year-olds with a high risk of weight gain, a body mass index (BMI) of 23.0 to 24.9 kg/m 2 with at least 2 kg of weight gain in the previous 12 months, or a BMI of 25.0 to 31.9 kg/m 2 were randomized to the intervention or control group. In the 12-week intervention period, the intervention group received 8 text messages weekly based on the transtheoretical model of behavior change, 1 email weekly, 5 personalized coaching calls, a diet booklet, and access to resources and mobile phone apps on a website. Control group participants received only 4 text messages and printed dietary and physical activity guidelines. Measured body weight and height were collected at baseline and at 12 weeks. Outcomes were assessed via online surveys at baseline and at 12 weeks, including self-reported weight and dietary and physical activity measures. Results: A total of 214 participants-110 intervention and 104 control-completed the 12-week intervention period. A total of 10 participants out of 250 (4.0%)-10 intervention and 0 control-dropped out, and 26 participants (10.4%)-5 intervention and 21 control-did not complete postintervention online surveys. Adherence to coaching calls and delivery of text messages was over 90%. At 12 weeks, the intervention group were 2.2 kg (95% CI 0.8-3.6) lighter than controls (P=.005). Intervention participants consumed more vegetables (P=.009), fewer sugary soft drinks (P=.002), and fewer energy-dense takeout meals (P=.001) compared to controls. They also increased their total physical activity by 252.5 MET-minutes (95% CI 1.2-503.8, P=.05) and total physical activity by 1.3 days (95% CI 0.5-2.2, P=.003) compared to controls.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "More than 35% of adults globally are overweight or obese, and in developed countries the peak prevalence of obesity is moving to younger ages  [1] . For example, younger Americans and Australians are gaining more weight than any other adult age group  [2] [3] [4] . As body mass index (BMI) exceeds 23 kg/m 2 , risks of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, diabetes, osteoarthritis, and chronic kidney disease increase  [1] . The Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) cohort study reported that weight maintenance over time (both normal weight and overweight) in young adults protects against cardiovascular risk, but weight gain increases the risk  [5] . Thus, interventions focused on prevention of weight gain in overweight young adults may help prevent obesity and its associated health consequences  [6] .\n\nCoordinated prevention approaches aimed at improving detrimental lifestyle behaviors have been proposed to prevent obesity  [7, 8] . Compared with other age groups, young adults eat the least amount of fruits and vegetables  [9, 10] , drink the most sugar-sweetened beverages (SSB)  [11] , more frequently eat food prepared outside the home (ie, takeout food)  [12] , and demonstrate declines in physical activity  [13] [14] [15] . These adverse behavioral lifestyle choices predict excessive weight gain and increased risk of chronic disease later in life  [16] .\n\nSeveral recent prevention programs have shown short-term efficacy in young adults to prevent further weight gain  [17] , but few investigated the use of mHealth (ie, mobile or cellular phone) technology. Advantages of such technology include its wide reach and, once created, its low costs compared with health professional time. The 18-to 29-year-old age group is also the most likely age group to own a mobile phone, with 83% ownership in the US  [18] . Interventions delivered via short message service (SMS) text messaging show promise in positively impacting health-related behavior change  [19, 20] . Our previous pilot study demonstrated the feasibility of delivering an mHealth lifestyle program  [21] . Participants in the intervention group decreased their body weight and SSB intake and increased their physical activity and vegetable consumption, although changes were not significant. Qualitative feedback facilitated improvements to the program and informed the development of the TXT2BFiT mHealth program aimed at improving weight management and weight-related dietary and physical activity behaviors among young adults.\n\nHere we report on the efficacy of a randomized controlled trial (RCT) of a larger mHealth lifestyle program, TXT2BFiT, among young adults deemed at high risk for development of obesity. We hypothesized that compared with young adults assigned to a control condition, those who received the TXT2BFiT mHealth intervention would maintain or lose a modest amount of weight and improve lifestyle behaviors."

All study materials were designed specifically for use in this study only. The trial was approved by the University Human Research Ethics Committee in September 2012 (approval number 15226) and all the participants gave written informed consent. The trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (ACTRN12612000924853). Both the protocol and recruitment methods have been previously published  [22] .

Eligible participants were deemed at risk of excess weight gain if they met the following inclusion criteria: had a BMI of 25.0 to 31.9 kg/m 2 , or 23.0 to 24.9 kg/m 2 with reported weight gain greater than 2 kg over the previous 12 months; had a fruit intake of less than two servings daily; had a vegetable intake of less than five servings daily; had an SSB intake of at least 1 L weekly; had energy-dense meals prepared away from home (ie, takeout food) more than once per week; and/or engaged in moderate-intensity physical activity of less than 60 minutes daily. Individuals were excluded if they were pregnant or planning to fall pregnant within the study period, were enrolled in an alternate weight loss program, had lost greater than 10 kg in the past 3 months, taken medications that have caused weight gain of greater than 2 kg, had medical conditions that precluded following dietary or physical activity recommendations, and/or did not speak English. Participants were also required to have a mobile phone capable of receiving text messages and accessing the Internet at least once a week.\n\nBased on our previous meta-analysis  [6] , it appeared that a difference of 1.7 kg could be expected. The sample size required for detection of a difference of 2 kg with 80% power, significance level of .05, 10 kg standard deviation, and a correlation between baseline and final weight of .8, was 354 subjects after allowing for a 20% dropout rate. Due to a slower-than-expected recruitment rate, and with time and funding constraints, recruitment was stopped at 250 participants."

Body weight (kg) and height (cm) data were collected to calculate BMI (kg/m 2 ) at baseline via both measured and self-report methods. Participants' GPs used a standardized protocol to measure body weight to the nearest 0.1 kg and height to the nearest 0.1 cm at baseline  [25] . Participants in both arms were invited for an optional in-person body weight (kg) and height (cm) measurement at the University Metabolic Facility within a 2-week window following the 12-week intervention completion (ie, weeks 13 and 14). Measures were taken by two higher-degree research students blinded to participant allocation.\n\nOnline surveys were administered at baseline and within a 2-week window following the 12-week intervention completion (ie, weeks 13 and 14). Data collected included self-reported weight (kg) and height (cm); short categorical questions to assess usual weekly intake of SSB  [26] , daily intake of fruits and vegetables  [26] , and weekly takeout meals  [27] ; and questions about physical activity in the previous 7 days using the short-form International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ)  [28] . The IPAQ was scored using established methods  [29]  and data were reported as a continuous measure in metabolic equivalent of task (MET)-minutes per week. All data were reported by participants via the online deidentified survey website, SurveyMonkey, from which data were downloaded for analysis.\n\nEngagement with the intervention was assessed using text message replies and number of coaching calls completed. Intervention participants were asked to reply \"OK\" to 16 messages in the 12 weeks and control participants were asked to reply \"OK\" to all 4 text messages. Text message delivery reports were created from the text message service provider, My MessageMedia, for delivery status and replies. Detailed records of all coaching calls were collated in a database. The 12-week postintervention survey also asked participants about their access to, and use of, program materials."

Support resources included \"easy, healthy eating on a budget,\" \"emergency meal tool kit,\" \"meal planning worksheet,\" \"commit yourself: physical activity planner,\" \"tips for take-out meals,\" \"seasonal guide to fruit and vegetables,\" and \"staying healthy over the holidays.\" Text messages were scheduled by two higher-degree research students. The text messages, based on the transtheoretical model of behavior change  [32] , consisted of 2 per week for each of the four behaviors-SSB, fruits and vegetables, physical activity, and food prepared away from home/takeout-for a total of 8 messages, weekly, tailored to the participant's stage of readiness to change  [22]  and sent using the My MessageMedia program. Two accredited practicing dietitians conducted the coaching calls according to a standardized protocol and allowed the participants to set goals, and to discuss barriers, enablers, and their progress. Each call lasted approximately 10 to 15 minutes, with 25 minutes allocated for the initial coaching call. The mobile phone apps were educational, for example, providing nutritional information on SSB and takeout meals, providing serving sizes for fruits and vegetables, and allowing self-monitoring of participants' behavior. One email was sent each week reiterating the information in the text messages and included links to the mobile phone apps to remind participants.\n\nIntervention participants were also mailed a printed 18-page booklet containing the two-page control handout summarizing the Australian National Dietary and Physical Activity Guidelines  [33, 34] . Additional information included sample meal plans, recommendations for daily servings from the core food groups with example serving sizes  [34] , and information about the four target behaviors addressed by the program-physical activity and sedentary behavior, intake of fruits and vegetables, intake of energy-dense takeout meals prepared away from home, and SSB intake."

Secondary outcomes that were continuous-physical activity MET-minutes and physical activity days-were also analyzed using analysis of covariance models. Robust regression models were used for analyses where residuals indicated nonnormality. Secondary outcomes that were categorical-fruit and vegetable servings per day, SSB consumption per week, and energy-dense takeout meal intake per week-were analyzed using Mantel-Haenszel chi-square tests stratified by GP clinic and gender. The analysis used the \"intention-to-treat\" principle with multiple imputations to account for missing data. Five imputed datasets were created and the results for continuous outcomes pooled using Rubin's rules. Chi-square statistics were pooled, and P values estimated, using the method described by Li et al  [35] . A P value <.05 was considered statistically significant. Researchers analyzing participant outcomes were blinded to participant allocation.\n\nWe also compared baseline characteristics and baseline primary or secondary outcomes between completers and noncompleters, and between in-person weigh-in attenders and nonattenders, using chi-square tests for categorical variables and independent-sample t tests for continuous variables.

      "text": "This 12-week TXT2BFiT mHealth intervention was effective in preventing unhealthy weight gain, resulting in modest weight loss and improvement in lifestyle behaviors. Compared with control participants, intervention participants consumed more vegetables and less SSB, consumed fewer energy-dense meals prepared away from home, and increased their physical activity, with increased total and walking days of physical activity. As far as we are aware, this is the first reported trial of a multi-component mobile phone-based program conducted in young adults.\n\nParticipants in the intervention program weighed 2.2 kg less than control participants at 12 weeks. The prevention of weight gain is an important public health priority for this population, given the likelihood of weight gain reported by prior observational studies in young adult populations  [37, 38] . Furthermore, young adults have been born into an increasingly \"obesogenic environment\" and are at a greater risk of becoming obese  [4] . If there is no effort to change these behavioral patterns, it is likely that young adults and subsequent generations will have a higher incidence of overweight and obesity.\n\nA greater number of intervention participants reported increasing vegetable servings compared with controls. While recommendations for increased fruits and vegetables alone may not prevent weight gain  [39] , intervention participants also reported reductions in energy-dense meals prepared away from home and in SSB intake, and further increased their physical activity.\n\nMost of the recent weight gain prevention interventions in young adults have targeted improvements in healthy eating and physical activity through in-person group interventions  [17] . Two previous intervention studies in young adults were conducted via an online tutorial-style platform  [40, 41] . Green et al conducted a 3-month online curriculum-designed program based on nondiet principles, with weekly goal setting to increase fruit and vegetable intake and increase physical activity  [40] . Intervention participants increased fruit and vegetable intake and increased physical activity compared to controls, however, no significant change in weight outcomes resulted. A shorter social cognitive theory-based intervention of 6 weeks by Gow et al focused on diet and physical activity habits pertinent to the transition period to college  [41] . BMI was lower in the intervention group participating in the online activities and receiving weekly emails, with no effects on diet and physical activity outcomes. Other studies investigating the use of technology in the prevention of weight gain for young adults have published protocol papers, but there have been no reports of efficacy to date  [42] .\n\nThis study was innovative in the use of text messages, already demonstrated as successful in older adults in combination with coaching telephone calls  [43] . This study design did not test the efficacy of the individual components, but the engagement data suggested that the coaching calls and text messages were useful to participants, with 100% and 90.9% reporting having used these components, respectively. A text message intervention in normal-weight young adults showed messages based on a habit framework can improve fruit consumption, and simply reminding young adults to be conscious of their food choices may be sufficient to improve their overall vegetable consumption  [44] . Costs of delivering a mobile program could be reduced without coaching calls, but our previous pilot intervention did not detect effectiveness in dietary change with text messages alone, without coaching calls.\n\nAn important strength of this study was low attrition (14.4% at 12 weeks), and the interventions were delivered according to protocol, with 92% of coaching calls completed and only 2.3% of SMS text messages failing to send. Primary health care facilities and public advertisements increased reach in recruitment. This study also recruited more males than is often expected in studies of this type  [45] . Another strength included"

The use of GPs to measure height and weight on their scales could introduce measurement error. However, GP clinic was one of the strata for participant randomization, and observer and equipment error would have been distributed equally across groups. Therefore, measurement bias should not have impacted the results from the analysis of covariance. It is acknowledged that using GP scales for baseline weight and clinic scales with a trained dietitian for follow-up measures was not ideal. As self-reported measures were used for all studied outcomes, the data may be biased. Self-report may underestimate weight, but has been shown to accurately identify overweight and/or obesity in the majority of a sample of young people  [46] . An element of social desirability might influence reporting of lifestyle behaviors. Both groups were provided dietary and physical activity guidelines, however, greater significant improvements in intervention participants were seen in this study. Further, the sample was mostly well educated and from higher socioeconomic areas, which may influence the generalizability of the results  [47] ."

      "text": "In conclusion, intervening in the lives of young adults with unhealthy lifestyle behaviors, who have an increased risk of weight gain and developing obesity, appears to have a beneficial impact on preventing weight gain. While the short-term efficacy of the 12-week TXT2BFiT intervention program is promising, maintenance of outcomes in the longer term will be evaluated at 9 months. The potentially wide reach and low delivery costs of using mHealth, coupled with the growing problem of obesity in younger adulthood, means translation and implementation of this program to the community at large also warrants further consideration."
