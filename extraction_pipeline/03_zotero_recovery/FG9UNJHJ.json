Depression and anxiety symptomology will differ among groups at 3 months post randomization, with those having access to the novel mHealth intervention reporting lower scores on the subscales of the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale (HADS).\n\n3.

We therefore explored the plausibility of the MCAR assumption by regressing the primary outcomes on the number of follow-up attempts needed before a response was recorded.
