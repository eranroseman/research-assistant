  "title": "Efficacy of supermarket and web-based interventions for improving dietary quality: a randomized, controlled trial",
  "abstract": "Dietary interventions may best be delivered at supermarkets, which offer convenience, accessibility, full food inventories and, increasingly, in-store registered dietitians, online shopping and delivery services. In collaboration with a large retail supermarket chain, we conducted a multisite supermarket and web-based intervention targeting nutrition trial (no. NCT03895580), randomizing participants (n = 247 (139 women and 108 men)) 2:2:1 to two levels of dietary education (Strategy 1 and Strategy 2) or an enhanced control group that included educational components beyond the routine standard of care. Both Strategies 1 and 2 included individualized, in-person, dietitian-led, purchasing data-guided interventions. Strategy 2 also included online tools for shopping, home delivery, selection of healthier purchases, meal planning and healthy recipes. The primary endpoint was change in dietary approaches to stop hypertension (DASH) score (a measure of adherence to the DASH diet) from baseline to 3 months. The primary endpoint was met because, at 3 months, the DASH score increased by 4.7 more for the combined Strategy 1 and Strategy 2 groups than for the control group (95% confidence interval (CI) (0.9, 8.5), P = 0.02). In a prespecified hierarchical test, at 3 months, DASH score increased by 3.8 more for the Strategy 2 group than for the Strategy 1 group (95% CI (0.8, 6.9), P = 0.01). This trial demonstrates the efficacy of data-guided, supermarket-based, dietary interventions and modern online shopping tools in improving dietary quality in a free-living, community-based population. The trial also demonstrates the opportunity for academic investigators to collaborate with retailers to design and rigorously test comprehensive healthcare interventions. Supermarkets with expansive footprints and evolving healthcare operations may offer new opportunities to expand clinical care services beyond traditional medical settings. Intrinsically, grocery stores may be partners well suited to addressing unmet public health challenges, including unhealthy diets 1 . Over the past 10 years, nutrition counseling provided by registered dietitians has been introduced in supermarket-based retail clinics 2,3 . New retail technologies may further address barriers to healthy eating, including websites and mobile applications for online food shopping, home grocery delivery and nutrition support.

Each intervention was guided and individualized by data on each participant's food purchases. The first intervention focused on the in-store shopping environment, while the second added online shopping, home delivery and other technologies that might improve the quality of grocery purchases and dietary intake. To date, research collaborations between academia and supermarkets and grocery stores have been very limited in regard to rigorous testing of new strategies aimed at improving dietary quality."

      "text": "From March 2019 to the end of February 2021, 267 participants in total were randomized (Fig.  1 ). Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the study was temporarily interrupted due to safety concerns about continued in-person intervention delivery. Study leadership withdrew 20 recently randomized participants who had not yet reached 3 months of follow-up (that is, the time point at which data required for the primary endpoint were collected). We prespecified that these participants would be excluded from all subsequent analyses. The overall cohort, including for assessment of the primary endpoint, consisted of 247 participants. For subsequent prespecified COVID-19 analyses, the prepandemic subgroup consisted of 109 participants.\n\nIn the overall cohort, 91% of participants provided 3-month dietary intake data. In Strategies 1 and 2, 96% of participants attended one or more intervention visits, with 80% attending all six scheduled intervention visits. To understand the disruption due to the pandemic, study conduct is also reported separately for the prepandemic and pandemic cohorts (Supplementary Tables  8  and  9 ). In the prepandemic cohort (n = 109), intervention visit completion was 97.8% (264 of 270 total visits) in Strategy 1 and 98.4% (248 of 252 total visits) in Strategy 2. In the pandemic cohort (n = 138), intervention visit Article  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41591-022-02077-7 persistently increased DASH score of 7.5 (95% CI (5.7, 9.3), P < 0.0001).

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "In SuperWIN, all three study groups demonstrated increases in adherence to the DASH dietary pattern from baseline to 3 months, along with persistence of increased DASH adherence at 6 months. On top of a data-enhanced medical nutrition therapy session, the addition of an individualized, food-purchasing, data-guided, 'teaching in the aisles' nutrition intervention increased DASH adherence. Introduction to online shopping and technologies to improve purchases, meal planning and recipe quality further increased DASH adherence. Participant engagement before the pandemic was remarkably high for a community-based study. This was reflected by extremely high visit attendance and near-perfect dietary intake and biometrics collection. Even during the disruption of the pandemic  6, 7  , visit attendance and data collection remained comparable to prepandemic community-based studies  8  .\n\nGlobally, suboptimal diet is accountable for more deaths than any other risk factor across age, sex and socioeconomic status  9  . While the scores used to measure DASH adherence have varied across studies, the association between DASH scores and clinical outcomes has been consistently demonstrated  10  . As an example, a recent meta-analysis found a linear dose-response for each five-point increase in DASH score and associations with lower all-cause, cardiovascular (CV), stroke and cancer mortality of 5, 4, 3 and 3%, respectively  11  . In both the PREDIMED trial and Western and non-Western observational studies, it has been shown that even small measures of increased diet quality result in large CV risk reductions over time  [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17]  . While the validation studies of DASH were performed in a highly controlled environment (that is, feeding studies), the PREMIER trial, which enrolled free-living participants, demonstrated the impact on DASH adherence through an intensive 18-visit, 6-month program conducted at academic centers  18, 19  . The 2021 update to the 2006 American Heart Association (AHA) guidelines continues to recommend evidence-based, heart-healthy dietary patterns, including DASH  20  .\n\nDespite longstanding recommendations, adoption of DASH across the United States 21 and many other countries 1 remains low. From 2007 to 2012, using a different DASH adherence score and the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, it was estimated that, in the United States, individuals with hypertension scored only about 2.6-2.7 from a total score of 9 (ref.  22 ). A 2019 AHA Science Advisory concluded that 'immediate action is needed' to innovate new approaches to close this gap  23  . Specific recommendations included creation of new partnerships (including with retailers) for sponsored research. The need for research on the health benefits of online shopping and smart technologies (for example, nutrition and health applications) was also highlighted. We incorporated several such approaches through a supermarket-based partnership. SuperWIN may now be able to extend the findings of previous dietary trials through an innovative, dietitian-driven, grocery store-based model, with technologies that facilitate broad convenience and accessibility.\n\nIn SuperWIN, the interventions increased DASH score by a clinically meaningful 4.7 points from baseline to 3 months compared with the control group. The control group experienced a 5.8-point increase in DASH score, which is larger than the change in DASH (or DASH food group) adherence for standard-of-care interventions reported in other recent clinical trials  24, 25  . It is likely that the standard of care delivered in SuperWIN had a more favorable impact on DASH adherence due to\n\nTable 3 | Between-group differences in DASH score, primary and secondary comparisons DASH score Strategies 1 and 2 versus control mean (95% CI) P value a Strategy 2 versus strategy 1 mean (95% CI) P value b Change (baseline to 3 months) 4.7 (0.9, 8.5) 0.02 3.8 (0.8, 6.9) 0.01 Change (baseline to 6 months) 3.1 (-1.0, 7.3) 0.14 1.8 (-1.9, 5.5) 0.34 Intervention effect is difference in mean change in outcome and 95% confidence interval. a P value from baseline to follow-up time point, whether Strategies 1 and 2 combined increased DASH score compared with control. b P value from baseline to follow-up time point, whether Strategy 2 increased DASH score compared with Strategy 1.

At 6 months, while DASH scores decreased slightly, they remained significantly increased from baseline by 4.4 (0.6, 8.1), 6.6 (4.0, 9.2) and 8.4 (5.9, 11.0) in the control, Strategy 1 and Strategy 2 groups, respectively. Additional research may identify opportunities to increase not only the initial post-intervention dietary improvements, but also to maximize their persistence over long-term follow-up. Opportunities include: (1) addition of more in-person visits, (2) use of telenutrition visits and (3) continued delivery of updated purchasing behavior data to the participant and/or dietitian.\n\nThe rapid yearly increase in online shopping across all age groups in the United States 26 may provide unique opportunities to address barriers to shopping and making better food choices. In addition, utilization of mobile health-focused applications in patients with CV risk factors is increasing  27  . In SuperWIN, the addition of online technologies increased DASH score by a clinically meaningful 3.8 points from baseline compared with education that did not incorporate them. Considering that SuperWIN enrolled a 'late tech-adopters' population, it is possible that early tech-adopters may experience even greater dietary improvements. As online shopping becomes even more common in the United States and other countries, retail\n\nTable 4 | Change in DASH score components at 3 months Control (n = 46) mean (95% CI) Strategy 1 (n = 100) mean (95% CI) Strategy 2 (n = 101) mean (95% CI) Strategies 1 and 2 versus control mean (95% CI) P value Strategy 2 versus 1 mean (95% CI) P value Fruit servings, 1,000 kcal d -1 At baseline 1.8 (1.3, 2.3) 1.6 (1.3, 2.0) 1.3 (1.0, 1.7) Change (baseline to 3 months) 0.2 (-0.3, 0.7) 0.7 (0.4, 1.0) 1.2 (0.9, 1.5) 0.8 (0.2, 1.3) <0.01 0.5 (0, 0.9) 0.03 Vegetable servings, 1,000 kcal d -1 At baseline 3.3 (2.7, 3.8) 2.7 (2.3, 3.1) 2.7 (2.3, 3.1) Change (baseline to 3 months) 0.3 (-0.3, 0.9) 0.8 (0.4, 1.2) 0.8 (0.4, 1.2) 0.5 (-0.2, 1.2) 0.18 0 (-0.6, 0.6) 1.00 Total dairy servings, 1,000 kcal d -1 At baseline 1.7 (1.4, 2.0) 1.7 (1.5, 1.9) 1.6 (1.4, 1.8) Change (baseline to 3 months) -0.3 (-0.7, 0.1) -0.2 (-0.4, 0.1) 0 (-0.2, 0.2) 0.2 (-0.2, 0.7) 0.27 0.2 (-0.2, 0.5) 0.32 Low-fat dairy servings, 1,000 kcal d -1 At baseline 0.3 (0.2, 0.5) 0.3 (0.2, 0.4) 0.3 (0.1, 0.4) Change (baseline to 3 months) 0 (-0.2, 0.2) 0.3 (0.2, 0.4) 0.2 (0.1, 0.3) 0.3 (0.1, 0.4) <0.01 -0.1 (-0.2, 0.1) 0.43 Total grain servings, 1,000 kcal d -1\n\nAt baseline 5.5 (4.8, 6.2) 5.4 (4.9, 5.9) 5.0 (4.5, 5.

Collectively, this may offer opportunities to mitigate challenges related to poor health literacy, busy schedules, inadequate personal or public transportation, distance to the nearest grocery retailer, disability and industry marketing  28  . In 2019, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program launched its pilot program to understand whether online shopping might increase the purchase of healthy foods  29, 30  .\n\nIn the overall cohort, secondary endpoints of blood pressure, lipids and BMI were not improved by the interventions compared with the enhanced control. However, as an example, SBP decreased by -6.6 and -5.7 mmHg at 3 months in the Strategy 1 and Strategy 2 arms, respectively, while SBP remained decreased by -5.2 and -4.2 mmHg at 6 months in the Strategy 1 and Strategy 2 arms, respectively. A similar pattern was found for BMI. More research will be needed to quantify the impact of these interventions on secondary outcomes.\n\nOur trial has certain limitations. Our cohort was receiving routine primary care and was predominantly middle-aged, female, married or living with a partner and living in households with a reasonable total annual household income (for comparison, in 2020, median US household annual income was US$69,560 (ref.  31 )). The COVID-19 pandemic dramatically not only impacted clinical trials but also shopping behavior and many other aspects of our participants' lives (for example, work, childcare). In terms of evaluation of SBP, DBP and lipid changes, we did not collect data on medication doses at any time point. In addition, medication use was assessed by a survey rather than by a rigorous evaluation by the study dietitian. We also did not collect medication use at 3 months. We performed a limited number of BP measurements at each time point, which may have curtailed precision. Collectively these limitations, as well as the baseline levels in this cohort, may have reduced our ability to more rigorously assess changes in these secondary endpoints. In future, additional components (for example, exercise interventions, detailed medication assessments, medication titration or medication adherence counseling through the retail pharmacy) may be combined with 'SuperWIN-like' dietary interventions to target these outcomes.\n\nIn conclusion, all three study groups had higher DASH adherence at 3 months, which persisted until the final study assessments at 6 months. Individualized, in-person, dietitian-led nutrition education focusing on the DASH dietary pattern, guided by electronic food-purchasing data and delivered within each participant's home supermarket, increased DASH adherence. The addition of technologies for online shopping with both grocery pick-up and home delivery options, as well as food comparisons and meal preparation, increased DASH adherence. More research will be needed to better understand the effects of these interventions on downstream secondary outcomes. These findings demonstrate the importance of sponsored research with the retail industry, the opportunities to enhance dietary quality through grocery stores and retail clinics, as well as the efficacy of specific types of new interventions."

Compared with typical practice, this session was enhanced by displaying each participant's baseline dietary intake data (collected during the run-in period) via simple figures and tables. These highlighted the participant's mean servings of each DASH food group, the mean serving goals per food group, the specific foods consumed, as well as the time and location of consumption. DASH food serving goals were established based on a caloric goal for either weight maintenance or loss.\n\nParticipants randomized to Strategies 1 and 2 were scheduled for six additional in-store educational sessions performed at 2-week intervals over the next 3 months. Educational visits in Strategies 1 and 2 utilized the physical supermarket environment ('teaching within the aisles'). Strategy 2 participants were also trained by the study dietitians in a stepwise manner on the store's online shopping platform, free home delivery services and two other healthcare applications (Supplementary Table  6 ). Nutrition education themes, learning outcomes and skill-building exercises were consistent across Strategies 1 and 2. Education in Strategies 1 and 2 was guided by dietitian and participant review of each participant's updated, individualized, Kroger purchasing data (automatically collected via a store loyalty card) at the beginning of each session. These data, displayed via simple figures and tables, highlighted the purchases of food groups and specific food items, as well as counts of purchases and money spent since randomization.\n\nAll randomized participants were scheduled for in-store study assessments (interviews and biometric measurements) at baseline and at 3 and 6 months from randomization. Raw dietary intake data were collected by phone at baseline and at 3 and 6 months. Medication intake was collected via an emailed survey at baseline and at 6 months."

In this trial, DASH score was calculated from 11 component scores based on the alignment between actual intake and the DASH serving recommendations (for example, whole grains, vegetables, fruits).\n\nAt baseline and at 3 and 6 months, three 24-dietary phone recalls (two weekday and one weekend) were collected at each time point by trained dietary interviewers from the Bionutrition Center at CCHMC. Only after completion of the study were these raw dietary intake data used to calculate DASH scores. DASH scores were first calculated for individual recalls followed by calculation of a participant's mean DASH score at each time point. Use of dietary intake recalls, collection on multiple days and a comprehensive scoring system to reflect the multiple components of DASH were used to optimize measurement of DASH dietary pattern adherence.\n\nPrespecified secondary endpoints included SBP, DBP, BMI, non-HDL-C, total cholesterol and TG measured during study visits by the study dietitians at baseline and at 3 and 6 months. COVID-19 impact analyses were prespecified before database lock.
