  "abstract": "sport participation and validated instruments assessing well-being (WHO-5), depressive symptoms (BDI-II) and anxiety (SAS). Multi-level mixed effects linear regression was used to examine associations between physical activity/sport participation and mental health measures. A minority of the sample (17.9 % of boys and 10.7 % of girls; p < 0.0005) reported sufficient activity based on WHO guidelines (60 min + daily). The mean number of days Abstract In this cross-sectional study, physical activity, sport participation and associations with well-being, anxiety and depressive symptoms were examined in a large representative sample of European adolescents. A schoolbased survey was completed by 11,110 adolescents from ten European countries who took part in the SEYLE (Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe) study. The questionnaire included items assessing physical activity,",

      "text": "There is conclusive evidence that the physical health of adolescents is enhanced by frequent physical activity  [1, 2] . It is recommended that children and adolescents aged 5-17 years should accumulate at least 60 min of moderateto-vigorous activity each day  [1, 3] . However, it has been reported that 80 % of 13-15 year-olds worldwide do not achieve this amount of activity per day  [4] . Internationally, levels of physical activity have been found to decrease with age in adolescence, with girls engaging in significantly less activity than boys in most countries and regions worldwide  [5] . Possible explanations for these sex disparities include the suggestion that competitive activities may appeal more to boys, while girls may focus more on health and fitness  [6] .\n\nAn association between physical activity and mental health in children and adolescents has also been reported, but research designs are often weak and effects small to moderate  [7, 8] . A systematic review of randomised controlled trials of exercise interventions for anxiety and depression in children and adolescents reported a small effect in favour of physical activity in reducing depression and anxiety levels in the general population  [9] , while sedentary behaviour has been reported to be associated with anxiety disorder  [10] . A recent longitudinal study has reported that adolescents who engage in higher frequencies of physical activity are more resilient to developing depressive symptoms  [11] . Participation in sports has also been found to be associated with reduced levels of depression and suicidal ideation  [12, 13]  and adolescents who participate in team sports have been found to report higher levels of happiness than those who play individual sports  [14] .\n\nMental health problems are common in European adolescents. The multi-centre Saving and Empowering Young Lives in Europe (SEYLE) study reported that 5.8 % of participants met criteria for an anxiety disorder, 10.5 % met criteria for depressive disorder  [15] , while 32.3 % reported suicidal thoughts  [16] . In this study, we examined physical activity and its associations with mental health indicators in the SEYLE sample. Our objectives were to describe the frequency of physical activity and participation in sport among girls and boys and to examine associations between physical activity and sports participation and anxiety, depressive symptoms and well-being. We hypothesised that the majority of adolescents were insufficiently active according to current public health guidelines, that girls were more inactive than boys and that higher frequency of physical activity would be associated with greater well-being and lower levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms among adolescents."

The SEYLE trial is registered at the German Clinical Trials Registry, number DRKS00000214. Participants were recruited from 168 schools in ten European countries (Austria, Estonia, France, Germany, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Romania, Slovenia and Spain) and the trial evaluated school-based interventions for prevention of suicidal behaviour. Schools in the study regions were included if they were public, a minimum of 40 students aged 15 were enrolled, more than two teachers were employed to teach 15-year-old students, and no more than 60 % of students were of the same sex. All students in participating classes, including those who were aged 14 and 16, were included to avoid discrimination. Ethical approval was obtained at each study site from the appropriate local ethics committees. Full details of trial methodology, consent procedures, response rates and representativeness of the sample have been reported elsewhere  [17] . Of 232 schools approached, 168 schools (72 %) agreed to participate. Of the 27,099 pupils approached, 14,267 were not enrolled because parental or student consent was not given, and 1722 pupils were absent on the day. In the current study, baseline data were used and only adolescents for whom sex was recorded were included (n = 11,072). Of these, 6566 (59 %) were girls and 4506 were boys. The mean age of the sample was 14.8 [SD 0.84]."

When compared with accelerometry, this measure has been reported to have acceptable validity in assessing non-compliance with physical activity recommendations  [20] . The survey item assessing physical activity was as follows: \"During the past 2 weeks, on how many days were you physically active for a total of at least 60 min? For each day, add up all the time you spent in physical activity like walking, riding a bicycle etc. Do not include your physical education or gym class. Count up the days with at least 60 min of physical activity in the past 2 weeks.\" Responses ranged from 0 to 14 days."

Participants were also asked to name the sports in which they participated, with space for up to three sports to be entered. The named sports were later coded by the study team as a team sport or an individual sport/fitness activity. Team sports were classified as those that typically involved three or more players on each side who compete concurrently  [14] . If participants named at least one team sport they were classified as engaging in team sports. Participants who did not report playing any team sport but named an individual sport or other fitness activity were coded as individual sport/fitness activity. A third sub-group comprised of those who reported no participation in sport or other fitness activity. For some analyses all sports (team and individual/ fitness) were treated as one category."

      "text": "Depressive symptoms: Severity of depressive symptoms was measured using the Beck Depression Inventory II (BDI-II)  [21] . Items of this instrument assess specific symptoms of depression experienced over the preceding 2 weeks. The BDI-II includes an item measuring loss of libido which was excluded from the SEYLE questionnaire as it is considered inappropriate for adolescents in some cultural settings  [22] . Each question was scored from 0 to 3, indicating the severity of the symptom, with total scores ranging from 0 to 60. Cronbach's alpha in our sample was 0.86, indicating good internal reliability  [18] . The reliability and validity of the BDI-II have been confirmed in clinical and community samples of adolescents  [23, 24] .\n\nAnxiety symptoms: Symptoms of anxiety were assessed using the Zung Self-Rating Anxiety Scale (SAS)  [25] , a 20-item self-report questionnaire. Responses to each item range from 1 to 4 with scores ranging from 20 to 80 with higher scores indicating increased levels of anxiety. Cronbach's alpha in our sample was 0.81, indicating good internal reliability  [18] . The SAS has been shown to have good reliability and validity in samples of undergraduate students  [26] .\n\nWell-being: Well-being was assessed using the WHO-5 Well-being Index (WHO-5)  [27] , which measures positive psychological well-being. Responses to each item range from 0 to 5. These scores are summed and converted to obtain a percentage score ranging from 0 to 100, where 100 represents best possible level of well-being. Cronbach's alpha in our sample was 0.80, indicating good internal reliability. The psychometric properties of the WHO-5 have been confirmed in a large adult sample  [28]  and it has been confirmed as a valid scale for use in an adolescent sample  [29] .\n\nSocio-economic status (SES) may be a confounding factor in associations between physical activity and mental health, as family affluence has been found to be associated with physical activity levels in most countries  [30] . Although SES was not measured using a validated instrument in this study, we have used responses to the following question as a proxy measure of SES: \"Do your parents have trouble making ends meet?\" with responses categorised as \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nChronic illness and sexual intercourse were included as covariates in our multivariate analyses due to their associations with physical activity levels and mental health in our sample. The survey items included were: \"Do you suffer from a chronic illness?\" and \"Have you ever had sexual intercourse?\" with responses \"Yes\" or \"No\".\n\nCigarette smoking and alcohol use were also examined and included as covariates. These lifestyle factors have been reported to have associations with both physical activity and mental health  [31] . Smoking was assessed by the following question: \"How many cigarettes did you smoke per day, in the past 6 months?\" and \"Have you quit smoking cigarettes in the last 6 months?\". Those who reported smoking at least one cigarette per day and not having quit smoking in the previous 6 months were coded as daily smokers. All other participants were coded as non-smokers. Drinking alcohol was assessed using the following survey items: \"How often do you have a drink containing alcohol such as a half pint or 330 ml bottle of beer, cider or alcopop, a glass of wine or a shot of strong alcohol?\". Those who answered \"Never\" or \"Once a month or less\" were coded as non-drinkers, while those who responded \"2-4 times a month\", \"2-3 times a week\", \"4 or more times a week\", \"Every day\" or \"Several times a day\" were coded as alcohol drinkers.\n\nAge was also recorded and has been included as a covariate due to known associations between increasing age and decreasing frequency of physical activity  [5] ."

Within the most active group, a sub-group who reported daily physical activity was identified (Sufficiently Active according to WHO guidelines).\n\nMean frequency of physical activity of boys and girls were compared using t-tests. Proportions of boys and girls in the Least/Somewhat/Most Active categories and of those reporting smoking, alcohol use, chronic illness, sexual intercourse and family financial problems were compared using Chi-squared tests.\n\nANOVA was used to compare mean scores on the psychological variables (BDI II, SAS, WHO-5) between Least, Somewhat and Most Active groups of girls and boys. Bootstrapping was used to account for the non-normal distribution. Post hoc between-groups comparisons were carried out using Tukey's HSD to account for multiple testing. Effect size was measured using \u03b7 2 and the effect size was considered very small if \u03b7 2 < 0.01, small if <0.06, medium if <0.14 and large if 0.14+  [32] .\n\nTo examine associations between frequency of physical activity and mental health variables (BDI, SAS and WHO-5) multi-level mixed effects linear regression was carried out with random effects to account for clustering of pupils within schools and countries.

Random effects were fitted to account for clustering of pupils within schools and countries.\n\nAs boys and girls differ significantly in terms of prevalence of mental health problems and in terms of physical activity levels, analyses were carried out separately for boys and girls. Cases with missing data on the relevant items were excluded from the analysis. Levels of missing data ranged from 3 to 4 % on the mental health measures and 12.3 % on the physical activity measure.\n\nAnalyses were carried out using SPSS version 20 and Stata version 13."

      "text": "A small minority (13.6 %) of the SEYLE adolescent sample reported meeting the level of physical activity recommended for good physical health (at least 60 min of moderate-to-vigorous activity daily) [3]. More frequent physical activity was associated with lower levels of depression and anxiety and greater well-being in our sample, after adjustment for possible confounding factors. The greatest differences in terms of all of the mental health measures examined was between the Least Active and Somewhat Active subgroups, while additional benefits of daily activity were not evident. Participation in sport (team or individual) conferred an additional mental health benefit independently of frequency of activity.\n\nAs hypothesised, girls were significantly more likely to be inactive than boys, with only 10.7 % of girls and 17.9 % of boys sufficiently active, based on WHO guidelines. This finding is in keeping with other international studies of activity levels in European adolescents aged 15  [5] . We also found significantly higher levels of participation in sport among boys than among girls. Over half of girls (60.7 %) and over three quarters (76.7 %) of boys reported engaging in team or individual sports or fitness activities. It has been suggested that opportunities to participate in sport and other physical activities may be biased in favour of boys  [5] .\n\nOur findings of small but significant associations between physical activity and mental health are consistent with previous findings  [7] . Although statistically significant, differences we have reported between more and less active adolescents in terms of anxiety and depressive symptoms may not be clinically meaningful. However, in terms of well-being, we can suggest based on our findings that moderately increasing activity in inactive adolescents could result in a meaningful improvement in well-being, as an increment of 10 % on an individual's WHO-5 score may be clinically meaningful  [33] . These findings are in keeping with longitudinal research on the association between physical activity and changes in well-being  [34] .\n\nIt has been suggested that small effect sizes found for associations between physical activity and mental health measures may be due in part to measures of activity which do not take into account the nature of the activity  [2] . We examined participation in individual and team sports to identify the types of activity which may be particularly beneficial to mental health. Lowest levels of anxiety and depression and highest level of well-being were found among those participating in team sports. Among girls, those participating in team sports differed significantly from those participating in individual sport or other physical activity in terms of all of the mental health factors examined, suggesting that team sports may confer particular mental health benefits for girls. For boys, those participating in team sports had significantly higher levels of well-being than those engaging in other sports, but there were no significant differences in terms of depression or anxiety in univariate analyses. In multivariate analysis, participating in any sport (individual or team) was associated with more positive mental health on all three of the examined measures, independent of frequency of activity, for both sexes.\n\nWe have reported an association between higher frequency of physical activity and better mental health, with lower and higher thresholds of activity associated with poorer mental health, particularly among girls. This is in keeping with previous findings on an adult population  [35] . It may be the case that the sub-group reporting very frequent or daily physical activity includes some adolescents who over-exercise and suffer from eating disorders or other psychopathology  [36, 37] .\n\nSeveral hypotheses have been proposed to explain the inverse association between physical activity and depression and other mental health problems  [38] . Regular engagement in a challenging activity may lead to an increase in a person's confidence and subsequently to a decrease in their depressive symptoms  [39] , or the social relationships developed from regular participation in physical activity may impact positively upon mental health  [40] . Inversely, depression may negatively influence patterns of activity through symptoms such as low energy levels, apathy, or social isolation  [41]  or physical inactivity and depression and anxiety may also share other risk factors  [38] . Our findings relating to the benefits of sport participation provide some support for the hypothesis that the mental health benefits of physical activity may be partly accounted for by the social interaction involved in team sports in particular, and confirm the importance of the psychological and social aspects of physical activity.\n\nThe greatest differences in terms of mental health measures were between the least active and the somewhat active adolescents. This is in keeping with other recent findings on adult physical activity and associations with mortality  [42] . Our findings suggest that minor increments in physical activity may have substantial benefits to mental health and provide support for the suggestion that key policy aim for improving mental health should be to specifically target those who are fully inactive  [42] .\n\nThe limitations of this study include the use of a self-report instrument measuring physical activity, which may be prone to recall bias and varying interpretations of physical activity in different cultures, sexes and age groups  [4] . The instrument used explicitly excluded activities carried out in physical education class, which may lead to an underestimate of activity levels. The level of missing data on this physical activity measure was also relatively high which may potentially have been a source of bias. As the study was cross-sectional, it was not possible to investigate any potential causal or temporal relationships between physical activity and mental health. Although we identified large cross-national differences in activity levels, we did not have scope to examine differing patterns of association between physical activity and mental health in the ten participating centres of this study. Further research could include in-depth cross-national comparisons and could also longitudinally examine the impact of physical activity on later mental health. The strengths of this study include the very large and representative sample of European adolescents and the use of multi-level mixed effects regression models which account for the clustered nature of the data  [43] ."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "Regular physical activity is associated with better mental health and well-being in adolescents. Our findings underline the importance of increasing activity levels among the least active young people. However, while at least one hour of physical activity daily is recommended for optimal physical health and development in children and adolescents, we did not find evidence for the benefit of daily activity in terms of mental health. Participation in sport confers an additional benefit over and above that provided by activity alone. It would be beneficial if recommendations for physical activity and sport participation in children and adolescents were formulated based on mental as well as physical health outcomes. Sex differences in activity levels and in sport participation persist, and making activities accessible to all through school physical education curricula and community organisations should be a priority. Community and school-based interventions to promote well-being and positive mental health in adolescents should incorporate a focus on frequent physical activity and engagement in individual or team sports."
