  "abstract": "Personal informatics (PI) systems, powered by smartphones and wearables, enable people to lead healthier lifestyles by providing meaningful and actionable insights that break down barriers between users and their health information. Today, such systems are used by billions of users for monitoring not only physical activity and sleep but also vital signs and women's and heart health, among others. Despite their widespread usage, the processing of sensitive PI data may suffer from biases, which may entail practical and ethical implications. In this work, we present the first comprehensive empirical and analytical study of bias in PI systems, including biases in raw data and in the entire machine learning life cycle. We use the most detailed framework to date for exploring the different sources of bias and find that biases exist both in the data generation and the model learning and implementation streams. According to our results, the most affected minority groups are users with health issues, such as diabetes, joint issues, and hypertension, and female users, whose data biases are propagated or even amplified by learning models, while intersectional biases can also be observed.",

      "title": "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "Ubiquitous technologies, such as smartphones and wearables, are an integral part of our lives today  [47, 90] . Their proliferation has given rise to Personal Informatics (PI), namely a class of systems that \"help people collect personally relevant information for the purpose of self-reflection and gaining self-knowledge\"  [66] . Such systems enable people to keep track of their productivity  [62] , finances  [60] , and learning  [45] . Yet, tracking various aspects of physical and mental health is particularly prevalent  [33] . PI systems can continuously and unobtrusively measure and collect physiological and behavioral data, namely, \"digital biomarkers\", from users through integrated sensors. Digital biomarkers contain an uncanny amount of personal information. Even the coarser behavioral biomarkers acquired from consumer wearables (e.g., steps, calories) strongly correlate to a person's gender, height, and weight  [61] , while signals of finer granularity (e.g., accelerometer and heart rate), can predict variables associated with an individual's physical health, fitness, and demographics  [89] .\n\nAt the same time, consumer smartphones and wearables are now packed with an increasing number of advanced health tracking features, innovating in personal health, research, and care  [7] . Flagship consumer wearable algorithms -some approved by the US Food and Drug Administration-can now identify signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib) through electrocardiogram (ECG) or photoplethysmography (PPG) signals  [37] . On a different note, newly released watches introduce novel cycle-tracking functionality, including fertility prediction and notifications, using logged period data and temperature measurements  [8] . Mobility features include fall and crash detection through accelerometer and gyroscope measurements and notification of emergency services. Similarly, newly integrated blood oxygen (SpO2) sensors on wearable rings can provide indicators and warn users about potential sleep apnea or lung diseases  [94] . It is evident that consumer smartphones and wearables have moved beyond step counts, marking a rapid transition towards mHealth .\n\nHowever, the prevalent PI adoption embeds important challenges due to the questionable transparency and unexplored biases in the systems' algorithms. Contrary to the common belief that algorithmic decisions are objective by definition, a machine learning (ML) model may be inherently unfair by learning, preserving, or even amplifying historical biases existent in the data  [81] . Unfortunately, real-world cases of unfair ML models are abundant even within the ubiquitous computing community. For example, neural network algorithms trained to classify skin lesions were found to exhibit lower diagnostic accuracy in black patients  [59] . Moreover, racial bias has been identified in health sensors such as oximeters, which were primarily tested on white populations, resulting in the misclassification of people of color  [88] . Given the growing potential of PI devices in mHealth, imagine the ethical and social implications if an AFib detection algorithm exhibited bias against a specific race or if a fertility prediction algorithm was biased against women in developing countries.\n\nDespite this growing interest in ML fairness, a focused emphasis on the requirements of unbiased PI systems in mHealth settings is lacking  [3, 110] . Yet, PI systems are deployed in high-stakes health applications, while their input data modality, i.e., personal sensitive data, makes them susceptible to propagating bias. Thus, exploring biases within these systems is critical to raise awareness regarding mitigating and regulatory actions required to avert potential negative consequences. This need is further highlighted by the differences between PI and other domains, such as facial or speech recognition:\n\n\u2022 The digital divide as a barrier of entry: To contribute data to an image or voice dataset, users do not need any technical knowledge or niche device. However, to contribute to a PI dataset, users face significant \"entry barriers\" in terms of digital capacity or device ownership, creating new-found representation biases. \u2022 Emerging technologies accuracy: Facial or speech recognition devices, e.g., camera or voice recorder, are mature technologies with high accuracy. On the contrary, emerging PI devices' accuracy significantly varies across models, creating unexplored measurement biases and discrepancies across user segments. \u2022 Complex nature of data: It may be straightforward to identify biases in terms of skin tone, nationality and gender in facial or speech recognition. Yet, identifying biases in digital biomarkers, e.g., sensor data, is complicated. Biases in PI data can remain hidden and be further propagated or even amplified in ML models. Motivated by these differences and research gap, we present the first comprehensive study on bias in PI: We adopt the most complete framework to date for understanding sources of harm in the ML life cycle  [92]  ( \u00a73), and explore biases in the data generation ( \u00a74) and model building and implementation ( \u00a75) streams. Ultimately, we apply our methodology in the largest real-world PI dataset to date, while providing preliminary indications of generalizability through differing datasets and use cases ( \u00a76), and we offer recommendations for bias mitigation ( \u00a77). Specifically, our research questions (RQs) and the respective contributions are as follows:\n\n(1) Are PI data susceptible to biases? We examine whether ubiquitous digital biomarkers are subject to historical, representation, and measurement biases. To demonstrate our point, we analyze the MyHeart Counts dataset  [52] , comprising physical activity, fitness, sleep, and cardiovascular health data for 50K participants across the United States (US). Our results reveal biases across all stages of the data generation stream, highlighting the need for careful usage of PI datasets, in general, and the MyHeart Counts data, in particular. (2) Do ML models inherit PI data biases? We examine whether biases inherent in PI data persist during modeling. Specifically, we assess various learning and personalization models for aggregation, learning, and deployment biases. Consistent with prior research  [79] , our findings indicate that data biases are propagated to learning models, particularly for user groups with intersecting identities. They are also significantly amplified in their personalized counterparts, prompting further exploration of personalization trade-offs. (3) Do synthetic benchmarks hide the imperfect nature of PI? We explore whether \"perfect\" synthetic benchmark datasets can hide PI data and model \"imperfections\" and biases during evaluation. Specifically, we compare a random benchmark, representative of our data, with one designed to achieve demographic parity for evaluation biases. Our findings highlight the importance of establishing PI benchmarks that are representative of the intended target populations to avoid deploying models with unidentified biases."

      "title": "2.1. Bias and Fairness in PI Definitions",
      "text": "Bias in ML is a potential source of unfairness that can lead to harmful consequences, such as discrimination. In terms of algorithms, bias can be defined as \"a systematic error or an unexpected tendency to favor one outcome over another\"  [70] . The term can also refer to an algorithm's undesired dependence on specific data attributes that may be linked to a demographic group, e.g., based on gender, race, or religion  [39] . While bias is related to fairness, it is important to note that algorithmic bias is distinct from ethics. It is simply a mathematical and statistical consequence of an algorithm, including the data used, the logic itself and the user interaction feedback-loop, making it fully quantifiable  [10] . Unlike bias, the fairness of an ML model is judged against a set of legal or ethical principles, which are subject to the local government and culture. The Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency in Machine Learning (FAccT/ML) community defines fairness as a principle that \"ensures that algorithmic decisions do not create discriminatory or unjust impacts when comparing across different demographics (e.g., race, sex, etc.)\"  [9] . Fairness is an inexorably subjective and context-dependent notion and incorporates different metrics for different definitions, some of which are even mutually incompatible  [42] . For example, drawing from our use case ( \u00a73.2) and as per relevant literature  [76] , women tend to perform overall less physical activity compared to their male counterparts. Hence, a PI goal-setting algorithm could either give females lower goals because they historically perform less physical activity or give females equal high goals despite historic differences to encourage behavior change. Fairness in this context is subjective and dependent on the viewpoint. However, algorithmic bias is objective and can be identified regardless of fairness considerations. For instance, the first algorithm described would be biased against women since it assigns them fewer high-activity goals compared to men.\n\nBias can (but does not always) result in discrimination. We consider systems fairer if they are less biased, but building ML systems without bias is practically difficult and possibly infeasible. However, quantifying and mitigating bias is an attainable and important step toward building fairer ML systems. Hence, our work aims to unveil and quantify biases in the PI life cycle without the subjective element of personal fairness perspectives. Note that we might still use the term \"fairness\" in the paper, when we refer to certain standard terminology, e.g., \"fairness through unawareness\" or \"fairness metrics\"."

      "title": "2.2. Bias and Fairness in PI for Health and Well-being Literature",
      "text": "With the widespread adoption of intelligent systems and applications in our everyday lives, accounting for data and model biases has gained significant traction in designing and deploying systems. Specifically, these notions have been studied extensively in domains such as natural language processing  [15, 41] , recommender systems  [65, 103, 105] , and computer vision  [16, 106] . Yet, evidence for biases in the PI setting is lacking. Closer to PI, fairness research in healthcare is still in its infancy  [36] . The digitization of medical data has enabled the scientific community to collect large amounts of heterogeneous, multi-modal data and develop ML algorithms for various medical tasks. During the process, various limitations have been uncovered based on the three most prominent data types: medical image data, structured electronic health record (EHR) data, and textual data.\n\nMedical imaging has been the most widely used data source for ML in healthcare, and biases in them have received attention  [56] . For example, Larrazabal et al.  [64]  utilizes two commonly used X-ray image datasets to diagnose various chest diseases under different gender imbalance conditions and showcase that the minority gender group systematically performs worse than the majority gender group. Similarly, according to Adamson and Smith  [1] , relying on ML for skin cancer screening may exacerbate potential racial disparities in dermatology.\n\nOn a different note, EHR systems store multi-modal, heterogeneous patient data, such as demographics, diagnoses, and clinical records, and have been used for various tasks, such as medical concept extraction, mortality prediction, and disease inference. Regarding EHR data fairness, Meng et al.  [71]  identify race-level differences in the predictions of neural network models on the MIMIC-IV dataset  [57] , with Black and Hispanic patients being less likely to receive interventions or receiving interventions of shorter average duration. Similarly, R\u00f6\u00f6sli et al.  [82]  reveals a strong class imbalance problem and significant fairness concerns for Black and publicly insured ICU patients in the same dataset.\n\nConcerning textual EHR data, Chen et al.  [19]  examines clinical and psychiatric notes to predict intensive care unit mortality and 30-day psychiatric readmission. Their analysis reveals differences in prediction accuracy, and biases are present in terms of gender and insurance type for mortality prediction and insurance policy for psychiatric 30-day readmission. Within the same scope, Zhang et al.  [112]  train deep embedding models on medical notes from the MIMIC-III database  [58] , and find that classifiers trained from their embeddings exhibit statistically significant differences in performance, often favoring the majority group regarding gender, language, ethnicity, and insurance status.\n\nYet, despite the emerging research on biases in healthcare, its proximity to PI, and the widespread adoption of PI technologies, biases in PI have been barely explored. Paviglianiti and Pasero  [79]  reported gender biases in digital biomarkers using Vital-ECG, a wearable smart device that collects electrocardiogram and plethysmogram signals. Still, their study is limited to quantifying learning bias, far from a complete study of bias in the PI life cycle. On the contrary, inspired by relevant works in related domains  [54, 55] , our work aims to raise awareness and set up a systematic approach to comprehensively analyze data and model biases in PI systems, highlighting the multiple facets of bias that may affect system fairness."

      "text": "There exist various frameworks for capturing bias in ML applications, e.g., in the context of the Web  [10] , autonomous systems  [25]  or crowdsourced labeling  [14] . However, most tend to be domain-specific. Yet, Suresh and Guttag  [92]  has introduced a framework for understanding sources of harm throughout the ML life cycle, independent of the application domain. Given its generic and comprehensive nature and, thus, suitability for the PI use case, we consider this as a basis for our study. As per  [92] , the ML life cycle consists of two streams, the data generation stream and the model building and implementation stream, containing seven sources of bias-related harms, as shown in Figures  1a  and  1b , respectively, and defined below:  \u2022 Historical biases can occur even if the data are flawlessly sampled by reflecting real-world biases against one or more groups of people. For example, gender gaps in certain fields can result in language models linking certain job-related terms, such as nurse or programmer, with female or male descriptors, respectively  [15] . \u2022 Representation biases can occur when sampling methods lead to underrepresenting population segments. For example, in popular image datasets, skewed towards the US or Europe, result in performance degradation when categorizing images from underrepresented regions  [28] . \u2022 Measurement biases can occur when choosing, collecting, and calculating features and labels for the prediction problem. For example, in medical contexts, diagnosis is frequently a stand-in for a health condition; yet, some gender and race groups face elevated risks of misdiagnosis, or underdiagnosis  [53] . \u2022 Aggregation biases can occur when a universal model is applied to that should be differentiated based on underlying user groups. For example, when training natural language processing models on generic data, the nuances and contextual meanings of street slang can be lost  [41] . \u2022 Learning biases can occur when modeling choices amplify performance gaps across user segments. For example, prioritizing privacy in a model can diminish the impact of underrepresented groups data  [12] . \u2022 Evaluation biases can occur when the benchmark population is not representative of the target population. For example, dark-skinned women comprise only a small percentage of popular facial image benchmarks, leading to worse intersectional performance of commercial facial analysis tools  [16] . \u2022 Deployment biases can occur when there exists a mismatch between the problem a model is designed to solve and how it is actually utilized. For example, risk assessment tools in criminal justice can be used in \"off-label\" ways, such as determining the length of a sentence  [23] .\n\nIn the following section, we introduce the use case through which we explore bias in PI for mHealth. We then show empirically and analytically how Suresh and Guttag's seven sources of bias translate in the PI domain."

The release of data from the MyHeart Counts Cardiovascular Health Study from 50K participants in the US, changed this situation. Participants completed surveys and a 6-minute walk test and contributed PI data via a mobile application. Approximately 1 out of 10 participants ( = 4920) shared their basic PI data, such as step count, distance covered, burned calories, and flights climbed. We combine these data with survey responses to attain the following user attributes: gender, ethnicity, age, BMI, and health conditions, such as heart condition, hypertension, joint problem, and diabetes."

In other words, based on the user's past activity, we try to predict how many steps they will perform the next day (see Table  2 ), e.g., to enable personalized goal-setting. Basic digital behavioral biomarkers, such as steps, are easy to collect and commonplace in the literature, enabling the reproducibility of our findings. Also, they are the largest available sensed modality in the My Heart Counts dataset, allowing us to exploit more data for our analysis. At the same time, according to the World Health Organization (WHO), physical activity has significant health benefits for hearts, bodies, and minds, contributing to preventing and managing noncommunicable diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes  [107] . Strikingly, physical inactivity has been identified by the WHO as the fourth leading risk factor for global mortality, accounting for 6% of deaths globally  [77] , highlighting the importance of the selected use case."

Values lower than 1 mean the majority group has a higher proportion of positive outcomes; a value of 1 indicates demographic parity.

However, inequalities in physical activity are well-documented in literature  [4, 49, 76] . Althoff et al.  [4]  reveal variability in physical activity worldwide, where reduced activity in females explains a large portion of the observed activity inequality. Overall, the World Health Organization reports that \"girls, women, older adults, people of low socioeconomic position, people with disabilities and chronic diseases, marginalized populations, indigenous people and the inhabitants of rural communities often have less access to safe, accessible, affordable and appropriate spaces and places in which to be physically active\"  [76] . Such real-world inequalities can manifest into the behavioral data we use to train our models."

Almost half the world's population, the majority of them women or citizens of developing countries, are still disconnected  [72] . Even in the connected world, male internet users outnumber their female counterparts. This \"digital divide\" encompasses even more discrepancies, such as the digital infrastructure quality and connectivity speed in rural or remote areas and the required skills to navigate technology  [21] . Therefore, it is clear that technological systems, including PI, are limited in their ability to capture the diversity of the world population, due to pre-existing inequalities in digital access and literacy.\n\n4.1.3 BYOD Study Design Biases. PI technologies are used for data collection in clinical research, resulting in newfound demographic imbalances. Studies adopting a bring-your-own-device (BYOD) design, such as MyHeart Counts, are more user-friendly, achieve better participant compliance, potentially reduce the bias of introducing new technologies, and accelerate data collection from larger cohorts  [22, 26] . However, Cho et al.  [22]  identifies significant demographic disparities regarding race (50-85% white cohorts) in BYOD studies. Their findings align with the reported demographic divide existent in the composition of wearable users. Even though the gap is narrowing, a recent report  [35]  documents that most existing wearable users are fit adults between 25-34 and that whilst females are more likely to own activity trackers, 63% of smartwatch owners are male. Hence, the technology and participant cohorts in PI in the context of BYOD studies subject datasets to the same biases exposed in the activity inequality and the digital divide literature."

In the MyHeart Counts dataset, we compare the ratios of majority and minority user segments as defined in Table  1  with the real-world ratios extracted from US population censuses. Specifically, we utilize the US Census Bureau (gender, race, and age  [17]  distributions), the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (BMI  [43, 44] , joint issues  [95] , hypertension  [40] , and diabetes  [75] ), and the American Heart Association (heart condition  [96] ) data. Figure  2  showcases the results of this comparison in a radar plot. For example, while in the general US population, we have approximately 1 female per 1 male (ratio of 1.0 in pink), in the MyHeart Counts data, we have 0.2 females per 1 male, highlighting the substantial underrepresentation of women. The same applies to race, age, and hypertension segments, where the minority classes in the dataset (non-white users, users less than 45, and users with hypertension, respectively) do not reflect real-world ratios. An interesting finding is that, while in the US, there exist approximately 0.3 underweight, overweight, or obese people for every person with normal weight, in the dataset, this ratio is doubled. Hence, possibly due to historical biases and design choices, our analysis of the MyHeart Counts data (Figure  2 ) provides evidence that PI datasets might not be representative of target populations."

We notice that even for representative sampling, e.g., users with joint or heart problems, the minority group is still significantly underrepresented. Thus, the model might be less robust for those users because it has less data to learn from. Overall, we see that the MyHeart Counts data are skewed towards white, fit males, which needs to be considered in the model-building phases. An ideal PI dataset should be representative of the target population while having enough minority samples.

In fairness through awareness, fairness is captured by the principle that similar individuals should have similar classification outcomes. In our use case, the similarity is defined based on user demographics in the absence of other features. In practical terms, the aware model is trained on a feature set that includes protected attributes per user.

Fairness through unawareness is also ineffective due to the presence of proxy features, i.e., features that work like proxies for protected attributes. Through them, bias propagates from data to models: for example, a person's walking behavior (measured in step counts) is a good predictor of gender, BMI, and age, which can thus be inferred, despite being hidden during training  [61] . Overall, diabetes patients have the largest bias gap compared to non-diabetic users, partially attributed to their highly biased training data.

Users with diabetes present an extreme case. The personalized model \"learns\" that diabetics are less active than healthy users in the dataset and thus provides solely low activity goals, even to active diabetics. The intuition behind this behavior lies in the training process; personalized models amplify data representation biases through fine-tuning.

Also, benchmarks within the community often do not represent the target population. For example, within the fall detection domain, due to safety concerns, datasets usually comprise imitated falls performed by younger people while they are deployed on older people  [91] . Yet, a misrepresentative benchmark encourages deploying models that perform well only on the benchmark population. To illustrate our point, given the lack of established benchmarks in PI, we devise two distinct test sets for comparison purposes: our original, \"realistic\" (random) test set, and a sampled subset of the latter (\"ideal\"), with demographic parity at base rate (DIR = 1.0). We then evaluate our models on these two test sets. Figure  11  presents the results of our experimentation, where it is clear that the ideal test set, imitating a \"fair\" world, consistently shows lower bias than the \"realistic\" test set. Better performance is defined as smaller deviations from the optimal DIR value of 1.0.

From this lens, False Positives (FP) and False Negatives (FN), i.e., Type I and Type II errors, respectively, in these scenarios are not critical, and models have been developed to maximize True Positives (TPs). This dominant view promotes deployment bias in novel use cases with the emergence of health-related intelligence embedded into PI systems. For example, given ECG sensor data and AFib detection functionality, Type II errors should be minimized to avoid loss of life.

As illustrated by our findings, pre-existing historical biases are present in digital biomarkers, due to well-documented phenomena, such as the global inequality in physical activity and the digital divide, leading to data generation that is not representative of the general population. This is indeed the case in the MyHeart Counts dataset, where female, non-white, underweight, overweight or obese, young, and hypertensive users, are undersampled. Unacknowledged historical biases, though, can creep into the ML pipeline perpetuating social injustices. Yet, even within well-sampled user groups, data imbalances, either in terms of user attributes or measured behaviors, are still prevalent due to realistic differences across user segments. Specifically, in PI, we see significant underrepresentation of minority groups across all protected attributes and measured behavioral differences -not necessarily realistic-for users with diabetes, joint issues, unhealthy BMI, non-white users, and females. Unresolved representation biases can lead to performance discrepancies for minority groups, which in turn might lead to differences in treatment or care  [46] . Finally, PI data is susceptible to measurement biases, due to the heterogeneity in input modalities, performance and hardware differences across generations of devices, and usage of third-multiple party apps of unknown accuracy. Females are especially affected by such biases in our dataset, as they tend to own older devices with fewer capabilities and use more fitness-related third-party apps. Unknown measurement biases in seemingly \"objective\" sensor data can lead to errors in downstream tasks that disproportionally affect certain protected groups.\n\nIn an initial attempt to offer guidance to researchers in the field of ubiquitous computing, we present the following guidelines in the context of the data generation stream on how to mitigate the impact of historical, representation, and measurement biases, respectively:\n\nGuideline #1: To identify historical biases relevant to the use case at hand, consult prior literature and domain experts (e.g., oximeters are proven susceptible to biases against darker skin tones  [46] ) or conduct small-scale feasibility studies with relevant and diverse demographics. Guideline #2: If data are self-collected, aim for diverse user recruitment and collect and report relevant protected attributes (e.g., via datasheets for datasets and data statements). Otherwise, evaluate algorithms in generalizable cross-dataset benchmarks [108] and inclusive synthetic data  [98] , whenever possible. In either case, consider appropriate data manipulation actions to alleviate biases, e.g., re-sampling/rebalancing populations conditioned on demographic attributes.\n\nGuideline #3: When working with data originating from diverse devices, investigate device ownership differences conditioned on demographic attributes. Also, incorporate uncertainty estimation approaches and be transparent about possible measurement error effects in downstream tasks.\n\nSumming up, we believe that our findings shed light on the biases that can creep into the data generation and model building, and implementation streams of PI technologies. While our mitigation guidelines are by no means exhaustive, they provide a starting point for researchers and practitioners to incorporate bias assessments \"by design\" in the life cycle of their works to alleviate the potential negative effects of such biases.\n\n7.1.2 Model Building and Implementation Stream. Based on our results, digital biomarkers representation biases can be propagated or even amplified by learning models, regardless of the inclusion of protected attributes in the feature set. This is due to the existence of proxy variables in PI data that can be used by models to infer hidden protected attributes. Such aggregation biases are also prevalent in our use case for users with joint issues, diabetes, hypertension, and female users. These biases may (or may not) lead to discrimination depending on the context. Yet, mitigating them is the safest way to ensure fairness. Additionally, common learning choices in PI, such as personalization, can introduce learning biases, if trained on biased data. In our case, they perform worse -in terms of bias-across all attributes, while, in extreme cases (e.g., diabetic users), they can even introduce maximum bias. Accuracy gains emerging from alternative learning choices can be tempting, but their trade-offs should be thoroughly assessed. On a different note, our empirical results illustrate that model performance is highly susceptible to the representativeness of the PI benchmark used and highlight how evaluation biases can affect ubiquitous models in the evaluation phase. In such cases, performance and fairness drift can emerge if the evaluation data is not representative of the target population. Finally, the application of ML in PI is not free of deployment biases, which can emerge from outdated evaluation practices emerging from the PI systems' early applications or the false assumption of autonomous PI systems' existence. Yet, mischoosing evaluation metrics or focusing solely on aggregate metrics can hide discrepancies in performance for minority groups. Developing high-stakes systems in isolation might also lead to (unintended) system misuse.\n\nTo provide guidance in the context of model building and implementations, we offer guidelines to alleviate the potential negative effects of the aggregation, learning, evaluation, and deployment biases, respectively: Guideline #4: Utilize fairness toolkits, such as FairLearn, AIF360, and Aequitas for implementations of pre-, in-, and post-processing bias mitigation algorithms and fairness metrics. Guideline #5: Move beyond accuracy in evaluating learning paradigms by incorporating fairness metrics in the evaluation pipeline of ML models, conditioning performance on intersections of protected attributes. Guideline #6: Aim for representative and realistic evaluation datasets -beyond carefully-curated benchmarks-, if available, or reassess your model after deployment. Re-train with the target population's data if you encounter performance drifts conditioned on demographic attributes. Guideline #7: Choose multiple, appropriate fairness metrics based on \"fairness trees\"  [85]  and domain expertise for the use case at hand. Consider a human-in-the-loop design approach for high-stakes applications to account for human biases that affect system design."

      "text": "While MyHeart Counts offers scale and access to protected attributes, as outlined in \u00a73, and our generalizability study supports our findings as described in \u00a76, additional analyses may be necessary to fully comprehend bias in PI. For instance, certain protected attributes in the dataset have incomplete categorization, e.g., gender is treated as a binary concept, while others might be fully absent regardless of relevance to the use case, e.g., physical or mental disability and pregnancy. At the same time, the selected dataset is US-based, not capturing activity patterns across the global population. Hence our findings might not be directly applicable across protected attributes and geographical contexts. Finally, while activity tracking is the most common functionality in PI systems and prior work has highlighted worldwide physical activity inequality  [4] , our dataset does not capture more advanced health features, such as heart monitoring and fertility tracking. Still, it is important to recognize that different use cases might incorporate different biases. Hence, while our findings shed light on the previously unexplored field of PI biases, they should be further corroborated across different contexts, such as demographics, geographical regions, and use cases.\n\nAppropriate PI datasets for fueling future fairness research in the domain are still lacking. Due to the sensitivity of the data at hand, many datasets are proprietary with restrictive Institutional Review Board (IRB) agreements, but inclusive, open datasets could significantly advance the domain. Also, given the prevalence of small-scale datasets, future work should focus on quantifying biases in small digital biomarkers data, as realistically, most institutions will never acquire big data  [11] . Additionally, due to closed-sourced data and algorithms, there is a lack of established benchmarks, especially regarding emerging PI tasks, such as fertility prediction, or AFib detection. To this end, similarly to the work of Harutyunyan et al.  [51] , future work should create inclusive and representative benchmarks for tasks within the PI domain. Beyond that, there is work to be done in quantifying and mitigating bias in sequential physiological and behavioral data. For instance, many PI tasks are formulated as regression problems, but regression-specific fairness metrics and mitigation approaches are limited in the literature  [2, 48] . Finally, due to privacy considerations for sensitive digital biomarkers, many times PI data are not accompanied by protected attributes for the population they describe, making it cumbersome to perform a bias and fairness evaluation. To this end, future work should investigate the space of \"fairness in unawareness\", or, in other words, how you can quantify and mitigate biases in the absence of protected attributes."

In response to our RQs, we show that bias exists across all stages of the life cycle, both in the data generation and model building and implementation streams. Different user minorities are affected by diverse types of bias, but users with diabetes, joint issues, or hypertension and female users show higher degrees of impact adversity in our MyHeart Counts use case due to representation, aggregation, and learning biases. Our findings echo concerns similar to those raised in the evaluation for healthcare technologies  [3] . While some of our findings are specific to the investigated use case, they can mostly be extended to other PI tasks."

For both categories, a value of 1.0 is optimal, indicating demographic parity. Anything greater or less than the optimal value indicates some level of bias. According to AIF360, accepted difference-based metrics' values are within the range [-0.1, +0, 1], and accepted ratio-based metrics' values are within [0.8,1.25], but such ranges are not universally accepted and might be adjusted on a task-by-task basis.

      "title": "B FAIRNESS TAXONOMY IN MACHINE LEARNING",
      "text": "Viewed through the lens of quantitative science, ML research has broadly grouped fairness into two categories: individual fairness and group fairness. In the broad sense, group fairness partitions the general population into groups based on sensitive (a.k.a. protected) attributes and seeks statistical equality across groups. On the other hand, individual fairness seeks for similar individuals to be treated similarly  [30, 73] .\n\nIn individual fairness, determining whether individuals are similar requires first defining what features are relevant to fairness  [38] . However, in PI, it would be incomplete to define such similarity solely based on digital behavioral biomarkers, such as steps, or heart rate, as hidden contextual information might be significantly more relevant. To this end, we proceed with group fairness from now on. This decision translates to our use case as exploring significant differences in allocation, representation, or error rates regarding future step goals across different population segments. For example, do females get systematically lower step goals than males? [42, 109] . The WAE viewpoint considers that all groups have similar abilities to perform the task, e.g., all groups of people are equally capable of walking more, while the WYSIWYG viewpoint holds that the data reflect each group's ability to perform the task, e.g., some groups of people might be less capable.\n\nOverall, every metric tries to quantify the difference in performance between privileged and unprivileged users. Here, we present the most common fairness metrics across all viewpoints, namely WAE, WYSIWYG, and hybrid (Figure  14 ). The confusion matrix (see Table  3 ) is the heart of ML performance measurement and is also used in the fairness metrics definitions below. All metrics are expressed as ratios or differences between unprivileged (u) and privileged (p) groups. Note that  is the user sample, \u0176 is the predicted label, and \"pos_label\" is the favorable outcome scenario (e.g., high physical activity)."

The two most commonly used WAE metrics are the Disparate Impact Ratio (DIR) and the Statistical Parity Difference (SPD) (Table  4 ).\n\nHybrid Metrics. Hybrid metrics lie in-between the two viewpoints. The most commonly used hybrid metrics, depending on the problem's context, are the False Positive Rate (FPR) Ratio, the False Negative Rate (FNR) Ratio, the False Omission Rate (FOR) Ratio, and the Error Rate Ratio (ERR) (Table  5 ).\n\nWYSIWYG Metrics. The WYSIWYG viewpoint supports that data correlates well with future behavior and that they can be used to compare the users' abilities. The two most commonly used WAE metrics are the Average Odds Difference (AOD) and the Equal Opportunity Difference (EOD) (Table  6 ). Table  6 .
