  "title": "Digital interventions to promote self-management in adults with hypertension systematic review and meta-analysis",
  "abstract": "Objective: To synthesize the evidence for using interactive digital interventions (IDIs) to support patient self-management of hypertension, and to determine their impact on control and reduction of blood pressure. Method: Systematic review with meta-analysis was undertaken with a search performed in MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, Cochrane Library, DoPHER, TROPHI, Social Science Citation Index and Science Citation Index. The population was adults (>18 years) with hypertension, intervention was an IDI and the comparator was usual care. Primary outcomes were change in SBP and DBP. Only randomized controlled trials and studies published in journals and in English were eligible. Eligible IDIs included interventions accessed through a computer, smartphone or other hand-held device. Results: Four out of seven studies showed a significantly greater reduction for intervention compared to usual care for SBP, with no difference found for three. Overall, IDIs significantly reduced SBP, with the weighted mean difference being \u00c03.74 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI) \u00c02.19 to \u00c02.58] with no heterogeneity observed (I-squared \u00bc 0.0%, P \u00bc 0.990). For DBP, four out of six studies indicated a greater reduction for intervention compared to controls, with no difference found for two. For DBP, a significant reduction of \u00c02.37 mmHg (95% CI \u00c00.40 to \u00c04.35) was found, but considerable heterogeneity was noted (I-squared \u00bc 80.1%, P \u00bc <0.001). \n Conclusion: IDIs lower both SBP and DBP compared to usual care. Results suggest these findings can be applied to a wide range of healthcare systems and populations. However, sustainability and long-term clinical effectiveness of these interventions remain uncertain.",

      "text": "H ypertension is a chronic medical condition in which the blood pressure of the arteries is elevated, and is normally defined as being when SBP is above 140 mmHg and/or DBP is above 90 mmHg ( http://www . nice.org.uk/nicemedia/live/13561/56015/56015.pdf). Hypertension has the highest attributable risk for death from cardiovascular disease (CVD), which is the leading cause of premature morality worldwide  [1] . Clinically significant effects and improvements in mortality can be achieved with relatively small reductions in blood pressure levels  [2, 3] . However, the rate of control and treatment of hypertension is poor, with a large gap found between the detection and control of hypertension  [4] . In addition, hypertension is an asymptomatic condition and medications may cause unpleasant side effects, exacerbating adherence problems  [5] . Consequently, alternative strategies to promote blood pressure control are needed.\n\nGuided self-management for hypertension as part of systematic, planned care offers the potential for improvements in adherence and in turn improved long-term patient outcomes. Self-management can encompass a wide range of behaviours in addition to medication titration and monitoring of symptoms, such as individuals' ability to manage physical, psychosocial and lifestyle behaviours related to their condition  [6] . Self-management in hypertension, including self-titration and behavioural interventions, has been shown to be effective  [7, 8] .\n\nDespite evidence of benefits, guided self-management and education in the control of hypertension remain underused  [9] . Interactive digital interventions (IDIs) can play a crucial role in meeting National Health Service (NHS) policy aims to empower patients to self-manage their long-term conditions, providing patients with better access to personalized information and support for active involvement in treatment, as well as producing significant savings in treatment costs. They are web-based packages delivered by computer or phone that can combine health information with decision support and help inform behaviour change in patients. IDIs can potentially improve the efficiency of healthcare by automating routine aspects of patient education, monitoring and support, whilst improving services by giving patients convenient 24-h access to detailed, personalized feedback and allowing health professionals to remotely monitor patient status  [10, 11] . There is clear evidence that well designed IDIs can effectively change patient health-related behaviour, improve patient knowledge and confidence for self-management of health and lead to better health outcomes  [12, 13] . A recent systematic review and meta-analysis on the impact of digital interventions on CVD outcomes found that IDIs significantly reduced CVD outcomes, weight and BMI, but not blood pressure  [14] .\n\nTherefore, there is growing interest in the potential of the internet and other digital media as a medium to deliver more tailored, relevant self-management support, while maintaining cost-effectiveness, in support of those with hypertension. There have been a number of reviews which have examined the impact of self-monitoring in adults with hypertension  [15] [16] [17]  while Liu et al.  [18]  assessed the impact of the internet on blood pressure control assessing both RCTs and case-control studies. However, we are not aware of any reviews which focus on RCTs for self-management IDIs in those with hypertension and compare with usual care only. Therefore this systematic review aims to synthesize the evidence for using IDIs to support patient self-management of hypertension, and determine their impact on control and reduction of blood pressure, other clinical outcomes, quality of life, medication adherence and economic benefits."

The intervention must function without the need for directive input from a health professional. They must also be 'interactive', which we define as requiring contributions from program users (e.g. entering personal data, making choices), which alter pathways within programs to produce tailored material and feedback that is personally relevant to users."

The search strategy combined three concepts and a study type filter for RCTs: The following databases were searched: MEDLINE, EMBASE, CINAHL, PsycINFO, ERIC, Cochrane Library (including CDSR, DARE, Central, NHS EED and HTA databases), DoPHER and TROPHI (both produced by the EPPI Centre), Social Science Citation Index and Science Citation Index. These databases were searched using a combination of subject headings when available (such as MeSH) and words in the title and abstracts.\n\nThe search was complemented by contacting experts in the topic under review, and by carrying out citation searches for articles which cite individual studies that are included in the review  [23] ."

[33] allowed physicians to use the intervention website to follow participants' trends in blood glucose levels, blood pressure and body weight changes, and then send individualized recommendations to patients when needed. In the study by Orsma et al., nurses scanned through the status of all intervention patients each week and contacted patients if warranted by their remote data reports. For the study by Bennett et al. [29], trained community health educators delivered counselling calls monthly during the first 12 months of intervention and bimonthly during the second year. No difference was found in blood pressure reduction between those offering additional help and those not, for either SBP (additional help \u00c03.37, 95% CI \u00c00.22 to \u00c06.52 vs. no additional help \u00c03.85, 95% CI \u00c02.08 to \u00c0563) or DBP (additional help \u00c02.18, 95% CI \u00c00.45 to \u00c03.91 vs. no additional help \u00c02.58, 95% CI 0.95 to \u00c06.11) (see supplementary Figs 1 and 2,  http://links.lww.com/ HJH/A580. Setting Five of the studies were set in healthcare settings, ranging from a hospital and community healthcare site to outpatient clinics. One study was based in three worksites and one used a number of community sites. Duration and intensity Only the study by Bennett et al. [29] (with a duration of 24 months) lasted longer than 10 months, with the shortest duration being 6 weeks [33]. No significant difference was found when comparing interventions by duration for SBP (6 months or longer \u00c04.35, 95% CI \u00c02.10 to \u00c06.60 vs. less than 6 months \u00c03.19, 95% CI \u00c01.07 to \u00c05.32) or DBP (6 months or longer \u00c03.16, 95% CI \u00c00.83 to \u00c06.49 vs. less than 6 months \u00c03.94, 95% CI 0.37 to \u00c03.35; see supplementary Figs 3 and 4,  http://links.lww.com/HJH/A580 ). Intensity of intervention ranged from daily use in three studies to weekly use in two studies. Bennett et al. [29] had no specific rate of intervention use, whereas Nolan et al. [35] reduced intensity of use over the duration of the intervention, from daily in the first month to biweekly in month 2 and weekly in months 3 and 4. No significant difference was found for SBP when comparing those interventions which required daily use (\u00c02.73, 95% CI \u00c00.35 to \u00c05.12) vs. other intervention (\u00c04.46, 95% CI \u00c02.44 to \u00c06.49), but daily use interventions had a significantly lower reduction for DBP (daily use \u00c01.29, 95% CI \u00c00.04 to \u00c02.53 vs. other interventions \u00c03.86, 95% CI \u00c02.73 to \u00c04.98; see supplementary Figs 5 and 6,  http://  links.lww.com/HJH/A580 ). Theoretical basis for intervention included in paper Three of the studies outlined a theoretical basis for their intervention. Orsma et al. used the Information-Motivation-Behavioral Skills Model [37]. Nolan et al. [35] used Prochaska's trans-theoretical model to assess readiness to change [38]. Bennett et al. [29] used theory-based principles from the Harvard Cancer Prevention Project, which developed a conceptual framework that articulates pathways by which social context may influence health behaviours [39]. No significant difference was found for SBP when comparing those interventions which included a theoretical basis (\u00c03.02, 95% CI \u00c00.79 to \u00c05.24) vs. no theoretical basis (\u00c04.41, 95% CI \u00c02.26 to \u00c05.5), but theoretical basis recorded no reduction for DBP (no theoretical basis 0.90, 95% CI 0.02 to \u00c01.82), whereas a significant fall was found for no theoretical basis (\u00c03.94, 95% CI \u00c02.53 to \u00c05.36; see supplementary Figs 7 and 8,  http://links.lww.com/HJH/ A580)."

They reported that in comparing intervention and control patients with hypertension, there was no difference in the percentage of patients who reported either a greater than 10% decline or any decline in SBP, but a significantly higher number of intervention patients did report both a greater than 10% decline in/or any decline for DBP  [32] .\n\nIn total, there were 610 intervention and 677 control patients used in the meta-analysis for SBP. Nolan et al.  [35]  divided intervention patients by use of the intervention, so we averaged the difference between these groups weighting by the numbers in each group and included in the analysis. Figure  2  shows that overall, IDIs significantly reduced SBP with weighted mean difference overall being \u00c03.74 mmHg (95% CI \u00c02.19 to \u00c02.58) with no heterogeneity observed (I-squared \u00bc 0.0%, P \u00bc 0.990). No significant difference was found between those studies which included self-monitoring and those that did not.\n\nPiette et al.

[31]  assessed medication adherence using home pill count audit conducted by the field technicians, based on Haynes' protocol  [41] . In the study by Friedman et al.  [31] , mean adherence improved 17.7% in the intervention group and 11.7% for usual care control participants (Table  2 ). Piette et al.  [34]  measured medication-related problems using a 7-item index with yes/no responses and found that intervention patients at follow-up had fewer medicationrelated problems (\u00c01.1, 95% CI \u00c01.7, \u00c00.5), such as uncertainty as to whether their medication is important, worry about the long-term effects of their medication or confusion due to the complexity of the regimen."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "This systematic review and meta-analysis of seven randomized controlled clinical trials found that the use of IDIs resulted in better blood pressure control, significantly reducing SBP by 3.74 mmHg and DBP by 2.2 mmHg, compared to usual care. However, the strength of the evidence is limited due to the small number of studies included, -2.80 (-5.20, -0.40) -4.02 (-5.12, -2.93) -2.37 (-4.35, -0.40) -0.80 (-1.79, 0.19) 100.00 32.11 41.58 58.42 % Weight (I-V) 0.81 7.24 8.66 51.18 Intervention reduces blood pressure Usual care reduces blood pressure 0 -10.1 10.1 0 1 2 3 4 -10 -5 0 5 effect size Funnel plot with pseudo 95% confidence limits (a) (b) the size of the studies and issues arising from potential bias due to lack of allocation concealment and questions over use of the intention-to-treat principle in a number of studies. The change in SBP and DBP is similar to that found in previous meta-analyses, which have examined the impact of self-monitoring vs. no self-monitoring  [10, 18] , as well as the impact of face-to-face lifestyle counselling  [42, 43] . The change in SBP and DBP found in this study is also similar to that found in analysis of the effect of telemedicine on lowering blood pressure compared to conventional means  [44] [45] [46] . However, meta-analyses of the effects of telemedicine have generally suffered from high levels of heterogeneity, limiting the generalizability of their results and usefulness in comparison to this study. For SBP, no significant difference was found for those interventions which included self-monitoring. In contrast, for DBP, a difference was found, with interventions which included self-monitoring recording a reduction of 4.0 mmHg, whereas those with no self-monitoring showed no significant difference compared to usual care.\n\nThe evaluation of other specific intervention components apart from self-monitoring was difficult due to the smaller number of studies involved. However, unlike previous analyses, we found no evidence that interventions that lasted longer than 6 months achieved greater blood pressure reduction than those that lasted less than 6 months  [19] . Intensity of the intervention also appeared to have little effect, with no significant difference found in blood pressure reduction for SBP, whereas studies with daily use recorded a smaller reduction in blood pressure for DBP compared to interventions with less intensive usage. We also found no evidence that interventions which offered additional professional help achieved greater blood pressure reduction. As interventions which have an additional professional help component to them are likely to be more expensive, this may have a significant detrimental effect on the cost effectiveness of these interventions. However, there exists little evidence from other analysis on interventions to lower blood pressure as to whether the effect of the intensity of an intervention or the provision of additional professional help is unique to these interventions. Liu et al.  [19]  suggested that a priority for future trials of preventive internet-based interventions is to design and evaluate e-counselling protocols according to theoretically grounded hypotheses. However, we also found no significant difference in blood pressure reduction for SBP in those studies which included a theoretical basis for the intervention compared with those that did not, whereas those with a theoretical basis failed to record a significant reduction in DBP in contrast to studies with no theoretical basis reported. It may be that theoretically grounded hypotheses are simply poorly described in these studies or that other factors may play a more important part in blood pressure reduction. Included interventions were from a wide range of countries (United States, Korea, Honduras and Mexico, Canada, Finland), suggesting that IDIs were suitable for use across a wide range of health systems. The included interventions featured a range of differing demographics including large differences in age range, ethnicity and sex, which help to increase the generalizability of the findings. The range of mean SBP at baseline was between 128.5-169.5 mmHg and 77.4-88.5 mmHg for DBP, suggesting that IDIS can also be suitable to address a wide range of hypertensive patients.\n\nThe observed magnitude of BP reduction by IDI interventions would have a significant clinical impact at a population level if it was sustained over time. For example, a reduction in SBP of 3 mmHg would be expected to be associated with an 8% reduction in stroke mortality and a 5% reduction in mortality from coronary heart disease  [3] . However, only one study lasted more than 1 year, limiting the information about how the IDIs perform over a longer period of time. The effect of IDIs on other clinical outcomes is uncertain due to the low number of studies, with none assessing the effect on quality-of-life indicators. However, most studies showed improvements in a wide range of other clinical outcomes, potentially adding to the health improvements offered by the use of IDIs. Only one study assessed the cost benefits of its impact, making the cost effectiveness of IDI difficult to gauge. There is also no evidence on how intervention effects may differ by socio-economic status or ethnicity. Nevertheless, in addition to the positive clinical effects found for IDIs, the criteria used for this study of these interventions, not requiring delivery by a health professional, suggest they could have additional benefits in terms of the time and costs saved for health professionals. The review has a number of limitations. Only a small number of studies fulfilled the criteria, and the majority were of average quality, had a limited time span and were relatively small in size, meaning that even for blood pressure outcomes most individual studies were likely to be under-powered. The small number of studies also meant analysis of the possible effects of specific intervention components was limited. No studies assessed the impact on quality of life, and information on cost effectiveness was limited to one study. Information on other clinical outcomes was lacking. One study divided intervention patients by use of intervention and did not provide data for all intervention patients; therefore we averaged the changes in these groups, which may over or under-report the mean change in SBP and DBP in this study. Three further studies  [31, 32, 34]  did not indicate that the outcome analysis was based on an intention-to-treat principle, and this raised the possibility of bias in the reported results. However, as all studies reported the effect of an intervention vs. no intervention, it was decided that these studies should remain in the analysis. Strengths of the study include the fact that for SBP, all studies showed a consistent outcome with no heterogeneity found. The included studies came from a wide range of different countries with large contrasts found in the demographic and clinical characteristics of the populations, suggesting a wide generalizability of the findings.\n\nIn conclusion, IDIs can lower both SBP and DBP compared to usual care. Results suggest these findings can be applied to a wide range of healthcare systems and populations. However, sustainability, long-term clinical effectiveness and the 'active components' of these interventions remain uncertain. In our view, the evidence is not yet robust enough to warrant a change in practice or policy. However, if individual patients wish to use an appropriate IDI, clinicians can feel reassured that the impact is likely to be beneficial."

This result adds to previous evidence of e-health interventions. A large heterogeneity of the effects was observed, likely related to differences in study settings, duration, design, technologies, etc. Unfortunately, it was not possible to systematically report on additional outcomes (e.g. weight, metabolic parameters, quality of life, comorbidities, adherence to treatment, etc.) because these data were not available for all studies. Future studies should address more in-depth secondary effects of such an approach."
