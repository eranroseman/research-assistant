  "abstract": "\uf0b7 A pre specified protocol was registered on the Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews \uf0b7 To the best of our knowledge this is the first systematic review on this topic \uf0b7 The quality of evidence was assessed using the CHEERS checklist \uf0b7 The majority of studies identified were partial economic evaluations \uf0b7 There was difficulty in comparing results due to study heterogeneity \n ABSTRACT The prevalence of type 2 diabetes mellitus continues to rise and simultaneously technology has contributed to the growth of MHealth interventions for its prevention, monitoring and management. This systematic review aimed to summarize and evaluate the quality of the published evidence on cost and cost-effectiveness of mHealth interventions for T2DM. A systematic literature search of PubMed, EMBASE, and Web of Science was conducted for papers up to end of April 2019. We included all partial or full economic evaluations providing cost or cost-effectiveness results for mHealth interventions targeting individuals diagnosed with, or at risk of, type 2 diabetes mellitus. Twenty-three studies met the inclusion criteria. Intervention cost varied substantially based on the type and numbers or combination of technologies used, ranging from 1.8 INT $ to 10101.1 INT $ per patient per year. The studies which presented cost effectiveness results demonstrated highly cost-effective interventions, with cost per QALY gained ranging from 0.4 to 62.5 percent of GDP per capita of the country. The quality of partial economic evaluations was on average lower than that of full economic evaluations. Cost of mHealth interventions varied substantially based on type and combination of technology used, however, where cost-effectiveness results were reported, the intervention was cost-effective.",

      "text": "In 2017, diabetes was ranked as the fourth leading cause of disability globally  [1] . The health consequences of diabetes cause a marked loss of productivity and economic burden to patients, healthcare providers and country's economies, mounting to 1.8% of the global gross domestic product (GDP) and 12% of the global health expenditure in 2018  [2, 3] . Over 80% of yearly deaths due to diabetes occur in developing countries causing drastic economic consequences compared to their developed counterparts  [4] . Diabetes is notoriously difficult to control with only about 50% of patients reaching their treatment targets  [5] . There are multifactorial explanations for this, including the challenges T2DM poses on patients' habits surrounding diet and exercise. Many patients demonstrate low willingness to change their perceptions and actions to alter their undesirable lifestyle habits  [6, 7] . Moreover, treatment plans often consist of multiple daily pharmacological interventions which contribute to poor medication adherence  [8] ."

      "text": "Mobile health (mHealth) uses technology to encourage patients' lifestyle modification and medication adherence by providing portable, every-day interventions to empower patients and encourage them to adhere to their management plans  [9] . The rise of mHealth has heavily correlated with the exponential growth in internet access which has allowed for the creation of wireless healthcare opportunities combining patient empowerment with the convenience of mobile devices  [10, 11] . MHealth interventions are becoming prominent amongst several medical specialties encompassing preventative, curative and chronic management goals. Additionally, mHealth reduces geographic related disparities in health care by removing physical barriers to accessing medical information and providing individuals a \"virtual\" platform. Successful MHealth interventions have shown to significantly reduce hospital inpatient admissions and prompt a 63% reduction in number of admission days  [12] ."

Management based interventions have proven to be particularly successful at reducing haemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c ) levels amongst people with T2DM  [14] . A meta-analysis investigating mobile phone interventions for glycaemic control demonstrated that among 22 trials there was a statistically significant improvement in glycaemic control amongst users of the online intervention  [16] . Similarly, another review found that glycaemic control results were significant amongst T2DM when mobile text messaging interventions were combined with an internet based intervention  [17] . MHealth interventions have proven to be low cost and cost-effective across various medical specialties  [18, 19] . Economic evidence is crucial to guide policy makers and funders towards implementing mHealth interventions. Nevertheless, there is a large gap in the literature analysing the costs and cost-effectiveness of mHealth interventions addressing T2DM  [20] . To the best of our knowledge, there is currently no published literature summarising the cost or cost-effectiveness of mHealth interventions targeting the prevention and control of T2DM. This study aims to systematically review, analyse and summarise the published evidence on the cost and cost-effectiveness of mHealth interventions for T2DM, as well as, to assess the quality of the published evidence."

The included studies were both partial or full economic evaluations for mHealth interventions targeting the prevention or management of T2DM. Partial economic evaluations were defined as evaluations that provide the costs of an intervention, but do not compare the costs with an alternative intervention or to the outcomes of the intervention  [23] . Costs reported as costs of the intervention from either the provider (eg design and implementation), patient or societal perspective will be included in the review. Full economic evaluations are defined as those that do compare the costs of the intervention with one or more alternative interventions and relate these to the measured outcomes. Full economic evaluations include cost-effectiveness analysis (CEA), cost utility analysis (CUA), cost benefit analysis (CBA), cost minimisation analysis and cost-consequence analysis  [23] . All papers including mHealth interventions that were targeting patients at risk of or diagnosed with T2DM were included in this review. MHealth interventions were defined as interventions that included use of the internet, mobile devices or computers. Exclusion Criteria encompassed papers that were not published in a peer reviewed journal or not in the English language. Unpublished documents and grey literature like conference papers, dissertations, and patents were excluded."

Both GR and AH independently assessed the included papers against these checklists and any discrepancies were resolved by discussion and involvement of third author (HHB). Papers that were recognized as meeting the checklist item were given \"yes\" for that category and \"no\" if they did not meet the checklist item. A \"part\" score was given if the paper met some of the checklist requirements, whilst an \"n/a\" was given if this was not relevant to the specific paper. Overall, papers who met over 75% of the checklist item were considered to be of high quality, those meeting 50% to 75% of the checklist they were regarded to be of moderate quality, and if they met less than 50% of checklist items they were labelled as being of poor quality."

To further judge the cost-effectiveness results, national and international cost-effectiveness threshold were used. In the United Kingdom a threshold of \u00a320,000 to \u00a330,000  [28] , and in the USA US$50,000 per Quality Adjusted Life Years (QALY) gained were used  [29] . For other settings, the World Health Organisation (WHO)  [30]  and Wood's et al.'s  [31]  cost-effectiveness thresholds were applied. WHO state that an intervention is highly cost-effective if costeffectiveness ratio (cost per disability-adjusted life years-or DALY averted) is less than the gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and is cost-effective if it is between one and three times the GDP per capita  [30] . Wood's et al.'s  [31]  have estimated cost effectiveness thresholds for each country which are much lower than the WHO threshold and are around 50% GDP per capita. Therefore, based on this threshold, an intervention will be cost-effective if incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) is less than the country GPD per capita  [32] ."

As per the WHO cost-effectiveness threshold all five studies reporting cost per QALY gained were costeffective as ICER as % of GDP per capita ranged from 0.4 to 62.5%. Of these, the two studies that used one mHealth technology reported cost per QALY gained had values of 0.9% and 0.4% of their respective countries' GDP per capita  [36, 37] . Whilst the one study that integrated two mHealth technologies reported costs per QALY gained equivalent to 7% of the GDP per capita (2018) showing high cost effectiveness based on the WHO thresholds  [38] . This intervention involved a weekly nurse led telephone service that would remotely consult patients using an online glucose monitor. Those that integrated three mHealth technologies reported QALY gained values of equivalent to 47.2% and 62.5% of their respective countries' GDP per capita  [39, 40] .\n\nOnly one study, by Wong et al, focused on the prevention of T2DM  [36] . They created a text messaging education service targeted for patients with, or at risk of, T2DM. This intervention costed INT$ 254 per QALY gained and resulted in cost savings of INT$ 28 per patient each year. This was on the lower end of costs compared to the seven interventions based on the management of T2DM. Interestingly, all of the full EEs were based in high income countries.\n\nAs shown in Appendix 2, three of these studies included mHealth interventions supplemented by non-mHealth components. Two of these included extra visits by a clinician whereby one intervention included an extra clinic visit with a doctor that year and the second included an extra three home visits by a care coordinator over the year  [33, 41] .

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "The current study aims to systematically review and summarise the research surrounding the costs and cost-effectiveness of mHealth interventions targeting T2DM. Our results have shown that, overall, the quality of reporting was weak among both partial and full economic evaluations, however, poorer amongst partial evaluations. The cost varied based on the type of intervention, the number of technologies integrated and whether it was combined with a non-mHealth component. Importantly, all those that reported cost-effectiveness results showed that the interventions were highly cost effective.\n\nThe first objective of this review was to summarise the literature on the cost and cost effectiveness of mHealth interventions for diabetes. This review has highlighted a limited number of full economic evaluations in this area. We identified only eight full economic evaluations in the literature. The majority of studies were from high-income countries with none set in low-income settings. This may reflect a technology disparity in lower income countries, but simultaneously represents an opportunity to begin to evaluate mHealth within newer health care systems. We also noticed that 16 out of 23 (70%) studies were RCTs and it is encouraging to find that economic outcomes are increasingly being reported alongside trials, however, further efforts are needed to produce full cost-effectiveness evidence alongside trials.\n\nIt seems that the mHealth interventions with one technology had lower costs with reported costs per patient per year ranging from INT$ 1.8 to INT$ 241.0 compared to those with two technologies (INT$ 61.1 to INT$ 894) and three technologies (INT$ 10.2 to INT$ 10110.1). Interestingly, patients often state too much complexity of the mHealth intervention[57]. Our results seem to agree that often a simple mHealth intervention using only one type of technology may be the most user friendly and also least costly. Another interesting consideration is that the majority of interventions (92%) we found were targeting the management of diabetes with only twos interventions focusing on the prevention of the disease. Evidence surrounding preventative mHealth interventions remains extremely limited. Further exploration into the cost-effectiveness of preventative mHealth interventions for diabetes is warranted.\n\nThe second objective of this review was to evaluate the quality of reporting costs and costeffectiveness evidence. Poor methodological quality is known to be a major area of weakness for healthcare economic evaluations  [58, 59] . This review has highlighted that the methodology of economic evaluations necessitates improvement, especially amongst partial evaluations or costing studies. In these studies, only 1 out of 15 papers (7%) provided evidence on how they identified or valued resources, the dates of costs included, the discount rates used or provided a detailed breakdown of costs. Without being able to explore the costing methodology of a costing paper it remains difficult to scrutinize its generalizability. Lower CHEERS scores might be expected amongst partial economic evaluations as for 12 out of 15 (80%) the costs were not the primary outcome of the study. However, this highlights the need for readers to be cautious when accepting costing results from partial economic evaluations as they may be methodologically flawed. This emphasises the importance of systematic reviews and quality reviews such as this paper. Moreover, a verified modified CHEERS checklist for partial economic evaluations should be developed.\n\nIn conducting this review, we faced a few challenges with the data which are worth mentioning. The first challenge was the heterogeneity amongst the studies due to differences in reported cost, outcome measures, currency and settings. Any review of both full and partial economic evaluations will invariably experience this heterogeneity. We increased comparability by converting reported unit costs and cost-effectiveness results into a common international currency and base year. We also acknowledge that specialized databases for economic evaluations were not used.\n\nSecondly, due to limited relevant papers, we were unable to conduct a sub-analysis the cost of MHealth interventions by income level and geographical region. Individuals living in rural areas often experience the effects of the medical \"brain drain\" and need to travel further to see a doctor. This leaves them at greater risk of having less exposure to health education and having a higher risk of developing conditions like diabetes  [60] . Having more economic data on the impact of mHealth interventions in rural areas could lead to promising results to tackle health inequalities  [61] . Evidence has shown that telemedicine interventions for diabetes can significantly reduce the blood sugar, blood pressure and cholesterol of patients in rural underserved communities  [62] . Until now, only one study has previously demonstrated that an SMS based mHealth intervention in a rural Bangladeshi community increased knowledge about diabetes  [45] . Further exploration into the success of mHealth interventions within rural communities is paramount.\n\nLimitations of our review are due to our search strategy. We only included published evidence in the English language, so we acknowledge there will be some publication bias within our results. We also want to highlight that the generalizability of our results needs to take into consideration the country setting, type of intervention and our methodology used to convert costs into 2018 international dollars."

      "title": "CONCLUSION",
      "text": "This review is the first to evaluate and summarise this area of the literature. Findings point to growing economic evidence on mHealth intervention targeting T2DM, although a limited number of full economic evaluation or cost-effectiveness studies exist. The cost of mHealth interventions varied substantially based on type and combination of technology used. However, where cost-effectiveness results reported, the intervention was highly cost-effective. Continued efforts towards integration of high-quality economic evaluations within trials are required to strengthen the economic evidence for mHealth interventions targeting diabetes in different populations, in particular in low-and middle-income countries."
