  "title": "Co-designing a Lifestyle-Focused Text Message Intervention for Women After Breast Cancer Treatment: Mixed Methods Study",
  "abstract": "Background: Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women globally. Recovery from breast cancer treatment can be mentally and physically challenging. SMS text message programs offer a novel way to provide health information and support, but few programs are co-designed with consumer representatives. Objective: This study aims to report the procedures and outcomes of a co-design process of a lifestyle-focused SMS text message program to support women's mental and physical health after breast cancer treatment. \n Methods: We followed an iterative mixed methods two-step process: (1) co-design workshop with consumers and health professionals and researchers to draft text messages and (2) evaluation of message content, which was scored (5-point Likert scale; 1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree) for ease of understanding, usefulness, and appropriateness, and readability (Flesch-Kincaid score). Additional free-text responses and semistructured interviews were coded into themes. Messages were edited or deleted based on the evaluations, with consumers' evaluations prioritized. \n Results: In step 1, co-designed text messages (N=189) were semipersonalized, and the main content themes were (1) physical activity and healthy eating, (2) medications and side effects, (3) mental health, and (4) general breast cancer information. In step 2, consumers (n=14) and health professionals and researchers (n=14) provided 870 reviews of 189 messages and found that most messages were easy to understand (799/870, 91.8%), useful (746/870, 85.7%), and appropriate (732/870, 84.1%). However, consumers rated 50 messages differently from health professionals and researchers. On the basis of evaluations, 37.6% (71/189) of messages were deleted, 36.5% (69/189) were edited, and 12 new messages related to fatigue, self-care, and cognition were",

      "text": "Breast cancer is the most commonly diagnosed cancer among women globally  [1] . More than 2 million women finish active breast cancer treatment (ie, surgery, chemotherapy, or radiotherapy) yearly  [1] , and many experience treatment-related mental and physical health challenges  [2, 3] . The 2013 Breast Health Global Initiative consensus statement posits that access to posttreatment information and support should be allocated to all patients  [3] . However, there are limited survivorship care services  [3] . Existing services usually occur in person, during work hours, or far from home, which increases the financial burden  [4]  and limits accessibility. Moreover, these services are rarely co-designed with patients  [5, 6] . Accessible posttreatment health support programs are required."

      "title": "The Importance of Consumer Co-design",
      "text": "Co-design is the process by which service providers and consumers collaborate to develop meaningful and creative solutions. The benefits of co-design include improved services, provider-consumer interactions, and consumer engagement and experiences  [7] . The key to effective co-design is making end-users' or consumers' lived experiences central throughout the project's lifespan  [8]  because it adds a unique and diverse perspective  [8, 9] . For example, citizen collaborators can be employed as active members of the research team from study conception to final dissemination  [9] . Qualitative data suggest that access to posttreatment health information and support are among breast cancer survivors' top priorities for service improvement  [2, 10] . Enlisting breast cancer survivors as co-designers for novel posttreatment services may help place survivors' priorities at the forefront and strengthen the intervention's impact."

      "text": "Mobile health (mHealth) uses mobile devices such as mobile phones to deliver health services  [11] . mHealth interventions delivered by text messages are the most accessible to patients, as they are inexpensive, do not require internet for delivery, and can be sent anytime and anywhere with mobile services  [12] . Moreover, text message programs effectively deliver health education to patients  [12, 13]  and are easily co-designed  [14] . Co-designed text message programs improved health-promoting behaviors among patients with heart disease  [13]  and were cost-saving for the health care system compared with traditional delivery methods  [15] . A 2015 systematic review revealed that there were no text message interventions for cancer survivors  [16] ; more recently, there is some evidence that breast cancer survivors find the delivery of health support via text messages acceptable  [17, 18]  and effective for improving adherence to endocrine therapy tablets  [19, 20]  or maintain weight loss  [21] . However, no studies reported that the interventions were co-designed and most focused on physical health outcomes, not including mental health messages within the intervention. Therefore, co-designing a text message intervention with women who completed active breast cancer treatment may be an innovative solution to reduce barriers to posttreatment health information and support."

WBCI resides within a large tertiary hospital in Western Sydney, Australia, serving a multicultural and diverse socioeconomic population (approximately 2.3 million people in 2016)  [22] . The study was approved by the Western Sydney Local Health District Human Research Ethics Committee (AU RED HREC/18/WMEAD/281). All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards.

Moreover, assisting people in setting attainable goals and identifying barriers and strategies for overcoming barriers can facilitate goal achievement  [24] . Table  1  provides examples of message content and corresponding behavior change techniques. In addition, researchers have found that people enjoy supportive personalized messages with a positive tone  [26, 27] .

      "text": "A combination of feedback surveys and semistructured interviews were conducted to evaluate the message content. For the feedback surveys, each participant provided basic demographic information regarding age, sex, and expertise (lived experience or health professional or researcher), and then evaluated 32 draft text messages (maximum 15 min) presented as 1 to 2 sentences on paper in a private room (consumers) or via a password-protected web-based database (health professionals or researchers). Owing to time constraints, one health professional evaluated only 16 messages. Message content related to medication adherence and side effects were reviewed by consumers who reported taking endocrine therapy tablets previously or at the time of the study.\n\nThe feedback survey contained 4 questions for each draft text message, with three 5-point Likert scale (1=strongly disagree to 5=strongly agree) questions: \"This message was easy to understand;\" \"The information provided in this message is useful;\" \"This message is appropriate for women with breast cancer\" and one free-text response question, \"Do you have any suggestions to improve this message?\" The Likert scale questions were summarized by the number and percentage of consumers' or health professionals and researchers' evaluations that agreed or strongly agreed that the messages were easy to understand, useful, and appropriate. Internal consistency was found among the 3 questions (Cronbach \u03b1=.88); therefore, each message received a mean score out of 15 (5 points per question; strongly disagree=1 point, strongly agree=5 points), which was the total score provided by each participant divided by the number of participants that evaluated the message. The mean consumer versus health professional and researcher score was also calculated for each message. Researchers were guided by a mean score <12 out of 15 (<80%), indicating less preference for a message from participants. All message scores and free-text replies were reviewed in parallel to guide message edits or deletions. If consumers and health professionals or researchers' ratings differed, priority was given to consumers' evaluations.\n\nFree-text consumer and health professional or researcher evaluations were collated for each message. The citizen collaborator evaluated all messages via free-text feedback. After completing the feedback survey, consumers were invited to brief (10-15 min) semistructured interviews that explored participants' most and least liked text messages, suggestions for additional message themes, the appropriateness of the language within the messages (too complicated vs too simple), and whether a SMS text message program would have been helpful during the transition from hospital care to health self-management. The interviews were audio-recorded and transcribed verbatim. The free-text feedback and interview transcripts were open-coded using inductive thematic content analysis in NVivo 11 (QSR International) by 2 independent parallel coders (AS and RR). The researchers discussed codes until they reached an agreement on themes. The feedback survey results and interviews were used to inform message refinement (edits, deletions, or creation of new message content)."

      "text": "Step 1: Co-design Workshop Consumers (n=2) and health professionals and researchers (n=4; health psychologist, specialist breast cancer surgeon, physiotherapist and digital health researcher, and psychology researcher) attended the workshop. The group decided that the program would be one-way (no replies) as consumers did not want to feel pressure to reply. Our team's previous research also showed that one-way messaging was well-liked by patients with heart disease and helped them feel supported  [27] . Next, the group decided that the text messages would be delivered randomly 4 times per week, as consumers felt that 1-2 messages were too few to be useful but 6 or 7 would be annoying. In our previous research, 4 messages per week were found to be acceptable  [27] . Unlike our team's previous research, which only delivered messages on weekdays  [14] , the consumers desired messages to be delivered Monday-Saturday (maximum 1 message per day) because people may have more time to read messages on the weekend. Messages would be delivered at 9 AM, noon, 3 PM, or 6 PM to mimic the unpredictability of how a friend or family member would text and gain insights into future process evaluations as to what times are best. The team decided that 1 message per theme would be delivered per week in random order, as consumers indicated that a specific order was not required. The co-designed message content themes were (1) physical activity and healthy eating, (2) endocrine therapy tablet (medication) adherence and side effects, (3) social and emotional well-being, and (4) general breast cancer information. Moreover, participants wanted messages to contain links to trustworthy websites because it can be challenging to navigate cancer information on the web. It was also agreed that the program would be semipersonalized according to the participants' preferred name or nickname, and there would be specific messages for participants taking endocrine therapy tablets because these tablets can cause challenging side effects and medication nonadherence  [32] .\n\nA total of 274 messages were co-designed; 157 messages were drafted during the workshop, and 117 were created by the authors, including the citizen collaborator, after the workshop. The citizen collaborator's content subtheme ideas included posttreatment financial support, difficulties returning to work (fatigue, treatment side effects, or cognitive load), and practical solutions for medication side effects. After revision of the messages by authors AS, JR, SRP, and RR, 189 co-designed messages remained for evaluation in step 2. Reasons for deletion included repetitive ideas or content (65/274, 24%), negative message tone (11/274, 4%), and message content not being relevant to breast cancer survivors (9/274, 4%)\n\nStep 2: Text Message Content Evaluation Participants Consumers (14/16, 87.5%) and health professionals or researchers (14/14, 100%) completed the message evaluation; 2 consumers (2/16, 12.5%) did not return their surveys and were not included in the analyses. The mean age of consumers was 60 (SD 10) years, and the mean age of health professionals or researchers was 46 (SD 8) years. Most participants were White (12/14, 86% of consumers; 12/14, 86% of health professionals or researchers) women (14/14, 100% of consumers; 12/14, 86% of health professionals or researchers)."

Examples of discrepant evaluation scores and free-text feedback are presented in Table  2 . The number of free-text responses was similar between health professionals (n=150) and consumers (n=156), suggesting that the media on which they conducted the surveys (in person vs on the web) did not bias the feedback.

Could use breast cancer experiences instead\" (female, age 41 years), and a health professional's feedback mirrored this sentiment: \"some people don't like the word journey, maybe consider alternative eg experience\" (female, age 62 years). Therefore, journey was replaced with the term experience throughout. Consumers also felt that messages relating to alcohol and cooking food on a barbeque were not appropriate in some cultures. For example, a consumer stated, \"I heard the BBQ is not good for cancer people because when protein and oil getting burnt...burnt food is no good for cancer\" and later explained, \"here is one about limit[ing] alcohol. It's a good message but some people when they read that message, even they don't want to drink alcohol. Some people read it and they might think 'oh maybe I can drink alcohol'\" (consumer, female, age 50 years). All messages about alcohol were deleted, and the word BBQ was replaced with a suggestion to bake the food.\n\nTextbox 1. Consumer and citizen collaborator message content themes and quotes."

[Consumer, female, age 50 years] Theme 2: Impact of Side Effects I was slowly recuperating pretty good, but I'm still not over it yet, it's been over 12 months...Tiredness, sometimes I can't do housework. [Consumer, female, age 76 years] Fatigue was huge. And it would always hit you sort of 2, 3 o'clock in the afternoon. [Consumer, female, age 56 years] Theme 3: Motivation for Exercise have an exercise buddy or just a friend that you meet to go and have a walk with or walk your dog...just go I'm meeting so and so and we're going to do this today, and it's like keeping an appointment [Consumer, female, age 56 years] [My smartwatch] counted the amount of steps I did every day...so it would tell me how many kilometres I had done. It gives you this sense of achievement at the end of the week. [Consumer, female, age 56 years] One thing you could add is a reminder that finding time to exercise and eat healthy can be really hard when you struggle with fatigue, but that it will actually help give you more energy. [Citizen collaborator, female, age 30 years] after operation...it's been 3 years...but still pain and the scar is hard. When I'm moving it feels hard [tight]. The doctor said more exercises, stretch and do some physical therapy. [Consumer, female, age 50 years] On the basis of the feedback (Likert scale, free-text questions, and interviews), 36.5% (69/189) of messages were edited, 37.6% (71/189) were deleted (score <12 or repetitive concept), and 12 new messages were created; 130 evidence-based, co-designed messages remained: 55.4% (72/130) of messages relating to the theme of physical activity and healthy eating, 29.2% (38/130) regarding social and emotional well-being, 32.3% (42/130) regarding general breast cancer information, and 28.5% (37/130) regarding medication adherence and side effects. Subthemes from step 1, such as financial support and practical solutions for side effects (fatigue, hot flushes, and cognitive load), were included within these four broader themes."

      "text": "This study reports the outcomes of a co-design process  [14]  and the development of a bank of evidence-based text messages.\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first SMS text message intervention to be co-designed by breast cancer survivors, a citizen collaborator, health professionals, and researchers, and includes both mental and physical health messages. The message content was combined with clinical guidelines  [28]  and behavior change techniques  [23] . Messages were evaluated highly for ease of understanding, usefulness, and appropriateness for breast cancer survivors by consumers, health professionals, and researchers. Although there were discrepancies between some consumers' and health professionals and researchers' mean message ratings, the consumers' feedback was prioritized to ensure that their voices were at the forefront of the co-design process. Compared with the initial bank of draft text messages (n=274), the resulting 130 evidence-based co-designed text messages were evaluated highly (score \u226512/15, 80% and positive qualitative feedback) by participants and focused on topics of interest to consumers-namely, social and emotional well-being, healthy eating, physical activity, medication adherence, side effects, and general breast cancer information. Overall, this iterative co-design process was feasible, produced an improved final text message bank, and highlighted the importance of consumer co-design.\n\nSMS text message interventions are becoming increasingly popular as mHealth strategies  [33] . However, there is sparse research on women with breast cancer  [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] , and few programs describe the process of text message content development  [34] . For example, health literacy is often overlooked or not reported in the development of eHealth programs  [35] . In this study, messages were short and rated highly for ease of understanding, which is supported by the Flesch-Kincaid grade level 7 and readability score (SD 68.9). These scores indicate that anyone with an education grade of 7 or above would likely understand the messages  [31] , which may reduce health literacy barriers  [30]  and increase user acceptability  [27] . Moreover, health professionals, researchers, and consumers feedback revealed that a positive message tone was important, which is consistent across studies  [27, 36] . Recent systematic reviews reveal that message tailoring and personalization may  [37]  or may not  [38]  improve program efficacy, and message content does not need to be based on a theoretical framework to be effective  [38] . Qualitative results suggest that it may be the overall impact of the program rather than a single program component that end users find helpful  [27] . However, for adequate comparison across interventions, the development of message content should be clearly reported  [37, 38] . Factors including the co-design strategy, behavior change theories, readability, and message personalization can help elucidate what makes an effective and well-liked intervention.\n\nThis study also provides a framework for developing and implementing SMS text message programs with consumers' voices at the forefront. Previous studies have developed and refined messages with health professionals, and consumers reviewed the edited messages  [14, 39] . This strategy may miss message topics or lived experiences important to consumers and limit program and delivery impact. Conversely, this study simultaneously involved consumers and a citizen collaborator with health professionals and researchers throughout the message development, review, and refinement. Moreover, all participants (consumers, a citizen collaborator, health professionals, and researchers) reviewed the same initial messages and were provided equal opportunity for opinions; furthermore, we prioritized consumer ratings when refining messages. Research shows that developing programs with consumers and citizen collaborators can improve user acceptance and engagement  [7, 9] , which may explain the high rating of message usefulness and acceptability from both consumers and health professionals and researchers in this study. However, an ongoing challenge is to provide adequate compensation to consumers for their involvement and efforts. The National Health and Medical Research Council recently released guidelines for the involvement of consumers in research, which suggest that consumer reimbursement (financial, authorship, or acknowledgment) should be considered when planning a project or applying for grants  [40] . These guidelines may help future researchers to identify barriers and enablers in consumer co-design."

      "title": "Implications for Practice",
      "text": "The proliferation of breast cancer survivors is a testament to improvement in treatment  [1] . However, women's mental health can be impacted years after a breast cancer diagnosis  [41, 42]  and increase the urgency for ongoing supportive care. There is evidence that eHealth self-management programs during cancer treatment can reduce women's distress and depression  [43, 44] . However, few programs address the mental health concerns that arise after treatment  [45] . In fact, many text message programs focus on improving physical behaviors such as physical activity, healthy eating, smoking cessation, and medication adherence  [34] . However, previous research shows that mental and physical health are closely related and that consumers desire mental health information  [5, 46, 47] . This program endeavored to fill this gap by co-designing messages for mental health after breast cancer treatment. The consumer feedback from this study provided further evidence that loneliness and treatment side effects are ongoing concerns that may impact mental health. This world-first co-designed program for breast cancer survivors may therefore add to current posttreatment support services by offering an overall lifestyle-focused approach, including both mental and physical health promotion.\n\nAlthough the study provides new evidence for the co-design of SMS text message interventions for breast cancer survivors, it has some limitations. The number of consumers was relatively small, and most were White, which may not be generalizable to the priorities of the wider breast cancer community. However, cultural considerations, such as alcohol intake and cooking styles, were considered in the message evaluations and refinements. Consumers were recruited from WBCI, which services a large (about 2.3 million) multilingual and socioeconomically diverse population in Western Sydney. Half (49%) of the Western Sydney population speak a non-English language at home, including 8.5% who reported speaking English not well or not at all  [22] . It is possible that the requirement to read and understand English limited some people from participating. However, this study demonstrates that the co-design process is acceptable and can be easily replicated in other populations or languages. To increase the diversity and number of message reviewers, future research should provide videoconference options for co-design workshops and web-based options for text message evaluation surveys, where possible and allowable through ethics. Reducing access barriers will allow women from distant or rural communities to offer important inputs. Moreover, the final text message bank will be evaluated in a randomized controlled trial and process evaluation  [48] . A diverse sample of 160 women will be recruited to provide feedback via a questionnaire and focus groups to elucidate the feasibility and acceptability of the message content and overall one-way program within the wider breast cancer community."
