  "title": "Digital therapeutics-based lifestyle intervention for gestational diabetes mellitus prevention of high-risk pregnant women: a study protocol for a non-randomised controlled trial",
  "abstract": "Introduction Digital therapeutics have been approved as a treatment aid for various medical conditions and are increasingly prevalent. Despite numerous studies on the potential of digital therapeutic interventions in preventing gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), there is a critical need for more high-quality, large-scale studies to validate their effectiveness. This need arises from the inconsistencies in results and variations in the quality of previous research. \n Methods and analysis We propose a non-randomised controlled trial involving 800 high-risk pregnant women in 6 maternity and child health hospitals in Fujian, China. This study aims to investigate the role and effectiveness of digital therapeutics-based lifestyle intervention in managing the health of pregnant women at high risk for GDM. The study will compare the differences in GDM prevalence, pregnancy weight management and other pregnancy-related health outcomes between pregnant women who received digital therapeutics-based lifestyle intervention and those in the control group. The intervention includes dietary guidance, a personalised physical activity programme and lifestyle improvement strategies delivered through a smartphone app. Primary outcomes include the incidence of GDM at 24-28 weeks gestation and gestational weight gain (GWG). Secondary outcomes comprise improvements in individual lifestyle and risk factors, nutritional issues, implementation outcomes and other pregnancy-related outcomes.",

      "text": "Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is defined as abnormal glucose metabolism that is first recognised during pregnancy, accounting for 5%-25% of all pregnancies.  1 In 2021, the International Diabetes Federation reported that 16.7% of women had hyperglycaemia during pregnancy, 80.3% of whom had GDM, and the prevalence of GDM increased from 4% in 2010 to 21% in 2020.  2  GDM not only increases the risk of preeclampsia, preterm birth, miscarriage, type 2 DM and cardiovascular disease in mothers but also may lead to fetal macrosomia, intrauterine growth retardation and future obesity, cardiovascular disease in the adulthood of infants.  [3] [4] 4] [5]  The increase in GDM brings a huge burden on the global economy.  6 7 For example, in China, the prevalence of GDM in 2015 was 17.5%, with an economic burden of 19.36 billion yuan, accounting for 0.5% of public health spending.  8 GDM is not covered by maternity insurance, and 60% of births are paid for"

[16] [17] ] [18]  Previous research mainly focused on glycaemic control and complications prevention after the diagnosis of GDM. However, domestic and international scholars have also begun to explore early pregnancy interventions aimed at delaying or preventing the onset of GDM in recent years, with lifestyle intervention being the primary method. Lifestyle intervention, encompassing dietary adjustment and physical exercise, have been shown to effectively mitigate the progression of GDM among high-risk pregnant women. The Gestational Diabetes Prevention Study indicated that a combination of moderate physical activity and dietary intervention reduced the incidence of GDM by 39% in high-risk pregnant women.  19 A systematic review and meta-analysis involving 30 871 pregnant women demonstrated that dietary patterns such as the Mediterranean diet, dietary approaches to discourage hypertension and the Healthy Eating Index diet decreased the relative risk of GDM by 18%-35%.  20 Furthermore, evidence from prospective cohort studies also suggested that a diet rich in vegetables, fruits and rice-based foods reduced the occurrence of GDM in Chinese pregnant women.  21 Physical exercise has been recognised as an effective method to manage weight gain during pregnancy and enhance insulin sensitivity.  22 A prospective randomised clinical trial conducted in China revealed that engaging in physical activity for at least 30 min three times a week, commencing in early pregnancy, reduced the incidence of GDM in overweight pregnant women by 45.8%.  23 24 Additionally, two meta-analyses indicated that the intervention group following an aerobic, lowintensity to moderate-intensity exercise programme had a 28%-31% lower risk of GDM compared with the control group, with a discrepancy in gestational weight gain of approximately 1.1 kg.  25 26  Therefore, personalised lifestyle intervention should be implemented in early pregnancy for high-risk women and sustained throughout the duration of pregnancy.\n\nAlthough lifestyle intervention was commonly used in clinical practice, the prevalence of GDM in China continues rising, indicating a need for more targeted intervention among high-risk women. Traditional maternal and child healthcare heavily relies on face-toface counselling, which faces challenges such as lack of standardisation and poor patient compliance with behaviour intervention. This makes it difficult to provide effective feedback and support. Therefore, there is an urgent need to shift from a 'one-size-fits-all' pattern to individualised intervention strategies that consider individual differences, including behavioural and socioeconomic factors.\n\nWith the increasing popularity and advancement of mobile internet, digital products are transforming various aspects of our lives. In the healthcare sector, digital technology is revolutionising the treatment, prevention and management of health conditions. Currently, 'digital therapeutics' have emerged as a highly promising field in the healthcare industry. These therapies are evidence-based treatment or intervention delivered to patients through high-quality software programmes. They primarily aim to prevent, manage or treat diseases effectively.\n\nIn particular, lifestyle intervention based on digital therapies has emerged as an important research direction for the prevention of GDM. However, despite the widespread interest in this research field, inconsistencies and qualitative differences in the results of existing studies revealed that key questions remain unanswered. These issues include how to develop efficient and feasible digital intervention strategies to minimise the risk of GDM and how to assess the applicability and effectiveness of these intervention in different population. These challenges point to the urgent need to validate and optimise the effectiveness of digital therapeutics-based lifestyle intervention programme for practical application through more rigorous study designs, larger sample size and more nuanced interventions. Based on this background, this study aims to evaluate in depth the effectiveness of an innovative digital therapeutics-based lifestyle intervention programme in the prevention of GDM in high-risk pregnant women through a multicentre, large sample size, non-randomised controlled trial to address the key issues in current research.\n\nDigital therapy is not only complementary to traditional medical treatments but also addresses deficiencies that exist in patients, providers, and the healthcare system by automating the clinical process through artificial intelligence learning to integrate clinical knowledge graphs and expert experience. For patients, digital therapies increase accessibility and adherence to healthcare, reduce the cost of accessing care and enable patients to receive services at their homes and interact one-on-one with healthcare professionals if necessary. For healthcare providers, digital therapies save precious time by automating operations, increasing service capacity, reducing service costs and improving service efficiency. Based on these advantages, we have developed a digital therapeutics-based lifestyle intervention aimed to reducing the risk of GDM through lifestyle changes, thus providing new strategies and perspectives on the prevention of GDM in high-risk pregnant women."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "This article presents a detailed description of a nonrandomised controlled trial, designed to evaluate the effectiveness of a digital therapeutics-based lifestyle intervention on the incidence of GDM in high-risk pregnant women. The digital therapeutics-based lifestyle intervention aims to change the health behaviour of GDM highrisk pregnant women by providing health information and lifestyle intervention through the development of a smart medical portal and smartphone app. Lifestyle intervention plays an important role in preventing GDM and a smartphone app supports a safe and convenient way for pregnant women to access health information and can be used by anywhere and anyone, especially for those who live in remote areas or have limited access to healthcare resources.\n\nThe non-randomised controlled trial will allow participants to choose interventions to their wishes that are more meaningful to them, taking into account individual differences and specific health needs. In addition, the non-randomised controlled trial can be conducted in conditions that are more closely aligned with real medical conditions, which can better reflect the actual effects of the intervention in routine medical practice. Therefore, if the digital therapeutics-based lifestyle intervention significantly helps high-risk pregnant women in preventing GDM, this method is expected to play a very useful role for both pregnant women and medical staff.\n\nHowever, there are limitations to this study. First, due to the nature of a non-randomised trial, the poor comparability of the baseline characteristics needs to be adjusted through well-designed statistical analyses to assess the effectiveness of the intervention. Second, poor compliance might occur owing to the cumbersomeness of the intervention process in the intervention group. Additionally, while the smart medical technology can provide personalised advice, this personalisation may be limited and may not fully address the unique health conditions and needs of each pregnant woman."
