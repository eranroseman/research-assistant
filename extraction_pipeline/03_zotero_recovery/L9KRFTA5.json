  "title": "Developing and Evaluating Digital Interventions to Promote Behavior Change in Health and Health Care: Recommendations Resulting From an International Workshop",
  "abstract": "Devices and programs using digital technology to foster or support behavior change (digital interventions) are increasingly ubiquitous, being adopted for use in patient diagnosis and treatment, self-management of chronic diseases, and in primary prevention. They have been heralded as potentially revolutionizing the ways in which individuals can monitor and improve their health behaviors and health care by improving outcomes, reducing costs, and improving the patient experience. However, we are still mainly in the age of promise rather than delivery. Developing and evaluating these digital interventions presents new challenges and new versions of old challenges that require use of improved and perhaps entirely new methods for research and evaluation. This article discusses these challenges and provides recommendations aimed at accelerating the rate of progress in digital behavior intervention research and practice. Areas addressed include intervention development in a rapidly changing technological landscape, promoting user engagement, advancing the underpinning science and theory, evaluating effectiveness and cost-effectiveness, and addressing issues of regulatory, ethical, and information governance. This article is the result of a two-day international workshop on how to create, evaluate, and implement effective digital interventions in relation to health behaviors.",

      "text": "Programs and devices using digital technology (digital interventions) have great potential to improve population health and the efficiency and reach of health care delivery. Mobile apps, SMS (short message service) messages, wearable and ambient sensors, social media, and interactive websites can improve health by supporting behaviors involved in disease prevention, self-management of long-term conditions, and delivery of evidence-based health care practice. Such interventions also have potential to do harm if they provide inappropriate advice, involve interactions that undermine desired behaviors, inappropriately share data, or are used instead of more effective behavior change interventions.\n\nMany of these digital interventions seek to foster or support behavior change on the part of health care professionals, patients, or the general public. The challenges involved in developing, evaluating, and implementing effective digital behavior change interventions (DBCIs), and preventing the use of counterproductive ones, have only just begun to be delineated, let alone met  [1] . Some of the challenges are similar to those faced by other behavior change interventions, but many are unique, including those of pace of development, engagement with the intervention, measurement of effectiveness and cost effectiveness, and compliance with regulatory, ethical, and security requirements. These challenges are set out in more detail in Table  1 .\n\nTable 1. Challenges for developing and evaluating digital interventions targeting behavior change. Challenges Topics Rapid technological change and iterative development cycles make it necessary to continually update and adapt interventions."

Theory Methods of characterizing intervention components, mode of delivery, and contexts that characterize their essential features are required but limited.\n\nControlling the testing environment is made problematic by the ready availability of alternative interventions."

For example, the type and amount of data that can be collected creates unprecedented potential to test and advance theories; understanding more about human behavior will enable the development of more effective DBCIs  [2] . Rising to these challenges and making the most of opportunities will require the expertise and collaboration of a wide range of academic disciplines such as behavioral, computer, and engineering sciences and user-centered design.\n\nGiven the explosion of development and use of DBCIs aimed at improving health, there is a need for recommendations for designing, evaluating, and implementing digital interventions in health care. Such recommendations are needed to (1) identify the scientific principles relevant to developing effective DBCIs, making digital research more efficient and future interventions safer and more effective and (2) to support key disciplines, health care professionals, patients, and the public to work together more effectively to advance research methods and the understanding and techniques of behavior change through digital technology.\n\nTo this end, an international workshop of experts in relevant fields was convened to consider the challenges, opportunities, and strategies for advancement and to formulate principles for developing and evaluating DBCIs. The workshop led to a series of publications  [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . This paper discusses key recommendations arising from the workshop and subsequent discussion."

The 42 participants from four countries were selected to include those who develop, evaluate, use, and fund DBCIs for both research and practical purposes. Participants included health care professionals, population health researchers (eg, systematic reviewers, behavioral scientists, and health economists), and intervention developers. The workshop proposal (led by SM) and steering group are shown in Multimedia Appendix 1.\n\nThe primary deliverable from this workshop was a set of journal articles that would summarize key issues for research in DBCIs and a synoptic paper setting out some key recommendations.\n\nSix topics were identified through discussion amongst the participants. Leaders for each topic were identified and participants were asked to sign up to one or more topics on the basis that they would actively contribute to writing the papers. The topics were (1) the pace of technological development,  (2)  understanding and promoting effective engagement with users, (3) advancing models and theories, (4) evaluation strategies, (5) economic evaluation, and (  6 ) regulation and governance.\n\nThe writing groups met by teleconference before the workshop to write draft papers that were circulated to the whole group in advance of the workshop. These drafts provided the structure and basis of the discussions at the workshop. A formal consensus process was not used, but the structured and open discussions did not reveal any fundamental disagreements about the nature of the recommendations, while at the same time supporting their refinement and specificity. Scribes were appointed from the writing groups to take and circulate notes of relevant points for each paper and the proceedings were audio-recorded. The writing groups developed five articles after the workshop, now published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine (AJPM)  [1, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] .\n\nThe five articles informed the recommendations presented in this article. All authors were workshop participants (SM was PI for the project and LY and KP were Editors of the AJPM Special Section)."

As with the previous recommendation, the change in scale of the data now attainable from new technologies is analogous to the changes that happened in the field of meteorology when multi-scale and multilevel sensors, combined with improved computing capabilities, enabled weather prediction models to be rapidly built, tested, improved, and retested  [11] .

However, the association is often not strong. For some users and contexts, just one in-depth period of engagement with the DBCI may be sufficient to initiate new habits or teach new skills, whereas for other types of behavior change or other users, brief but timely context-triggered prompts may be needed long-term, whenever the behavior is required  [14] . It is therefore important to empirically establish what the \"effective\" engagement required to achieve behavior change is, in a particular intervention context and for any particular user, as this is likely to differ for different types of interventions and target behaviors."

These approaches are useful in the development of any intervention, but are particularly important for developing DBCIs; human therapists can adjust their advice in real time based on user reactions, whereas the content and delivery of DBCIs must be pre-adapted during development to anticipate a range of user reactions. This involves carrying out iterative qualitative research and stakeholder consultation throughout the design and development process. Tailoring interventions to different needs and preferences can improve engagement, but a well-designed intervention that allows choice is often accessible and engaging for a wide range of users. Adding human support is also known to promote engagement with many interventions  [18] . However, as tailoring and human support both increase the cost of interventions, it is important to establish when and how interventions need to be tailored to the individual or supplemented by human support."

This allows the building of idiographic models of behavior change and the personalization of DBCIs, that is, the tailoring of the DBCI content and delivery to individuals. It allows DBCIs to adapt, as data are gathered about how the person responds in different contexts.

Such knowledge-organizing structures are called \"ontologies\"  [22, 23] . Work is beginning to develop an ontology of behavior change interventions.

An example of this approach is \"Drink Less,\" a mobile app  [25]  to reduce excessive alcohol consumption in which five theoretically distinct modules were tested in a full factorial trial (Normative feedback, Feedback and self-monitoring, Identity change, Action planning, and Cognitive bias re-training)  [26] . This allows the linking of theory to intervention content, the investigation of which techniques and mechanisms is doing the \"heavy lifting\" in effective interventions and enables the cumulative process of advancing theory and developing more effective DBCIs.\n\nTesting and advancing theory is strengthened by supplementing these quantitative data analytic strategies with qualitative research methods."

This may include development, implementation, update, and eventual obsolescence. While scaling interventions may be cheap, with a low additional unit cost, development costs can be high at the start of the process and need to be fully included in calculations.\n\nThe rapid cycle of development for many DBCIs, with multiple versions of a product that evolves with small iterative and incremental improvements, is different from that of the relatively fixed products common in the pharmaceutical and medical devices industries. The cost of these iterations must be captured and included across the lifespan of the intervention.

This was emphasized in the United States in a 2016 report from the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine  [32] , which advocated reflecting the contemporary realities of new research contexts, including accessibility and use of personal data."

      "text": "DBCIs will need to navigate the complex landscape of regulation and governance. Many of these interventions fall at the blurred edges of existing regulatory frameworks, which evolved in a pre-digital and less software-intensive era. Depending on their nature, many DBCIs will be classified as medical devices. A lack of consistency of approach between countries means that those developing interventions will need to carefully monitor and engage with the emerging frameworks of the jurisdictions they work within. Regulatory organizations include the United Kingdom's Medicines & Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency, which has issued specific guidance on apps  [33]  and the US Federal Trade Commission, which has released similar advice  [34] . In addition, although several frameworks for assessment exist, there is diversity in views about what the necessary domains of quality are for DBCIs. Developers will need to understand this variation and create the appropriate evidence to match these specifications. Developing assessment frameworks in the United Kingdom include the National Health Service (NHS) app assessment model  [35]  and the European Union mHealth assessment guidelines  [36] ."

      "text": "There are unique challenges of information governance, as DBCIs may produce large amounts of personal, identifiable, and potentially valuable data. As data is often collected directly from mobile devices, this may include geographical information or information related to contacts and social networks.\n\nThose developing interventions will have to comply with local legislation that varies in scope and detail. Relevant legislation includes the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) [37] in the United States, the Data Protection Act [38] (together with the Caldecott principles) in the United Kingdom, and the General Data Privacy Regulation in the EU [39]. In addition, DBCIs may have more benefit if they are able to formally interact with health care delivery systems and, in particular, with electronic health records, requiring compatibility with local (and often highly variable) standards."

      "title": "Provide Clear and Transparent Information on How Data From the Intervention Will Be Used and Shared",
      "text": "Beyond the essential regulatory frameworks, there are wider societal questions that have not yet been definitively answered regarding acceptability of data collection and sharing with competing commercial and ethical demands on data ownership. Some interventions are provided on a fee-for-use basis. Others have more complicated business models where a product is provided for free, but data is made available to the provider.\n\nThere may be a trade-off that the public is willing to make between sharing their own data, effectiveness of interventions, and cost. As the threshold of acceptability is still being understood-and as this threshold may vary between populations and individuals-developers will need to tread cautiously and transparently. In addition, ownership of the data produced by DBCIs is not always clear and may vary by jurisdiction. These data have the potential to be a valuable resource for health care research and service planning  [40] , but the public may not be aware of these potential uses and may have reservations about how the data are used  [41] . Developers should provide clarity about how and with whom they share their data. They may also wish to make sure that the business model for provision of their intervention is openly reported."

      "text": "The approaches used to address the compelling health problems of our times should be based in state-of-the-art science in medicine, public health, and the social and behavioral sciences. They must also reflect advances in other disciplines such as engineering, data science, systems science, human-computer interaction, and communications technologies, in particular if these promise to improve the means by which we both understand the determinants of health and improve health behaviors. Innovations in digital health are now emerging on several fronts that demonstrate the utility of methods drawn from these fields. This should not surprise anyone who is engaged as a digital citizen in the increasingly smart and connected world in which we now live. The mobile in our pockets, purses, or backpacks is becoming both an increasingly important window on the potential of digital health and an enabler thereof. Thus, there is a need to consider several implications of these developments and optimally shape them as they go forward.\n\nThe ways in which users engage with digital interventions are changing as fast as the technologies for delivering them, and it is important that our methods of conceptualizing and assessing engagement keep pace. Earlier, PC-based digital interventions often replicated a series of therapeutic or coaching \"sessions,\" and engagement was defined simply as completing sufficient sessions to receive the full therapeutic program. However, mobile users of just-in-time adaptive interventions may just engage briefly at the crucial time-point with precisely the required behavior change support. The \"effective\" engagement required for behavior change support is therefore likely to differ, depending on the users and their contexts, and can only be determined by analyzing complex patterns of relationships between usage, user experiences, and outcomes. A challenge for future research into DBCIs is to find the most valid and efficient combinations of methods of measuring engagement with the intervention, both on the Internet and offline. Technology can provide detailed, unobtrusive assessment of behavior and its context, while complementary qualitative methods are crucial to fully understand and interpret user experiences. These qualitative approaches are central to participatory user-centered design, which is the key to developing and evaluating DBCIs in order to ensure that they are engaging and effective  [16, 17] .\n\nWith respect to theory, DBCIs provide an unprecedented opportunity to test and advance our understanding of how behavior changes. However, this requires the application of more \"agile\" science  [42] . This includes designing DBCIs on a modular basis with a clear understanding of which behavior change techniques  [43]  constitute that module and how they link to the theoretically postulated mechanisms of action.\n\nCollaborations between behavioral scientists and computer scientists are enabling theories of change to be specified in precise detail as sets of constructs and specified relationships between them. Computational models can define and test not just interactions between modules, mechanisms of action, and behaviors, but also how these vary across individuals and populations, settings, and time. This is spawning a fruitful area of \"ontology\" development, ontologies being well specified structures for organizing knowledge  [22] . By combining this with computational algorithms and machine learning, the promise is that we can advance theoretical understanding of behavior change so that we can answer with confidence the questions put by health practitioners and policy makers: \"What works, how well, for whom, in what settings, for what behaviors, and why?\"  [24] .\n\nWith respect to evaluation, one key effectiveness question for policy makers and practitioners is whether purchasing or commissioning a given intervention will improve outcomes for their population compared with current practice or another innovation that they may be considering. Another is whether digital interventions can reduce the cost of health care provision without a significant loss of effectiveness. Ideally, this would involve pragmatic randomized trials (individual or cluster) comparing the different forms of care. However, the analysis in this paper indicates that this is often impracticable. Moreover, there are so many unknowns in the development of these interventions that a much more iterative cycle of development and testing is needed before getting to the point of a pivotal evaluation. Even when an intervention has been found to be effective in a pivotal evaluation, there are no guarantees that it will continue to be effective in a rapidly changing context. This means that the evaluation strategy for DBCIs needs to be fully integrated into every phase of development and implementation and needs to take advantage of the wide range of methodologies that are available, both experimental and observational, while also taking into account the exposure as well as effect in those exposed. The evaluation needs to take advantage of statistical techniques, particularly Bayesian analyses that promote ongoing accumulation of evidence.\n\nWith respect to the economic evaluation, policy makers and service providers will be hungry for the potential to deliver interventions at scale with only small increases in marginal cost, often in comparison with face-to-face interventions. This creates a requirement for evaluators to adapt existing economic approaches and develop new ones to accurately capture cost across the full digital development cycle, measure the reach of the intervention, and consider the complexity of the intervention to allow meaningful comparison. In evaluating both effectiveness and cost effectiveness, policy makers and organizations that consider purchasing these services will need to compare them with conventional delivery models and evaluation approaches. Thus, developers and evaluators will need to ensure that they produce evidence that allows this comparison to be made.\n\nWith respect to ethical, regulatory, and policy issues, standards for DBCIs are still emerging, and people developing and testing them will have to pick a cautious path through rules not often designed with this new category of interventions in mind. They will need to ensure that new, agile approaches to testing DBCIs demonstrate that they meet the exacting expectations of the clinical and biomedical community. Possibilities to develop common standards for intra-operability between interventions, with electronic health records and health care delivery systems, and in common behavioral data repositories should be explored.\n\nThe advice provided here is specific to DBCIs, but it should also build on the good practice of reporting general mHealth interventions published elsewhere to ensure adequate description of the technical components of the intervention  [44, 45] ."
