  "title": "Systematic review and meta-analysis of text messaging interventions to support tobacco cessation",
  "abstract": "Objective To review randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating the effectiveness of text message-based interventions for smoking cessation, including the effects of dose (number of text messages) and concomitant use of behavioural or pharmacological interventions. Data sources We searched seven databases (PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science), Google Scholar and the reference lists of relevant publications for RCTs. Eligible studies included participants aged \u226515 years who smoked tobacco at enrolment. Study selection One reviewer screened titles and abstracts and two reviewers independently screened full texts of articles. Data extraction One of three reviewers independently extracted data on study and intervention characteristics and smoking abstinence rates using Qualtrics software. Data synthesis 30 of the 40 included studies reported higher rates of smoking cessation among those receiving text messaging interventions compared with comparators, but only 10 were statistically significant. A meta-analysis of seven RCTs found that participants receiving text messages were significantly more likely to quit smoking compared with participants in no/minimal intervention or 'usual care' conditions (risk ratio 1.87, 95% CI 1.52 to 2.29, p <0.001). Three trials found no benefit from a higher dose of text messages on smoking cessation. Two trials that tested the added benefit of text messaging to pharmacotherapy reported outcomes in favour of adding text messaging. Conclusions Findings suggest that text messagingbased interventions are effective at promoting smoking cessation. Further research is required to establish if any additional benefit is gained from an increased number of text messages or concurrent pharmacotherapy or behavioural counselling.",

      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "In recognition of the harmful effects of tobacco smoking,  [1] [2] [3]  a variety of pharmacological  4  and behavioural  5  interventions have been developed to support smoking cessation. The ubiquity of mobile phones globally, the common use and costeffectiveness of text messages, and the ability to provide tailored support at any time (eg, when experiencing stress or cravings) make text messagebased interventions a feasible, low-cost and potentially effective option for promoting smoking cessation.  [6] [7] 7] [8]  Globally, there were an estimated 8.48 billion mobile phones in use in 2021, equal to 107 phones per 100 people.  9 While mobile phone access is the greatest among high-income countries (124 subscriptions per 100 people), there is also increasingly good access among middle (110 per 100 people) and low-income countries (64 per 100 people).  9 Hence, mobile text messaging interventions could provide impactful and cost-effective smoking cessation support in both low-resource and high-resource settings.\n\nA 2019 Cochrane review of the effectiveness of text messaging and smartphone app-based interventions for smoking cessation found moderatecertainty evidence that automated text messaging interventions were more effective than minimal smoking cessation support (risk ratio (RR) 1.54, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.00; I 2 =71%; 13 studies, 14 133 participants).  6 The authors also found that the addition of text messages encouraging smoking abstinence to other smoking cessation interventions was more effective at promoting smoking cessation than the other smoking cessation interventions alone (RR 1.59, 95% CI 1.09 to 2.33; I 2 =0%, 4 studies, 997 participants).  6 With the literature searches for this Cochrane review conducted in 2018,  6  it is timely to conduct an updated review. As such, this systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigated the effectiveness of text messaging-based interventions for promoting tobacco smoking cessation. In particular, we examined the impacts of dose (ie, number of text messages) and concurrently delivered behavioural or pharmacological smoking cessation treatments on the effectiveness of text messaging interventions for increasing smoking cessation. This review was commissioned by the WHO to inform clinical guidelines for text messaging interventions for smoking cessation."

      "text": "In June 2019, authors CP, CLS and EET conducted a systematic review of studies investigating the effectiveness of text messaging-based interventions for promoting tobacco smoking cessation published since 1 January 2010, with no limits on study design. The methods and search results for the 2019 review are included in online supplemental material (including the PRISMA diagram as online supplemental figure  1 ). Twenty-one studies were included in the review; of these, 15 were RCTs, and these 15 studies were retained for inclusion in the current study.\n\nTo search for studies published since or missed in the 2019 review, the primary author (CP) searched seven databases (PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Scopus, EMBASE, Cochrane Library and Web of Science) on 14 February 2023 for articles published since June 2019 using search terms related to smoking cessation and text messaging (see online supplemental material for search terms). Next, to identify relevant articles not captured in database searches, author CP searched four trial registries (NIH Clinical Trials, Australian Clinical Trials, EU Clinical Trials Register and WHO International Clinical Trials Registry Platform), articles included in the 2019 Cochrane review on mobile phone text messaging and app-based interventions for smoking cessation, 6 reference lists of relevant reviews excluded during article screening and of included articles, and conducted targeted searches of Google Scholar. Inclusion/exclusion criteria We included RCTs that described use of automated text messages to increase tobacco smoking cessation (text only, automated or interactive texts, delivered via the phone's text messaging function or another similar app such as WhatsApp), either alone or in combination with pharmacological smoking cessation aids (eg, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT)) or other behavioural interventions (eg, counselling), among individuals (aged 15 years and over, based on the WHO's defined age cut-off for adults as used for the Global Adult Tobacco Surveys 11 ) who smoked tobacco on enrolment in the study, published in any language. We included studies that compared the text-messaging intervention with no intervention, a placebo, usual care or active treatments as comparators. Studies with active treatments as the comparators were only included if the comparators were behavioural interventions (eg, Quitline telephone counselling, individual or group counselling, printed materials), internet-based, artificial intelligence-based or smartphone-based interventions, or the following pharmacological interventions: NRT, bupropion or varenicline. We excluded studies where the text messaging interventions included pictures or videos sent via text, the only text message-based element of the study was text-based reminders about study participation, participant randomisation was by site or cluster (eg, by hospital) or where only outcomes less than 30 days from enrolment were reported."

Where multiple outcome measures were available, we prioritised reporting continuous abstinence (preferably of 6 months or more) over point prevalence abstinence, biochemically validated results over self-report and 6-month outcomes over other time points.

One study tested a high-frequency text contact (HFTC) intervention versus a low-frequency text contact (LFTC) comparison group among 8000 participants in China.  41 The HFTC group received up to an additional 91 texts over the 6 weeks (3 messages per day for weeks 1-2, 2 per day for weeks 3-5 and 1 per day for week 6) while the LFTC group received 1 text message each week, for a total of 6 texts. Participants in both conditions could elect to stop receiving text messages at any time. At 6 months, the 7-day point prevalence abstinence rate was identical between the two groups (27.7% intention-to-treat analysis), suggesting no benefit in the higher dose group. Furthermore, 42.9% of the HFTC group vs 15.4% of the LFTC group opted out of receiving further texts prior to the end of the 6-week intervention period (p<0.001).  41    49 49 reported no additional benefit on 6-month outcomes of high-frequency text messaging (6.5%, 44/674 abstinent) over low-frequency text messaging (6%, 12/284 abstinent). Squiers et al tested 8 weeks of messages (2 weeks prequit and 6 weeks postquit) to 2 weeks of preparatory prequit date text messages and a control arm with smoking assessment and quit date reminders sent prequit date only, finding no additional benefit of the postquit text messages for 7-day point prevalence abstinence at 32 weeks follow-up (28.2%) compared with prequit preparation messages only (31.8%) or the control condition (29.6%).  23 Abroms et al  40  reported outcomes at 3 months in favour of a text messaging intervention (SmokefreeMOM) that delivered 3-6 messages a day to pregnant people (14.5%, 8/55 abstinent) against a single text with the Quitline number and printed quit materials (9.1%, 4/44 abstinent).\n\nOne study compared a tailored and a non-tailored text messaging programme.  47 47 reported higher continuous abstinence outcome at 3 months in favour of text messages tailored to quitting stage with on demand text messages and additional resources and a discussion forum on a website (40%, 40/101 abstinent) compared with a similar text messaging programme that was not tailored to quit stage and did not have text on demand (30%, 19/63 abstinent), but the result was not statistically significant."

      "text": "While participants received some form of behavioural counselling in 12 of the included studies,  17 21 25 26 30-33 35 43 45 52  only 4 of these studies  24 31 32 51  provided the counselling to either the intervention or control group participants, thus allowing for an investigation of the impact of the counselling on smoking outcomes. Two of the four studies were three-arm RCTs, where intervention group participants received telephone-based behavioural counselling in addition to text messages encouraging smoking cessation and pharmacotherapy (either varenicline  24  or NRT  32  ), and the two comparison groups received either pharmacotherapy alone or pharmacotherapy plus text messages encouraging smoking cessation.  24 32 First, in a three-arm RCT,  24  participants received either (1) varenicline; (2) varenicline and text messages or (3) varenicline, text messages and seven sessions of phonedelivered adherence-focused motivational and behavioural therapy. At the 12-week follow-up, participants in the third group had the highest abstinence rates (15.7%) compared with those who received varenicline alone (5.7%,) or varenicline and text messages (3.7 %), suggesting that the behavioural counselling sessions improved cessation rates, but text messaging alone did not. The study's authors noted that the addition of the counselling was associated with significantly improved cessation rates even after controlling for varenicline adherence, suggesting that counselling may have increased motivation to quit and remain abstinent.  24 Second, in a similar three-arm RCT, participants received either (1) NRT; (2) NRT and text messages or (3) NRT, text messages and 11 sessions of proactive telephone counselling.  32 As with the previous study, the third arm had the highest rates of biochemically verified abstinence (25.5%) compared with abstinence rates of 12.0% for each of the other arms at 6 months follow-up. These findings further suggest that text messages alone do not improve cessation outcomes compared with pharmacotherapy alone, but the addition of behavioural counselling increases effectiveness. As neither trial included a medicine with counselling arm only, it is unknown if the text messages enhanced the counselling effect.\n\nIn a third study, control group participants received telephonebased behavioural counselling, while intervention group participants received text messages only.  51 Higher (but not significantly higher) abstinence rates were observed among participants receiving telephone counselling sessions than those who only received text messages encouraging cessation. However, the authors noted that the text messaging intervention was half as expensive as telephone counselling.  51 In the fourth study, control group participants received one standard care counselling session, while intervention group participants received one tailored session of CBT in addition to text messages.  31 There was no significant difference in quit rates between groups, but those who received CBT reported a significantly greater reduction in cigarettes per day.  31 These studies further suggest improved smoking cessation outcomes when adding behavioural counselling to text messaging interventions promoting smoking cessation."

      "title": "DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS",
      "text": "Forty studies were included in this systematic review investigating the effectiveness of text messaging interventions for promoting smoking cessation. Of these, 30 reported outcomes in favour of the text messaging intervention compared with the comparator condition,  17-29 32 33 36-40 42-47 49 50 53 54  with 10 of these reporting a statistically significant effect.  18 19 21 23-26 46 49 53 Our meta-analysis found that participants receiving text messages promoting smoking cessation were significantly more likely to achieve 6 months' continuous abstinence from smoking compared with participants in a control condition. There was high certainty evidence that participants who received text messaging interventions (compared with no or minimal intervention, placebo or 'usual care') were significantly more likely to achieve 6 months' sustained abstinence compared with participants in the control condition. With this review's findings supporting the effectiveness of text message-based interventions for smoking cessation, and considering the low cost of sending text messages  51  and the global ubiquity of mobile phones,  [6] [7] [8]  there is clear merit in promoting the use of text message-based interventions for individuals attempting to quit smoking.\n\nThese findings strengthen the conclusions of previous reviews reporting that text messaging-based interventions are effective for promoting smoking cessation.  6 57 58 A previous Cochrane review found only moderate-certainty evidence for text messaging interventions compared with minimal support and a pooled RR of 1.54 (95% CI 1.19 to 2.00) with a metaanalysis of 13 studies.  6 There were some differences in the studies we included compared with the 2019 Cochrane review. First, we only included RCTs that included participants who currently smoked at baseline (trials that included people who did not smoke tobacco or had recently quit were excluded), that randomised on the individual level (cluster trials were excluded), and investigated interventions that were simple textbased messaging interventions (interventions involving video or images were excluded). We also restricted the meta-analysis to those trials that reported at least 5 months' sustained abstinence at follow-up of 6 months or longer since baseline, and excluded trials with unclear duration of abstinence. We also identified two additional trials that met our criteria that were published since the Cochrane review was undertaken.  26 54 e did not find any relationship between the intervention dose (ie, number of texts received by participants) and smoking cessation outcomes. However, the number of texts sent to participants was not clearly specified in 12 (30%) of the 40 included studies, precluding a thorough investigation of the impact of varying the intervention dose. We recommend that future studies clearly provide this information, to ensure that the impact of intervention dose can be accurately measured through stratified analyses. To facilitate this, we recommend more widespread use of the template for intervention description and replication (TIDieR) checklist, an extension of the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) and Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials (SPIRIT) statements developed to improve the completeness of the reporting of interventions.  59 Furthermore, more studies designed specifically to examine the impact of text message 'dose' (frequency, duration and timing of text messages) would be valuable. It was also interesting that higher dose groups had a higher opt-out rate for the programme in one study,  41  demonstrating that there is potentially an optimal dose level that provides a trade-off between consumer retention and dose-dependent smoking cessation outcome.\n\nSPIRIT statements developed to improve the completeness of the reporting of interventions.  59 Furthermore, more studies designed specifically to examine the impact of text message 'dose' (frequency, duration and timing of text messages) would be valuable. It was also interesting that higher dose groups had a higher opt-out rate for the programme in one study,  41  demonstrating that there is potentially an optimal dose level that provides a trade-off between consumer retention and dosedependent smoking cessation outcome.\n\nWe were similarly limited in our ability to understand the impact of concurrent behavioural or pharmacological interventions. Only two studies  24 32  measured the impact of concomitant behavioural counselling and text messages compared with text messages alone, and either varenicline  24  or NRT.  32 Both found significantly higher rates of smoking abstinence among participants who received both text messages and behavioural counselling versus pharmacotherapy and text messages or pharmacotherapy alone,  24 32  however, neither included an arm with pharmacotherapy and behavioural counselling without text messages. Similarly, only one study measured the impact of receiving NRT in addition to text messages encouraging cessation; the authors found higher (but not significantly higher) rates of abstinence among intervention group participants (vs control group participants who only received a brochure on the health benefits of quitting smoking) at 3 months post-treatment.  36 urther trials are needed to establish the impact of text messaging interventions delivered in combination with behavioural and/or pharmacological smoking cessation interventions versus text messages alone or pharmacotherapy and behavioural counselling alone to provide clearer evidence to inform clinical practice. While the benefit of adding text messaging to pharmacotherapy or behavioural counselling is uncertain, it is unlikely to adversely impact cessation outcomes."

      "text": "Our findings are subject to some limitations. First, while our review benefited from a comprehensive literature search, it is possible that we missed relevant publications. We only included published findings and excluded those only reported in conference abstracts. Due to wide heterogeneity in study designs and comparators, only seven trials were included in our metaanalysis. Several of the studies were rated as high risk of bias using the ROB2 tool due to missing information, but not necessarily due to elements of the study design that increased risk of bias in the studies' findings. A leave-one-out sensitivity analysis indicated the findings were not sensitive to the inclusion of these studies."
