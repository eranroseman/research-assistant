  "title": "Effects of a Telephone-Delivered Multiple Health Behavior Change Intervention (CanChange) on Health and Behavioral Outcomes in Survivors of Colorectal Cancer: A Randomized Controlled Trial",
  "abstract": "Purpose Colorectal cancer survivors are at risk for poor health outcomes because of unhealthy lifestyles, but few studies have developed translatable health behavior change interventions. This study aimed to determine the effects of a telephone-delivered multiple health behavior change intervention (CanChange) on health and behavioral outcomes among colorectal cancer survivors. \n Methods In this two-group randomized controlled trial, 410 colorectal cancer survivors were randomly assigned to the health coaching intervention (11 theory-based telephone-delivered health coaching sessions delivered over 6 months focusing on physical activity, weight management, dietary habits, alcohol, and smoking) or usual care. Assessment of primary (ie, physical activity [Godin Leisure Time Index], health-related quality of life [HRQoL; Short Form-36], and cancer-related fatigue [Functional Assessment of Chronic Illness Therapy Fatigue Scale]) and secondary outcomes (ie, body mass index [kg/m 2 ], diet and alcohol intake [Food Frequency Questionnaire], and smoking) were conducted at baseline and 6 and 12 months. \n Results At 12 months, significant intervention effects were observed for moderate physical activity (28.5 minutes; P \u03ed .003), body mass index (\u03ea0.9 kg/m 2 ; P \u03ed .001), energy from total fat (\u03ea7.0%; P \u03ed .006), and energy from saturated fat (\u03ea2.8%; P \u03ed .016). A significant intervention effect was reported for vegetable intake (0.4 servings per day; P \u03ed .001) at 6 months. No significant group differences were found at 6 or 12 months for HRQoL, cancer-related fatigue, fruit, fiber, or alcohol intake, or smoking. \n Conclusion The CanChange intervention was effective for improving physical activity, dietary habits, and body mass index in colorectal cancer survivors. The intervention is translatable through existing telephone cancer support and information services in Australia and other countries.",

      "text": "Colorectal cancer (CRC) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in Australia and the Western world.  1, 2 Five-year survival has increased to 62%,  2  although CRC survivors still face many physical and psychosocial sequelae after diagnosis and treatment.  3 Health behaviors, such as physical activity (PA), can have significant effects on physical functioning, quality of life, and fatigue among cancer survivors.  4 However, despite the evidence, many CRC survivors do not meet current public health guidelines for health behaviors (eg, 60% are overweight, and 62% are insufficiently active).  5 spite the challenges after cancer diagnoses and treatments, survivors can be motivated to make behavioral improvements.  [6] [7] 7] [8]  There have been several trials of behavioral interventions that have improved health outcomes, although they have largely focused on PA in breast cancer survivors.  [9] [10] 0] [11] [12] [13] [14]  It is difficult to generalize results across cancer survivor groups because each cancer is unique in terms of natural history and pathology of disease, treatment protocols, disease and treatment adverse effects, and demographic, medical, and lifestyle characteristics of survivors.  15 here have been just three published randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of health behavior interventions specifically for CRC survivors. Two were limited by small sample sizes, methodologic weaknesses, and an exclusive focus on exercise.  15, 16 Moreover, Campbell et al  17  targeted only older CRC survivors and limited their assessment to fruit/vegetable intake and PA. These data are promising, although larger definitive trials are needed to determine the effects of improvements in PA and other health behaviors on a range of health outcomes in representative samples of CRC survivors.  14, 15 ealth behaviors are interrelated in terms of the psychological, social, and environmental factors that reinforce them, and multiple unhealthy behaviors often co-occur.  18 Previous investigators have shown that change in one health behavior may serve as a stimulus for change in other health behaviors.  19, 20 Nevertheless, there remain large gaps in knowledge about the efficacy of interventions to address multiple health behaviors,  21  and few cancer studies have evaluated interventions on multiple behaviors simultaneously.  22 ecause of the increasing number of cancer survivors, more research is needed testing the impact of health behavior change on health outcomes, especially research focusing on high-reach, sustainable interventions that recruit representative samples to help increase the generalizability of findings.  14 This report presents the results of an RCT to determine the effects of a telephone-delivered multiple health behavior change intervention for CRC survivors (CanChange) on health outcomes including PA, HRQoL, cancer-related fatigue, body mass index (BMI), dietary intake, and smoking."

Participants also received a quarterly study newsletter to enhance participant retention and were contacted for all follow-up assessments.\n\nHC. The intervention, described in detail elsewhere,  26  included: 11 telephone-delivered HC sessions over a 6-month period (biweekly for 5 months, followed by final telephone session 4 weeks later to promote selfmanagement techniques and maintenance of behavioral improvements), a participant handbook, regular motivational postcard prompts, a pedometer, and the quarterly study newsletter sent to UC participants. The intervention was based on Acceptance Commitment Therapy (ACT). 27-29 ACT interventions have been successfully used to enhance HRQoL and promote positive health behaviors for various health conditions including chronic pain,  30  diabetes,  31, 32  epilepsy,  33  smoking,  34  and obesity or weight management.  [35] [36] ] [37] [38]  However, this is the first trial to our knowledge of a multiple health behavior intervention for cancer survivors applying strategies drawn from the core components of ACT.\n\nTelephone sessions addressed: the cancer experience, CRC-related symptoms, specific ACT components in relation to lifestyle behaviors (ie, values, mindfulness, defusion, acceptance, and committed action),  27  and strategies to enhance improvement in health behaviors consistent with Australian recommendations and individual goals.  [23] [24] [25] 39, 40  Intervention strategies were consistent with the session content, including: ACT strategies, motivational interviewing, problem solving, action planning and goal setting, and reviewing and ongoing monitoring of health behaviors.\n\nHealth coaches had university degrees in nursing, psychology, or health promotion and at least 5 years of experience in the field. They also received 6 weeks of study-specific training. The intervention protocol was manualized, and all telephone sessions were audio taped, with a proportion reviewed to ensure adherence to the intervention protocol. Furthermore, coaches met weekly with study investigators for supervision of the intervention delivery.\n\nThe participant handbook included educational information on health behaviors, CRC,  41  the core components of ACT, and tracking and monitoring tables for health behavior change. Participants received motivational postcards between telephone sessions to promote behavior change and participant retention, and a Yamax SW700 Multifunction Digi-Walker (Yamasa, Tokyo, Japan) pedometer to promote PA. Participants were encouraged to achieve 10,000 steps per day as the recommended goal  23, 42  and to track and monitor their steps throughout the intervention."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "We observed a significant between-group difference of approximately 30 minutes of moderate PA at 12 months. Also, HC participants were more likely to be sufficiently active (16.4%) than UC participants (9.2%). In comparison, earlier behavior change studies have reported no intervention effect on PA,  15, 51, 52  or the group differences have been attenuated by 12 months.  16 We did not observe a significant intervention effect at 6 months, and our magnitude of change was slightly lower than those in some previous reports. Eakin et al  51  reported an 11% to 20% absolute increase in the proportion of participants meeting PA guidelines from baseline to 12 months, and Pinto et al  16  reported a between-group difference of 59 minutes at 12 months.\n\nCompared with previous study samples,  16, 51  our sample was older, and 24% were receiving adjuvant therapy at baseline and within 12 months of diagnosis, which may have affected their ability to be physically active. Finally, a focus on multiple health behaviors has the potential for decreased efficacy on any single behavior.  53 However, the complex and multifactorial process of carcinogenesis suggests that multiple health behavior changes may be needed to significantly reduce risk,  22  and growing evidence suggests the potential for multiplebehavior interventions to have a greater impact on public health than single-behavior interventions.  54 revious investigators have reported no intervention effect on HRQoL or cancer-related fatigue in CRC  15, 16  or other cancer survivors  55, 56  after participation in health behavior change trials. We found some suggestion of an intervention effect for physical HRQoL but no evidence of a between-group difference for mental HRQoL or cancerrelated fatigue. The reasons for the lack of intervention effect are unclear. First, participants in the current study were recruited within 12 months of diagnosis, and improvements in HRQoL along with reductions in fatigue may be expected during recovery from CRC treatment. Also, participants were relatively high functioning, and ceiling effects may have limited our ability to detect differences. Hence, future interventions targeting patient-reported outcomes may want to consider recruiting participants with poor HRQoL and higher cancerrelated fatigue, in addition to the health behavioral inclusion criteria in our study. Finally, the lack of intervention effect may be attributable to the modest improvement in PA, given there is a significant association between PA and HRQoL.  15 he intervention effect for a number of secondary outcomes was comparable with, or greater than, those reported in other intervention trials addressing behavior change in a range of patient populations.  51, 52, [57] [58] 8] [59] [60] [61]  Furthermore, for BMI and fat intake, the observed intervention effect immediately after intervention was maintained at 12 months. From baseline to 12 months, the HC group maintained BMI (0.1 to 0.4 kg/m 2 ), whereas the UC group experienced a significantly greater increase (0.7 to 1.3 kg/m 2 ). These findings are consistent with the intervention focus on weight maintenance and making PA and dietary improvements rather than weight loss per se. For total fat intake, previous investigators have reported intervention effects ranging from \u03ea1.2% to 5.5%, 51,58-61 compared with our significantly greater intervention effect of \u03ea7.0% at 12 months. For fiber intake, earlier studies have also reported no intervention effect ranging to improvements of up to 11.2 g.  [60] [61] [62]  A review of telephone-delivered health behavior interventions suggested that the average intervention effect for fruit and vegetable intake was 0.6 servings per day,  57  whereas a recent trial  51  reported an intervention effect of 0.28 and 0.21 at 4 months for fruit and vegetable intake, respectively. Our findings were similar at 6 months, with an intervention effect of 0.2 for fruit and 0.4 for vegetable servings per day. Although these improvements were modest, the health impact of increasing fruit and vegetable intake by \u03fd one serving per day is considered significant because each additional daily serving of fruit and vegetables has been linearly associated with reduced risk of chronic diseases such as cancer,  63  coronary heart disease,  64  and stroke.  64 However, the intervention effect was not maintained at 12 months, indicating that an extended intervention may be required to support participants in maintaining some dietary improvements.\n\nAs has been previously reported,  15, 51, 52  the UC group made improvements in some health outcomes, such as fruit and fiber intake, which may have contributed to the lack of intervention effect. The reasons for the UC improvements are unclear, although cancer survivors can be motivated for behavior change after their diagnosis,  6  and participants are likely to have joined a behavior change study because they wanted to make changes.\n\nStudy strengths were: recruitment of CRC survivors in need of health behavior change, validated and reliable outcome measures, a theory-based multiple behavior change intervention, a low-cost, highreach intervention, assessment of health behaviors at the completion of the intervention and after a period of no-intervention contact, and a high rate of intervention delivery. Importantly, mediated (non-faceto-face) intervention delivery can be cost effective and provide the repeated contacts necessary to promote behavior change.  65 Telephone delivery is an accessible mediated approach and has potential for adoption by health agencies that routinely operate telephone information and support centers.  65 he study was limited by use of self-report measures that can be subject to over-reporting (particularly PA) and under-reporting (particularly dietary fat intake and body weight).  51 However, all measures have been routinely used in population-based epidemiologic and intervention research,  66, 67  and our results are consistent with previous results. Data were collected by telephone interview, which limited our ability to collect objective biomedical data, although the relationship between lifestyle change and disease biomarkers has been well established.  51 Participants were not blinded to study condition, and finally, we made multiple comparisons for study outcomes at the level of \u2423 \u03ed 0.05, so it is possible that false positives occurred by chance.\n\nIn conclusion, telephone-delivered multiple health behavior change interventions, such as CanChange, are feasible and can improve some important health outcomes for CRC survivors compared with UC. Telephone delivery also allows for follow-up or booster sessions that may be necessary to sustain initial intervention effects. Importantly, telephonedeliveredinterventionsareconvenient,flexible,widereaching,andpotentially low cost. The CanChange intervention may also be immediately translatable into broad-reach telephone helplines, which are widely used for patients with cancer in Australia and other countries."
