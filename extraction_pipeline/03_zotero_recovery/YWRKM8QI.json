  "title": "Association between alcohol consumption and subclinical femoral atherosclerosis in smoking and non-smoking men: the AWHS study",
  "abstract": "Background and Aims Many addictive substances, such as tobacco and alcohol, influence atherosclerosis development. Whether or not tobacco's pro-atherosclerotic effect is influenced by alcohol consumption is unknown. We aimed to estimate the impact of alcohol intake on the presence of subclinical atherosclerosis in femoral arteries in smoking and non-smoking middle-aged men. Design, Setting and Participants Cross-sectional analysis of a subset of the Aragon Workers Health Study (AWHS), comprising 2099 men with mean age 50.9 years without previous cardiovascular disease. Measurements The presence of plaques in femoral arteries was assessed by high-resolution sonography. Self-reported alcohol consumption over the previous year was measured with a food frequency questionnaire. The sample was divided into four groups according to their daily grams of alcohol consumption \u2264 1 (abstainers), \u2265 2 to < 30, \u2265 30 to < 60 and \u2265 60 g/day. Participants were divided on ever-smoking (current and former) versus never-smoking strata in the main analysis. Findings We did not find a significant association between the different levels of alcohol intake and the likelihood of developing femoral artery atherosclerosis in never-smokers. Ever-smoking was positively associated with femoral atherosclerosis overall [odds ratio (OR) = 3.00; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 2.40, 3.74; P < 0.001] and within each level of alcohol consumption. Atherosclerosis was lower in ever-smokers who consumed 2 g/day or more but less than 30 g/day with respect to those ever-smokers who were abstainers (OR = 0.70; 95% CI = 0.49, 0.99; P < 0.05). However, among these ever-smokers, atherosclerosis prevalence was still higher than among never-smokers who consumed alcohol in the same amount (2 g/day or more but less than 30 g/day) (OR = 2.73; 95% CI = 2.07, 3.61; P < 0.001). Conclusions Among middle-aged men, moderate alcohol consumption appears to be associated with lower prevalence of femoral artery subclinical atherosclerosis compared with alcohol abstinence only in ever-smokers.",

      "text": "Atherosclerosis is the pathological process that causes most cardiovascular disease (CVD). Consumption of some addictive substances, such as smoking tobacco and drinking beverages with alcohol, influences its development, even below addiction thresholds.\n\nAmong CVD risk factors, smoking increases atherosclerosis progression and the risk of atherosclerosis-related events by inducing oxidative stress, endothelial dysfunction, vascular inflammation, platelet aggregation and worsening of serum lipid profile  [1, 2] . Smoking more strongly affects lower limb arteries and it is the most important cause of peripheral artery disease  [3] . Smoking cessation slowly decreases the acquired risk for CVD but the risk does not decrease close to that of never-smokers until 10 years' cessation  [4] .\n\nAlcoholic beverages consumption also influences cardiovascular health, but the mechanisms, magnitude and dose-dependency of the effects are still controversial  [5, 6] . The Global Burden of Disease study concluded that the level of alcohol consumption that minimizes health impact is zero  [7] . However, the CALIBER (ClinicAl disease research using LInked Bespoke studies and Electronic health Records) study showed that moderate alcohol intake was associated with a lower incidence of cardiovascular events  [8]  . A recent review published by Wood et al.  [9]  concluded that the upper threshold of alcohol consumption for a lower risk of CVD, defined as an aggregate of myocardial infarction, other coronary heart disease and stroke, was 100 g/week. This potential atherosclerosis protection from alcoholic beverages consumption is attributed to anti-oxidant effects which may be due, at least in part, to their actual alcohol content but also to non-alcoholic compounds, mainly polyphenols  [10, 11] . Thus, the protective effect of alcoholic beverages, if present, would be greater in tobacco users, who suffer from increased oxidative stress.\n\nSubclinical atherosclerosis can be measured in several body locations, including carotid, femoral and coronary arteries. This allows evidence of vascular disease to be found much earlier than when symptoms appear. Several studies have recently demonstrated that the presence of femoral plaques is a strong marker of coronary lesions  [12] . The Aragon Workers' Health Study (AWHS)  [12]  and the Progression of Early Subclinical Atherosclerosis (PESA)  [13]  study have shown that atherosclerotic femoral plaques are the most prevalent subclinical atherosclerotic alteration available non-invasively in the middle-aged population, and they are the atherosclerotic subclinical alteration with the strongest association with traditional CVD risk factors, especially with tobacco consumption  [12] , higher than carotid plaques. Alcohol consumption has been studied as a protective factor for subclinical atherosclerosis, mainly in cerebral and coronary territories  [8] , but it has not yet been studied in subclinical femoral atherosclerosis. Thus, data about the effects of alcohol on early atherosclerosis are scarce.\n\nGiven the controversial results that were previously published, we aim for two things: first, to address early associations, which can support the causal nature of the influence of the exposures; and second, to assess the possibility that alcohol partially counteracts strong pro-oxidant pro-atherosclerotic exposures such as tobacco.\n\nTo that end we selected the femoral arteries as the territory most heavily affected by smoking. Thus, we aim to describe, for the first time to our knowledge, the possible influence of alcohol-and its dose-on subclinical atherosclerosis in femoral arteries among ever-smoking and never-smoking individuals. We studied this association on a sample of male workers from a factory in Spain. To broaden and contrast our results, we also analyzed these associations in carotid arteries."

      "text": "This cross-sectional study is based on AWHS, which is a prospective cohort, aimed to investigate the determinants of the development and progression of subclinical atherosclerosis. Although the association of dietary factors, including alcohol, and smoking with atherosclerosis has been considered as an aim of AWHS in the protocol since the beginning, the details of the particular analysis presented in this report were not publicly pre-registered and consequently the results may be regarded as exploratory. Healthy middle-aged workers of the Opel Spain automobile assembly factory  [14] , attending their annual health examination between February 2009 and December 2012, were invited to participate in the study. From 2011 to 2014 participants aged between 39 and 59 years were additionally invited to undergo subclinical atherosclerosis measurements and to complete diet, behaviour and life-style questionnaires. Of the 2617 participants who attended these extended examinations, we excluded women due to the small number (n = 132) and those with missing data on subclinical atherosclerosis imaging examinations (n = 317), with missing data on CVD risk factors or relevant variables [body mass index (BMI), blood pressure] (n = 69). The final sample comprised 2099 men. All participants gave their written informed consent. The study was approved by the Clinical Research Ethics Committee of Aragon (CEICA)."

      "text": "Usual diet over the preceding year was assessed using a 136-item semiquantitative food frequency questionnaire (FFQ). This was previously validated in Spain  [15] , and included a validated alcohol consumption assessment. In this questionnaire, each participant provided information on the foods consumed during the year prior to the day of the interview. The variable 'daily grams of alcohol' was calculated from the sum of the intake of red, ros\u00e9 and white wine, beer and distillates. As this is an FFQ-derived variable, it is unevenly distributed. Also, the frequency of values 0 and 1 was high enough to compromise analysis of this variable as continuous. Thus, the sample was divided into four groups according to their consumption in: \u2264 1 (abstainers), \u2265 2 to < 30, \u2265 30 to < 60 and \u2265 60 g/day. In Spain, \u2265 30 g/day corresponds to three or more glasses of wine (100 ml), more than three beers (250 ml) or two spirit shots (50 ml) per day, and it was preferentially used here as a threshold versus 40 g/day [World Health Organization (WHO) risk of acute drinking problems classification]  [16]  because the number of participants above 40 g/day was scarce in our sample."

The physical examination included height, weight and waist circumference and blood pressure. Total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-c), triglycerides and fasting serum glucose concentrations were determined by enzyme analysis using the ILAB 650 analyzer from Instrumentation Laboratory (Bedford, MA, USA). Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) was calculated using the Friedewald formula  [20]  when the triglyceride levels were < 400 mg/dl. In all participants, non-HDL-c was calculated by subtracting the HDL-c value from total cholesterol. We defined arterial hypertension as having systolic blood pressure \u2265 140 mmHg, diastolic blood pressure \u2265 90 mmHg or self-reported use of anti-hypertensive medication  [21] . Dyslipidaemia was defined as having total cholesterol \u2265 240 mg/dl, LDL-c \u2265 160 mg/dl, HDLc < 40 mg/dl or self-reported use of lipid-lowering drugs  [22] . Diabetes was defined as fasting plasma \u2265 126 mg/dl or self-reported treatment with hypoglycaemic medication  [21] . Smoking habits were categorized as current smoking if the participant reported having smoked in the last year, former smoking if the participant had smoked at least 50 cigarettes in his life-time, but not in the last year, and never smoking. Ever smoking (current and former) versus never smoking was studied in the main analysis. Smoking was quantified with self-reported number of cigarettes per day."

Presence of atherosclerotic plaques in femoral and carotid arteries was fitted separately with logistic regression models, which included all groups of variables combining alcohol and smoking exposures (created through terms for category interactions between both variables) and adjusted for age, hypertension, dyslipidaemia and diabetes. Linear combinations of coefficients were used to calculate odds ratios (OR) for plaque presence of each exposure with respect to the neversmoker/alcohol abstainer group and to test for relevant differences. In particular, ORs for the presence of plaque for each group of alcohol consumption with respect to the abstainers group were tested within each smoking stratum, and ORs for the presence of plaque for being ever-smoker with respect to never-smokers were tested within each alcohol consumption stratum. An overall interaction between both variables was also tested with the linear combination of all interaction terms in the regression. P-values below 0.05 were considered statistically significant. To provide a detailed description of the influence of both variables on subclinical atherosclerosis, an analysis with smoking dose categories was performed. R statistical software (version 3.4.4) was used for the analysis."

      "text": "The sample included 2099 men with a mean age of 50.9 (SD = 3.9) years. The number of participants reporting alcohol intake \u2264 1 (abstainers), \u2265 2 to < 30, \u2265 30 to < 60 and \u2265 60 g/day were 246 (11.7%), 1239 (59.0%), 501 (23.9%) and 113 (5.4%), respectively. Higher alcohol consumers were older. Systolic and diastolic blood pressure, total cholesterol, non-HDL-c, triglycerides and HDL-c rose with higher alcohol consumption. Also, higher alcohol consumption was associated with belonging to the ever-smoking category (see Table  1 ), with unadjusted OR for each increasing category 1.38 (95% CI = 1.19, 1.60; P for trend < 0.001).\n\nAt least one femoral plaque was present in 166 of the 474 never-smokers (35.0%) and in 1024 of the 1625 ever-smokers (63.0%) (fully adjusted OR = 3.00; 95% CI = 2.40, 3.74; P < 0.001). We found no association between different levels of alcohol intake and the likelihood of developing subclinical atherosclerosis in femoral arteries in never-smoking participants (see Table  2  and Fig.  1 ). The odds for having a femoral plaque was 3.70 (95% CI = 2.00, 6.98) times higher among the ever-smoker/alcohol abstainer group than among the never-smoker/alcohol abstainer group. The OR was 2.59 (95% CI = 1.49, 4.48) in those ever-smokers who consumed 2 g of alcohol/day or more but fewer than 30 g/day compared to the never-smoker/alcohol abstainer group. Testing the difference between these ever-smokers groups, the group of eversmokers who consumed 2 g/day or more but fewer than 30 g/day presented a significantly lower atherosclerosis prevalence (fully adjusted OR = 0.70; 95% CI = 0.49, 0.99; P = 0.044) than the ever-smoker/alcohol abstainer group, although still higher than never-smokers who consumed alcohol in the same amount (fully adjusted OR = 2.73; 95% CI = 2.07, 3.61; P < 0.001). At any alcohol consumption level, odds for femoral plaques were always higher among ever-smokers than among never-smokers (fully adjusted ORs ranging between 2.73 and 6.32; P \u2264 0.001) (see Table  2  and Fig.  1 ). Although this study was not sized to provide adequate statistical power for it, a test for an overall interaction term between all drinking and smoking categories was performed and significance was not reached (P = 0.165).\n\nA detailed observation of the combined influence of alcohol and tobacco on femoral atherosclerosis considering smoking dose suggests that the U-shaped association tends to appear at higher smoking consumption levels (see Fig.  2  and Supporting information, Table  S1 ).\n\nAt least one carotid plaque was present in 123 of the 474 never-smokers (25.9%) and in 647 of the 1625 ever-smokers (39.8%) (OR = 1.89). We found no association between different levels of alcohol intake and the likelihood of developing subclinical atherosclerosis in carotid arteries in any of the two groups (see Supporting information, Table  S2 ). We did not seek a detailed smoking dose analysis, given the weaker association of carotid  atherosclerosis with smoking and the absence of association with alcohol."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "In this study we could not demonstrate a protective influence of alcohol on femoral subclinical atherosclerosis among never-smokers. However, among ever-smokers, who are participants with an increased prevalence of femoral subclinical atherosclerosis, it appears that a pattern of moderate alcohol consumption of between 2 and 30 g/day is associated with a lower prevalence of subclinical atherosclerosis in femoral arteries, independently of other risk factors. The prevalence was still greater than that of never-smokers with the same level of alcohol consumption.\n\nNo previous studies have analyzed this association on early atherosclerosis that can explain, at least in part, the overall beneficial effect on latter CVD observed in some observational studies.\n\nInformation on the association of alcohol consumption and femoral atherosclerosis is scarce. Most studies analyzing the role of alcohol consumption have mainly focused on the presence of atherosclerosis in coronary and cerebral territories or on coronary and cerebrovascular clinical outcomes, and very few have focused on carotid territory  [23, 24] . However, in the CALIBER study  [8] , among 1.93 million adults, alcohol consumption of 140 g/week was associated with a lower risk of myocardial infarction, Figure  2  Odds ratio for the presence of femoral plaque according to levels of alcohol intake and smoking exposures Figure  1  Odds ratio (95% confidence interval) for the presence of femoral plaque according to levels of alcohol intake and smoking habit ischaemic stroke and peripheral arterial disease. The ARIC study found a protective effect of alcohol on incident peripheral arterial and coronary heart disease  [25, 26] , but none on brain disease  [27] . Research of an alcohol effect on subclinical femoral atherosclerosis was lacking. With respect to dose-effects, a recent analysis  [9]  of 599 912 current drinkers with an average age of 57 years belonging to 83 prospective studies determined a positive and progressively increasing association with alcohol consumption for all-cause mortality, with the lowest risk for those consuming below 100 g/week. However, for the aggregate of CVD outcomes (myocardial infarction, other coronary heart disease and stroke) there was a J-shaped association. In another systematic review and meta-analysis of longitudinal cohort studies, comparing non-drinkers with alcohol drinkers, light to moderate alcohol consumption was associated with a reduced risk of coronary heart disease  [28] . These studies paid very limited attention to exposure to smoking (CALIBER analyses were simply adjusted for smoking), and none considered the proportion of exposure to it nor to the possibility of an effect restricted to smokers. This is especially important because alcohol consumption is frequently coincident with the use of tobacco  [29, 30] , and if the effect occurs only among smokers, observing the overall effect could depend on tobacco being consumed by a large proportion of the studied population.\n\nCurrent smoking and cumulative exposure are significant risk factors for CVD  [2]  and, in particular, very strong factors for peripheral arterial disease  [31] . We have found a protective role of moderate alcohol intake in the femoral territory, which is the one most affected by smoking, and interestingly, it was only observable in current or former smokers. Smoking is an important modifiable risk factor, and it is addressed as a primary intervention aim in most guides  [32, 33] . Probably, the potential benefits of moderate alcohol consumption may only be apparent among groups with a substantial smoking exposure. Eradicating tobacco use is a long-term goal of public health strategies. Thus, in future societies in which this achievement has been attained, the benefits of moderate drinking may fade off as the population becomes mainly non-smoker.\n\nThere are several possible explanations for our findings. It is possible that moderate alcohol consumption specifically counteracts the harmful effects of tobacco. Tobacco contains many oxidative substances  [34]  and there are many basic science studies that support the anti-oxidant properties of alcoholic beverages  [35] . There has been limited success in isolating a single anti-oxidant component  [36, 37] , as both alcohol  [38]  and other compounds  [10, 11]  seem to be responsible for those properties. That the association is observed only in smokers and only in femoral arteries, which are affected much more than carotid ones by tobacco, suggests that this could be one of the main mechanisms that explain our results. Furthermore, moderate alcohol consumption was associated with a lower risk of incident peripheral arterial disease in the CALIBER  [8]  and the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) studies  [25] , in contrast with a null effect in cerebral vascular disease in the latter  [27] . Similar results have been replicated in other populations  [39, 40] , demonstrating protective effects in peripheral territories. It is also possible that moderate alcohol consumption reflects a healthier life-style, such as a Mediterranean diet, even in the presence of smoking, and that it is an epiphenomenon without causal relationship with atherosclerosis. This seems unlikely, because the beneficial influence of moderate alcohol consumption does not appear in neversmokers, and appears not only in moderate smokers but also in heavy smokers. It is also possible that moderate alcohol consumption acts in the prevention of all types of atherosclerosis if there is considerable risk, regardless of the causal risk factors. It is well known that alcohol consumption is associated with an increase in HDL-c which, in turn, is a protective factor for CVD. However, in our study the observed benefit is independent of the presence of dyslipidaemia, and it is not observed in carotid territory, which does not support a general anti-atherosclerotic influence.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to evaluate the impact of moderate alcohol consumption on subclinical femoral atherosclerosis, and to take smoking influence into consideration. Furthermore, it has the strength of having been carried out with standardized protocols and using high-quality data collection methods to obtain information on subclinical atherosclerosis in both carotid and femoral territories. However, it has also several limitations. First, the cross-sectional design does not allow us to assume causality and temporality of the associations found. Second, we only included men, so our result cannot be translated to women. Third, although alcohol intake assessment includes personal interviews by trained interviewers, we have to assume that the use of FFQ can lead to some misclassification  [41]  and is less precise than other tools, even though scientific literature supports that this questionnaire classifies usual intakes correctly. Unfortunately, we have not been able to break down the current group of abstainers into life-long non-drinkers and exdrinkers, so the combination of these groups can lead to an overestimation of the protective influence of moderate alcohol consumption. Also, the never-smokers group size was smaller than the ever-smokers group size, which means that finding associations among those participants suffers from smaller statistical power. Nonetheless, the dose-response for alcohol association with atherosclerosis was nearly flat, and there were no visible trends where non-significance could be attributed to lack of power. As an example, assuming that in the never-smoker stratum 'abstainers' and '\u2265 2 to < 30 g/day' categories are of the same size as we have (63 and 316, respectively), and that the prevalence of femoral plaque among 'abstainers' is 0.35, this sample would have 80% power to detect a difference in plaque prevalence of approximately 0.15 less among the '\u2265 2 to < 30 g/day' category. Only a 0.03 difference was observed between these groups.\n\nAlcohol use has been ranked as the seventh leading risk factor for premature death and disability  [7] . The recommendation on alcohol consumption varies, and it is subject to continuous review. From the point of view of public health, the prevention of alcohol related problems, derived fundamentally from certain behaviours such as compulsive alcohol consumption, is a social policy issue, especially in teenagers and young adults. Our study suggests that it may have a neutral effect on atherosclerosis in future tobacco-free societies, making it easier to supply more straightforward recommendations for alcohol.\n\nFuture studies of alcohol potential protective effect should address its potential interaction with other risk factors in samples at high risk for atherosclerosis in which expected progression could be slowed down in any territory. Also, particular attention devoted to interaction with factors that impact oxidative stress will clarify whether or not the nature of the risk factor is relevant. In any case, public health implications that we have outlined above (potential protection fades away in tobacco-free societies) remain relevant, no matter the mechanistic explanation."
