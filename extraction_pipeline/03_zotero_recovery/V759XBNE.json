  "title": "Impact of Patient-General Practitioner Short-Messages-Based Interaction on the Control of Hypertension in a Follow-up Service for Low-to-Medium Risk Hypertensive Patients: A Randomized Controlled Trial",
  "abstract": "The evaluation in real-life settings of services for the follow-up and control of hypertensive patients is a complex intervention, which still needs analysis of the roles, tasks, and resources involved in the basic items: patient, healthcare professional, and the interaction between the two. To evaluate the impact of patient-general practitioner (GP) short-messages-based interaction, isolated from other items, on the degree of hypertension control in the follow-up of medium-to-low-risk patients in primary care, a randomized controlled trial has been performed: 38 GPs enrolled 285 hypertensive patients who recorded the results of self-blood-pressure (BP) monitoring, heart rate, and body weight, and completed an optional questionnaire in an identical manner over a six-month period. The telemedicine group (TmG) sent the data to a telemedicine-based system that enabled patient-GP interaction; the control group (CG) recorded the data on paper and could only deliver it to their GP personally in the routine visits. In the TmG, the results were better, but not significantly so, for: 1) degree of hypertension control, in terms of the percentage of uncontrolled hypertensives at the final visit (TmG versus CG: 31.7% versus 35.6%; p = 0.47); 2) reduction in hypertension during follow-up, comparing measurements (performed by a professional) at the initial and final visits of systolic BP (15.5 versus 11.9; p = 0.13) and diastolic BP (9.6 versus 4.4; p = 0.40); and 3) adherence to the protocol within compliance levels of interest in a real-life follow-up service: >50% (84.8% versus 73.3%) and >25% (92.4.8% versus 75.4%) (p = 0.053). Other factors such as average values of self-measured systolic BP, diastolic BP and heart rate, acceptability of the protocol, and median number of consultations and hospital admissions were similar in both groups. Outcomes show that, taken alone, the patient-GP",

      "text": "T HE OPTIMAL follow-up and control of the hypertensive patients is a complex intervention  [1] ,  [2]  that depends on multiple interrelated factors associated with both the patient and the healthcare professional, as well as the manner of providing care itself  [3] ,  [4] .\n\nAlthough the full design of a real-life follow-up and control service has to address many other aspects (technology involved, logistic support for service provision, interface for patient records, etc.) that are not considered here, the core design\n\nTABLE I SCENARIO ITEMS FOR FOLLOW-UP AND CONTROL SERVICES\n\nmust take into account at least two basic items: the method for recording the blood pressure (BP) and the interaction between the patient and the healthcare professional.\n\nWith respect to the recording method, home self-bloodpressure monitoring (SBPM) is the obvious choice for longterm follow-up. Many authors claim that SBPM is more effective than clinic BP measured by a professional (PBPM) in that it has a greater prognostic significance  [5] ,  [6] , correlates better with the target organ damage  [7] ,  [8] , is associated with greater adherence to treatment  [9] , helps to diagnose the whitecoat effect  [10] ,  [11] , and in some studies, has been reported to result in better BP control  [12] ,  [13] . Moreover, it is considered to be similar to or only slightly less reliable than 24-h ambulatory BP monitoring (ABPM) for the adjustment of antihypertensive treatment  [14] . However, negative aspects are present such as poor patient technique  [15] , possible errors in self-reporting in cases of uncontrolled BP  [16] -  [18] , doubts concerning the continuity of adherence over intervention periods of more than six months  [19]  or in primary care  [20] , and the fact that the decrease in BP attributed to more frequent changes in the type or dose of antihypertensive medications also occurs in patients in whom no changes in treatment have been made  [21] . From all these circumstances, it can be deduced that it should be considered as more of a complementary method than an alternative in the treatment of hypertension  [22] ,  [23] .\n\nWith respect to patient-healthcare professional interaction, the use of telecom-based systems also seems the obvious choice. The added value that they could provide in basic aspects of the follow-up and control of hypertension, as are adherence to medication  [24]  and improvement in patient-physician communication  [25] , was rapidly envisaged. There are many more recent examples of telemonitoring involving different networks for transmitting the information provided by the patient-wired  [21] ,  [23] ,  [26] , cellular  [27] ,  [28] , the Internet  [29] ; different methods for delivering the information sent by the patient to the healthcare professional-weekly reports on paper  [30] ,  [31] , e-mails  [28] ,  [32] , access to Web pages  [27] ,  [33] ; and different modes of providing the patient with feedback information (recommendations, changes in medication, alerts, etc.)-computer-controlled speech  [24] , voice telephone  [25] , reports on paper  [21] ,  [31] , e-mails  [32] , or short messages  [27] . Finally, other telecom-based systems have demonstrated the advantages of improving communication between the healthcare agents involved-general practitioners (GPs), hospital-based hypertension clinicians, and others  [34] -and have made it possible to carry out large telemonitoring studies like the hypertension objective treatment based on measurement by electrical devices of blood pressure (HOMED-BP) study  [35] .\n\nThe designer of a service for the follow-up of chronically ill patients needs to have an in-depth knowledge of the clinical, technical, and logistic basics of the scenario  [36] ,  [37] . To know clearly what each agent involved (patient, healthcare professional, telecom system) should do in the provision model is a fundamental goal  [38] . A slight modification in any of these roles could have a great impact on its clinical validity or economic cost, and of course, in its viability  [39] .\n\nDespite the extensive literature available, there are aspects related to SBPM and patient-healthcare professional interaction in the follow-up and control of hypertension that continue to have poorly defined profiles; in many cases, the interventions evaluated involved several overlapping items and the results produced have sometimes been of little value to the designer. Studies with protocols that contribute to define more clearly the roles and tasks that constitute the complex procedure carried out in a service for the follow-up of hypertensive patients are necessary. The items included in the context managed by our group are mapped in Table  I .\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, the influence of the interaction between patient and professional (specialist, GP, nurse, or team) on the degree of hypertension control during periods of telemonitoring has not been studied under conditions that separated it, to the greatest possible extent, from other factors. Table  II  references clinical and pilot trials that describe the interaction among patient, healthcare professional, and telecom-based systems, all of which refer to \"usual care\" in the control group. For this purpose, based on a previously reported technological platform  [27] , our group designed a procedure for a randomized clinical trial in which the patients in both groups follow exactly the same self-measurement protocol; however, the intervention\n\nTABLE II STUDIES DESCRIBING THE INTERACTION AMONG PATIENT, PROVIDER, AND TELECOM-BASED SYSTEM\n\ngroup sends the values obtained to a central station and those of the control group are recorded on paper. We present the results of a first study (provider: GP and nonspecial setting) in which the GPs accessed the information sent by their patients through the Internet and could, according to their criteria, choose whether or not to send short text messages (SMS) to the patient concerning any related issue (including treatment changes). The patients in the control group could only present their results to their GP in person, in visits scheduled according to the routine established prior to the study.\n\nThe main objective was to determine whether the patient-GP interaction based on the established protocol is, in itself, sufficient to improve the control of hypertension achieved in primary care and without the intervention of any specialized setting.\n\nThe secondary objectives were to evaluate the improvement in hypertension during follow-up, the impact on patient quality of life and anxiety, and certain economic aspects concerning the viability of the telemedicine system in this context."

      "text": "Conceptually, the platform is divided into five entities (see Fig.  1 ): central station (CS), patient, auxiliary center, healthcare professional, and coordination office. By means of services based on the cellular network [wireless application protocol (WAP) sessions, data transmission, short messages (SMS)] and the Internet (WWW), and by providing the users with commercially available equipment (mobile phones and handheld medical devices), this system enables patients to comply with specific self-management protocols and their healthcare professionals to perform tasks involving their follow-up and control.\n\nThe interrelationships between entities follow a client-server architecture in which the CS provides services to the rest of the entities. There is no other type of interaction between client entities. The interfaces from the client entities to the CS are WWW-based applications (http, https, WAP protocols) that are accessible via the Internet through fixed or mobile public data networks.\n\n1) Central Station: The CS functions autonomously, without human operators, providing a round-the-clock service and concentrates all the necessary information and communication systems.\n\nIt is connected to the Internet via a 2 Mb/s circuit. The privacy of the communications is ensured by means of Internet Protocol Security (IPSec) tunneling [extrasensory perception (ESP) mode] in the case of general packet radio service (GPRS) access and secure sockets layer (SSL)v3 for the rest. It is equipped with a CISCO PIX515E firewall (firewall, routing, VPN server), which segments network into a demilitarized zone (DMZ) and a militarized zone (MZ). The front-end servers-WWW server (client applications), WAP gateway, and systems for remote biosignals (e.g., ECG, spirometry) reception-are located in the DMZ segment. The MZ segment concentrates platform-specific services: database, logs, public key infrastructure (PKI) support, the gateway for the incorporation of biosignals, and the gateway for SMS transmission and reception.\n\nWith the exception of the software employed for biosignals reception, which is always proprietary of the device manufacturer, the rest in the CS is software open-source, based on the LINUX operating system (SUSE): Apache (Web server), PHP (server-side scripting language), MySQL (relational database), OpenSSL (cryptographic libraries), Kannel (WAP server), SMSTools (SMS libraries), etc. There are also software modules or services developed for the platform, for example, all the interface applications to the rest of the entities of the platform and several services such as SMS service (controlling delivery reports and validity periods), biosignals gateways, etc.\n\nAccess to the CS is controlled by users' digital certificates (X.509v3) from a certification authority specifically developed for the platform.\n\n2) Patient: The patient equipment in this project consists of a cellular phone with WAP-GPRS capability (Nokia 3510i) and a sphygmomanometer (Omron M4-I). The WAP application consists of presenting the patient with a set of questions according to his/her self-management protocol.\n\n3) Healthcare Professional: The professional (GP in this project) is provided with a specific Web application (see Fig.  2 ) that manages the folders of his/her patients (admissions, discharges, follow-up, etc.), performs messaging tasks, taking notes of all types (changes in dosage, etc.), and processes the stored information (BP curves over time, etc.). The GPs access the CS from their offices via the corporative network of the \"Servicio Madrile\u00f1o de Salud.\"\n\n4) Coordination Office: It provides the organizational and logistical support  [40] . The tasks carried out are mainly related to the support of patients' training on self-management, several aspects of the care delivery model, and the methodological support of pilots and clinical trials. Tasks such as training patients in the use of the devices, control of the equipment, information systems, communications, manage the documentation related to trials, procedures for detailed data collection and analysis, etc., are assumed by this entity.\n\n5) Auxiliary Center: The auxiliary center entity (which does not exist in this project) acts as a point of concentration of costly resources or those seldom utilized in the protocol."

      "text": "A randomized clinical trial was carried out in which 285 patients were enrolled by 38 GPs from 21 health centers in four different health areas in Madrid, Spain, that spanned the entire socioeconomic spectrum.\n\n1) Study Subjects: Patients with hypertension, defined as a mean systolic BP (pSBP) \u2265140 mmHg or a mean diastolic BP (pDBP) \u2265 90 mmHg in six determinations taken by a professional during two separate visits, were included. Patients with a previous diagnosis of hypertension, receiving drug therapy, with pSBP \u2265 130 mmHg or pDBP \u2265 80 mmHg (mean of three determinations) were also included if they presented type 2 diabetes, were under 40 years of age, or presented a major cardiovascular risk factor, for example, ischaemic heart disease (angina, infarction, revascularization), stroke or transient ischaemic attack, or peripheral arterial disease.\n\nExcluded from the study were: 1) controlled hypertensive patients, that is, those with pSBP < 140 mmHg and pDBP < 90 mmHg; 2) pregnant women; 3) patients with a history of serious cardiovascular events; 4) severely hypertensive patients with multiorgan involvement and pDBP > 110 mmHg; and 5) patients with chronic renal failure defined as a creatinine level over 2.5 mg/dl. Patient enrollment commenced in October 2004 and continued until June 2006, and the study ended in January 2007.\n\n2) Procedure: After signing the informed consent form, each patient was randomly included by his or her GP, who was responsible for the follow-up of the patient during the study. The randomization list was created on the basis of stratification according to the center, with unequal block sizes. Patients who dropped out were not replaced. At enrollment, the GP introduced the demographic data for each patient into an electronic preadmission form.\n\nSubsequently, the coordination office set up appointments with the patients of both the TmG and the CG in their respective health centers, grouping them, whenever possible, for training in SBPM and the use of the digital sphygmomanometer (both groups) and the telephone (only TmG). After performing SBPM (both groups) and WAP sessions (only TmG) on the following days to complete their training, the patients requested an initial appointment with their GP, at which time they were enrolled in the project.\n\nDuring the initial visit, the following parameters were recorded: general information (yes/no answers concerning: current smoking status, microalbuminuria, left ventricular hypertrophy, diabetes, hypercholesterolaemia, family history, treatments prior to/following the initial visit, normal ECG, other health problems), specific data [pSBP, pDBP, heart rate (HR), body mass index] and routine laboratory tests (hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelet count, blood glucose, cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol, lowdensity lipoprotein cholesterol, creatinine, uric acid).\n\nDuring the six-month follow-up period, the TmG patients sent their mean self-measured SBP (sSBP) and DBP (sDBP), based on three measurements made at 3-min intervals under fasting conditions in the morning and at night, four times a week (Monday and Thursday, morning and night), and their pulse rate and weight once a week. During each WAP session, they had the option of responding to a simple questionnaire.\n\nAt some later moment, with no obligation imposed by the protocol in terms of frequency of access to the CS, the GPs accessed the data sent by their patients via the Web. According to his or her own criteria, the GP could send an SMS regarding any related issue to the patient's phone.\n\nThe CG patients followed the same SBPM protocol, with the exception that the results were recorded on paper in a data collection notebook; they sent no data to the CS, and thus, had no interaction with their GPs. They continued to make their scheduled visits to their GPs at their corresponding center, as they had prior to the study.\n\nAll the measurements made at the initial visit were repeated at the final visit.\n\nDuring the study, the GPs prescribed the medication they considered appropriate, with no limits imposed by the protocol.\n\n3) Study Variables: The main outcome measure, referred to by us as the degree of hypertension control, was the percentage of patients who were not optimally controlled at the time of the final visit. Optimal control was defined as a mean of three arterial pressure determinations carried out by a professional at the final visit, resulting in pSBP \u2264 140 mmHg and pDBP \u2264 90 mmHg.\n\nThe secondary outcome measures were: 1) the changes in pSBP and pDBP between the initial and final visits measured in the office of the GP; 2) the changes in the mean self-measured sSBP, sDBP, and HR throughout the intervention period; 3) the changes in the dimensions of the brief profiles of the SF-36 Health Survey physical component summary (PCS) and mental component summary (MCS) and in the state anxiety (SA) and trait anxiety (TA), according to the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI); and 4) the number of consultations and hospital admissions in the two groups.\n\n4) Statistical Study: After two years of recruitment, 285 patients were enrolled in the trial. Assuming that 60% of patients in the CG would have BP under 140/90 mmHg at the end of the study, this sample size would detect a proportion of control of at least 77% in the TmG, given an \u03b1-level of 0.05 and a power of 80%.\n\nThe analysis of the degree of hypertension control was carried out according to the assigned treatment, independent of the modality of control employed (intention to treat analysis). A secondary analysis was also performed according to the protocol. The results of the main outcome measure, both the incidence of optimal control by group and the odds ratio (OR), are reported with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs).\n\nA descriptive analysis of the initial values was carried out to establish the general characteristics of the two study popu-lations. The data are presented using measures of central tendency and dispersion: mean, median, standard deviation, and maximum and minimum values.\n\nThe Kolmogorov-Smirnov goodness-of-fit statistic with the Lilliefors correction was employed to test the normal distribution. The comparison between the two groups in terms of BP and quality of life and anxiety questionnaires was performed with Student's t-test for independent samples, and Student's ttest for paired samples was utilized to analyze the differences between the results at the beginning and the end of the study. The tables show the means and standard deviations of the initial values, and the mean of the differences between the results at the beginning and end with the 95% CI.\n\nSince, in general, the data relative to the durations and numbers of consultations and hospital admissions did not follow a normal distribution, the nonparametric Mann-Whitney U-test was employed.\n\nFor the comparison of percentages, Pearson's \u03c7 2 and \u03c7 2test with continuity correction were applied. Finally, analysis of covariance was performed to compare the means of the changes in BP in the two groups, eliminating the possible effect of the initial BPs (concomitant variables), which could influence the results.\n\nFor all the tests, a significance level (two-sided p-value) of less than 0.05 was accepted.\n\nThe analysis of the data was carried out using the statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) (v14.0) statistical software package."

      "text": "During the training phase, prior to the initial visit, there were 12 dropouts (TmG: n = 11; CG: n = 1). In the TmG, seven considered the procedure to be too complicated and two withdrew because the family support they had counted on when they signed the informed consent failed them, and the remaining two and the CG patient for reasons not related to the project. Since they had not even attended the initial visit, we have no data on these patients. Thus, the statistical analysis was based on the results in 273 patients (TmG: n = 131; CG: n = 142), except for the results for the optimal control variable, in which all 285 patients were included (intention to treat analysis).\n\nClinical and demographic data. Table  III  shows the distribution of the patients according to age range and group. In both groups, the mean age was 62 years (TmG: 62.1; CG: 62.8), and 60% of the participants were men (TmG: 60.3%; CG: 59.2%). The initial demographic and clinical characteristics were similar in the two groups.\n\nDegree of hypertension control. The main outcome measure, the number of patients exhibiting poor control at the final visit, appears in Table  IV . This was the case in 31.7% of the patients in the TmG and in 35.7% of those in the CG, (difference: 4.0%, 95% CI: -7.0% to 14.9%) there being no significant difference (p = 0.47).\n\nChange in hypertension during follow-up. In the comparison of the measurements carried out by the GPs at the initial and final visits (Table  V ), the TmG presented a decrease in pSBP\n\nTABLE III DEMOGRAPHIC AND CLINICAL DATA (INITIAL VISIT)\n\nof 15.5 mmHg and a decrease in pDBP of 9.6 mmHg, while in the CG, the pSBP decreased by 11.9 mmHg and the pDBP by 4.4 mmHg, decreases that did not differ significantly (pSBP: p = 0.13; pDBP: p = 0.40).\n\nThe mean values for self-measured sSBP, sDBP, and HR throughout the six-month period, calculated according to the area under the curve, can be seen in Table  VI . There were no significant differences between the two groups (sSBP: p = 0.52; sDBP: p = 0.50; and HR: p = 0.79).\n\nAcceptability of the follow-up service. The educational sessions carried out in the health centers (Table VI, top), with a mean of 1.7 patients in the TmG and 1.5 in the CG, had an average duration of 33.7 min in the TmG and 21.1 min in the CG, and a subsequent training phase of 3.6 days in the TmG and 1.0 in the CG. The existence of four levels of help in the home environment (never, first week, first 15 days, always) can also be viewed in Table VI (top); the percentage of patients requiring some type of help was higher in the TmG (27.3% versus 16.2%).\n\nThe degree of adherence to the protocol was rated according to five levels (Table VI, upper middle section); 100% adherence in the TmG meant having carried out all the WAP sessions, and in the CG, having filled out all the boxes provided in the data collection notebook. The two groups presented similar percent-ages in optimal adherence, or having complied with > 90% of the requirements (25.2% versus 26.1%), while the adherence was better, although not significantly so, in the TmG in the remaining three levels: > 75% (59.6% versus 53.6%), > 50% (84.8% versus 73.3%), and > 25% (92.4.8% versus 75.4%).\n\nThe analysis of the SF-36 questionnaire (Table  VI , lower middle section) revealed no differences between the initial values of the two groups. When the change between the results of the initial and final PCS were compared, a mean increase of 0.2 points (p = 0.65) was observed in the TmG and a mean decrease of 1.0 points (p = 0.23) in the CG; the opposite occurred in the MCS, with a mean decrease of 0.4 points (p = 0.69) in the TmG and a mean increase of 0.7 points (p = 0.51) in the CG, differences that in no case were significant. The between-group differences in terms of these two measures were not significant either (PCS: p = 0.25; MCS: p = 0.52).\n\nThe results of the initial STAI (Table  VI , bottom) showed no significant differences between the two groups. Over the course of the study, there was a mean decrease in SA of 1.1 points (p = 0.35) in the TmG and a mean increase of 0.9 points (p = 0.43) in the CG, differences that were not statistically significant. Mean decreases in TA of 0.9 points (p = 0.26) in the TmG and 1.1 points (p = 0.13) in the CG were recorded. The between-group differences were again not statistically significant (SA: p = 0.4; TA: p = 0.8).\n\nInteraction. Table  VII  shows the distribution of the messages. In all, 212 short messages were sent to 66 patients in the TmG by 30 of the 38 participating GPs, while 49.6% of the patients received no messages; the maximum number of messages received by a single patient was 11. Of the 212 messages, 123 (58% of all those transmitted) were sent by just eight GPs, whereas another eight GPs sent none whatsoever.\n\nTable  VIII  presents the degree of control of hypertension according to two different levels of interaction involving: 1) a group consisting of patients who had received either some message or none at all and 2) a group formed by those who had received three messages or less and those who had received more than three. In the first case, among the patients who had received no messages, 24.6% are not controlled, while this rate increases to 27.3% among those patients who received at least one message; in the second case, of the patients who received three messages or less, 27.0% are not controlled, whereas this incidence decreases to 20.0% among those who received more than three messages. The differences are not statistically significant in either case (p = 0.46 and p = 0.63, respectively).\n\nEconomic significance and miscellaneous data. Table IX presents the median of the number of consultations over the six months of intervention by the patients of both groups, which was higher in the CG, but not significantly so (p = 0.75). The difference in the number of hospital admissions, which was higher in the TmG, was not statistically significant either (p = 0.71). Table IX also shows a number of technical and/or economic parameters relative to the patients, the GPs, and the coordination office, which will help to estimate the resources necessary for a future extensive implantation of the follow-up and control service, but the latter are not discussed here.\n\nTABLE IV PERCENTAGE OF POORLY CONTROLLED PATIENTS (MAIN OUTCOME VARIABLE)\n\nTABLE V COURSE OF HYPERTENSION DURING FOLLOW-UP\n\nTABLE VI ACCEPTABILITY OF THE PROTOCOL Authorized licensed use limited to: The University of Iowa.

      "text": "We have proposed the evaluation of patient-GP SMS-based interaction (in a nonspecialized setting) with regard to hypertension control. For this purpose, a clinical trial in which the CG patients followed the same procedures as those of the TmG, except for said interaction, was carried out. An overall comparison of our results with those of other authors (Table  II ) is, of course, difficult since, in all those cases, the CG patients received the \"usual care,\" and thus, the context was different from that of the TmG not only with respect to patient-healthcare professional interaction, but in terms of other context items (e.g., regimen of BP measurements) as well. However, we comment on partial aspects of these works that could be comparable.\n\nInitiation. The initial demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients in the two groups were similar, thus guaranteeing the randomness of the sample.\n\nDegree of hypertension control. There are no significant differences between the two groups in terms of the degree of hypertension control, measured as the number of poorly controlled patients at the final visit (Table  IV ), given that the intention to treat analysis adds the dropouts prior to the initial visit (TmG: n = 11; CG: n = 1) and those occurring during follow-up (TmG: n = 4; CG: n = 10) to the number of poorly controlled patients who underwent follow-up (TmG: n = 30; CG: n = 40). SBPM introduces improvements in hypertension control, given that the percentage of controlled patients in the final visit is greater in both groups (TmG: 68.3% versus 31.7%; CG: 64.3% versus 35.7%), as has been reported by other authors  [24] ,  [30] ,  [34] .\n\nChanges in hypertension during follow-up. With respect to the course of hypertension during follow-up, the results obtained show that there are no significant differences between the two groups, either in the initial and final measurements of pSBP (TmG: 146.1 mmHg versus 130.6 mmHg; CG: 146.8 mmHg versus 134.9 mmHg) and pDBP (TmG: 88.8 mmHg versus 79.2 mmHg; CG: 87.5 mmHg versus 79.0 mmHg) performed by the GPs, or in the overall mean values for self-measured sSBP (TmG: 131.6 mmHg; CG: 132.4 mmHg), sDBP (TmG: 78.7 mmHg; CG: 78.0 mmHg) and HR (TmG: 70.1 bpm; CG: 69.7 bpm) throughout the six months of intervention.\n\nThe reduction obtained in pSBP and pDBP in the TmG are consistent with the values reported by other authors, independent of the intervention selected: controlled speech  [24] , data transmission and faxed printed report  [21] ,  [30] , patient data shared by providers  [34] , data transmission, and e-mail or SMS  [28] . The decreases in pSBP and pDBP in the CG, which were more marked among our patients, did exhibit differences with respect to other publications, no doubt owing to their performance of SBPM as well.\n\nIn our results, the equivalence of the average values for sSBP and sDBP in the two groups over the six-month period is a determinant factor, a circumstance that undoubtedly will have an impact on the design of a real-life follow-up service, with a \"tendency\" toward a decline in the frequency with which healthcare professionals access the data sent by the patients.\n\nAcceptability of the protocol. An overall evaluation of all the aspects studied (training, adherence to the protocol, quality of life, and anxiety questionnaires) enables us to affirm that the acceptability of the protocol was excellent in both groups.\n\nThe longer duration of the training phase in the TmG is due, both in the session held in the healthcare center and in the practice phase prior to the initial visit, to the instruction in the use of the cellular phone and the corresponding WAP session, which are not required in the CG. It is also responsible for the increase in the need for family support (Table VI, top), reducing the proportion of those who never needed help from 83.8% in the CG to 62.6% in the TmG, with more patients in the TmG group requiring help than those in the CG at all three levels: first week (9.2% versus 1.4%), first 15 days (12.2% versus 4.9%), and always (16.0% versus 9.9%).\n\nThe adherence to protocol exhibited by the patients of both groups, which was better in the TmG, although not significantly so, is noteworthy. Supposing that, in a \"real-life healthcare\" context, the healthcare professional needed to access 50% of the data resulting from this study (equivalent to twice a day, morning and night, once a week), the rate of adherence is considerably higher in the TmG, although the difference is not significant, given that the percentage of noncompliers is 15.3% versus 26.8%. If only 25% of the data were required (equivalent to once a day, in the morning, once a week, a highly plausible value for long-term monitoring  [3] ), adherence in the TmG would improve even more with respect to the CG, since the percentage of noncompliers would be 7.6% versus 24.6%). However, in this respect, the total duration of the study period is of utmost importance  [19] , and we must be prudent in the management of these results.\n\nThe analyses of the questionnaires show that, in every case, the initial levels in the two groups were very similar, meaning that the two samples were comparable.\n\n1) SF-36: The responses indicate practically identical effects on both the physical and the mental component in the patients of both groups. 2) STAI: Although none of the changes are significant, the TmG patients show a decrease in the level of anxiety in its two expressions, state and trait, at the end of the intervention period, indicating that self-measurement and transmission of the data in WAP sessions does not provoke a higher degree of anxiety in these patients. Interaction. The distribution of the messages shows that only 2 GPs of the 38 involved considered it to be of interest to send more than six messages (one a month) for proper patient control during the follow-up period.\n\nThe number of messages sent (a mean of 1.6 per patient over six months) is extremely small when compared with the expectations of the authors at the start of the project; however, the inclusion in this section of aspects related to the usability of the design and the accessibility of the application was ruled out since all the participating GPs had had more than acceptable computer support (electronic medical records, etc.) for some time; and the reason did not appear to be the lack of messaging skill on the part of the GPs or problems concerning accessibility of the service. However, it will be necessary to pay additional attention to this matter in future studies.\n\nThe analysis of the degree of control of hypertension among the patients in the TmG in terms of the number of messages each received clearly demonstrates that there is no relationship between them, although the small size of the sample must be taken into account.\n\nThe conclusions obtained from this study can be structured according to several aspects.\n\n1) The analysis of the requirements: In our regional public health service, the established opinion is that the followup and control of patients at low and medium risk should be carried out by primary care GPs and nurses, without recurring to specialized units. The viability of a follow-up service in this scenario is directly related to its \"lightness\"; it will only be successful if it demands little time on the part of the professional, but its added value from the clinical point of view must also be demonstrated.\n\nThe seeming simplicity of the proposed protocol is deceptive. It is one piece of a larger puzzle (follow-up and control service) that requires a clearer definition of roles, tasks, and resources for the purpose of designing a followup service that is \"light,\" or unencumbered, for both patient and healthcare professional.\n\n2) The performance of the trial: From the results obtained, it can be deduced that the influence of the interaction between patient and GP, in a nonspecialized setting, over a six-month period and in the type of hypertensive patient selected, does not significantly improve either the degree of hypertension control, the course of hypertension during follow-up, adherence to the protocol, the results of quality of life and anxiety questionnaires, or economic aspects such as the number of consultations and/or hospital admissions. Modifications in the \"usual care\" of the CG as simple as that applied in our study (SBPM recorded on paper) produce very similar clinical results. However, a number of important points should be clarified.\n\n1) The BP measurements performed by a professional at the final visit exhibit better results in the TmG, a fact that would appear to indicate that these patients tend to be less vulnerable to the white-coat effect (evident in the results presented), perhaps because of the feeling of proximity and virtual presence of the GP produced by the procedure in the TmG. This aspect should be analyzed in greater depth.\n\n2) The improvement in adherence to the protocol in the TmG is nearly significant (p = 0.053), an aspect that is of great importance in the design of a real-life follow-up service.\n\nAlthough, given the similarity in the clinical results, the decision not to introduce a telemedicine-based service for the follow-up of patients of this type would appear to be justified, a more thorough assessment of this aspect may prove otherwise. This aspect is also analyzed in a recent own work  [41] .\n\n3) The evidence that following the protocol (i.e., the use of the cellular phone) does not modify quality of life or generate additional anxiety in the TmG opens a wide range of possibilities for improving the introduction of the data generated in the information system of a healthcare organization (see telematic services in Table  I ). This study was a first step toward the gathering of information on defining the roles, tasks, and resources involved in the designing of services for the follow-up and control of hypertensive patients on the basis of the type of patient, the provider, and patient-healthcare professional interaction. Together with another study that is presently underway (identical intervention, identical hypertensive patient profile, a GP+nurse team in a nonspecialized setting as provider, to compare adherence to the protocol and adherence to treatment), it will serve in the designing of a follow-up service for hypertensive patients with this profile, and in the future, will help in the configuration of the design of other follow-up and control services in which the parameter BP is included, the added value of which is obvious (e.g., secondary prevention of cardiovascular risk factors and others)."
