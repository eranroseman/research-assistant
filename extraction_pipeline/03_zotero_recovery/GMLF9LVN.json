  "title": "Management of Hypertension Using a Plant-Based Diet Among Farmers: Protocol for a Mixed Methods Study",
  "abstract": "Background: Farmers in Indonesia have a high risk for hypertension owing to their lifestyle and working environment. Diet management is a solution to reduce hypertension, and Indonesia has natural resources in the agricultural sector that could help manage hypertension. Optimizing vegetable and fruit intake in a plant-based diet (PBD) could help maintain blood pressure among farmers in Indonesia. Objective: This study aims to explore the health problem of hypertension and the characteristics of local food sources to formulate a PBD menu for treating hypertension, as well as assess the prevalence of hypertension, level of acceptability of a PBD, and associated sociodemographic factors. Further, we want to examine the effectiveness of a community-based nursing program for managing hypertension using a PBD. \n Methods: We will use the exploratory sequential mixed methods approach. There will be a qualitative study (phase I) in 2022 and a quantitative study (phase II) in 2023. We will analyze data using a thematic framework in phase I. In phase II, the study will involve (1) questionnaire development and validation; (2) examination of the prevalence of hypertension, the level of acceptability of a PBD, and the associated factors; and (3) a randomized controlled trial. We will recruit farmers with hypertension who meet the study criteria. Moreover, in phase II, we will invite expert nurses and nutritionists to assess the face and content validity of the questionnaire. We will use multiple logistic regression models to estimate the associated sociodemographic factors and the level of acceptability of a PBD. Furthermore, a linear generalized estimating equation will be used to estimate the parameters of a generalized linear model with a possible unmeasured correlation between observations from different time points for systolic and diastolic blood pressure. \n Results: A model PBD for hypertension management is expected to be developed. In 2022, we will collect information on hypertension and the characteristics of local food sources for managing hypertension, and will formulate a PBD menu to treat hypertension among farmers. In 2023, we will develop a questionnaire to assess the acceptability of a PBD to manage hypertension among farmers, the prevalence of hypertension, and the sociodemographic factors associated with hypertension among farmers. We will implement a community-based nursing program for managing hypertension using a PBD among farmers. \n Conclusions: The PBD model will not be readily available for other agricultural areas since validation of local food variation is required to design the menu. We expect contributions from the local government to implement the intervention as one of the policies in the management of hypertension for farmers in the agricultural plantation areas of Jember. This program may also be implemented in other agricultural countries with similar problems, so that hypertension can be optimally treated among farmers.",

      "text": "Hypertension contributes to 12.8% of the total 7.5 million deaths worldwide  [1] . The prevalence of hypertension in Indonesia is 33.4%  [2] , while in East Java province, it is 20.43%  [3] . Farming communities have a high risk of health problems  [4] , including hypertension  [5] [6] [7] . Hypertension among farmers in Indonesia has reached 36.1%  [8] . Our previous study found that the incidence of hypertension among farmers in agricultural areas was 35.8%  [9] . This shows the magnitude of the problem of hypertension among farmers, and there is a need for the management of care using an agricultural health nursing (agronursing) approach to realize the health status of farmers.\n\nAgronursing can facilitate occupational health and safety among farmers  [9] . Farmers' health problems are generally caused by a lack of knowledge and skills in health management, which can lead to hypertension  [10] . Most farmers with hypertension have a low level of education, so skills in self-care management are lacking  [11] . Hypertension among farmers is also caused by an unhealthy lifestyle  [9]  and inadequate nutrition  [12] . High consumption of unhealthy foods among farmers, such as high-sodium foods  [6] , and low knowledge about diet  [13]  can increase the risk of hypertension in farmers. Therefore, dietary management with a plant-based diet (PBD) needs to be introduced, and the basic principles of hypertension nursing care for farmers need to be developed.\n\nNatural agricultural resources should be considered in the management of hypertension among farmers. The basic principles of hypertension care among farmers should be developed through optimizing the agricultural sector's potential by consuming a PBD that prioritizes vegetables and fruits  [14] . Therefore, it is necessary to formulate the basic concepts and principles of a PBD in nursing care management for farmers with hypertension based on the agronursing approach.\n\nThe agronursing approach to treat hypertension among farmers focuses on promotive and preventive measures to reduce the risk of disease occurrence or disease worsening from previous conditions  [15] . Moreover, it focuses on the health status of individuals in carrying out their work (in this case, farmers who work in fields) in order to improve overall health (physically, mentally, and socially)  [16] . The PBD concept is expected to be able to overcome the problem of hypertension among farmers in agricultural areas, which is synergistic with the culture and local wisdom of the agricultural population. Therefore, the objectives of this study are as follows:  (1)  to explore the health problem of hypertension among farmers and the characteristics of local food sources of vegetables and fruits that can be used in a PBD to manage hypertension;  (2)  to examine the prevalence of hypertension, the level of acceptability of a PBD, and the associated factors among farmers; and (3) to examine the effectiveness of a community-based nursing program for the management of hypertension using a PBD among farmers."

Then, we will formulate a PBD menu to treat hypertension among farmers.\n\nIn phase II, we will conduct a quantitative study. In this phase, the following 3 activities will be performed: (1) we will develop and validate a questionnaire as the assessment instrument; (2) we will examine the prevalence of hypertension, the level of acceptability of a PBD, and the associated sociodemographic factors among farmers; and (3) we will examine the effectiveness of a community-based nursing program for managing hypertension using a PBD among farmers.

      "text": "This study will recruit eligible participants selected from 3 public health centers (PHCs) in Jember, East Java Province of Indonesia. Jember, East Java Province is a province representing Indonesia's agricultural sector. It is known that Jember Regency is an agricultural area, and most of its people make a living as farmers or work in agriculture. The agricultural land in Jember Regency is very fertile. Therefore, most land in Jember Regency is used for agriculture and plantations. This is very suitable as the main livelihood of the people of Jember Regency is related to the agricultural sector.\n\nJember Regency is considered one of the rice barns of East Java Province, reflecting that the agricultural sector plays an important role (leading sector) in the economy of Jember Regency, and it can be said that Jember has an agrarian economic structure. Since Jember's economy is generally based on agriculture, the maintenance and management of natural resources are very important, and it is hoped that the economic development carried out is oriented toward environmentally sound development. Regarding cultivations, all areas except the city center have food crops; the slopes of Mount Argopuro have plantations of tea, coffee, cocoa, and rubber; the slopes of Mount Raung have plantations of coffee and tobacco; and central to southern areas have plantations of tobacco, sugarcane, and coconut. In Jember, 42.9% of the population has jobs in agriculture  [17] . Based on data  [18]  released by BPS Kabupaten Jember, the population of Jember Regency in 2020 was projected to reach 2,536,729 people, consisting of 1,264,968 male residents and 1,271,761 female residents, and the population density in Jember Regency in 2020 reached 770.26 people/km 2 ."

We will exclude older people who are not citizens of Indonesia and those who are unwilling to be interviewed or unable to communicate clearly due to language problems. To obtain more insights on the acceptability of a PBD, the family members of eligible farmers with hypertension will be included in the interview. The inclusion criteria are as follows: (1) employment as a farmer; (2) age 45-65 years; (3) presence of grade I/II hypertension according to the Eighth Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure (JNC VIII) criteria; and (4) presence of relatives who stay in the same house with their parents or take care of their parents by helping them with preparing food or assisting them in daily routines.

Further, in-depth interviews may be conducted with certain respondents who have attended the previous focus group interviews to gain more perspectives and clarify the focus groups' findings. Each focus group will consist of 4 to 6 participants. An earlier scoping review conducted by the same research team will help identify health problems related to hypertension among farmers. Then, we will explore the characteristics of local food sources to manage hypertension and formulate a PBD. The findings will provide additional information for developing the interview guides and questions (eg, \"Can you describe your health problem related to your hypertension?\" \"How would you control your blood pressure with a plant-based diet?\" \"What kinds and contents of local foods would you use for controlling hypertension?\" \"How would you formulate a plant-based diet menu to control hypertension?\" \"What do you expect from a plant-based diet?\" and \"Would you adopt a plant-based diet? If yes, why? If no, why not?\"). The preliminary semistructured interview guides, which contain open-ended questions and probes to explore the acceptability of a PBD, will be pilot tested.\n\nWe plan to interview the farmers and the family members of eligible farmers with hypertension. We will recruit 30 participants initially, but the final sample size for this qualitative study will be determined when data saturation is reached, for example, when additional data collection reveals no substantial new information. Each in-depth interview will take between 30 and 45 minutes, and the focus group interview will take around 45 to 60 minutes. Before the interviews, participants will provide their sociodemographic and related information, such as age, education, occupation, income, insurance, and health condition. Information about this research, including the hypertension problem and the characteristics of local foods used in a PBD, will be explained to all participants in Bahasa Indonesia before they are asked to provide informed consent. All interviews will be conducted in the Bahasa Indonesia language and will be audio recorded. Investigators will take down field notes, and transcripts will be translated line by line into English.

The emerging codes will be analyzed thematically according to the framework if they are coherent. The team members will repeatedly read each document and transcript to familiarize themselves with the whole data set and ensure the accuracy of the transcription reviews. Codes will be applied to raw data and then grouped into clusters to generate themes. Consensus on the codes and themes must be reached among at least three of the investigators (TS, HR, FK, IR, and RAY). The data will be compared in an ongoing manner to identify the true meaning of the data. Member checking and investigator reflexivity will be used to increase the credibility and reliability of the data. Data credibility will be enhanced through further analysis of interview and field notes, and views from the different categories of farmers having different sociodemographic backgrounds (eg, those with different grades of hypertension), as well as through triangulation involving multiple investigators. The content of the interviews will be shared with some participants, and their feedback on the findings will be sought for validation purposes (respondent validation). Investigators involved in the data analysis will collect and explain their biases or assumptions during data analysis and interpretation (reflexivity). Raw data, interpretations, and conclusions will be discussed with peers (peer debriefing). Confirmability will be enhanced by keeping an audit trail of the audio/video files, electronic documents, original field notes, and translations  [21] ."

Based on the scores of the items or the summed scores, expectations and acceptability can be categorized into the following 3 categories: affordable, accessible, and achievable. Categorization will be performed using a statistical formula. If the data are normally distributed, the grade level will be based on the mean value; otherwise, the median will be used (X < mean/median -1 SD; mean/median -1 SD < X < mean/median + 1 SD; mean/median + 1 SD < X).\n\nThe questionnaire will have the following 2 sections: (1) sociodemographic characteristics of hypertension and (2) acceptable PBD for controlling hypertension. The instructions and descriptions of the definition, concept, and criteria of a PBD will be provided at the beginning of the questionnaire. The Pender Health Promotion Model will guide the questionnaire's qualitative analysis and item design.

Feedback will be discussed by the expert committee, and it will determine the appropriateness and completeness of the questionnaire and ethical considerations in the process. The next analysis step is the COSMIN (consensus-based standards for the selection of health measurement instruments) checklist developed in an international Delphi study to estimate the quality of selected measurement instruments. It measures internal consistency, reliability, measurement error, content validity (as well as face validity), structural validity, hypothesis testing, cross-cultural validity (the 3 aspects of construct validity), criterion validity, and responsiveness. Based on the checklist, items will be sorted by experts in the group to establish face, content, and construct validity in activity 1. The duration to finish the questionnaire is estimated to be less than 30 minutes. Further validation of the questionnaire will be conducted in activity 2. Cronbach alpha will be applied to prove the internal consistency (0.70 or higher is considered as good) of the expectations and acceptability questionnaire. Exploratory factor analysis using principal component analysis will be performed to examine the structural validity of the expectations and acceptability questionnaire separately.\n\nIn addition, the Kaiser-Mayer-Olkin test of sampling adequacy, the Bartlett test of sphericity, and the scree plot will be used to check the unidimensionality of the expectations and acceptability questionnaire. The convergence criteria will be set at an eigenvalue above 1. Construct validity (hypothesis testing) will be tested when comparing the responses to the expectations or acceptability of 1 item (yes or no). We hypothesize that the highest tertile expectation will be associated with willingness measured by a repeat measurement value of at least 2.0. The highest tertile acceptability will be related to willingness measured by a repeat measurement value of at least 3.0. It is also hypothesized that expectations and acceptability will correlate at a coefficient of at least 0.4. One-month intrarater test-retest reliability will be assessed in a random sample of at least 50 older people throughout the data collection period in activity 2."

Numerical variables will be shown as means and standard deviations or medians and interquartile ranges, while categorical variables will be shown as absolute frequencies and percentages. We will use the chi-square test to examine the sociodemographic factors associated with farmers' different categories of acceptability. With the 95% CI, a P value of <.05 will be considered statistically significant.\n\nWe will use multiple logistic regression models to estimate the associated and independent factors from the sociodemographic factors and the level of acceptability of a PBD among farmers. In the case of a low event rate and low sample size for expectations and acceptability in the definite form, we may recode them into tertiles and use the lowest score category as the reference group. Alternatively, we may conduct multiple linear regression analyses with the 2 dependent variables as continuous variables. We will also include any independent factors with a P value <.20 from the univariable regression analysis in the multiple regression analysis. Multicollinearity between independent variables will be checked according to a tolerance value <0.4 (variance inflation factor \u22652.5).

A single-blind technique will be used so that participants will be unaware if they are in the control or intervention group."

Measurements of SBP and DBP (mmHg) will be categorized according to the JNC VIII criteria to determine hypertension for participants aged >18 years  [24] . The length of work per day, time of rest during working, and hours of sleep per day will be assessed among the farmers. These factors will be measured as they can influence blood pressure among farmers, according to a previous study  [2] . Manual blood pressure measurement is usually performed using a mercury device or a calibrated needle (aneroid). SBP and DBP are determined through auscultation by listening for the appearance and disappearance of Korotkoff sounds in the brachial artery. Blood pressure measurements will be taken after a 14-minute rest period, during which the researcher and the participant will have a conversation to reduce tension associated with the \"white coat\" effect. Measurements will be taken at the same time (ie, 8 AM before activities) with the same tool. Participants will be told not to wear clothes that are too thick. Blood pressure test results will be more accurate if the cuff is placed directly over the skin. Participants will be told to empty their bladder before measurement. For the measurement, participants will be told to sit with their arms on a table so that the elbows are in line with the heart, the back is well supported by the back of the chair, and the feet are on the floor."

As they will receive health education, they will be able to lead a healthy life in the agricultural environment, with occupational health and safety.\n\nIn both study groups, health education will be provided before the program, which will include information on how to manage a healthy lifestyle while working as farmers, including diet, exercise, rest, and sleep, and how to address blood pressure problems among farmers. Participants will receive this health education in a single session for 60 minutes at the first screening meeting. All participants will receive a manual book on a healthy lifestyle in an agricultural setting.\n\nThe blood pressure of participants in both study groups will be maintained. If the blood pressure increases to hypertension stage II or above, appropriate treatment will be provided by the medical doctor in the PHC and the participant will be excluded from the study. Data will be obtained at registration and at the pretest and posttest assessments. For blood pressure data, we will use rounded values, with values ending in 0-4 being rounded to \"0\" and values ending in 6-10 being rounded to \"10\" (eg, 120-124 mmHg will be rounded to 120 mmHg, 125 mmHg will be used directly, and 126-130 mmHg will be rounded to 130 mmHg)."

The research started in May 2022, and phase I of the study is scheduled to begin in May 2023, with a total research duration of 2 years. A model PBD for the management of hypertension is expected to be developed from using local food-related agronursing services. In 2022, we will collect data on hypertension and the characteristics of local food sources to manage hypertension, and formulate a PBD menu to treat hypertension among farmers. A thematic analysis of the qualitative data of farmers in the agricultural sector will be performed. In 2023, we will develop a questionnaire to assess the acceptability of a PBD to manage hypertension among farmers, the prevalence of hypertension, and the sociodemographic factors associated with hypertension among farmers. Furthermore, we will introduce a community-based nursing program for the management of hypertension using a PBD among farmers."

      "title": "Contributions of the Study",
      "text": "This paper describes a protocol for the management of hypertension using a PBD among farmers. We hypothesize that the formulation of the PBD concept can overcome the problem of hypertension among farmers in agricultural areas, which is synergistic with the culture and local wisdom of the agricultural population. The findings of this study may contribute to the development of a better solution for hypertension among farmers in Indonesia and may be relevant to a special group of readers interested in this research. It is believed that innovations of the intervention can be used and integrated to promote nursing care within the fields of health assessment, activities of daily living, and care management, which could improve the quality of life and quality of care for farmers in agricultural areas.\n\nThe concept of a PBD as a solution for hypertension is based on meeting the nutritional needs of plant-based proteins and minimizing intake from animal and processed sources  [24] . Maximized intake of nutrients in a PBD involves high intake of fiber, vegetable protein, vitamins, polyphenols, and unsaturated fatty acids, and low intake of sodium. Food processing in a PBD can be adapted to the culture and habits of the local community to facilitate the consumption process and maintain consistency in the implementation of the process. A PBD is expected to provide considerable benefits to overcome hypertension in farmers. Optimal nutrition and fiber in a PBD will provide strong protection for organ systems in the body and will help systems to work synergistically to reduce inflammation and oxidation in the body  [19] .\n\nA PBD model will provide farmers with an alternative solution that has independent, safe, and comfortable features for their needs. It could also be used to adapt and transform existing hypertension programs for farmers and their family members. With a better understanding of farmers' expectations and acceptability of a PBD model in public health, researchers, stakeholders, and policymakers may be able to effectively develop a complete model that incorporates appropriate technologies and integrates relevant medical services, and yet remains affordable to benefit the majority of farmers. This would facilitate the transformation of traditional hypertension interventions to smart and local interventions, which include necessary skill sets or required training for PHNs and other health care professionals to meet expectations.\n\nThe findings of this study will be presented at conferences and published in peer-reviewed journals. We will publish the results of this research in academic journals. We will also present this research at national and international conferences. The data from this study will be presented in a research report to the Ministry of Cultural Education, Research and Technology, and Higher Education on the BIMA system dashboard (BIMA -Kemdikbudristek) as restricted data. In addition, research data will be reported to the Institute for Research and Community Service, University of Jember (organizer in research activities). Furthermore, the research results of the first year and second year will be presented in a manuscript. The manuscript will be submitted to a reputable international journal in the areas of hypertension and NCD management.\n\nDisseminating our study findings will significantly contribute to the advancement of science and holistic nursing services for farmers with hypertension in the community."

      "title": "Limitations of the Study",
      "text": "This study will examine the effectiveness of a community-based nursing program for the management of hypertension using a PBD among farmers in Indonesia. However, this protocol may have some limitations. First, the program requires participant compliance for carrying out regular training to maintain blood pleasure, and some participants may drop out of this study for various reasons, such as noncompliance with the consumption of a PBD. Therefore, a dairy is required to continuously monitor the diet. Second, the measurement of blood pressure may be biased because of different enumerators and sphygmomanometers. This can be minimized by interrater enumerator measurements and instrument calibration."

      "text": "We believe the findings of this research will be beneficial for farmers in the agricultural and plantation areas of Jember, who experience hypertension. We will compile the results of our research by comparing and discussing the results in terms of the results of previous similar studies. Future research is expected to improve the results of this study in terms of determining the preparation of hypertension management using a PBD for farmers. We expect contributions from the local government to implement the intervention as one of the policies in the management of hypertension for farmers in the agricultural plantation areas of Jember. This program may also be implemented in other agricultural countries with similar problems, so that hypertension can be optimally treated among farmers."
