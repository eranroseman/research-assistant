  "title": "Dose-Dependent Effect of Aerobic Exercise on Inflammatory Biomarkers in a Randomized Controlled Trial of Women at High Risk of Breast Cancer",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Increased levels of inflammation are associated with many diseases, including cancer. Physical activity can lower breast cancer risk as well as levels of inflammation. The Women In Steady Exercise Research (WISER) Sister trial was a randomized controlled trial that investigated the effects of a dosed, moderate to vigorous, aerobic exercise intervention on levels of inflammation in premenopausal women who were at high risk of developing breast cancer. METHODS: Participants were randomized to control (<75 minutes per week; 41 patients), low-dose exercise (150 minutes per week; 38 patients), or high-dose exercise (300 minutes per week; 37 patients) groups. The 5-menstrual cycles-long, home-based treadmill exercise intervention gradually increased in minutes per week and intensity up to a maximum of 80% of the age-predicted maximum heart rate. Blood was collected at baseline and at follow-up and assayed for chemokine (C-C motif) ligand 2 (CCL2), interleukin 10 (IL-10), interleukin 12 (IL-12), and tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1). RESULTS: A linear dose-response relationship was observed for the proinflammatory biomarkers CCL2 (%\u0394 of -5.44% in the control group, -0.03% in the low-dose exercise group, and 1.54% in the high-dose exercise group), IL-12 (%\u0394 of -21.5% in the control group, 38.2% in the low-dose exercise group, and 25.8% in the high-dose exercise group,) and TNF-\u03b1 (%\u0394 of -4.69% in the control group, 9.51% in the low-dose exercise group, and 15.7% in the high-dose exercise group) but not for the anti-inflammatory biomarker IL-10 (%\u0394 of 5.05% in the control group, 6.05% in the low-dose exercise group, and 10.6% in the high-dose exercise group). For IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1, the percentage change was significantly higher in the low-dose (IL-12: P < .001; and TNF-\u03b1: P = .01) and high-dose (IL-12: P < .001; and TNF-\u03b1: P < .001) exercise groups compared with the control group. CONCLUSIONS: Moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise appeared to increase levels of proinflammatory biomarkers in a dose-dependent manner in a population of healthy women at high risk of developing breast cancer. The results of the current study suggest that for healthy premenopausal women, the mechanism of reduced breast cancer risk observed in physically active individuals may not be a result of reduced levels of inflammation.",

      "text": "On average, women have a 12% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer,  1  and there are several factors involved in its carcinogenesis such as sex hormones, 2 growth factors,  3  and adipokines.  4 Women may be at an elevated risk of developing breast cancer if they possess additional risk factors, including breast cancer-associated mutations  5, 6  or increased levels of inflammatory biomarkers.  7 Physical activity has been shown to reduce breast cancer risk.  8 Premenopausal women who exercise (\u226539 metabolic equivalent for task [MET] hours per week) can reduce their risk of breast cancer by 23% compared with physically inactive women.  9 One mechanism through which physical activity is hypothesized to decrease cancer risk is by decreasing levels of inflammation.\n\nInflammation is associated with an increased risk of disease.  10, 11 Specifically, increased levels of proinflammatory biomarkers such as tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF-\u03b1), interleukin 12 (IL-12; IL-12p70 active heterodimer), and chemokine (C-C motif ) ligand 2 (CCL2) have been implicated in the development and progression of cancer.  [12] [13] 3] [14]  Antiinflammatory biomarkers such as IL-10 are responsible for controlling the inflammatory response by inhibiting the production of proinflammatory biomarkers by inflammatory macrophages.  15, 16 Failure to resolve an inflammatory response can result in a chronic state of inflammation that is characterized by persistent, low levels of proinflammatory biomarkers and inflammatory cells, even in the absence of injury or infection, that can cause harm to healthy tissue.\n\nMitigating chronic inflammation may be particularly important for women at high risk of breast cancer. Cells in an inflammatory environment are known to produce free radicals such as reactive oxygen and nitrogen species.  17 Through Cancer January 15, 2020 oxidative stress, these free radicals are capable of damaging DNA and preventing DNA repair. In addition, mutations in genes that are associated with an increased risk of breast cancer (BRCA1/2 and PALB2) also are key components of the DNA repair process.  18 Furthermore, mutations in genes associated with the DNA damage response also can increase a woman's risk of breast cancer.  2, 3 Thus, reducing chronic inflammation via the implementation of healthy lifestyle changes in women with deficiencies in DNA repair processes may be particularly important.\n\nSeveral studies in women have observed physical activity-induced decreases in proinflammatory biomarkers and increases in anti-inflammatory biomarker levels.  [19] [20] 0] [21] [22]  Despite data from observational studies regarding physical activity and interventional studies using structured exercise interventions  19, 21, 22  demonstrating that both can improve levels of inflammatory biomarkers, to the best of our knowledge no randomized controlled intervention trial to date has assessed whether structured aerobic exercise is able to change levels of inflammation in a dose-dependent manner in a population of women at high risk of developing breast cancer. Studies that have been performed in high-risk women, specifically BRCA1/2 carriers, primarily have focused on observational data exploring the relationship between levels of physical activity and breast cancer risk. These data have shown that physical activity early in life can reduce breast cancer risk.  23 It is important to note that these observational studies have assessed general physical activity (defined as any bodily movement produced by skeletal muscles that requires energy expenditure). Exercise is a subtype of physical activity. Exercise is planned, structured, and intentional movement with the goal of improving or maintaining physical fitness. Exercise physiology has indicated that the body reacts and adapts to different physical stressors (frequency, intensity, and duration) in unique ways. Thus, the objective of the current prospective, randomized controlled trial was to assess the effect of a dosed aerobic exercise intervention on levels of inflammation in premenopausal women at high risk of breast cancer."

Detailed information regarding study recruitment, randomization, the intervention, and main results (improvements in body composition, hormone levels, breast density, adiponectin, and leptin) have been reported previously.  [24] [25] ] [26] [27]  Briefly, eligible participants were considered to be at high risk if they possessed any of the following: 1) confirmed BRCA1/2 mutation; 2) a lifetime risk of developing breast cancer of \u226518% according to the Gail or Claus prediction models; or 3) documented deleterious mutation in a relative that conferred a >25% risk to the participant. Eligibility criteria also included age >18 years; normal menstrual cycles; not currently smoking; body mass index (BMI) of 18 to 50 kg/m 2 and weight stable; no history of fibroids, endometriosis, or polycystic ovary syndrome; no recent use of hormonal contraception; no contraindications for exercise training; controlled hypertension; and sedentary lifestyle (<75 minutes of aerobic exercise per week). The University of Pennsylvania Human Subjects Review Committee approved the current study, and written informed consent was obtained from all subjects before study activities were initiated.\n\nWomen were randomized to control or intervention groups after stratification by: 1) baseline BMI >30 kg/m 2 and <30 kg/m 2 ; and 2) time since first menstrual cycle (>10 years vs \u226410 years). In the current study, 132 participants had available samples at baseline and 116 of those women also had follow-up samples available. Sixteen women were lost to follow-up. Baseline analyses of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12 included all 132 women (43 women in the control group, 44 women in the low-dose exercise group, and 45 women in the high-dose exercise group). Baseline analysis of CCL2 and IL-10 included 131 participants. Two data points at baseline were excluded due to technical error: CCL2 (43 women in the control group, 43 women in the low-dose exercise group, and 45 women in the high-dose exercise group) and IL-10 (42 women in the control group, 44 women in the low-dose exercise group, and 45 women in the high-dose exercise group)."

Control group participants experienced significant decreases in the proinflammatory biomarkers CCL2 (-11.9 pg/mL), IL-12 (-0.4 pg/mL), and TNF-\u03b1 (-0.4 pg/mL). The high-dose exercise group experienced a significant increase in TNF-\u03b1 levels (0.7 pg/mL) after the intervention period, whereas the other proinflammatory biomarkers did not appear to change. Levels of proinflammatory biomarkers did not significantly change among women in the low-dose exercise group. Finally, levels of the anti-inflammatory biomarker IL-10 did not significantly change within any group. Between groups, the changes in IL-12 and TNF-\u03b1 concentrations in the low-dose exercise and high-dose exercise groups were significantly different from those of the control group, whereas the changes in concentrations of CCL2 and IL-10 were not significantly different between groups.\n\nThe percentage change in biomarker levels was calculated and compared between groups. We further tested whether the observed changes in biomarker Cancer January 15, 2020 levels changed linearly as the dose of exercise increased (Fig.  1 ). The percentage change of both IL-12 (36.6% \u00b1 65.6% in the low-dose exercise group and 25.8% \u00b1 50.2% in the high-dose exercise group) and TNF-\u03b1 (12.4% \u00b1 31.7% in the low-dose exercise group and 15.7% \u00b1 15.9% in the high-dose exercise group) was significantly different from the change in the control group (-22.0% \u00b1 30.3% for IL-12 and -4.8% \u00b1 20.0% for TNF-\u03b1).

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "To the best of our knowledge, the current study is the first randomized controlled trial to examine the effect of a dosed 5-menstrual cycle-long, moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise intervention on circulating levels of CCL2, IL-10, IL-12, and TNF-\u03b1 in a national cohort of premenopausal women at risk of developing breast cancer. We observed significant exercise dose-dependent increases in the concentrations of the proinflammatory biomarkers CCL2, IL-12, and TNF-\u03b1. Control group participants experienced significant decreases in their levels of proinflammatory cytokines whereas the intervention groups experienced increases in the levels of proinflammatory biomarkers. The increase in inflammatory biomarker levels was most striking with regard to TNF-\u03b1 levels among participants in the high-dose exercise group (15.7% \u00b1 15.9%). In addition, the increases in TNF-\u03b1 and IL-12 levels within both the lowdose and high-dose exercise groups were significantly different from the decreases observed in the control group.\n\nDespite the conventional wisdom that structured exercise decreases levels of proinflammatory biomarkers, there have been studies that also report increases. Hayase et al observed that premenopausal women (9 patients), but not postmenopausal women (9 patients), had significantly increased levels of TNF-\u03b1 after 10 weeks of aqua aerobics (120 minutes per week) and resistance training (60 minutes per week).  32 They also demonstrated that this increase in TNF-\u03b1 was significantly correlated with a decrease in visceral fat tissue (r = -0.816; P < .05). Brown et al reported that participants in the WISER Sister study from the low-dose and high-dose exercise groups had significantly decreased levels of visceral adipose tissue compared with control group participants,  27  which may have influenced the increase in TNF-\u03b1 levels noted in the current study.\n\nThere also is evidence in the literature that inflammatory biomarkers are not changed after an exercise intervention. In one example, 100 women (aged 54.4 \u00b1 7.1 years, 34% of whom were premenopausal) who participated in a 12-month aerobic exercise intervention (60 minutes per day for 6 days per week, 60%-85% of the maximum heart rate) experienced unchanged levels of inflammation, as measured via C-reactive protein (CRP), despite improvements in body composition and fitness capacity.  33 However, after a stratified analysis of women with BMIs >30 kg/m 2 and <30 kg/m 2 , a trend Cancer January 15, 2020 was observed that women with a higher baseline BMI reduced their CRP levels more than women with a lower BMI. This observation may help to explain why women in the current study with an average BMI of 26.8 kg/m 2 did not experience a decrease in levels of proinflammatory biomarkers.\n\nAlthough the current study did not assess CRP, the inflammatory biomarkers were chosen to represent various facets of the inflammatory response. CCL2 aids in the recruitment and activation of monocytes and macrophages in mammary tissue,  14, 34  and it also has been associated with increased stromal density of mammary glands, which is a risk factor for breast cancer.  35 TNF-\u03b1 signals through the TNF receptor 1, which is expressed by all human tissue, and intracellular responses to TNF-\u03b1 include regulation of apoptosis and the production of cytokines.  36 IL-12 is highly involved in the functional activity of natural killer cells and T lymphocytes, and for this reason this proinflammatory cytokine can have beneficial or detrimental effects.  37, 38 IL-10 plays a major role in resolving the inflammatory response.\n\nThe population in the current study included adult (aged 34.4 \u00b1 7.0 years), slightly overweight (BMI of 26.8 \u00b1 6.3 kg/m 2 ), but otherwise healthy, premenopausal women. It was not anticipated that this cohort would have elevated levels of inflammation at baseline, Cancer January 15, 2020 but it was hypothesized that the exercise intervention herein could decrease biomarkers of inflammation further. All participants initiated the study with similar levels of each biomarker, suggesting that changes in the measured biomarkers of inflammation were an effect of the intervention, and that consistent (>80% of the total prescribed minutes of exercise were completed)  [24] [25] [26] [27]  and chronic (approximately 6 months on average) exercise training increased levels of inflammatory biomarkers. These results need to be taken in context with prior reports from the WISER Sister study. Our previous work has demonstrated an exercise dose-dependent decrease in leptin levels, estrogen-sensitive breast tissue, and body fat.  [25] [26] 6] [27]  Thus, given the full scope of physiological changes observed from this interventional study, we can speculate that in healthy women who are at risk of developing breast cancer, exercise-induced changes in adipokines, body composition, and fibroglandular breast tissue may be more meaningful mechanistically for protection against breast cancer than exerciseinduced changes in systemic inflammation.\n\nA major strength of the current study was the high level of adherence to the exercise intervention in both the low-dose and high-dose exercise groups. The current study allowed for a more direct interpretation of the effect of exercise on inflammation by focusing on the volume of exercise rather than varying exercise intensity or including a caloric restriction component. The inclusion of a control sedentary group for comparison of inflammation levels with the intervention groups was an additional strength. Finally, this study focused solely on a national sample of women at high genetic risk of breast cancer who otherwise were healthy without other known diseases.  24 To the best of our knowledge, this population of women is underrepresented in the literature regarding inflammation and structured exercise. The current study has several limitations, one of which is the selection of 4 cytokines. The inclusion of additional proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory biomarkers and their receptors would provide a more complete inflammatory profile that may explain the changes we observed in the panel in the current study. Future studies also will need to assess a more stable marker of inflammation, such as CRP. Last, the population in the current study predominantly was educated white women, which limits the application of its findings to other women more broadly.\n\nOverall, the results of the current study demonstrated clear increases in levels of proinflammatory biomarkers after a 5-menstrual cycle-long, moderate to vigorous aerobic exercise intervention. Despite the increase in levels of inflammation in these women at high risk of developing breast cancer, the WISER Sister study has been shown to improve hormone levels, breast density, body composition, fitness capacity, and energy expenditure.  [28] [29] ] [30] [31]  Overall, the information gained from the WISER Sister study indicates that for healthy premenopausal women, the mechanism of reduced breast cancer risk observed in physically active individuals may not occur as a result of reduced levels of inflammation."
