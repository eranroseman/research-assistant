  "title": "Using Mobile Phones and Short Message Service to Deliver Self-Management Interventions for Chronic Conditions: A Meta-Review",
  "abstract": "Background: The worldwide burden of chronic disease is widespread and growing. This shift from acute to chronic care requires rethinking how resources are invested in managing these conditions. One response has been to create programs and interventions that have the goal of helping patients better manage their own conditions. Over time, these self-management interventions and strategies have increasingly relied on various technologies for their implementation, with the newest technology being mobile phones and short message service (SMS). Aim: The objective of this meta-review was to evaluate the current evidence on the use of mobile phones and SMS to deliver self-management interventions for chronic conditions. Methods: A meta-review was conducted of the 11 systematic reviews (SRs) that were identified and retrieved after an extensive search of electronic databases covering the years 2000-2012. Relevant information was abstracted from each systematic review and a quality assessment carried out using the AMSTAR (\"A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews\") criteria. \n Findings: The number and types of included studies and total number of subjects varied significantly across the systematic reviews. Mobile phone text messaging was reported to significantly improve adherence to appointments and antiretroviral therapy, short-term smoking quit rates, and selected clinical and behavioral outcomes. AMSTAR scores ranged from 11 to 3, reflecting substantial variation in SR quality. Linking Evidence to Action: Mobile phones and SMS show promise as a technology to deliver self-management interventions to improve outcomes of chronic care management. However, the quality of future studies and systematic reviews needs to be improved. There also are unresolved issues about the technology itself.",

      "title": "BACKGROUND",
      "text": "The burden of chronic disease is widespread and growing. The shift from acute to chronic illness has caused policymakers and healthcare providers worldwide to rethink how resources are invested in managing these chronic conditions  (Wilkinson & Whitehead, 2009) . One response has been to invest in the development of programs and interventions that are focused on helping patients to better manage their own conditions. Self-management is a rethinking of the traditional ways of delivering health care: the patient assumes the role of primary provider and the healthcare professional supports and empowers the patient to take primary responsibility for his or her own health  (Richard & Shea, 2011) . Therefore, the purpose of self-management interventions is to assist patients to become informed about their conditions and to assume an active role in their treatment. Self-management decisions may include: level of adherence to medication and treatment plans, selection of which diagnostic tests and surgical procedures to undergo, and determining which health-related goals to pursue. Self-management can apply to health promotion interventions, prevention strategies, acute care and, most often, chronic illness care  (Lorig & Holman, 2003; Richard & Shea, 2009; Wilde & Garvin, 2007) . The effectiveness of self-management education programs is measured in terms of relevant behavioral, physical, psychological, and social health outcomes, including knowledge, medication and treatment adherence, symptom management, healthcare utilization, and quality of life  (Barlow, Wright, Sheasby, Turner, & Hainsworth, 2002; Bodenheimer, Lorig, Holman, & Grumbach, 2002; Chodosh et al., 2005; Lorig, Ritter, & Plant, 2005; Richard & Shea, 2009) .\n\nSelf-management programs and interventions have increasingly been delivered using technological devices rather than face-to-face meetings. These technologies have changed over time and have included telephone support and counseling, telehealth/telemedicine programs, computer and webbased programs and, most recently, mobile phone and short message service (SMS) utilization. A recent review of asynchronous and synchronous teleconsultation strategies for diabetes care identified the deployment of mobile technology as a promising application for self-management monitoring and feedback  (Verhoeven, Tanja-Dykstra, Nijland, & Esenbach, 2010) .\n\nText messaging is a highly prevalent and global phenomenon. Recent statistics indicate that of the 4 billion mobile phones in use, 3.05 billion, or 75%, are SMS enabled ( http://www.smartinsights.com/mobile-marketing-analytics /mobile-marketing-statistics). Across the 21 countries surveyed by the Pew Research Center Global Attitudes Project, a median 75% of cell phone users say they text. Texting is widespread in both wealthy nations and in the developing world, with texting being most common among cell phone owners in two of the poorest nations-Indonesia and Kenya. In nearly every country, the young and the well educated are especially likely to embrace these technologies ( http://www.pewglobal.org/2011/12/20/global-digital- communication-texting-social-networking-popular-worlwide/ [updated February 29, 2012] ). Worldwide, over 350 billion text messages are exchanged across the world's mobile networks every month.\n\nThe objective of this meta-review was to evaluate the current evidence on the use of mobile phones and SMS to deliver selfmanagement interventions. Meta-reviews appraise and synthesize findings from systematic reviews or meta-analyses  (Whitlock, Lin, Chou, Shekelle, & Robinson, 2008)  in order to appraise quality of the reviews prior to their application to practice and policy  (Savard, Thompson, & Clark, 2011) . The specific aims of this meta-review were to: (a) Describe and appraise the evidence supporting self-management interventions delivered using mobile phone and short message service technology as reflected in published systematic reviews. (b) Develop recommendations for improving the quality of the underlying research base focused on the use of mobile phones and SMS to deliver self-management interventions. (c) Identify issues and questions that need to be addressed by clinicians and policymakers in the adoption and application of mobile phones and SMS to improve self-management of chronic conditions."

      "text": "We searched PubMed (Medline), Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (CDSR), CINAHL (EBSCO), and Web of Sci-ence for systematic reviews or meta-analyses published between 2000 and 2012 using combinations of the following search terms: self-management, self-monitoring, short message service, short text messaging, text messaging, mobile phones, and cellular phones. We also searched the reference lists of the retrieved articles. In addition, the Cochrane DARE (Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effectiveness) was searched for reviews of the identified non-Cochrane systematic reviews. Only reviews written in English were included. Additional inclusion criteria included a self-management intervention (education, reminders, monitoring) delivered via a mobile phone and employing text messaging to improve selfmanagement processes and outcomes, including adherence to treatment plan, medication or appointments, improvements in clinical or behavioral outcome measures, or improvements in processes of care. Each eligible review article was abstracted by one author and then reviewed by a second author for accuracy. The following information was placed in a grid: complete citation, stated aim of the review, number of included studies and subjects, quality appraisal and score (if performed), inclusion and exclusion criteria, intervention details, measured outcomes, results, study conclusions, and identified research and technology limitations and issues.\n\nEach systematic review was evaluated for methodological quality by two reviewers independently using the A Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) criteria  (Shea et al., 2009) . The AMSTAR is a reliable and valid measurement tool to assess the methodological quality of systematic reviews.\n\nIt contains 11 criteria, with 4 possible responses related to whether the criteria were met: Yes, No, Can't Answer, and Not Applicable. The criteria are: 1. an \"a priori\" design, 2. duplicate study selection and data extraction, 3. comprehensive literature search, 4. source of publication as inclusion criteria, 5. list of included and excluded studies, 6. characteristics of included studies provided, 7. quality of included studies assessed and documented, 8. scientific quality used to formulate conclusions, 9. appropriate combining of findings of studies, 10. publication bias assessed, and 11. conflict of interest stated.\n\nGiven concerns expressed by Jaspers, Smeulers, Vermeulen, and Peute (2011), the AMSTAR score was not used to screen out systematic reviews from the meta-review. Instead, they are utilized in the consideration of strength and reliability of the findings."

Further analysis of the titles or abstracts led to the exclusion of 92 of these: 16 were not systematic reviews, 34 were not focused on self-management, and 42 did not study or report separate outcomes for interventions that utilized mobile phones or SMS. Eleven systematic reviews or meta-analyses met all the inclusion criteria and were retrieved for inclusion in this meta-review. Publication dates ranged from 2009 to 2012, reflecting the recent introduction of this technology. Population focus and targeted outcomes varied across reviews. Four were limited to persons with diabetes; three focused on the general population; one each focused on individuals with a chronic illness, HIV infection, or smoking addiction, and one focused on children and adolescents."

      "text": "As shown in Table  1  (available online), the individual systematic reviews (SRs) varied significantly in terms of type of research designs, number of studies, and total number of subjects included in each review as well as outcomes measured and population focus. Number of research studies included in each review ranged from 2 to 25 and number of subjects ranged from 421 to 38,060. Four of the SRs included only randomized controlled trials (RCTs), three included RCTs and quasiexperimental studies, and the remaining four included RCTs, pre-post designs and descriptive studies. The number and type of outcomes that were assessed also varied and included clinical, process, and behavioral measures, as well as satisfaction and costs. The majority of underlying studies were conducted in countries other than the United States. Three of the SRs included no studies conducted in the United States. Interventions ranged from simple (one reminder to keep appointment) to complex (a multifaceted self-management program)."

      "title": "Outcome Analysis",
      "text": "Cochrane systematic reviews are considered the \"gold standard\" of systematic reviews and meta-analyses, with rigorous requirements for their performance and reporting. The four Cochrane review results, all with AMSTAR scores of 11, are discussed first. Car, Gurol-Urganci, de Jongh, Vodopivec-Jamsek, and Atun (2012) found that mobile phone text messages significantly improved appointment adherence, were less expensive than phone call reminders, and were acceptable to patients. The evidence supporting the results was rated low to moderate quality by the authors. De Jongh, Gurol-Urganci, Vodopivec-Jamsek,  Car, and Atun (2012)  reported that mobile phone text messaging led to improved peak expiratory flow and improved symptom score in asthma patients. They also found that text message prompts led to a higher number of blood glucose results being reported to the provider, and text messages improved scores on self-management capacity in diabetes and diabetes social support. The evidence supporting these results was rated as moderate quality by the authors. The SR did not find that text messaging improved glycemic control, diabetic complications, or weight control in persons with diabetes, or blood pressure levels or control, and body weight in persons with hypertension. Horvath, Azman, Kennedy, and Rutherford (2012)  found that short, weekly text messaging lowered risk of nonadherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in HIV patients, and lowered the risk of virologic failure. Both short and long weekly text messaging lowered the risk of nonadherence compared to short or long daily text messages. The evidence was considered high quality by the authors. Whittaker et al. (2009)  focused on use of text messaging for smoking cessation interventions.\n\nText messaging programs increased short-term self-reported quit rates, while mobile phone combined with Internet interventions increased both short-term and long-term quit rates. However, the long-term benefit of programs delivered solely by mobile phone text messaging was not established. The quality of the evidence was considered high by the authors.\n\nThe remaining SRs scored lower on the AMSTAR tool. Liang et al. (2011)  scored a 10, losing a point due to failure to provide a list of included and excluded studies. This SR reported that mobile phone interventions significantly reduced hemoglobin A1C (HbA1C) values in persons with diabetes, and subgroup analysis showed that the reduction was greater in persons with Type 2 diabetes. Greater reductions also were seen with combined mobile phone-and Internet-based interventions compared to mobile phone alone. The evidence supporting the results was considered strong by the authors. Russell-Minda et al. (2009)  and  Militello, Kelly, and Melnyk (2012)  both scored an 8 on the AMSTAR. Neither SR provided a list of included and excluded studies, assessed for publication bias, or provided information on potential conflicts of interest. Russell-Minda et al. (2009)  reported, based on moderately strong evidence, that text messaging significantly improved HbA1C levels in persons with diabetes. This SR also reported that limited evidence supported the use of text messaging to improve selfefficacy, adherence, diabetes knowledge and quality of life, but did not improve cholesterol and triglyceride levels. Militello et al. (2012)  reported that text messaging improved blood glucose and self-monitoring in children with diabetes, and that intensive insulin therapy plus text messaging improved diabetes self-efficacy, self-reported adherence, and perceived social support from the medical team. This SR also reported that SMS reminders reduced rejection and risk of rejection in children having received a liver transplant. However, the two studies with the highest calculated quality scores within the SR did not report significant improvements in outcomes.\n\nThe SRs conducted by  Holtz and Lauckner (2012) ,  Fjeldsoe, Marshall, and Miller (2009) ,  Krishna and Boren (2008) , and  Krishna, Boren, and Balas, (2009)  had lower scores on the AM-STAR tool. Fjeldsoe et al. (2009)  scored a 6; Krishna and Boren and Krishna et al. each scored a 3, and Holtz and Lauckner scored a 5. The most serious quality issue with these four SRs was failure to appraise the quality of the underlying studies and incorporate that knowledge into formulating conclusions about the results. The reliability of these results is therefore questionable. Fjeldsoe et al. (2009)  also did not provide the list of studies, assess the likelihood of publication bias, or include conflict of interest information. Holtz and Lauckner (2012)  searched only for published research studies, did not include the list of studies, did not assess for publication bias, and did not report on conflicts of interest. Krishna and Boren (2008)  and  Krishna et al. (2009)  did not use duplicate study selection or conduct a comprehensive literature search, searched only for published studies, did not assess for publication bias, and did not include conflict of interest information.\n\nBecause of serious methodological flaws, the following systematic review findings may not be reliable. Fjeldsoe et al. (2009)  reported that use of SMS increased smoking cessation at 6 weeks, but not at 26 weeks. Use of SMS to deliver behavioral change interventions was reported to be associated with improved physical activity and weight reduction, improved diabetes self-management, and improved blood pressure control. Asthma and bulimia outcomes were not improved. Holtz and Lauckner (2012)  reported that SMS was associated with significant improvements in HbA1C levels and self-care in some studies, as well as positive trends in body mass index, knowledge, satisfaction, and self-efficacy, but statistics were not provided for many studies. Krishna and Boren (2008)  also reported significant improvement in HbA1C in some studies, no improvements in blood pressure, and mixed results for cholesterol, triglycerides, exercise and weight, but few statistics were provided. Krishna et al. (2009)  looked at disease management programs for a wide range of diagnoses. They reported significant improvements in HbA1C for the individuals with diabetes and significant improvements in adherence in the majority of relevant studies. There were mixed results for smoking cessation. One or two studies each supported improvements in quality of life, self-efficacy, and asthma symptoms. No studies supported improvements in physical activity, body mass index, blood pressure, cholesterol, or triglycerides."

      "title": "Quality Assessment Within SR",
      "text": "To develop valid and reliable practice recommendations based on systematic review results, it is critical that the quality of the underlying studies be assessed. Car, Gurol-Urganci, de Jongh, Vodopivec-Jamsek, and Atun (2012), de Jongh et al. (  2012 ), and  Horvath et al. (2012)  utilized the Grading of Recommendation Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) criteria to appraise the quality of the underlying evidence. Liang et al. (2011)  utilized a modified Jadad Scale  (Jadad, 1996)  to appraise the quality of included studies. Militello et al. (2012)  and  Russell-Minda et al. (2009)  applied the Downs and Black checklist  (Downs & Black, 1998) . Russell-Minda et al. (2009)  used the instrument to screen out low-quality papers from the review, while  Militello et al. (2012)  incorporated the quality scores into the discussion of results. Whittaker et al. (2009)  assessed risk of bias with specific questions, but no standardized tool was identified. The rest of the SRs did not conduct a critical appraisal of the quality of the underlying studies and thus the conclusions drawn by the authors may be suspect."

      "title": "Quality Assessment of Non-Cochrane Reviews",
      "text": "Five of the systematic reviews were included in the DARE database. The DARE contains details of SRs that evaluate the effects of healthcare interventions and organization of health services. A summary and critical commentary on the quality and reliability of the evidence in the reviewed SR are provided by researchers with in-depth knowledge and experience of systematic review methods. This provides an additional level of quality review in addition to the AMSTAR. The review of  Fjeldsoe et al. (2009)  found potential language and publication biases, and reported that the author's conclusion may not be reliable. (Language bias is possible when only English-language studies are included in a review. Publication bias occurs, for example, when studies with positive findings are more likely to be published than studies with negative findings). The review of  Krishna et al. (2009)  found potential language and publication biases, and stated that the authors' conclusions may not be reliable. The review of  Liang et al. (2011)  found possible publication bias and limited reporting of comparator treatments, and stated that the authors' conclusions should be interpreted with caution. The review of  Militello et al. (2012)  found potential language and publication biases, and stated that the reliability of the results is unknown due to limitations of the study trials and the systematic review. The review of  Russell-Minda et al. (2009)  found possible language and publication biases, and concluded that the reliability of the authors' conclusions was limited due to methodological problems in the systematic review."

      "title": "Study Designs",
      "text": "Almost all the authors identified an urgent need for higher quality studies with larger sample sizes or longer follow-up periods  (Car et al., 2012; Fjeldsoe et al., 2009; Holtz & Lauckner, 2012; Krishna et al., 2009; Liang et al., 2011; Milettelo et al., 2012; Whittaker et al., 2009) . Often, individual studies are underpowered and not able to reliably detect significant differences between the treatment and control groups  (Fjeldsoe et al., 2009; Holtz & Lauckner, 2012) . Lack of adequate sample sizes also prevents important subgroup analyses. For example,  Holtz and Lauckner (2012)  found that a few highly active users were responsible for sending the majority of text messages in those studies. Thus, it might be beneficial to examine the characteristics of these highly active individuals to develop methods for encouraging more active engagement by other users. Liang et al. (2011)  found larger effects in the subgroup of patients with Type 2 diabetes, which might suggest closer targeting of the intervention to individuals with Type 2 diabetes mellitus. Dose of the mobile phone text messaging intervention is also important, but seldom measured. Militello et al. (2012)  point out the need to determine how much of a dose of the intervention is required to sustain positive outcomes over time. Even though blinding of the subjects and provider is not possible, potential biases may be introduced if the outcome assessors are not blinded to which study group findings are being analyzed  (Car et al., 2012) . Inadequate follow-up periods and short intervention periods have prevented assessment of long-term sustainability of the mobile phone interventions for diabetes self-management and smoking cessation  (Holtz & Lauckner, 2012 , Whittaker et al., 2009) . Assessment of the maintenance of the behavioral effects of the intervention, after the intervention period is over, is thus recommended  (Fjeldsoe et al., 2009) . Attrition is a common problem in studies with technology interventions  (Fjeldsoe et al., 2009) , so investigators must consider strategies for retaining participants over time. Horvath et al. (2012)  suggest the possible need for modest monetary incentives to keep patients sufficiently motivated to continue participation in the study. However, better targeting of the mobile phone interventions to those more likely to engage in these technologically driven programs would also be beneficial."

    {
      "title": "Missing Variables of Interest",
      "text": "Many variables of interest are never identified, collected, and analyzed in the studies of mobile phone technology. For example, cost of the mobile phone and SMS intervention is seldom addressed, although important to healthcare administrators, patients, and potential payers  (Holtz & Lauckner, 2012; Krishna & Boren, 2008; Krishna et al., 2009; Militello et al., 2012) . Most of the studies did not include evaluations of the intervention from the provider or participant perspectives, which would help inform future applications and modifications of the technology. Little attention has been paid thus far on the impact of the technology on the quality of the patient-provider interaction  (Holtz & Lauckner, 2012) . Finally, almost none of the underlying studies addressed the potential harms and adverse effects that might occur as a result of using this technology. For example, important messages being lost because the participant changed mobile phone service providers and telephone numbers."
    },
    {
      "title": "Intervention Details",
      "text": "In many studies, the interventions are not described in sufficient detail to allow for replication of the study. Investigators need to report more details on message content, message timing and frequency, and message format (standardized or tailored to the individual). Studies also need to report process measures associated with intervention delivery, such as number of sent SMS messages, number of replies, and how SMS messages are treated and stored  (Fjeldsoe et al., 2009) . Other variations that need to be examined include how the technology was initiated, how any dialogue was initiated, and whether there is opportunity for interaction  (Fjeldsoe et al., 2009) . Furthermore, interventions being delivered using mobile phone SMS have attempted to change patient behavior, but most have not been based on any specific behavioral theory  (Liang et al., 2011) . Applicable theories include cognitivebehavior theory, self-efficacy, and theory of planned behavior. Militello et al. (2012)  called for more studies that employ both rigorous and theory-based methods and interventions. Adherence to the protocols and the degree of compliance with the device or intervention also need to be evaluated and measured. Fidelity is often overlooked in implementation studies."
    },
    {
      "title": "Generalizability",
      "text": "Most of the underlying studies were conducted in non-U.S. locations, across a large number of both developed and developing countries. On one hand, this suggests that mobile phone technology might have broad applicability and acceptability across the globe. On the other hand, the limited number of studies conducted in the United States makes it difficult to generalize the findings to domestic settings and populations  (Car et al., 2012; Krishna et al., 2009) . It is possible that the included studies may not be representative of the intended target population  (Fjeldsoe et al., 2009) . Both the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality and Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute support research portfolios that fund these types of technologically focused studies, and encourage proposals from interdisciplinary groups of researchers. In addition,  Horvath et al. (2012)  and  Militello et al. (2012)  specifically recommend that more research be conducted on use of mobile-based interventions in pediatric and adolescent populations. This is especially relevant given that the younger population is more likely to embrace these new technologies.\n\nLong-Term Considerations  Krishna et al. (2009)  point out the need for more studies on cost-effectiveness and technical and financial feasibility of adoption of mobile phone or SMS interventions in real world clinical settings. One important issue is whether this intervention delivery system will be reimbursed by payers or governmental agencies. Krishna and Boren (2008)  identified specific concerns about lack of reimbursement for health professionals receiving the calls or messages, who must commit time to read and respond as necessary. So far, little is known about the provider's future intentions to integrate mobile phone applications into his or her practice after a study ends  (Holtz & Lauckner, 2012) . Most studies did not examine providers' acceptance of, satisfaction with, and intention to adopt mobile phone applications  (Holtz & Lauckner, 2012) . There has also been little examination of the impact of these applications on the patient-provider interaction  (Holtz & Lauckner, 2012) . Future study designs and implementation initiatives need to address long-term sustainability and outcomes-including who would be most likely to use the mobile phones and who would benefit the most."

      "title": "Systematic Reviews Quality",
      "text": "The AMSTAR tool and DARE reviews indicate a need to improve the quality of systematic reviews as well. Since systematic reviews should be the primary source of practice recommendations that are included in evidence-based clinical practice guidelines, it is imperative that they meet high-quality standards. In 2011, the Institute of Medicine published the document \"Finding What Works in Health Care: Standards for Systematic Reviews.\" This document includes standards for initiating a SR, for finding and assessing individual studies, for synthesizing a body of evidence, and for reporting the results. Following these standards would help ensure that future published systematic reviews are providing valid and reliable practice recommendations. There also are issues of internal versus external validity of the systematic review findings. The Cochrane reviews use stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria, resulting in reviews of a minimal number of studies (two to four each in this meta-review). One must question to what extent the results can be generalized to other populations and settings. On the other hand, the remaining SRs included a larger numbers of studies with multiple study designs, many of which were excluded from the Cochrane reviews. Several of these studies appeared in multiple SRs. This introduces the potential for bias and confounding of reported results, but may also reveal more generalizable information about the intervention implementation and outcomes."

      "title": "AIM 3: ISSUES RELATED TO ADOPTION AND APPLICATION OF MOBILE PHONE AND SMS TECHNOLOGY",
      "text": "The advantages of using mobile phones and SMS to deliver current treatment services seem obvious: the messages and reminders can be delivered anywhere, anytime, and directly to the participant with minimal direct contact  (Whittaker et al., 2009) . However, authors of the systematic reviews have pointed out that there has been little assessment of potential complications that might arise from text messaging (e.g., loss of data due to lost messages or misinterpretation of the information being sent  (Car et al., 2012) . Technical issues might arise, such as inadequate cell phone coverage  (Holtz & Lauckner, 2012) . There also has been little consideration of possible security, privacy, liability, and confidentiality issues  (Car et al., 2012; Holtz & Lauckner, 2012) . Standards regarding patient privacy and confidentiality must be upheld-but universal guidelines are thus far not in place to support mobile health implementation  (Militello et al., 2012 ). De Jongh et al. (2012)  point out that cell phones are frequently shared among family members in low-income countries. They also point out that reliability of cell phone service is lower in some countries, which must be taken into consideration when evaluating whether to implement such an intervention. Mobile phone numbers frequently change, and the provider may be unable to verify whether the message was delivered to the correct person  (Car et al., 2012) . Licensure issues might arise if the provider practices in one state and the patient lives in another  (Krishna & Boren, 2008) . Another potential issue is the reliability and validity of the information entered into the mobile phones by the patient  (Krishna & Boren, 2008) . The same question can be asked of the information entered by the provider. Numbers may be inadvertently transposed and medication doses doubled or halved based on erroneous data entry.\n\nThere has been relatively little attention paid so far to the training needs of patients, such as how much detail and how many sessions are required for participants to become comfortable in the use of mobile phone technologies  (Horvath et al., 2012) . Militello et al. (2012)  suggest adding additional components to the mobile phone-based interventions, such as education and skills building, to improve effectiveness and sustainability. The developers of the behavior change intervention should also have collected culture-specific data to determine optimal message content and length  (Horvath et al., 2012) .\n\nSubstantial variability in acceptance of this technology has been documented  (Horvath et al., 2012) . Some patients are highly active users while others engage infrequently or drop out altogether. Because of this, the technology might need to be targeted at particular subgroups, but little is known currently about what groups should be targeted for which specific applications of the technology.\n\nThere are some aspects of the mobile phone SMS technology that appear be better supported by systemic review results, but need confirmation in higher quality reviews. Personally tailored messages appear to be more effective than messages that are not tailored to the individual recipient  (Fjeldsoe et al., 2009; Krishna & Boren, 2008) . Interventions that rely on unidirectional communication alone are not as effective as interventions that are based on or are supplemented by interactions between the provider and the patient  (Fjeldsoe et al., 2009) . Lack of tailoring and interactivity were associated with higher attrition rates in the underlying studies. Frequency of messaging also appears to make a difference. Car et al. (2012)  found that weekly messages of any length were more effective than daily messages to remind patients to adhere to their ART, which might reflect a phenomenon similar to \"alert fatigue.\" However, the systematic review conducted by  Liang et al. (2011)  found the opposite-that daily messages were more effective than weekly for diabetes self-management. Another review concluded that the frequency of message delivery needs to be matched with the frequency of the expected behavior change-for example, five messages daily for smoking cessation and five times a week for physical activity. The optimum scheduling of text messages is therefore yet to be determined. Stronger evidence supports the added benefit of combining the mobile phone and SMS intervention with an Internet-based intervention, rather than relying on text messages alone. Finally, we have a higher level of confidence in the reported short-term outcomes than we have for long-term effects of the intervention. Some of this relates to the typical short intervention periods, as well as the rather high attrition rates in some of the underlying studies."

      "title": "CONCLUSIONS",
      "text": "There is a beginning body of evidence supporting the use of mobile phones and short message service as a vehicle for delivering self-management interventions in countries across the globe. Of the 11 systematic reviews that were included in this meta-review, 4 were Cochrane reviews and considered high quality. The strongest evidence from these reviews supports use of mobile phones and text messaging to improve adherence to appointments and medication, self-management of asthma and diabetes, and short-term smoking cessation. The remaining SRs included studies with different research designs and focused on multiple conditions and outcomes. This introduced more heterogeneity and uncertainty into the results. More highquality studies are needed to judge the long-term benefits of using mobile phones and SMS to deliver more r Systematic review authors need to meet the re- cently published standards for developing, conducting, and reporting systematic reviews."

WVN LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION r Mobile phone SMS may be an effective strategy for delivering self-management interventions to those with chronic conditions regardless of age, location, or socioeconomic status. r Appointment and medication adherence can be improved with mobile phone delivered text message reminders; short-term smoking quit rates also can be increased via SMS-delivered smoking cessation programs. r Those considering mobile phone SMS for delivery of self-management programs and interventions should provide tailored messages, interactive capability, and linkage with Internet-based interventions. The potential advantages of mobile phones and SMS to deliver healthcare interventions must be balanced with an awareness of the potential complications and technical issues that might arise."

WVN LINKING EVIDENCE TO ACTION r Mobile phone SMS may be an effective strategy for delivering self-management interventions to those with chronic conditions regardless of age, location, or socioeconomic status. r Appointment and medication adherence can be improved with mobile phone delivered text message reminders; short-term smoking quit rates also can be increased via SMS-delivered smoking cessation programs. r Those considering mobile phone SMS for delivery of self-management programs and interventions should provide tailored messages, interactive capability, and linkage with Internet-based interventions. The potential advantages of mobile phones and SMS to deliver healthcare interventions must be balanced with an awareness of the potential complications and technical issues that might arise."
