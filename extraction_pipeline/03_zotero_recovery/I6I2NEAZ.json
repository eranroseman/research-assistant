  "title": "A Digital Behavior Change Intervention for Health Promotion for Adults in Midlife: Protocol for a Multidimensional Assessment Study",
  "abstract": "Background: To support lifelong health promotion and disease prevention, Sant\u00e9 publique France studied the methodology for building a social marketing scheme with a digital intervention targeting middle-aged adults, specifically socioeconomically disadvantaged groups. The digital intervention aims to encourage people aged 40-55 years to look after their health in the short and medium terms by adopting small actions relating to 8 health determinants: nutrition, physical activity, smoking, alcohol, stress, cognitive health, sleep, and environmental health. In the long term, the intervention intends to prevent frailty and reduce the burden of multimorbidities in older age, particularly for lower socioeconomic groups. Objective: This study aims to measure behavior changes among registered users of the future website. The protocol assesses the impact of the website based on users' implementation of small actions relating to the 8 health determinants. Specifically, it intends to evaluate the website's performance in terms of engaging a specific population, triggering behavior change, raising awareness about a multifactorial approach to health, and encouraging user interaction with the website's resources. \n Methods: The methodology is based on clinical assessments developed alongside the website according to the functionalities offered to registered users in their personalized space. The assessment tool design draws on logic models for digital interventions, and their consistency for digital applications is verified. The target audience is clearly defined from the outset. The protocol sets out a 3-step assessment: upon registration, after 3 weeks of use, and after 10 weeks of use (end of assessment). Users are divided into 2 groups (socioeconomically disadvantaged users and others) to characterize differences and make corrections. The protocol uses a mixed assessment approach based on website traffic and user login data. Specific and identifiable behavior changes are documented by monitoring the same individuals from T0 to T2, using verbatim comments to classify them into profiles and conducting semistructured individual interviews with a sample of users. \n Results: The protocol creates a multidimensional assessment of digital intervention, showing that during a given timeline, interactions with users can reveal their capabilities, opportunities, and motivations to adopt healthy lifestyles. The protocol's principles were integrated into the development of a personal account to assess users' behavior changes. Given the delayed launch of the website, no recruitment or effects analysis of the protocol took place. \n Conclusions: As no multidimensional assessment protocol is currently available for digital behavior change interventions, our methods reveal that the different framework stages can strengthen the effect measurement, consolidate the choice of assumptions used within the logic model and steer the digital intervention toward action while reducing the burden of information. The suitability of the assessment protocol remains to be evaluated given the delayed launch of the website.",

      "text": "Today, expert consensus recommends that people should strengthen disease prevention actions from the age of 40 years  [1] [2] [3]  to avoid loss of independence due to the accumulation of chronic diseases. Different studies show a correlation between the number of healthy behaviors (physical activity, diet, stop smoking, and reduction of alcohol consumption) and healthy aging. Sant\u00e9 publique France has been working on the planning stages of a social marketing scheme that includes a digital behavior change intervention. The digital intervention was designed in tandem with its assessment protocol in the hope that engineering feedback would improve its applicability. An overview of the literature on the assessment of digital tools for health promotion and disease prevention found proven evidence for the following:  (1)  the added value of a multidimensional assessment of a digital intervention  [4, 5] ,  (2)  the challenge of distinguishing between effect measurement and implementation measurement  [6]  since \"a crucial implication of explicitly recognizing the distinction between engagement with the technological and behavioral aspects of the intervention is that intervention usage alone cannot be taken as a valid indicator of engagement\"  [7] ,  (3)  the importance of being able to qualify the maintenance of a target behavior over time  [8] , and (4) the absence, to our knowledge, of a mixed quantitative and qualitative assessment protocol  [4, [9] [10] [11] .\n\nIt was precisely this gap that prompted the drafting of this assessment protocol for a nonclinical intervention. We explored the literature on assessments in the fields of medicine and medical informatics as a basis for consolidating some of our following methodological choices."

This digital intervention is based on the quantified self to support behavior transformation  [17, 18] . The design of the intervention is explained in a separate study (under review) that illustrates the complementary nature of the theories used in relation to the targeted behavior changes. To become familiar with the user and guide them toward behavior changes, the initial access to the site requires them to fill out a questionnaire on their lifestyle habits, which generates personalized feedback according to a traffic light system in order to introduce recommendations for protective behaviors. At this stage, the user has the option of downloading their report with an overview of the feedback in the form of a table. The next click opens a feed page with action cards and studies that the user can \"like,\" save to their account, and use to navigate further around the site. The personal account is designed as a self-coaching tool intended to support motivation, increase the power to act, and help the user understand health as an interaction between several health determinants applying to all life areas (Table  1 ).\n\nTable 1.

The mixed assessment evaluates behavior changes made at different time points in the data collection process rather than the increase in quality of life and disability-free life expectancy. As mentioned earlier, the evaluable result is the user's loyalty to the logic models used  [13]  and not the loyalty necessary for a program to be effective  [15] . Kelders et al  [22]  described the typical components through an analysis of 83 digital interventions: modular, updated once a week, use of persuasive technologies, and potential to interact with the communicator and peers  [23] .\n\nThe features of an assessment protocol are as follows.\n\n\u2022 Before the digital intervention is launched: it supports the design and modeling of digital intervention.\n\n\u2022 Once launched, (1) it checks whether the users of the personalized space are between the ages of 40 and 55 years, whether they are socioeconomically deprived, and whether they have a low level of literacy; (2) it creates typologies of registered users; (3) it measures the effects (ie, changes in the behavior of registered users) through evaluable criteria and indicators such as adopting and maintaining a new healthy behavior, increased knowledge, improved psychosocial skills, and improved health variables  [6, 24] ; and (4) it continually improves the website and personalized space to support the desire to change behavior in midlife  [18, 25] .\n\nRecording unexpected effects  [16]  sheds light on the adjustments needed in order to continually improve the intervention. Several hypotheses for these have been formulated: (1) the questionnaire does not engage users or it is never repeated; (2) the initial request does not correspond to the determinant that the user is \"coached\" on in their personalized space; (3) a highly disparate choice of actions makes it difficult or even impossible to implement them (no actions are adopted); and (4) actions are liked without a time objective being set."

The research takes an interest in challenging the time frame necessary to evaluate the adoption of healthy lifestyles. It focuses on how the usage of behavior change models (COM-B) combined with the techniques of digital behavior change interventions  [8]  can strengthen the effect measurement of an assessment protocol. The assessment protocol is based on typical digital functionalities such as a user account, self-evaluation of healthy lifestyles (questionnaire), and feedback to engage people with behavior change.

The mixed assessment method delivers a granular analysis that sheds light on the effectiveness and even the efficiency of the website through its personalized space. To our knowledge, our assessment protocol for a digital personalized space, designed with the aim of changing health promotion and disease prevention behaviors, is the first of its kind in the sense that it goes beyond the measurement of the implementation and expressly targets the measuring effect. According to literature reviews, the effects in question will be behavioral change, greater knowledge, improved psychosocial skills, development of a support network, and improved health variables  [6] . The protocol cannot be likened to assessments in investigational designs such as randomized controlled trials, which have been dismissed by some experts as unsuitable by some experts due to the complexity of health promotion interventions. The open design is considered effective \"for the institutions that set it up and its flexibility matches the characteristics of health promotion interventions\"  [6] ."

This makes it possible to consolidate the choice of hypotheses for constructing the logical models used and the objectives targeted. A protocol helps to steer the digital intervention toward the action and regularly checks that it meets the needs of its target audience. The assessment protocol meets the SMART (specific, measurable, achievable, relevant, and time-bound) criteria.\n\nThe research presented here will impact digital interventions in health promotion and disease prevention. As the protocol demonstrates, both the implementation and effects can be assessed. Health promotion and disease prevention stakeholders may prefer an assessment of the program, but this is rarely carried out. Without assessments, a digital intervention can claim to be \"evidence-inspired,\" although, with assessments, it is closer to \"evidence-based.\""
