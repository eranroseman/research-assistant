  "title": "Development, validation, and application of a Brazilian sleep myths and truths assessment scale (SLEEP-MTAS)",
  "abstract": "Objective: This study aimed to develop, validate, and apply a scale assessing knowledge of sleep-related myths and truths and associate it with sociodemographic factors. Methods: A scale with 15 questions was created, containing statements about the characteristics of sleep and related to sleep and dentistry. Each answer ranged from 0 to 4 points, generating a total score from 0 to 60, where higher scores represented greater knowledge. A preliminary study with 200 people assessed its convergent and discriminant construct validity, internal consistency, and temporal stability. The main study included 1965 respondents over 18 years. Additionally, sociodemographic data were collected and a classification of the level of knowledge was performed. Data were analyzed with Student's t-test and one-way ANOVA (p < 0.05). Results: The questionnaire showed convergent (p < 0.001) and discriminant (p \u00bc 0.024) construct validity, internal consistency (alpha \u00bc 0.7), and temporal stability (ICC \u00bc 0.87). In the main study, 90.3% of the participants had moderate and high knowledge, with the score ranging from 24 to 58. Adults over 28 years old (p < 0.001), from the southern region of Brazil (p < 0.001), who lived in capital or metropolitan areas (p < 0.001), with higher education (p < 0.001), without religion (p < 0.001), and involved in dentistry (p < 0.001) had greater knowledge than their peers. Conclusions: The scale presented good psychometric properties. Most participants had moderate and high knowledge on sleep, with a difference in knowledge related to the age, region and area of residence, education, involvement with dentistry, and religion.",

      "text": "Sleep is an essential neurophysiological process for overall health and brain development  [1] , and humans spend a third of their life sleeping, on average  [1] . The quality, duration, and architecture of sleep change over time, especially in the first years of life. Therefore, children need more hours of sleep than an adult or elderly person  [2] . Sleep alterations are associated with metabolic, cardiovascular, endocrine, and neurological problems  [3] . Sleep deprivation can alter the immune system and metabolism and increase the heart rate, as well as affecting the hormones that regulate hunger  [4e6] .\n\nSleep also has an influence on dental issues, which is a constantly growing field with a close relationship with sleep medicine  [7] . Sleep disorders in dentistry are associated with behavioral problems, anxiety, irritability, mood swings during clinical procedures [8e10], greater pain sensitivity  [11] , bruxism  [12, 13] , caries risk  [14] , and alveolaredental trauma  [15] .\n\nGiven the impact of sleep on human health, the scientific literature often does not reach the population in general, which generates popular beliefs or myths that are perpetuated through different sources. A myth is characterized by beliefs propagated by individuals without scientific basis or contrary to scientific evidence  [5, 16] . Although some beliefs can promote behaviors that improve the individual's health, others that are inconsistent with science can negatively affect the population's health status  [16] . Little attention has been given to these myths about sleep and how they result in a healthy or unhealthy behavior pattern  [16] .\n\nQuestionnaires are integral instruments of clinical practice and health assessment and research, essential for decisions about interventions and treatments and in the formulation of health programs  [17] . However, the authors are not aware of instruments in the literature investigating the population's knowledge about sleep-related factors that influence issues inherent to dentistry.\n\nBased on this assumption, this study aimed to assess the Brazilian population's knowledge about specific myths and truths related to sleep by applying a questionnaire previously developed and validated. It also aimed to compare the scale scores according to sociodemographic variables and self-reported sleep quality. The instrument can provide input for the implementation of public policies, providing the general population with educational campaigns to promote health."

In the second stage, a cross-sectional study with national coverage was carried out, and data collection was performed through an online questionnaire that first contained sociodemographic data and the participant's self-assessment about the quality of their sleep, then the SLEEP-MTAS. This study was approved by the Ethics Committee of Hospital Clementino Fraga Filho, Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, under the number 29840020.8.0000.5257."

      "text": "A team of five individuals, guided by an expert sleep academic focused on the dental field, created the SLEEP-MTAS. The SLEEP-MTAS questions were built from concepts about sleep often disseminated among the population and from a scientific article  [16] . To confirm the veracity of these concepts, the available scientific evidence (Table  1 ) was consulted to establish the correct answers for each question in the instrument.\n\nTo perform face and content evaluation  [18] , the questionnaire containing the SLEEP-MTAS was distributed to six dentists attending graduate studies, six laypeople of different education levels and areas of expertise, and two professors in the field of dentistry. They were asked to make comments, modifications, and suggestions. The suggested changes were evaluated by consensus among the team, and those considered pertinent were made. Then, the questionnaire was sent to a committee of professionals in the field of linguistics and education, consisting of a pedagogue, a psychopedagogue, and a Portuguese teacher, who were asked to identify any failures related to agreement, interpretation, and writing. The suggestions made by the experts were all accepted. Finally, the scale was sent to a sample of 10 people from the target audience for clarity assessment, and semantic changes were made. The scale was built and validated in Brazilian Portuguese.\n\nAfter all the suggested changes, the instrument was completed with 15 statements. The answers used a Likert scale of \"strongly agree,\" \"agree,\" \"neither agree nor disagree,\" \"disagree,\" and \"strongly disagree.\" Each question had its corresponding correct answer (truth or myth). For a true statement, a score 0 was given to people who scored \"strongly disagree,\" 1 for \"disagree,\" 2 for \"neither agree nor disagree,\" 3 for \"agree,\" and 4 for \"strongly agree,\" with the opposite when the statement was a myth. Thus, each participant scored from 0 (minimum) to 4 (maximum) points for each question, and the total score ranged from 0 to 60 points, where the higher the score, the greater the knowledge about sleep.\n\nConsidering the instrument's range of scores, we propose the following criteria for classifying the level of knowledge about sleep-related myths and truths: score 12 \u00bc very low knowledge, score 13 to 24 \u00bc low knowledge, score 25 to 36 \u00bc moderate knowledge, score from 37 to 48 \u00bc high knowledge and score >48 \u00bc very high knowledge. The statements in the final version of the SLEEP-MTAS, with their respective answers and references, are described in Table  1 ."

      "title": "Scale validation",
      "text": "The presence of floor and ceiling effects was investigated by analyzing the frequency of responses of the scale's total score. Floor and ceiling effects occur when more than 15% of the responses are concentrated in the minimum and maximum values, respectively  [65] .\n\nThe convergent construct validity was tested through the correlation between the SLEEP-MTAS score and the education level of the participants, using Spearman's correlation coefficient. For this, it was necessary to convert the educational level of the participants into a score ranging from 1 to 5, where 1 represents the lowest educational level and 5 the highest: primary education \u00bc 1, elementary education (gymnasium) \u00bc 2, high school or technical education \u00bc 3, undergraduate \u00bc 4, and graduate \u00bc 5. The discriminant construct validity was investigated by comparing the SLEEP-MTAS scores between the group with self-reported knowledge about unsatisfactory sleep (none, insufficient, and average) and the group with self-assessment of knowledge about satisfactory sleep (good and excellent), using the ManneWhitney test.\n\nThe questionnaire was applied at two different times with at least 15 days between the two applications. The first application (test) was carried out with 200 people and the second (retest) was carried out with 50 participants, randomly selected from the participants who had already answered the SLEEP-MTAS in the first application  [65] . Testeretest participants were not included in the main study.\n\nReliability was evaluated according to the criteria of internal consistency and temporal stability (agreement between repeated testeretest measures). The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calculated for the total score, and Cronbach's alpha was calculated for the total scale and the scale with items deleted, together with the correlation coefficients between the items and the total score. It was considered as evidence of reliability ICC and Cronbach's alpha 0.7  [66] . The significance level adopted in all analyses was 5% (a \u00bc 0.05).

All questions were mandatory, and participants could not complete the questionnaire without answering all questions. However, they could leave the questionnaire page at any time and not complete it. When the questionnaire was not fully completed, it was not computed in the database. The confidentiality of the participants was maintained throughout the study, using a code system to identify the questionnaires for anonymity. Social media platforms (Facebook and Instagram) and a messaging application (WhatsApp) were used to disseminate the questionnaire so that all regions of the national territory could be reached according to population proportions. The survey authors asked participants to share the link to the questionnaire in their WhatsApp groups. An Instagram campaign was created through a page about the survey. The open campaign was created in Brazilian Portuguese and restricted to organic reach among Instagram users, with no paid advertising. The campaign started on August 5, 2020, and ended when the total sample number was reached on August 22, 2020. A specific account for the survey was created on Instagram (@mitosdosono), with a short username to facilitate identification. The ads were created on Canva\u2122 and posted to the feed and stories, and the survey website link was available on the home screen of @mitosdosono's profile. This was necessary because Instagram does not allow website links in posts or captions. The participating researchers shared the invitations on their personal Instagram profiles (feed and stories) and asked other dentists to help share the campaign."

The distribution of the sample, according to level of knowledge about sleep-related myths and truths is shown in Fig.  1 . Most participants (90.3%) demonstrated moderate and high knowledge, with 72.4% scoring from 37 to 48 points.\n\nTable  3  shows the descriptive results and comparisons of the scale scores, according to sociodemographic variables and selfreported sleep quality. A statistical difference existed between the groups for the variables of age group, birth region, city of residence, education level, religion, and involvement in dentistry. Individuals from the two older age groups (28e44 years and >44 years) had higher SLEEP-MTAS scores compared to younger participants (18e27 years). Participants from the southern region had a higher SLEEP-MTAS score than those from the northern region, but no statistically significant differences existed between the other regions. Compared to their peers, individuals residing in capital or metropolitan regions, with higher education levels (Undergraduate/Graduate), and who were in the field of dentistry had higher SLEEP-MTAS scores. Participants without religion and Spiritists had higher scores compared to Protestants, but without significant differences to those of other religions. Notably, despite the differences found, the effect of age, birth region, city of residence, education level, and religion on knowledge about sleep myths and truths was generally small; being involved in dentistry was the only factor that significantly contributed to a higher score.

      "text": "This study aimed to develop, validate, and apply a scale to assess the Brazilian population's knowledge of sleep-related myths and truths. Sleep problems are a medical and social concern because they represent a global phenomenon in modern society, which can affect all age groups, impacting the quality of life and productivity of individuals [69e71]. Therefore, evaluating the population's knowledge about sleep can bring an understanding and inform the need to develop programs to disseminate knowledge based on scientific literature.\n\nThe use of virtual questionnaires in scientific studies represents a more economical possibility, with faster information and a higher response rate, than conventional face-to-face or even telephone questionnaires  [72] . They also allow reaching participants from different geographic locations at a low cost, given the large territorial extension of Brazil, and are practical and convenient for researchers (who can contact several participants at the same time and monitor and control responses in real time) and participants (who can answer anonymously and at the most appropriate time for them)  [72e74] .\n\nQuestionnaires are widely used in scientific research. All the steps proposed by Coluci et al.  [17]  were followed in the production of the SLEEP-MTAS, which resulted in a satisfactory internal consistency of the scale  [65] , good reproducibility (testeretest consistency), absence of floor and ceiling effects, and convergent and discriminant construct validity, with adequate psychometric characteristics to be administered in the Brazilian population. Although this study presents the scale's questions also in English, it is important to highlight that the scale was developed in Brazilian Portuguese and was only validated for the last-mentioned  language. Thus, to be applied in other countries, it is necessary to perform transcultural adaptation and validation for the language of the destination country. The analysis of demographic data showed a higher percentage of female participants and those aged 28e44 years, which was expected since the Brazilian female population corresponds to 51.8% ( https://educa.ibge.gov.br/ , accessed on 20/04/2021), and adults aged 30e39 (15.8%) are the majority of the country's population ( https://educa.ibge.gov.br/ , accessed on 20/04/2021). The higher percentage of women corroborates other studies [74e77] and raises the issues of women having more receptive and participative behavior in research and being more interested in sleep compared to men. Some of the reasons reported by men to justify their non-participation have been lack of interest and time constraints  [75] .\n\nThe demographic data also showed that most of the study population had completed higher education (Undergraduate/ Graduate). This does not reflect the general population, since in 2019, only 48.8% of the population over 25 years old had completed high school, and fewer (17.4%) had completed higher education ( https://educa.ibge.gov.br/ , accessed on 20/04/2021). This bias can be explained by the fact that internet access in Brazil at the last census (2018) was still inadequately available (74.7% of the general population in Brazil have access to the internet, according to the website  https://educa.ibge.gov.br/ , accessed on 20/04/2021), making it difficult to reach the parts of the population who did not have access to the questionnaire.\n\nMost participants demonstrated moderate and high knowledge, which reveals that the population have a good knowledge, but still has doubts about what is a myth and what is true about sleep. Individuals' beliefs are associated with behaviors, so knowledge based on scientific studies on sleep needs to be addressed at the population level for adequate sleep behavior and health patterns. Therefore, changing sleep-related beliefs that are myths is a promising strategy for promoting the health of the population  [16] . It is important to note that the sample of this study has a high educational level, which should be carefully analyzed when generalizing the results.\n\nParticipants aged 18e27 had a significantly lower score than those older than 28 years. Some studies claim that sleep pattern and duration vary with age, and older individuals have a higher prevalence of insomnia, decreased percentage of deep and restful sleep, and increased light sleep, making sleep quality worse  [78, 79] . Thus, with aging, sleep is a greater concern in the population, generating a search for more knowledge about sleep by them.\n\nBrazil has a wide territorial extension and is cut by the equator to the north and the Tropic of Capricorn to the south (Supplementary Fig.  1 ), with a difference in solar incidence throughout the country. Light is essential for maintaining the circadian rhythm and biological clock of individuals  [80, 81] . In the Arctic and Antarctic Circles, for example, deprivation of natural light occurs in winter, which can be detrimental to sleep, health, and mood  [81] . One study reported an association of low incidence of natural light with insufficient sleep  [81] . The fact that the southern region of Brazil is farther from the equatorial region gives it more rigorous winters and less natural light  [81] , meaning the population has more sleep problems compared to the northern region and seeks greater knowledge on the subject. This explains why participants from the southern region had a higher level of knowledge about sleep than those from the northern region.\n\nThe same logic applies to individuals living in capital and metropolitan regions (more urbanized regions) presenting a significantly higher score compared to people living in the interior (more rural regions). Urbanization and artificial light have affected the behavior and sleep patterns of individuals, changing the sleepewake cycle, delaying bedtime, and reducing sleep duration  [82] . The combination of indoor work and artificial light after sunset affects the sleepewake cycle, which slows biological clocks, but social schedules remain unchanged, so people accumulate a lack of sleep, causing what we call social jetlag  [83] . A study carried out with small communities called \"quilombolas\" showed that communities that had not yet or had recently acquired electricity slept earlier than those long urbanized  [83] . Additionally, access to technology and the internet in places far from large centers is more precarious, making information and knowledge more difficult to access  [84] . Individuals with higher education obtained higher scores compared to individuals with less than secondary or technical education. This demonstrates the necessity to go beyond the walls of universities and bring knowledge about sleep to the rest of the population, making people aware of myths and truths to ensure health promotion  [85] . Schools are ideal places for prevention and intervention programs because they reach not only the young population but also family members. This can encourage the development of healthy sleep habits from an early age and create a basis to integrate these habits into daily life at any age. Although sleep education programs are reported in the literature [85e87], and they have been successful in increasing the population's knowledge of sleep in other countries, little effort is yet made to change sleep patterns through these programs  [87] , particularly in Brazil. Knowledge should not be withheld from just a portion of the population; therefore, educational actions in this area should be encouraged not only in Brazil, but in the world.\n\nThese educational actions should also be expanded to the dental field. In this study, dentists and professionals linked to dentistry had higher scores than laypeople, which was expected, since the instrument included questions directly related to dentistry. Every dentist, as a healthcare professional and regardless of their specialty, must be able to help patients identified with a possible sleep disorder, making recommendations and referrals or participating in general management  [88] . Although dental sleep medicine is a new branch of dentistry, it is practiced mainly by oral and maxillofacial surgeons, orthodontists, and dentists specialized in oral pathology or orofacial pain and dysfunction. This is due to not being taught as a dental discipline in many countries, and when it is in the curriculum, it does not include wide knowledge [88e90].\n\nAmong religions, the study showed a statistically significantly lower score for Protestants compared to non-religious individuals and Spiritists. Religiosity and spirituality are cultural factors that can influence the identity, traditions, and way of life of societies, impacting the quality of life and health of individuals  [91] . Religious dogmas are part of the lives of Protestant Christians, and several studies show that people with religion tend to care more for their health, have better quality of life and sleep, and less depression and mortality, as well as the support in their faith [91e94]. Thus, religiosity has an important role in health promotion and disease prevention  [92] . Therefore, the authors hypothesize that individuals without religion may research more about improving their sleep, without dogma support and in a more skeptical way. This theme deserves further qualitative studies in the future.\n\nAlthough the representativeness of this study and the nonprobabilistic snowball method to obtain the sample were limitations, methods were used to mitigate this, such as the distribution of questionnaires according to the population numbers in each region. In this way, we obtained a proportional sample with the entire national territory. Another limitation was the high prevalence of dentists and professionals in the field of dentistry in the sample (29.7%), which does not represent the real proportion in the country. This was because the research was carried out by a team of dentists and, consequently, the authors' connection network was mostly formed of professionals in the field.\n\nHowever, we believe that these limitations did not influence the results of this study, since knowledge about sleep is still needed in the population, and mythical beliefs are still widespread. Although beliefs can be changed through the news sources and the experience and influence of peers  [16] , educational campaigns are needed to disseminate information supported by science. Future longitudinal and qualitative studies should be encouraged along with public policies to promote sleep health in the general population."

Given this potential, cross-cultural adaptations and new validations of this scale can be useful for making measurements in other populations. The population still has doubts about myths and truths about sleep since most participants demonstrated moderate and high knowledge and no participant achieved the maximum score. However, adults over 28 years old, from the southern region of the country, living in capital or metropolitan regions, with higher education, who were non-religious, and who were in the field of dentistry showed greater knowledge of myths and truths about sleep."
