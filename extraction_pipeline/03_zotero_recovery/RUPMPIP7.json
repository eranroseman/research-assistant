  "abstract": "Introduction: Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) testing remains controversial, with most guidelines recommending shared decision making. This study describes men's PSA screening preferences before and after viewing a decision aid and relates these preferences to subsequent clinician visit content. Methods: Men were recruited from two health systems in 2009-2013. Participants answered a questionnaire before and after decision aid viewing addressing PSA screening preferences and five basic knowledge questions. At one health system, participants also answered a survey after a subsequent clinician visit. Data were analyzed in 2014. \n Results: One thousand forty-one predominantly white, well-educated men responded to the pre-and post-viewing questionnaire (25% and 29% response rates at the two sites). After viewing, the proportion of patients leaning away from PSA screening increased significantly (po0.001), with 386 (38%) leaning toward PSA screening versus 436 (43%) before viewing; 174 (17%) unsure versus 319 (32%) before; and 448 (44%) leaning away versus 253 (25%) before. Higher knowledge scores were associated with being more likely to lean against screening and less likely to be unsure (po0.001). Among 278 men who also completed a questionnaire after a subsequent clinician visit, participants who planned to discuss PSA screening with their clinicians were significantly more likely to report such discussions than participants who did not (148/217 [68%] vs 16/46 [35%], respectively [po0.001]). Conclusions: A decision aid reduces men's interest in PSA screening, particularly among the initially unsure. Men who plan to discuss PSA screening with their clinician after a decision aid are more likely to do so.",

      "text": "ecent clinical practice guidelines have recommended a shared decision-making approach between clinicians and men considering a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test for early detection of prostate cancer.  [1] [2] 2] [3]  Even the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which recently recommended against routine PSA screening, acknowledged that PSA tests would continue to be offered and requested, and stated that physicians should not offer or order PSA screening unless they are prepared to engage in shared decision making that enables an informed choice by the patients. Similarly, patients requesting PSA screening should be provided with the opportunity to make informed choices to be screened that reflect their values about specific benefits and harms.  4 t, others have questioned the practicality of a shared decision-making approach for PSA screening, concerned that it is not commonly done in the busy world of office practice, or that patients would not be swayed by evidence about its pros and cons.  [5] [6] ] [7]  A network of primary care practices in the U.S. has been working to incorporate a shared decision-making process into the workflow of day-to-day primary care. A patient decision aid on PSA screening was used to facilitate the shared decision-making process at two sites. The purpose of this paper is to report the proportion of patients who wanted PSA screening after being fully informed in a standardized way about the potential benefits and risks, and to describe the relationship between how well informed men are and their leanings about PSA screening. To address concerns that clinicians might override patient preferences regarding PSA screening, we also seek to relate patients' leanings about PSA screening after viewing a decision aid before a clinician visit to their ratings of the content of the visit afterwards."

      "text": "The setting for this study was primary care practices affiliated with two health systems that successfully responded to a request for proposals for decision aid implementation projects funded by the Informed Medical Decisions Foundation. The participating health systems were Dartmouth-Hitchcock Medical Center (DHMC) and Massachusetts General Hospital (MGH). Both systems are academic medical centers, including largely fee-for-service primary care practices with long-established electronic medical record systems. Both systems have infrastructures to support distribution of decision aids including electronic prescribing, which became available at DHMC during the study. These primary care practices planned to provide decision aids, including one for PSA screening, to eligible patients facing a preference-sensitive decision.\n\nThe decision aid on PSA screening, titled \"The PSA Test: Is It Right for You?\" was developed by the Informed Medical Decisions Foundation in collaboration with Health Dialog. The version used in these practices was updated in 2010, after the publication of the two large clinical trials on PSA screening from the U.S. and Europe.  8, 9 The video portion of the program is approximately 31 minutes in duration and presents the options of deciding to have or not to have a PSA test to screen for prostate cancer and the pros and cons of each choice. The program is available as a DVD/ booklet or online with identical content in either format. The decision aid scored very highly according to the International Patient Decision Aids Standards criteria ( http://decisionaid.ohri.  ca/AZsumm.php?ID=1148-effect ) and was available to the practices in English and Spanish. In previous randomized trials, earlier versions of this program have been shown to increase viewers' knowledge about PSA testing compared with controls.  [10] [11] ] [12]  Patients were eligible to view the decision aid if they were considered candidates for screening by their clinicians and did not already have a diagnosis of prostate cancer. The decision aids could be sent before or after a scheduled visit to the practice. At DHMC, most decision aids were automatically sent to eligible men prior to a visit. A minority of decision aids was prescribed by the patient's primary care clinician at the time of a visit. These decision aids were ordered using a paper visit exit form until November 2011, when decision aid order entry through the electronic medical record became available. At MGH, clinicians prescribed the decision aid at their discretion through the electronic medical record, with the decision aid being either mailed or picked up in a central location depending on patient preference. Clinicians received quarterly reports of their own and their practice's decision aid prescribing. At both sites, patients viewed the decision aid outside the visit. Participants were asked to complete a short twopart questionnaire before and after viewing the decision aid. Subjects were provided the questionnaire along with the decision aid with a prepaid return mailer. Both sites made a follow-up call or sent a postcard reminder to return the survey 2-4 weeks after the decision aid was sent.\n\nThe first part of the questionnaire, which participants were asked to complete immediately before viewing the decision aid, assessed the user' pre-viewing leanings regarding PSA screening (leaning toward being screened, not being screened, or not sure), their readiness to decide, and their preferred role in decision making. The second part of the questionnaire, which participants were asked to complete immediately after viewing the decision aid, included these same items, an additional item asking whether the subject planned to discuss PSA testing with their clinician, five knowledge questions about PSA screening, demographics, and prior history of PSA screening. Participants were also asked how much of the program they reviewed (none, some, most, or all). The five knowledge items were developed and validated to measure the quality of PSA decisions, and were all addressed in the decision aid ( www.massgeneral.org/decisionsciences/ research/DQ_Instrument_List.aspx provides more information about the knowledge instrument and its development process). Subjects at DHMC who completed the pre-and post-viewing questionnaire and had an upcoming clinician visit were also given a second survey after their next clinician visit, with survey items covering whether PSA testing was actually discussed, clinician behaviors promoting shared decision making, clinician recommendations regarding PSA, and patient leanings after the visit. Key items from both surveys used in the analyses in this paper are provided verbatim in Table  2  and Appendix Table  1 . Answers to the knowledge questions of I am not sure or a missing answer were scored as incorrect.\n\nThe study was approved by the IRBs at both participating sites. Data were collected in 2009-2013 and analyzed in 2014. Chisquare tests were used to identify significant differences in respondent leanings by performance on the knowledge questions and differences in provider recommendations by respondent leaning. The McNemar-Bowker test for paired data was used to identify changes in respondent leanings, decision-making progress, and role preference before and after viewing a decision aid. IBM SPSS, version 21 was used for all analyses."

      "text": "A total of 1,041 participants returned a pre-and postviewing questionnaire between November 2009 and April 2013 at the two sites. The response rates to the pre-and post-viewing survey was 586/2,331 (25%) at DHMC and 455/1,564 (29%) at MGH. Table  1  provides the demographic data on the viewers. Almost half of participants were aged 50-59 years, and half had had a prior PSA test. Twenty-six percent were high school graduates or less, whereas 56% were college graduates; participants were predominantly Non-Hispanic whites. Across both sites, 14/1,041(1.3%) of participants reported reviewing none of the decision aid; 42/1,041 (4.0%) reported reviewing some; 83/1,041 (8.0%) reported reviewing most; 868/1,041 (83.4%) reported reviewing all; and 34/1,041 (3.3%) did not answer the question.\n\nThe distribution of answers to the knowledge questions after viewing the decision aid are provided in Table  2 . Answers on individual items ranged from 83% to 92% correct, and 727/1,041 (70%) respondents had all five correct.\n\nFigure  1  presents the proportion of 1,008 participants leaning toward or against PSA screening, or not sure, before and after viewing the decision aid. After viewing, there was a significant increase in the proportion of patients leaning away from PSA screening (po0.001), with 386 (38%) leaning toward PSA screening; 174 (17%) not sure; and 448 (44%) leaning away from screening. The most dramatic change in leaning occurred in the number of men who were unsure about PSA screening: 319 (32%) before viewing and 174 (17%) after viewing. Which version of the decision aid was used (the earlier version not presenting the results of the two large trials or the later version presenting the trial results) could be ascertained for 1,035/1,041 (99%) of participants. There was no significant difference in after-viewing leanings for participants who viewed the early version (n\u00bc170) versus the later version (n\u00bc839) (p\u00bc0.60).\n\nRegarding readiness to decide, the number of participants close to making a decision or already having made a decision regarding PSA screening increased from 573 (57%) before seeing the decision aid to 752 (75%) post-viewing (po0.001) The number of participants who wanted to make the PSA screening decision themselves, share the decision with their clinician, or have the clinician make the decision was 383 (38%), 586 (58%), and 39 (4%) pre-viewing, respectively; and 434 (43%), 550 (55%), and 24 (2%) post-viewing, respectively (po0.001).\n\nTable  3  relates the post-viewing knowledge scores (trichotomized as zero to three correct, four correct, and five correct) to pre-and postviewing PSA screening leaning. There was no significant relationship pre-viewing (p\u00bc0.16), but post-viewing, the relationship was significant (p\u00bc0.009), with better-informed men more likely to lean against screening and less likely to be unsure.\n\nThe response to the post-visit survey at DHMC was 278/ 586 (47%) (Table  1 ). After the office visit, participants reported that clinicians had discussed PSA screening some or a lot in 171/276 (62%) of visits (denominators vary slightly owing to item non-response). However, these clinician discussions were much more common among participants planning to discuss PSA after viewing the decision aid than among participants not planning to discuss PSA (148/217 [68%] vs 16/46 [35%], respectively [po0.001]). Participants reported that clinicians expressed an opinion about whether or not the participant should have a PSA test in 118/236 (50%) of visits where patients reported PSA was discussed at all, and 113 of these men had expressed a post-viewing leaning on their previous questionnaire. Among participants whose clinicians made a recommendation, clinician recommendations for PSA screening were significantly related to participants' postviewing leanings. Specifically, 38/49 (78%) of participants leaning toward screening said their physicians recommended screening, compared with 12/21 (57%) of participants who were unsure about screening, and 13/43 (30%) of participants leaning against screening (po0.001) (Figure  2 )."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "Among men prescribed a decision aid as part of routine care addressing PSA screening for early detection of prostate cancer, key knowledge about PSA screening was high, consistent with previous randomized trials of earlier versions of this PSA decision aid.  [10] [11] 1] [12]  Postviewing, men became less enthusiastic about PSA screening, with most of the shift occurring among men who were not sure about PSA screening beforehand leaning against PSA screening afterward. Moreover, betterinformed men, as judged by a knowledge test, were significantly more likely to be leaning against PSA screening. At one site, participants' desire to discuss PSA screening with their clinicians and their leanings for or against PSA testing were compared with their reports of the PSArelated content of subsequent office visits with their clinicians. There was a strong and significant relationship between participants' desires to discuss PSA and a PSA discussion with their clinician actually happening. When participants reported clinicians made recommendations about PSA screening, those recommendations were significantly related to participants' leanings for or against PSA screening after viewing the decision aid. To our knowledge, these data are among the first to demonstrate that viewing a decision aid before a visit can have a substantial influence on the content of the visit related to the decision aid. We do not know how this relationship is mediated. Although it is tempting to hypothesize that patients communicated their desire to discuss PSA testing and their leanings about testing, and clinicians tended to respect these communications, we cannot test this hypothesis with our data. Further research, perhaps including audiotaping of encounters, is needed to clarify how these postdecision aid but pre-visit desires and leanings affect the content of the visit. We also note that at these two sites, clinician rates of recommending PSA tests were relatively"

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "This study has a number of important limitations. First, prescribing a PSA decision aid in these two demonstration site practices was not necessarily to consecutive eligible patients. Different results might have been observed if all consecutive patients eligible for PSA testing had been prescribed a program. Second, participants in this study were predominantly white and well educated. The results may not be generalizable to less-well educated or minority men, including African Americans, who have a higher risk of prostate cancer mortality. Prior studies have suggested African American men are more likely to desire PSA tests,  13  and both African American and Hispanic men report more discussion of PSA advantages and disadvantages with their clinicians.  7 Third, the percentage of patients prescribed a decision aid who also returned a pre-and post-viewing questionnaire was relatively low at 26%. We cannot be sure of the effect of non-response bias on our results. Fourth, we asked a subset of participants about the content of subsequent clinician visits, but we could not verify their reports with audiotapes of conversations or clinician reports of the content of the visits. Finally, we asked about participants' leanings regarding PSA screening, but we did not ascertain whether or not PSA tests were actually done."
