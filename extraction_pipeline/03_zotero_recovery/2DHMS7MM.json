  "title": "The Impact of mHealth Interventions: Systematic Review of Systematic Reviews",
  "abstract": "Background: Mobile phone usage has been rapidly increasing worldwide. mHealth could efficiently deliver high-quality health care, but the evidence supporting its current effectiveness is still mixed. Objective: We performed a systematic review of systematic reviews to assess the impact or effectiveness of mobile health (mHealth) interventions in different health conditions and in the processes of health care service delivery. \n Methods: We used a common search strategy of five major scientific databases, restricting the search by publication date, language, and parameters in methodology and content. Methodological quality was evaluated using the Measurement Tool to Assess Systematic Reviews (AMSTAR) checklist. \n Results: The searches resulted in a total of 10,689 articles. Of these, 23 systematic reviews (371 studies; more than 79,665 patients) were included. Seventeen reviews included studies performed in low-and middle-income countries. The studies used diverse mHealth interventions, most frequently text messaging (short message service, SMS) applied to different purposes (reminder, alert, education, motivation, prevention). Ten reviews were rated as low quality (AMSTAR score 0-4), seven were rated as moderate quality (AMSTAR score 5-8), and six were categorized as high quality (AMSTAR score 9-11). A beneficial impact of mHealth was observed in chronic disease management, showing improvement in symptoms and peak flow variability in asthma patients, reducing hospitalizations and improving forced expiratory volume in 1 second; improving chronic pulmonary diseases symptoms; improving heart failure symptoms, reducing deaths and hospitalization; improving glycemic control in diabetes patients; improving blood pressure in hypertensive patients; and reducing weight in overweight and obese patients. Studies also showed a positive impact of SMS reminders in improving attendance rates, with a similar impact to phone call reminders at reduced cost, and improved adherence to tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus therapy in some scenarios, with evidence of decrease of viral load. \n Conclusions: Although mHealth is growing in popularity, the evidence for efficacy is still limited. In general, the methodological quality of the studies included in the systematic reviews is low. For some fields, its impact is not evident, the results are mixed, or no long-term studies exist. Exceptions include the moderate quality evidence of improvement in asthma patients, attendance rates, and increased smoking abstinence rates. Most studies were performed in high-income countries, implying that mHealth is still at an early stage of development in low-income countries.",

      "text": "Mobile phone usage has been rapidly increasing worldwide  [1, 2] . In many high-income countries, mobile phone subscriptions exceed the population, and in many low-and middle-income countries, this number is expanding faster than other infrastructures  [2] . Mobile technology's mobility, instantaneous access, and direct communication allow for faster transfer of health information, which in turn supports medical and public health practices. These characteristics define mobile health (mHealth). mHealth could transform the worldwide delivery of health services, especially in low-and middle-income countries. This includes simple apps and complex technologies including voice, text messaging (short message service, SMS), multimedia message service, Bluetooth technology, and others  [3] .\n\nmHealth is increasingly being used  (1)  for patient communication, monitoring, and education,  (2)  to reduce the burden of diseases linked with poverty, (3) to improve access to health services, clinical diagnosis, and treatment adherence, and (4) for chronic disease management  [4] [5] [6] .\n\nIt is commonly stated that mHealth effectively improves the quality of care and that it can quickly be adapted on a large scale and at low cost, but evidence regarding its effectiveness and cost-effectiveness is still lacking in different areas. As the evidence in this field is consistently growing, many systematic reviews have already been performed. A thorough review of available evidence is essential to guide clinical and health policy decisions. Consequently, complex reviews, which may assess multiple interventions, different or distinct populations, and different outcomes may adequately support health policy decision making in this context  [7] . Therefore, the objective of this study was to perform a systematic review of systematic reviews that assessed the effectiveness of mHealth interventions in different health conditions and in the processes of health care service delivery, in order to investigate for which areas there is evidence and which areas still require further studies."

Cochrane, LILACS, and IBECS were assessed by Virtual Health Library (Biblioteca Virtual em Sa\u00fade). The search was restricted to studies in humans, publication date (from January 1, 2000, up to the search data), and publication language (English, French, Spanish, Italian, and Portuguese).\n\nWe used a common search strategy and allocated relevant studies to their respective reviews before assessing their risk of bias and extracting data. The search strategies for each database are given in Multimedia Appendix 1. All studies were included in the software StArt (State of the Art through Systematic Review)  [8] . In this software, different combinations of the terms \"systematic\" and \"review\" identified systematic reviews by title or abstract.\n\nAn additional search using the same terms and parameters was performed in February 2016. The new search was more specific to make assessment manageable and was supplemented by a manual search of reference lists  [9] ."

Sensors and point-of-care diagnosis, data collection, provider-provider communication, patient-provider communication, decision support, client education, provider work planning, training, protocol-based treatment, voicemail, videos, immediate physician feedback from a central location, cloud-based interactive voice response, disease management calls, disease monitoring, automated email to clinicians, treatment adherence, and phone counseling were also used. These interventions were performed for smoking cessation, to increase physical activity, chronic disease management, chemotherapy-related symptoms monitoring, sexual health behavior safety, alcohol consumption reduction, medication adherence, appointment attendance, stress management and anxiety reduction, vaccination timeliness, prenatal support, reduction in emergency referrals or adverse events, health information access, cardiopulmonary resuscitation skills, patient satisfaction, and social functioning.\n\nHall et al  [22]  categorized 12 common applications: (1) client education and behavior change, (2) sensors and point-of-care diagnostics, (3) registries and vital events tracking, (4) data collection and reporting, (5) electronic health records, (  6 ) electronic decision support: information, protocols, algorithms, checklists,  (7)  provider-provider communication: user groups and consultation, (8) provider work planning,  (9)  provider training and education,  (10)  human resource management,  (11)  supply chain management, and (12) financial transactions and incentives.\n\nMultiple interventions were used on significantly varied targets, and the duration of follow-up varied from a few minutes to up to 24 months."

Ten were rated low quality (AMSTAR score 0-4), seven moderate quality (score 5-8), and six were high quality (score 9-11).\n\nRegarding bias risk assessment, 10 reviews did not explicitly report on study quality assessment. Two specified that the risk of bias was mostly either low or unclear  [25] . Free et al  [18, 19]  related that only 4 trials were at low risk of bias in all areas. All studies included in Car et al  [13]  had high risk of bias.\n\nBaron et al used the McMaster University quality assessment tool and reported that the overall quality was poor  [26] . Fanning et al used the Guide to Community Preventative Services data extraction form and reported that 7 studies were rated \"fair\" and 4 were \"good\"  [16] . Three reviews  [27]  used the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions  [28]  reporting varying methodological quality, with some providing insufficient information.\n\nTwo reviews reported adequate sequence generation for randomization  [20] . De Jongh et al  [17]  reported adequate sequence generation in 3 of 4 and that none of the included studies were clear if the allocation was concealed. A potential for bias occurred from the apparent lack of blinding of outcome assessors. In Vodopivec-Jamsek et al  [27] , allocation concealment was considered adequate in 2 studies and unclear in 2 studies. Only one study reported on blinding of personnel collecting and analyzing samples. No mention is made of blinding of outcome assessors or researchers, which could have introduced bias.\n\nIncomplete data analysis methods varied, with analysis and reporting based on intention-to-treat analysis and on only participants who completed the study, which could influence generalizability of the findings. Substantial heterogeneity was detected across analyses; however, a post hoc decision to conduct the main analysis using a random-effects model resulted in no difference in the interpretation of findings. Bacigalupo et al  [29]  also used Cochrane guidance  [28] , reporting that 4 of 7 studies presented low risk of bias. The only studies in which Grading of Recommendations, Assessment, Development, and Evaluation (GRADE) methodology  [30]  was used were those published in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews  [13, 15, 17, 20, 27] ."

There was no effect on the number of cancelled appointments (RR 1.08, 95% CI 0.89-1.30), and no difference in attendance using SMS reminders versus other reminders (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.94-1.02) [19] .\n\nHall et al  [22]  assessed 6 studies in low-and middle-income countries. The studies showed mHealth interventions to be beneficial, except a pilot study in rural Swaziland  [39] . Mahmud et al  [40]  trained community health workers to use mobile phones for reporting on patient adherence, send appointments reminders, and answer physician queries. This evaluation was based on a retrospective observational study, with the possibility of recall bias."

Hepatitis A and B dose vaccination XSL \u2022 FO RenderX schedules also increased among international travelers with reminders sent to mobile phones  [31] .\n\nHall et al reported improved adherence to tuberculosis treatment by using text messages and adherence to HIV therapy, with evidence of reduction of viral load  [22] , although the authors did not perform quality assessment. The authors commented that a risk-benefit analysis that assessed mHealth reminders to improve tuberculosis medication adherence showed increased mortality and disability-adjusted life years compared to directly observed treatments, and that an RCT in China observed no benefit with voice calls. They also reported limited evidence of contraceptive knowledge improvement with the use of an SMS education scheme; risk reduction of contracting dengue fever, but no significant improvement over alternative schemes; antenatal care improvement, with increases in using skilled birth attendants and women with 4 antenatal visits; and improved vaccination rates in rural Kenya  [22] .\n\nHamine et al observed in 2 studies that text messaging tailored to counteract negative beliefs about asthma and education was associated with improved adherence to medication  [34] ."

There was a reduction in patient burden to transportation time and costs in African countries  [23] .

      "text": "The current evidence shows benefits of mHealth in chronic disease management, improving symptoms and peak flow variability in asthma patients and chronic pulmonary diseases symptoms; heart failure symptoms, reducing deaths and hospitalization and improving quality of life; glycemic control in diabetes patients; and improving BP in hypertensive patients. SMS reminders improved attendance rates at reduced costs and improved adherence to tuberculosis and HIV therapy in some scenarios, with evidence of decrease of viral load.\n\nMobile devices may improve patient-provider communication, facilitating assistance in disease management. It may increase the likelihood of delivering health interventions to hard-to-reach populations. Whittaker et al  [20]  listed advantages of using mobile interventions: convenience, ease, cost-effectiveness, scalability, personalization, and \"the ability to send time-sensitive messages with an 'always on' device.\" Hamine et al  [34]  observed that mHealth tools can impact patients who are less inclined to engage with traditional health services. Aranda-Jan et al  [23]  reported that governments may benefit from increased support of patient management and increased direct communication in rural areas. Health workers may receive support through professional networks and can prioritize efforts and increase their role in active case detection using disease surveillance systems. Baron et al  [26]  assessed studies involving data transferring for diabetes management and suggested that recording and tracking of data might increase patients' motivation to self-manage.\n\nThe most popular mHealth intervention was behavior change interventions using text messaging. The low cost and low broadband requirements facilitate the spread of applications, even in low-income countries.\n\nDifferent uses of motivation have also been described as a tool to be used in mHealth interventions in some of the systematic reviews analyzed. These are mainly focused on patient motivation in different contexts on chronic diseases  [36] , communicable diseases  [23] , physical activity  [16, 29, 31] , and empowerment in the use of services  [37] .\n\nTwo reviews  [14, 32]  reported lessons learned: patient needs must be met, training and support provided, users engaged in the development and implementation of the tools, and consideration of patient age and education level. Usage might improve with user-centered design, engagement strategies, and feedback to the users.\n\nThis study provides a thorough review of available evidence on effectiveness of mHealth interventions in different health conditions and in the processes of health care service delivery, so it useful to guide clinical and health policy decisions. However, there are some limitations of the studies that need to be addressed.\n\nStudies assessing mHealth interventions usually do not include the assessment of risks, consumer satisfaction, and acceptability of the intervention  [17] . None reported studies assessing security and confidentiality. Chen et al  [41]  noted that mobile phone numbers frequently change in China, reducing certainty the message was delivered to the correct recipient. This was not assessed elsewhere. Particularly in low-income countries where mobile phones are frequently shared, these are important confidentiality issues that must be taken into account when designing interventions  [15] . De Jongh et al  [23]  warned of inaccurate data input, misinterpretation of the information, and difficulties in reading due to vision or literacy problems and remarked that text messaging cannot capture verbal and nonverbal cues. Norwell suggested that doctors agree on vocabulary to minimize the risk of patients' misunderstanding the message  [38] . Risks associated with mobile phone messaging in general may apply, such as car accidents  [23] .\n\nOther drawbacks related to mHealth initiatives were reported by Hamine et al  [34]  Some patients' concerns included dependence on professional supervision, unnecessary medicalization, fear of technology failure, and difficulty in understanding and using the technology. Provider concerns related to data review and response times, increased clinical workload and workflow, record maintenance, and concerns about supervision and technology dependence. Aranda-Jan et al  [23]  reported difficulties in monitoring text message content, data underreporting, and the possibility of biased responses from participants.\n\nTwo reviews cite availability and poor connectivity as barriers  [34] . Most identified the main limitation as the small number of RCT studies, patients enrolled, and the low-to-moderate quality of evidence. Researchers should validate their pilot study findings through follow-up studies with adequate research designs and appropriate controls  [17] . Aranda-Jan et al  [23]  mention that claimed benefits are unclear and long-term results uncertain. Also, only 2 reviews assessed funding  [15] . This is important to identifying conflicts of interest. To improve the suboptimal reporting and standardize Web-based and mobile health interventions, the CONSORT-EHEALTH was developed, a checklist that is an extension of the CONSORT statement  [42] .\n\nCosts have not been routinely assessed. Such costs may be dependent on the nature of the intervention and the size and characteristics of the target group  [17] . More attention to cost implications seems warranted  [27] . Additionally, future studies should compare effects in different contexts  [27] ."

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "Although mHealth is growing in popularity, the evidence for efficacy is still limited. Positive results were reported for chronic disease management, improving chronic pulmonary diseases symptoms and heart failure symptoms, reducing deaths and hospitalization and improving quality of life, and improving glycemic control in diabetes patients and BP in hypertensive patients. SMS reminders improved attendance rates and improved adherence to tuberculosis and HIV therapy in some scenarios. However, in general the methodological quality of the studies included in the systematic reviews is low. For some fields, its impact is not evident or is mixed. Exceptions are the moderate improvement in asthma patients, attendance rates, and smoking cessation rates."
