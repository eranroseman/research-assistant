  "abstract": "Objective. To conduct a retrospective analysis of sequential cross-sectional data of opioid prescribing practices in patients with no prior history of opioid use. Methods. Individuals filling an oral opioid prescription who had 1 year of prior observation were identified from four different administrative claims databases for the period between January 1, 2002, and December 31, 2018: IBM MarketScan V R Commercial Database (CCAE), Multi-State Medicaid Database (MDCD), Medicare Supplemental Database (MDCR), and OptumV C De-IdentifiedClinformatics V R Data Mart Database. Outcomes included incidence of new opioid use and characteristics of patients' first opioid prescription, including dispensed morphine milligram equivalent (MME) per day, total MME dispensed, total MME !300, and days' supply of prescription for 3 or !30 days. Results. There were 40,600,696 new opioid users identified. The incidence of new opioid use in the past 17 years ranged from 6% to 11% within the two commercially insured databases. Incidence decreased over time in MDCD and was consistently higher in MDCR. Total MME dispensed decreased in MDCD and increased in CCAE, with no major changes in the other databases. The proportion of patients receiving !30-day prescriptions decreased and the proportion of patients receiving 3-day prescriptions increased in MDCD, while !30-day prescriptions in the Optum database dramatically increased (low of 3.0% in 2003 to peak of 16.9% in 2017). Conclusions. Opioid prescribing practices varied across different populations of insured individuals during the past 17 years. The most substantial changes in opioid prescriptions over time have occurred in MDCD, with reductions in use across multiple metrics.",

      "text": "Opioid prescriptions and nonmedical opioid use saw a dramatic increase during the 1990s and into the new millennium, which was soon followed by a dramatic increase in the rates of opioid-involved overdose and death  [1] [2] [3] [4] . The risk of opioid-related overdose and death is a complex, multifactorial problem, including associations with dose  [5] [6] [7] [8] , and the duration of opioid exposure is an important risk factor for opioid use disorder  [9] . The latest guidelines for chronic pain management published by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend caution when increasing the dose of opioids to 50 morphine milligram equivalents (MME) and advise that a dose of 90 MME or greater per day should be avoided  [10] . The guidelines also suggest that care be taken when determining the duration of opioid therapy, noting that three days will typically be sufficient for acute pain, and more than seven days is rarely needed.\n\nWith the increase in opioid abuse and deaths due to overdose in recent decades  [11] [12] [13] [14] , various efforts have been taken to deal with the crisis. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the extended-release and long-acting Opioid Analgesics Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) in 2012 in a national effort to educate prescribers and patients on appropriate opioid use. The REMS program was later expanded in 2018 to include immediate-release and short-acting opioid analgesics  [15, 16] . Additional work has been undertaken to understand the risk and risk factors for substance use disorders, overdose, and death associated with chronic opioid use through observational and prospective randomized studies; these studies are part of a postmarketing requirement for companies with New Drug Application approvals to manufacture and sell extendedrelease and long-acting opioids  [17] , which aims to add to a significant amount of existing research on the subject  [18] [19] [20] [21] . Furthermore, legislation has been adopted at the state  [22]  and federal levels  [23, 24]  as a means to curb opioid abuse, misuse, and overdose through mandatory training for prescribers, education initiatives for patients and families, and addiction treatment programs, among other methods.\n\nCharacterizing the prescribing practices for opioid medications is vital to understanding how behaviors are changing as more efforts are made to address the opioid epidemic. This characterization should be comprehensive, not only in terms of duration of exposure but also in terms of amount of drug dispensed (e.g., total MME), daily dose, quantity (e.g., number of pills) of drug dispensed, and the proportion of patients receiving opioids. For example, measures of daily dose or daily MME rely on a specification of days' supply by the pharmacies. These measures can be subjective and could change over time, as they may or may not reflect actual patient behavior. The present study identified patients newly prescribed an opioid over a 17-year period and characterized those prescriptions in terms of quantity dispensed, days' supply, daily dose, total amount of opioid dispensed, and duration of dispensing."

      "text": "The analysis was executed by using four United Statesbased administrative claims databases. Each database contains data from adjudicated health insurance claims (e.g., inpatient, outpatient/emergency department, and outpatient pharmacy) and health plan enrollment information. Databases cover various insured populations, including commercially insured individuals, Medicare patients, and Medicaid patients. This study included data from January 1, 2001, through December 31, 2018, with the exception of the Medicaid database, which includes data from January 1, 2006, through June 30, 2018. Briefly, the four databases included in this study were:\n\n1. IBM MarketScan V R Commercial Database (CCAE): Includes data from 142 million individuals enrolled in employer-sponsored insurance health plans. 2. IBM MarketScan V R Multi-State Medicaid Database (MDCD): A claims database for 26 million Medicaid enrollees from multiple states. Individuals qualified for Medicaid coverage primarily include low-income families, qualified pregnant women and children, and individuals receiving Supplemental Security Income [25]. 3. IBM MarketScan V R Medicare Supplemental Database (MDCR):\n\nIncludes data for more than nine million retirees with primary or Medicare supplemental coverage through privately insured feefor-service, point-of-service, or capitated health plans. 4. Optum'sDe-IdentifiedClinformatics V R Data Mart Database.\n\nIncludes 84 million members with private health insurance, who are fully insured in commercial, employer-sponsored plans, or in Medicare Advantage Prescription Drug coverage. The population is representative of U.S. commercial claims patients (0-65 years old) and some Medicare patients (!65 years old).\n\nData elements included outpatient pharmacy dispensing claims (coded with National Drug Codes), which provide information on what medication was dispensed, the quantity of drug dispensed, and the days' supply of the prescription. Inpatient and outpatient medical claims, which provide diagnosis codes (coded in the International Classification of Diseases, Clinical Modification, 9th or 10th revisions) associated with a visit, were used to characterize the comorbidities of our study sample. To allow for a 12-month clean period of no prior opioid use, opioid prescriptions were captured at least 1 year after the earliest date of available data noted above.\n\nThe use of the IBM MarketScan and Optum claims databases was reviewed by the New England Institutional Review Board (IRB) and was determined to be exempt from broad IRB approval, as this research project did not involve human subjects research."

Patients must have had no prescription filled for an opioid any time before the index date in the database and continuous health plan enrollment during the 12 months preceding the index date. Opioids were limited to oral tablets and capsules because these forms have more clear prescribing data with regard to quantity and days' supply, which were needed to calculate many of the outcomes of interest.

The total MME dispensed in a prescription is calculated as the quantity of pills dispensed in the prescription multiplied by the strength in milligrams of the opioid ingredient multiplied by the MME conversion factor. The MME conversion factors were obtained from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  [26]  and are found in the Supplementary Data.\n\nAn example of an MME calculation follows: a prescription for oxycodone with a 30-day supply with 60 pills and a 5-mg strength would have a total MME dispensed of 60 pills \u00c2 5 mg/pill \u00c2 1.5 MME conversion factor \u00bc 450 MME. Daily MME received uses the same formula divided by the days' supply of the prescription. The daily MME in this example would be 450 MME \u00c4 30 days \u00bc 15 MME/day."

There was increased variability among patients in MDCR but no clear trend in either direction.\n\nAmong patients who received an opioid, the mean MME received per day has been fairly stable over time, remaining around the mid-30s to 40 MME per day (Figure  2 )."

      "text": "Next, the total MME dispensed in the first prescription of opioids received was examined to understand exactly how much opioid is being prescribed rather than relying on averages over time (Figure  3 ). Patients in MDCD went from having one of the highest MME dispensed across any group at any time (450 MME in 2007) to having the lowest amount dispensed in 2018 after a consistent 5-year decline (213 MME in 2018), a 53% decrease. A similar trend was noticed recently for patients in MDCR, where total MME fell the last 4 years of observation to 313 MME in 2018, a 33% reduction from its peak. Conversely, patients in Optum had a steady increase in total MME dispensed for the first opioid prescription from 2002 to 2017 (205 to 370 MME, an 80% uptick) before dropping 21% in 2018 (294 MME). Opioid dispensed for patients in CCAE had a 39% increase from 2007 through 2016 (214 to 298 MME) but declined in 2017 and 2018 to levels comparable to the early part of the millennium.\n\nSimilar trends are seen when examining the proportion of patients receiving prescriptions of 300 total MME (representing 2 times the median MME dose observed in each of the databases), as shown by the bars in Figure  3 . The proportion of patients receiving prescriptions containing these large amounts of opioid has decreased for Medicaid patients but not for any other group."

Prescriptions for 30 days or longer did not clearly increase or decrease over the observation period for patients in the CCAE and MDCR databases, which saw fluctuations year-over-year but generally remained flat. For patients in the Optum database, receipt of opioids with a supply of 30 days or more went from being an uncommon practice in 2002 (3.2%\n\nof opioid prescriptions) to accounting for one in six prescriptions received by new opioid users in 2017 (16.9%), a more than five-fold increase. This was mirrored by a steady decrease in the share of short-term opioid prescriptions over time. For all groups, except that from the Optum database, there has been a clear increase in the proportion of new opioid prescriptions that are for 3 days or fewer in recent years."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "This study used various metrics to assess a diverse population of individuals to obtain a comprehensive view of opioid dispensings in patients receiving opioids for the first time. The most substantial changes in opioid prescriptions over time have occurred in patients in MDCD. Fewer subjects were exposed to opioids for the first time, the total MME and the daily MME have decreased, and the proportion of subjects receiving at least 300 MME in the first prescription has decreased, as has the proportion of subjects receiving prescriptions for !30 days. The average total dispensed MME in the MDCD population has gone from one of the highest observable peaks across all populations to the lowest level observed in 2018, the result of a constant 5-year decrease. This decrease in opioid use in patients receiving Medicaid may be due to the large number of opioid policies that have been enacted across states for Medicaid programs. A recent overview of opioid policies enacted in the United States from 2016 to 2018 found that 20% are specific to Medicaid  [29] .\n\nThe trends for new opioid use and daily MME dispensed have remained relatively flat in the past decade across other databases. Initially, it was expected that patterns would be similar in the two databases that are composed primarily of commercially insured individuals: Optum and CCAE. However, the Optum database includes individuals who are 65 years of age and older, which appears to have impacted the results. For the Optum database, which represents a mix of commercially insured and Medicare-eligible patients, there was a declining incidence of new opioid use through 2016; however, that reversed in the last 2 years of observation. There was also a noticeable increase in total MME being dispensed, indicating more or stronger medications being prescribed over time, and an increase in prevalence of long-term opioid prescriptions, which went from being a relatively rare practice to much more frequent. These trends may reflect an aging population in the Optum database; of the patients new to opioids, those who were 65 years of age or older accounted for 10% of the population in 2002 but rose to 25% in 2018.\n\n205 201 214 256 238 237 254 266 295 301 324 320 317 330 315 370 294 14.1 13.6 14.8 19.4 18.6 19 19.9 20.6 22.9 23.4 24.7 25 25.6 27.5 26.1 30.7 23 0 100 200 300 400 500 0 25 50 75 100 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 Mean total MME dispensed (line) A Optum 231 221 241 235 214 222 216 229 253 274 263 301 291 298 249 238 217 16 15.2 16.6 16.6 16.2 17.2 16.5 17.2 18.9 20.7 20.2 21.1 22 22 19.6 18.2 14.9 0 100 200 300 400 500 0 25 50 75 100 2002 2004 2006 2008 2010 2012 2014 2016 2018 Year Mean total MME dispensed (line) C CCAE 450 318 287 321 275 322 415 315 293 262 229 213 31.9 23.8 20.9 21.8 20 23.2 27.5 21 22.5 18.9 16.2 13.9 0 100 200 300 400 500 0 25 50 75 100 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 2019 Proportion w/ total MME \u2265 300 (bars) B MDCD 335 348 275 325 317 295 301 313 333 371 387 352 464 420 413 369 313 30.9 31.6 25.9 31.3 29.8 28.5 29.6 29.6 31.2 34 36.9 33.3 35.4 37 33.6 34.6 28.9\n\nPatients in the MDCR database saw a steady decrease in total MME dispensed over the last few years of observation, but they still received the highest MME in 2018 as compared with the other databases. The high drug dose and consistently higher prevalence of long-term prescriptions in the MDCR population may be due to chronic and serious pain conditions (e.g., cancer) that are more prevalent in this population than in the other, relatively younger, groups. Additionally, total MME dispensed, MME per day, and prevalence of long-term prescriptions all saw decreases in 2018 as compared with recent previous years, a trend that was observed in all databases.\n\nThere have been limited data on the amount of opioid being prescribed to new opioid users and how this behavior has changed over time. A recent comprehensive analysis using retail pharmacy data across the United States examined trends in opioid use overall  [30] , but it is lacking information specific to individuals who are new opioid users. Data for these patients can inform our expectations about what to expect in the future with regard to opioid use and downstream effects, such as overdose and death.\n\nA recently published study focused on trends of new opioid use within a commercially insured population during the period from 2012 to 2017, but dosing trends were based only on MME per day and ignored potential important trends in total MME dispensed  [31] . Additionally, the larger observation period used in our study is crucial to understand how current trends compare with more historical data.\n\nOur study did not perform any statistical testing. The objective of this study was to describe the trends that have been observed over the past 17 years. In some cases, these trends are described in terms of the most recent few years, in other cases the past decade is described, and in others it is the entire observation period. There was no specific hypothesis tested over one static, a priori defined time period, but instead a more dynamic approach was taken by letting the data tell the story about how opioid use has varied over time.\n\nRelying on daily MME dispensed has limitations because it relies on the number of days of supply specified on the prescription claims. For a drug that is prescribed pro re nata (PRN) (i.e., to be taken \"as needed\"), the days' supply may have limited value and in fact can obscure important information about the amount of drug being dispensed. For example, consider a case in which a physician prescribes 28 tablets of 5 mg oxycodone for pain due to a fracture and instructs the patient to take one pill as needed every 4 to 6 hours. Determining the days' supply on the basis of 4-hour intervals will result in\n\n42.7%42.4% 41.1% 38.0% 38.8% 39.6% 38.7%38.5% 37.2% 36.3%36.1% 35.1% 34.0% 32.4% 33.6% 32.1% 35.2% 3.2% 3.0% 3.4% 6.1% 5.5% 5.6% 6.1% 6.6% 8.3% 8.8% 9.8% 10.4%10.9% 12.3% 11.6% 16.9% 12.9% 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 Proportion of patients A Optum 41.9% 46.3% 45.3%45.2%45.4%45.2%44.8% 44.2% 42.4% 41.4%40.8%40.9% 38.6%39.3% 40.8% 42.7% 47.1% 5.0% 4.3% 4.8% 4.6% 4.1% 4.8% 4.8% 5.3% 5.8% 7.1% 6.9% 6.1% 7.6% 7.0% 5.9% 5.5% 5.2% 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 Year Proportion of patients C CCAE 34.9% 39.0%38.4%38.8% 41.0% 37.3% 35.6% 39.1% 40.5% 42.8% 43.8%43.2% 17.0% 11.3%11.6%11.4% 9.3% 11.5% 15.6% 9.6% 13.7% 9.2% 7.6% 6.3% 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 Proportion of patients B MDCD 23.2% 27.4% 26.5% 27.8% 28.7% 27.5%28.2% 26.5% 25.2% 24.1% 25.7%25.0% 24.1% 26.4%26.3% 30.1% 32.0% 14.9% 10.7% 13.3% 12.4% 11.2% 12.5% 11.7% 14.0% 16.2% 18.1% 15.3%15.8% 18.6% 14.4% 16.4% 12.2%11.8% 0.0 0.2 0.4 0.6 0.8 2003 2005 2007 2009 2011 2013 2015 2017 Year Proportion of patients D MDCR\n\na calculated 5-day supply (28 mg per day), whereas if it determined according to 6-hour intervals, it will be considered a 7-day supply (20 mg per day). This equates to a nearly 30% reduction in the daily MME, even though the actual amount of opioid dispensed has remained the same. Moreover, this assumes that physicians are being consistent in the prescribed time intervals; if doctors have lengthened those time intervals in recent years-for example, by specifying the same prescription to be taken every 6 to 8 hours instead of 4 to 6 hours-this would result in decreases in daily MME prescribing, while total MME would not change. Our study expands on previous research by examining total MME dispensed in addition to the daily MME. Instead of relying on any single measure, our study analyzed multiple characteristics of opioid use to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of current and past prescribing practices. By looking at overall incidence of new opioid use, we were able to frame the overall picture. Examining daily MME allowed us to understand the average amount of opioid being taken per day if patients take their medication as prescribed. Studying the total MME dispensed allowed us to see how much drug is actually being dispensed and in the hands of patients. Finally, by examining the length of prescriptions, we were able to assess changes in the initial amount of time patients are prescribed their opioid medication.\n\nThere are limitations to this study. Claims data include information on medication dispensed (i.e., received by the patient), but it is unknown whether the medication was consumed. Each of these databases captures claims paid by a third party, so any prescriptions paid for in cash without proof of insurance are not captured; however, this appears to be a relatively uncommon practice with opioids as compared with other types of medications  [32] . Patients were considered new users according to the first observed fill for an opioid prescription in the database, with at least 12 months of prior observation to create a clean period; however, patients may have had prior opioid use further in the past, either before the study period start date or while being covered by a different insurance plan, and thus may not have been na\u0131 \u00a8ve to opioids during their entire lifetime.\n\nThe analysis is limited to oral tablets and capsules; this decision was made to capture the most accurate information with regard to quantity and days' supply, which may have less accuracy and more subjectivity in formulations such as liquids, topical creams, patches, and other applications  [33, 34] . It is not possible to capture pain severity measures, such as from patient reported outcomes, from the claims data; thus, we were unable to determine whether any changes in opioid prescribing behaviors were due to changes in pain severity within opioid users over time. The calculations involving MME relied on the quantity of drug dispensed, among other variables. Records containing any improbable values were removed, but it is possible there were claims included for which information about the quantity of drug dispensed was inaccurate, leading to a mismeasurement of MME. This study examined only the first prescription fill for opioids and did not examine refill patterns or subsequent opioid use after the first prescription."

When trends of opioid use are considered over time, it is important to evaluate different metrics of opioid prescriptions, including the number of individuals receiving an opioid, how much drug is being dispensed overall, and how much drug to be taken per day is being prescribed."
