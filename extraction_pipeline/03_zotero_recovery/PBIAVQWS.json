  "title": "The effectiveness of short mobile phone text message reminders compared to usual care on medication adherence in patients with hypertension: a systematic review protocol",
  "abstract": "Background Poor adherence to long-term medication increases the risk of morbidity and mortality and decreases the quality of life of patients with hypertension. One strategy to improve treatment adherence is to use a short text message reminder. Although evidence indicates that such programs increase medication adherence, the extent of their effectiveness and translation into clinical practice needs to be better documented. Our systematic review will collect and analyze the available evidence for clinical practice implementation. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of short mobile phone text message reminders versus usual/standard care for medication adherence in patients with hypertension. Methods This review will include and summarize evidence from randomized controlled trials. Adults (age > 18 years) with hypertension. The comparator group received either the usual care or standard care. It encompasses standard medical care for patients not participating in a structured and supervised intervention program such as a telemedicine program. We will include studies that assess the effectiveness of short mobile phone text message reminders in improving medication adherence in patients with hypertension compared to usual care. We will search the following databases: PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, SCOPUS, Web of Science, Cochrane Library Central Register of Controlled Trials, and Cochrane Library. We will include studies published in English. Furthermore, we will consider studies published from the inception of the database until April 20, 2024. At least two reviewers will independently conduct study selection, data extraction, and quality assessment. A third reviewer will determine and resolve discrepancies. We will conduct a quality assessment using the ROBIS 2 critical appraisal checklist. At least two independent reviewers will crosscheck the data synthesis. \n Discussion We expect this review to provide current evidence for future studies and clinical practice concerning the impact of mobile phone text message reminders on medication adherence issues.",

      "text": "Hypertension is a significant cause of cardiovascular disease and death worldwide, especially in low-income and middle-income countries  [1] . An estimated 10% of global healthcare spending is directly related to increased blood pressure and its associated complications, including ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and stroke  [2] . Control of hypertension reduces mortality and disability and is highly cost-effective or cost-saving in most settings  [3] . Elevated systolic blood pressure is the leading cause of disability-adjusted life-years globally and in the Americas. Moreover, over 50% of ischemic heart disease events and strokes are attributable to high blood pressure  [4] . The treatment of hypertension is also been shown to be highly cost-effective  [5] .\n\nPoor adherence was the most common cause of resistant hypertension. Inadequate adherence to antihypertensive medication results in poorly controlled blood pressure and an increased risk of coronary and cerebrovascular events  [6] . Missed appointments for the collection of medicines and challenges associated with lifelong treatment are among the significant reasons for suboptimal adherence  [7] . Emerging technologies can be employed in interventions to improve adherence and reduce morbidity and mortality caused by poorly controlled hypertension  [8] . Telemedicine allows clinicians to expand their reach by using technology to take care of patients who otherwise may not be seen  [9] [10] [11] . Telemedicine presents an opportunity to increase medication adherence rates using electronic reminder systems  [12] . They are an aid, particularly for patients suffering from forgetfulness problems and those who are unintentionally nonadherent. One example of telemedicine is a short mobile phone text message reminder system, which automatically sends reminder messages to a patient's mobile phone in text messaging accessible on every mobile phone  [13] .\n\nAdherence support delivered via short message system text messages can improve treatment adherence and health outcomes  [14] . Text messaging is easy to use, widely accessible, and cost-effective. Moreover, it serves as a suitable intervention for various health behavior changes  [15] . Hence, mobile phone-based interventions are of particular interest because of their due to low cost and the potential for widespread delivery. However, no systematic review has specifically examined the effects of mobile phone text message interventions on adherence to antihypertensive medications. Therefore, the present review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effect of mobile phone text message interventions on medication adherence among patients with hypertension and to provide applicable evidence for clinical practice.\n\nA preliminary search of PROSPERO, MEDLINE, the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, and JBI Evidence Synthesis was conducted. Unfortunately, no current or in-progress systematic reviews on the topic were identified."

Finally, sensitivity analyses will be conducted to test the decisions made regarding the effectiveness of an intervention on the outcome of the study.

By conducting a systematic review, our research team ensures a comprehensive and thorough examination of the available literature. This approach allows for the synthesis of multiple studies, providing a more robust and generalizable conclusion about the effectiveness of mobile phone text message reminders on medication adherence in hypertension patients. It contributes to the generation of evidencebased recommendations that can inform clinical practice and healthcare policy.\n\nHowever, this review has some limitations.
