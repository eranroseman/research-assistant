  "title": "Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards for Interventions That Use Artificial Intelligence (CHEERS-AI)",
  "abstract": "Objectives: Economic evaluations (EEs) are commonly used by decision makers to understand the value of health interventions. The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS 2022) provide reporting guidelines for EEs. Healthcare systems will increasingly see new interventions that use artificial intelligence (AI) to perform their function. We developed Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards for Interventions that use AI (CHEERS-AI) to ensure EEs of AI-based health interventions are reported in a transparent and reproducible manner. Methods: Potential CHEERS-AI reporting items were informed by 2 published systematic literature reviews of EEs and a contemporary update. A Delphi study was conducted using 3 survey rounds to elicit multidisciplinary expert views on 26 potential items, through a 9-point Likert rating scale and qualitative comments. An online consensus meeting was held to finalize outstanding reporting items. A digital health patient group reviewed the final checklist from a patient perspective. Results: A total of 58 participants responded to survey round 1, 42, and 31 of whom responded to rounds 2 and 3, respectively. Nine participants joined the consensus meeting. Ultimately, 38 reporting items were included in CHEERS-AI. They comprised the 28 original CHEERS 2022 items, plus 10 new AI-specific reporting items. Additionally, 8 of the original CHEERS 2022 items were elaborated on to ensure AI-specific nuance is reported. Conclusions: CHEERS-AI should be used when reporting an EE of an intervention that uses AI to perform its function. CHEERS-AI will help decision makers and reviewers to understand important AI-specific details of an intervention, and any implications for the EE methods used and cost-effectiveness conclusions.",

Costeffectiveness estimates are typically informed by an economic evaluation (EE), conducted alongside a clinical study or using a decision model, and indicate the likely economic value of an intervention compared with the most appropriate comparator(s). The Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards (CHEERS 2022) provide researchers with a framework for reporting EEs.  1  By reporting their EE using the CHEERS 2022 checklist, authors should provide at least a minimum standard of transparency and reproducibility.\n\nThe use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is an area of rapid development, with an increasing number of AI-enabled healthcare technologies reaching late stage development and achieving market authorization as medical devices.  2"

      "text": "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in healthcare is expanding rapidly. New health interventions that use AI to perform their functions are increasingly expected to be developed. To date, the reporting of economic evaluations (EEs) of AIbased health interventions appears to lack important details regarding the AI nature of the intervention and potential implications for costeffectiveness results.\n\nThe Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards for Interventions that use AI (CHEERS-AI) checklist is intended to standardize reporting of EEs of health technologies that use AI. Developed using a Delphi study, it contains 38 reporting items in total. It comprises the original 28 CHEERS-2022 checklist items with 8 elaborations to draw out potential AI-related nuances, plus 10 new AIspecific items that extend upon CHEERS-2022.\n\nThe CHEERS-AI checklist will ensure that important details relating to the AI nature of the intervention and implications for the analysis are reported in a transparent and reproducible way. CHEERS-AI will also support the interpretation and comparison of such studies by reviewers and decision makers. It will raise the standard of EEs reporting for AI technologies as their presence in healthcare proliferates.\n\nthat perform tasks normally associated with human intelligence.  3 ecision-making organizations are likely to increasingly be presented with health interventions that use AI systems, such as recent examples to analyze chest X-rays  4  and assist radiotherapy treatment planning.  5 This is reflected by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence recently updating its framework for digital health technologies to include evidence standards for AIbased technologies.  3 Given that AI-driven capabilities are often complex and may affect the cost-effectiveness of the intervention, it is important that the methods used to evaluate AI-based interventions are clearly reported.\n\nA systematic review of EEs of AI-based interventions,  6  and a recent update of the review,  7  both concluded that advancements in AI appear to be accelerating quicker than the practices of EE. There appears to be notable reporting gaps in published EEs, such as how the AI intervention works, including its role in and influence on care pathways. These are likely to be different to commonly evaluated health technologies, such as medicines. We considered that an extension to CHEERS 2022 for the evaluation of AI-based interventions may be warranted to ensure that key information about the AI component(s) and implications for the EE are adequately reported.\n\nThis study reports the development of the Consolidated Health Economic Evaluation Reporting Standards for Interventions that use AI (CHEERS-AI) reporting guideline extension. CHEERS-AI is intended to extend the original CHEERS statement, by drawing out important nuances relating to AI that might otherwise be missed and introducing new AI-specific reporting items in situations which are appropriate. The key intended audience for CHEERS-AI is likely to be health economists who are reporting an EE of an AIbased intervention. Additionally, healthcare decision makers (and the HTA agencies that support them), journal editors, and peer reviewers may find that CHEERS-AI provides useful AI-specific review criteria when assessing the suitability of a published EE.\n\nThis study has been supported by Next-Generation HTA (HTx), which is a Horizon 2020 project supported by the European Union, lasting for 5 years from January 2019 onward."

The 119 identified stakeholders were invited by email to participate in a three-round survey process and encouraged to share the invitation with their networks. The Delphi method was administered between May 2023 and September 2023. The response time was 3 weeks for survey rounds 1 and 2, and 2 weeks for survey round 3. Two reminders were sent before each round closed.\n\nParticipants were asked to score the importance of each candidate item on a 9-point Likert scale, from 1 (not important) to 9 (very important). For each item, respondents could provide qualitative comments about the proposed text and description, such as suggestions to improve the wording or merge items. After each survey round, the steering group convened and discussed the quantitative and qualitative findings. The group implemented minor wording changes, and more substantial changes such as merging items, in which they were considered sensible without altering the intended meaning of the proposed items.\n\nConsistent with the CHEERS 2022 Delphi study,  1, 11, 15, 16  items with 70% of expert ratings below 7 in survey round 1 were excluded. Items with a mean score of 7 or higher after round 2 were included, and items with a mean score of 4 or less were excluded. Remaining items, with mean scores higher than 4 but less than 7, proceeded to round 3. After round 3, the steering group would include items that scored 5 or higher, except any that received multiple conflicting qualitative comments. Any such items would be discussed during a consensus meeting with a subgroup of Delphi participants. The steering group would make the final decision about them."

One major change was recommended by participant to exclude an extension item because an existing CHEERS 2022 item (#16) was considered to be sufficient. However, this recommendation was in conflict with the quantitative results from round 3. Therefore, the item proceeded for further steering group deliberation to find a resolution. As a compromise, the item was reclassified as an elaboration on CHEERS 2022 item 16 and reworded to improve its specificity.\n\nThe EURORDIS Digital Advisory Group of 13 patient advocates provided positive feedback about the completeness and convenience of the CHEERS-AI reporting items.

Biases may include, for example, the AI intervention being developed using a training data set that is not representative of the population of interest. AI indicates artificial intelligence; IMDRF, International Medical Device Regulators Forum; NICE, National Institute for Health and Care Excellence; SaMD, Software as a Medical Device. (item 7 elaboration, items AI 1 and AI 6). Some participants suggested that several CHEERS-AI items could apply more broadly to EEs of diagnostic technologies with or without AI, perhaps reflecting that AI in healthcare is currently dominated by diagnostic interventions, rather than therapeutics. Second, participants explained that CHEERS-AI can help to clarify costs associated with AI-based interventions (item 14 elaboration), clearly indicating when they are exploratory (eg, Van Leeuwen et al 24 and Gomez et al 27 ) or not captured (eg, Szymanski et al 28 ) because it is unlikely that predictive algorithms underpinning such interventions will be free to use in practice. The use of such interventions may incur one-off or recurring acquisition costs and significant implementation costs for healthcare providers if they cause disruption to care pathways. Furthermore, the potential for AI health interventions to learn from data over time and become more effective has not been observed to date, and our pilot exercise-conducted to stress test the CHEERS-AI checklist in the way it might be applied by reviewers-identified no EEs that\n\nreported on this. Indeed, a total of 5 items were found to be inadequately or not reported by EEs in our pilot exercise, and we believe this further demonstrates the need for CHEERS-AI to improve the reporting of such studies. In the context of AI interventions learning over time, items AI 3 (\"Measurement of AI learning over time\") and AI 8 (\"Modeling of AI learning over time\") are likely to be enabling CHEERS-AI to accommodate future advances in AI health technologies. In the meantime, version control, including how often adaptive algorithms are updated and whether those updates are included in the purchase cost of the AI intervention, remains an important reporting consideration. The development of CHEERS-AI had a few noteworthy limitations. First, similar to any consensus-generation process, it was limited by the expertise of the participants involved. Our Delphi group (n = 58) was smaller than some Delphi studies of AI reporting, such as CONSORT-AI (n = 103),  9  but bigger than others, including the comparable extension to CHEERS 2022 for value of information analysis (CHEERS-VOI) (n = 30).  29 Our steering group The data used to develop the intervention's AI component may be referred to as its \"training\" data set. This may differ from the study population that was used to examine the beneficial impact of the intervention compared with alternative options (eg, clinical trials to evaluate efficacy or diagnostic studies to evaluate predictive accuracy)."

However, it remains possible that experts with valuable complementary insights may not have been reached. Second, when reviewing the results of survey round 1, it became clear that many high scores-indicating that items should be included in CHEERS-AI-were accompanied by less-positive qualitative comments, suggesting that the items were broadly important but were not necessarily specific to AI interventions or were already captured by CHEERS 2022. This misunderstanding was rectified in survey round 2, in which participants were clearly advised that high scores should be reserved for items that were considered important to report in an EE of an AI-based intervention and may not be captured by CHEERS 2022. Furthermore, although the checklist has a dual purpose of being used by both authors and reviewers of EEs, it was piloted only in the latter context of reviewing the reporting of published evaluations, rather than guiding the reporting of a primary EE study. Because CHEERS 2022 is now often used by systematic reviewers to grade the reporting quality of identified EE studies, this can be a beneficial secondary purpose of CHEERS-AI. Finally, although some CHEERS-AI items are likely to be 'future-proofing' the reporting standards against future developments of AI in healthcare, the authors recognize that this is a rapidly evolving field. We consider that major developments should be monitored and, if needed, CHEERS-AI may need to be amended or expanded over time."

The development of a reporting extension that supplements CHEERS 2022, to guide the reporting and reviewing of EEs of AI-enabled health interventions (CHEERS-AI), represents an important addition to the tools available to support the conduct of such evaluations. CHEERS-AI contains all pre-existing CHEERS 2022 items, including 8 elaborations to draw out important AI-specific nuances, and 10 entirely new reporting items. The use of CHEERS-AI will ensure that important AI-specific details about the intervention and their potential implications for cost-effectiveness conclusions are appropriately reported and described. We recommend that CHEERS-AI is used by researchers, editors, and reviewers conducting or assessing such EEs for dissemination or HTA purposes.\n\nlike to thank Harry Topps and Emma Flood for their support in developing the surveys for this study.
