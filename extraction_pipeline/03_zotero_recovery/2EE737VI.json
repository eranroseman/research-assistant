  "title": "The Prevalence, Pathophysiological Role and Determinants of Mitral Annular Disjunction Among Patients with Mitral Valve Prolapse: A Systematic Review",
  "abstract": "Background: Over the last two decades, a number of imaging studies have evaluated the characteristics and clinical implications of mitral annular disjunction (MAD) among patients with mitral valve prolapse (MVP). The present systematic review has been primarily designed to summarize the main findings of these studies and to examine the overall impact of MAD in MVP patients. Methods: All imaging studies assessing the prevalence, pathophysiological role and determinants of MAD in MVP individuals, selected from the PubMed and EMBASE databases, were included. There was no limitation in terms of time period. The risk of bias was assessed by using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) Quality Assessment Tool for Observational Cohort and Cross-Sectional Studies. Results: The full texts of 23 studies on 7718 MVP individuals were analyzed. The overall pooled prevalence of MAD in MVP individuals was 40% (range 5.4-90%). When considering the different imaging modalities for assessing MAD, the average MAD prevalence was 20% for cardiac computed tomography studies, 31.3% for transthoracic echocardiography (TTE) studies, 44.7% for transesophageal echocardiography studies and 47% for cardiac magnetic resonance studies. MAD presence was more commonly associated with female sex, young age, narrow antero-posterior thoracic diameter, symptoms of palpitations and syncope, T-wave inversion in inferolateral leads and frequent and/or complex ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) on electrocardiogram, myxomatous leaflets, bileaflet prolapse, larger mitral valve annulus and non-severe mitral regurgitation on TTE. A total of 12 studies (52.2%) provided follow-up data. Over a median follow-up time of 3.9 yrs (range 1-10.3 yrs), MVP individuals with MAD showed increased risk of clinical arrhythmic events, no difference in survival rate and good surgical outcomes. Conclusions: MAD was present in more than one-third of MVP patients, with a wide range of variability depending on the specific imaging method used for assessing MAD presence and on a nonunivocal MAD definition, with a possible overestimation due to Pseudo-MAD rather than True-MAD measurement. A multimodality imaging approach comprehensive of noninvasive chest shape assessment might improve MAD detection among MVP individuals. It appears that careful serial monitoring for VAs should be mandatory for MAD patients.",

      "text": "Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) is the most frequent cause of primary mitral regurgitation (MR), affecting about 2-3% of the general population  [1] [2] [3] . MVP is diagnosed as the systolic displacement of one or both leaflets by at least 2 mm above the annular plane into the left atrium, in the parasternal long-axis view  [2, 4] .\n\nEven if MVP is generally considered a benign condition, a subset of individuals may be affected by the arrhythmic MVP that carries an increased risk of complex ventricular arrhythmias (VAs) and sudden cardiac death  [5] . The mechanisms for arrhythmias in patients with MVP are still not completely understood. According to the most recent literature, severe alterations in mitral valve structure, including bileaflet prolapse, a myxomatous mitral valve with thickened leaflets and mitral annular disjunction (MAD), as well as the presence and extent of myocardial fibrosis (MF) at late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR), have been associated with increased arrhythmic risk in MVP individuals  [6] [7] [8] .\n\nMAD is a structural abnormality, defined as the atrial displacement of the hinge point of the mitral annulus from the underlying ventricular myocardium  [9] . It has been closely linked to MVP. However, some reports indicate that MAD also may appear without concomitant MVP  [10] ; an MAD distance of 3 mm or less may be a benign finding in patients without mitral valve (MV) disease  [11] .\n\nFrom a pathophysiological point of view, MAD may contribute to paradoxical systolic expansion of the mitral valve annulus (MVA)  [12] , as well as to myxomatous degeneration of the leaflets, with consequent MR progression  [13] . Due to the abnormal tugging on the submitral apparatus resulting in MF, usually located in the inferolateral basal wall of the left ventricle, MAD may trigger complex VAs  [6, 7, 14] . The wider the magnitude of the disjunction, the higher the incidence of VAs  [15] .\n\nMAD may be assessed by transthoracic echocardiography (TTE), transesophageal echocardiography (TEE), cardiac computed tomography (CCT) or CMR. Due to its excellent spatial resolution, CCT may theoretically allow the most accurate assessment of the circumferential extent and the severity of MAD  [11] . However, to date, there are no studies that have compared MAD diagnosis based on CCT to that based on other imaging modalities. CMR is able not only to precisely quantify the MAD extent, but also to provide an accurate assessment of the pattern and distribution of myocardial fibrosis at LGE imaging  [16] . Compared to CCT and CMR, TTE suffers from lower spatial orthogonal resolution and limited imaging views  [17] .\n\nOver the last two decades, a number of imaging studies have evaluated the prevalence, pathophysiological role and determinants of MAD among MVP patients. The present systematic review aimed at summarizing the main findings of these studies and examining the overall impact of MAD in patients with MVP."

Seven studies each were performed in the USA and Italy, two in France and one each in Canada, Portugal, the Principality of Monaco, the United Kingdom, Australia, Turkey, Belgium and the Netherlands, whereas the study of Figliozzi, S. et al.  [7]  was a multicenter European study. A total of 19 out of 23 studies (82.6% of total) were single-center studies. The great majority of studies (87% of total) had a retrospective design, whereas only 13% of the total had a prospective design. The mean age of MVP patients among the included studies was 55 yrs (range 12.8-82 yrs). Females accounted for 46.7% (range 18.3-75%) of MVP individuals examined by the included studies. All the included studies defined MVP as the systolic displacement of one or both leaflets by at least 2 mm above the MVA plane into the left atrium, assessed from the parasternal long-axis view during conventional TTE examination  [2, 4] . MAD was defined as the detachment of the left atrial (LA) wall-MVA junction from the LV myocardium, occurring during systole in the parasternal long-axis view  [10] , by 21 studies (91.3% of total). On the other hand, the most recent multicentric studies  [42, 43]  distinguished between True-MAD (atrial displacement of the posterior leaflet in diastole and systole) and Pseudo-MAD (apparent displacement in systole only), and found a significantly lower prevalence of True-MAD vs. Pseudo-MAD in MVP individuals. MAD presence and extent was assessed by using only TTE in eleven studies (47.8% of total), only TEE in two studies (8.7% of total), only CMR in seven studies (30.4% of total) and only CCT in one study (4.3% of total), whereas two studies  [16, 43]  assessed the agreement among echocardiographic techniques and CMR for MAD identification and measurement. Seven studies (30.4% of total) evaluated the MAD prevalence among MVP individuals with moderate-to-severe and/or severe MR who underwent MV surgery and had a pre-surgical evaluation by TTE, TEE, CMR or CCT, whereas the remaining sixteen studies (69.6% of total) were focused on MVP patients with mild and/or mild-to-moderate MR. Among the echocardiographic studies included, five (21.7% of total) performed a TTE examination implemented with speckle tracking echocardiography (STE) for evaluating left ventricular (LV)-global longitudinal strain (GLS) and regional longitudinal strain at the basal, mid-and apical level.\n\nTable  2  lists all the relevant clinical characteristics of MVP patients and principal conventional and functional cardiac indices assessed by the different imaging studies in the same individuals."

The most commonly reported symptoms were palpitations (35.9%), followed by dyspnea (22.4%), fatigue (16.4%) and chest pain (16%). Concerning anthropometrics, MVP individuals with normal weight were found, as assessed by BSA and BMI; in addition, our study group observed that MVP individuals with MAD had a significantly shorter antero-posterior (A-P) thoracic diameter and significantly greater MHI than those without MAD  [31] ."

Overall, MVP patients with MAD were found to have increased risk of clinical arrhythmic events over the follow-up period. The wider the magnitude of the disjunction, the higher the incidence of complex and/or malignant VAs. Carmo, P. et al.  [15]  demonstrated that an MAD extent of >8.5 mm measured on TTE was able to predict the NSVT risk on 24 h Holter monitoring; moreover, Hussain, N. et al.

Indeed, the studies of Eriksson, M.J. et al.  [24]  and Bennet, S. et al.

      "text": "The present systematic review, which analyzed the main findings of 21 imaging studies conducted on MVP individuals, demonstrated that the overall pooled prevalence of MAD in MVP individuals was 40%. Due to the significant heterogeneity between the included studies with regard to demographics, clinical characteristics of MVP individuals, degree of MVP and severity of MR associated with MVP, and the specific imaging method used for assessing MAD presence, the estimated MAD prevalence among MVP individuals showed a wide range of variability, ranging from 5.4% to 90%. An explanation for this finding is related to the possible overestimation of the real MAD prevalence due to Pseudo-MAD measurement by the great majority of included studies. Conversely, only the two most recent CMR studies were specifically focused on True-MAD identification, reporting a low prevalence of systolic and diastolic MAD among MVP individuals.\n\nIt is also important to consider that the MAD prevalence estimated by CMR studies turned out to be approximately 1.5-fold higher than that derived from TTE studies. Posterior MAD and MAD distances of <4 mm are frequently underdiagnosed by echocardiographic imaging. The lower detection rate of MAD by TTE has been ascribed to different mechanisms, such as an inadequate acoustic window, shadowing or reverberations caused by posterior MVA calcification and limited spatial lateral resolution  [16] . Another limitation of TTE is the tendency to slightly overestimate the MAD distance compared to other imaging modalities. CMR is more accurate than echocardiography in detecting short-length MAD (typically <4 mm), due to its superior ability to visualize the posterior MVA and to assess its relationship with the LV wall and adjacent structures  [46] . Moreover, CMR allows for the accurately identification of myocardial fibrosis in the LV-basal inferolateral wall and in the posterior papillary muscle by LGE  [14, 47] . However, the local availability of this technique, together with procedural costs, scanning and post-processing time duration, still limit the use of CMR in clinical routine. Based on the included studies' findings, the MAD prevalence assessed by TEE studies turned out to be intermediate between TTE and CMR studies. It is noteworthy that TEE provides superior diagnostic accuracy for evaluating MV scallops, MVA diameters and MAD distance, compared to TTE  [48] . Due to its semi-invasive nature, TEE is generally performed when TTE is inconclusive or technically difficult. Despite its limited sensitivity, TTE is still considered the modality of choice to assess MAD because of its widespread availability, low costs and excellent capacity to evaluate the haemodynamic consequences of MR  [49] . Even if the present systematic review included only one CCT study  [27] , recent evidence indicates that MAD may be detected by CCT in more than 90% of individuals with structurally normal hearts, with bimodal distribution predominantly involving the P1 and P3 scallops of the posterior mitral leaflet  [11] ."

      "title": "Factors Associated with MAD Presence in MVP Individuals",
      "text": "MAD presence was associated with a number of demographics, anthropometrics, clinical characteristics of MVP individuals and typical MVP phenotypes, highlighted by each of the studies included in the present systematic review. Compared to MVP individuals without MAD, those with MAD were mostly females, were significantly younger, had a concave-shaped chest wall and/or narrow A-P thoracic diameter, were commonly symptomatic for palpitations, had a lower prevalence of the most relevant cardiovascular risk factors and had a lower comorbid disease burden  [28] . MAD was more frequently detected in the LV inferolateral wall in comparison to other LV regions. Consistently with the literature data  [11, 12] , circumferential and/or heterogeneous distribution of MAD was also described, particularly in MVP patients with severe valvulopathy  [30] . However, recent evidence indicates that only extensive inferolateral disjunction is clinically relevant in MVP individuals, whereas disjunction elsewhere in the annulus should be considered a normal finding  [50] . Female patients with MVP and MAD were less likely to be affected by severe MR  [26, 28, 31] . Conversely, severe forms of MR were predominantly reported in males with advanced MVP and longer MAD extent  [29, 32, 35] . MVP individuals with MAD with subclinical myocardial dysfunction were also found, defined by the reduced magnitude of myocardial strain parameters, in the presence of preserved LVEF (\u226555%)  [45] . Impairment in myocardial deformation indices was more enhanced at the level of midand basal segments, with peculiar involvement of the LV-basal inferolateral wall  [31, 37] . Consistently with STE results, CMR studies demonstrated abnormal LGE in the LV-basal inferolateral wall and PMs in MVP patients with MAD  [26, 33] ; this finding was correlated with increased risk of malignant VAs  [33, 36, 38] ."

    {
      "title": "Pathophysiology of MAD",
      "text": "Given that the most common site of origin of VAs in MVP individuals with MAD is the LV-basal inferolateral wall, it has been hypothesized that MAD and bileaflet prolapse lead to a systematic and repetitive stretch on the posterobasal myocardium or the PMs, which, over time, can induce the development of myocardial fibrosis  [24, 32, 36, 51] . The greater the amount of myocardial fibrosis, the higher the risk of malignant VAs in patients with MVP  [14, 41] . Especially pronounced MADs might play an arrhythmogenic role  [52] . Areas of myocardial fibrosis may be detected by strain echocardiographic imaging  [53] [54] [55]  or assessed by LGE-CMR, which is actually considered as the gold-standard imaging technique to noninvasively identify and quantify myocardial fibrosis  [56, 57] . These areas of myocardial fibrosis are responsible for both the attenuation of myocardial strain parameters on STE and the abnormal LGE on CMR. The abnormal stretching of the LV-basal inferolateral wall and PMs induced by MAD is considered the causal factor for the repolarization abnormalities frequently detected in these individuals  [58] . Hutchins et al.  [10]  hypothesized that the excessive mobility of the mitral valve apparatus secondary to disjunction of the mitral annulus fibrosus might cause repeated mechanical stress on mitral leaflets, leading to myxomatous valve degeneration.\n\nRecent evidence derived from autoptic studies indicates that MAD may represent an anatomical variation, more frequently found at the P2 level (detected in approximately 20% of normal hearts), and more pronounced in individuals with prolapsing leaflets  [59, 60] .\n\nOur study group found a strong inverse correlation between MAD extent and the A-P thoracic diameter, indicating a possible relationship between MAD presence and chest wall conformation: the shorter the A-P thoracic diameter, the greater the MAD extent. Considering that the primordia of the mitral valve undergo differentiation to their final form at around the fifth to sixth week of gestation, the same period during which the vertebral column and the thoracic cage start their chondrification and ossification  [61, 62] , we supposed that a defect in growth patterns at this stage of development might affect both the mitral valve and the bony thorax shape  [63] . Therefore, it is likely that both MAD and the continuous mechanical stress perpetuated by the narrow A-P thoracic diameter might contribute to the myxomatous degeneration of MV. This \"mechanical theory\" would primarily explain the occurrence of ventricular and/or atrial arrhythmias and the reduced magnitude of basal longitudinal strain observed in MVP individuals with MAD, as secondary to extrinsic thoracic compression on cardiac chambers in the absence of any intrinsic myocardial dysfunction. As suggested by previous authors  [64, 65] , it is also possible that a concave-shaped chest wall and/or pectus exacavatum, MVP and MAD may be altogether genetically determined as components of a unique syndromic condition. Figure  4  illustrates an example of MHI assessment in an MVP individual with MAD and a narrow A-P thoracic diameter.\n\nRecent evidence derived from autoptic studies indicates that MAD may represent an anatomical variation, more frequently found at the P2 level (detected in approximately 20% of normal hearts), and more pronounced in individuals with prolapsing leaflets  [59, 60] .\n\nOur study group found a strong inverse correlation between MAD extent and the A-P thoracic diameter, indicating a possible relationship between MAD presence and chest wall conformation: the shorter the A-P thoracic diameter, the greater the MAD extent.

      "title": "Clinical Implications",
      "text": "Individuals with a concave-shaped chest wall, symptoms of palpitations and T-wave inversion in inferolateral leads on ECG, especially if young females with a low cardiovascular disease burden, should always be suspected of having MVP and/or MAD.\n\nConsidering the increased risk of complex VAs associated with MAD presence and extent, all MVP patients should be investigated for MAD detection on TTE, and for symptoms suggestive of arrhythmias (especially palpitations and syncope). MVP individuals with MAD should undergo regular 24 h ECG Holter monitoring at diagnosis and during follow-up, with detailed evaluation of arrhythmias  [66] . In selected cases, particularly in MVP patients with abnormal electrocardiographic or Holter findings and with no clear evidence of MAD on TTE, a comprehensive multimodality imaging approach involving TEE and/or CMR would add value to individual diagnostic tests. Among the imaging modalities, CMR may better define MAD of minor degree and myocardial fibrosis, allowing clinicians to identify MVP patients with a potential arrhythmogenic substrate  [67] .\n\nThe impairment of myocardial strain parameters, more enhanced at the level of basal myocardial segments, detected by strain echocardiographic imaging in MVP patients with MAD, might not necessarily be an expression of intrinsic myocardial dysfunction. The individual's chest wall conformation, particularly a narrow A-P thoracic diameter due to sternal depression, might exert a strong influence on cardiac kinetics and function, leading to dissynchrony as a major determinant of a variable angle of incidence of the ultrasound beam during the cardiac cycle, inducing reduced strain value calculations by the software  [68] . It is noteworthy that various degrees of anterior chest wall deformities, ranging from mild concave-shaped chest wall conformation to severe forms of pectus excavatum, may be observed in clinical practice more commonly than expected. An increased prevalence of MVP, nonspecific ST-T-wave abnormalities and VAs, a low probability of CAD and a good outcome over a mid-term follow-up have been demonstrated in individuals with various forms of anterior chest wall deformity  [69, 70] .\n\nThe absence of an increased mortality rate over a significant time frame documented by studies conducted on large cohorts of MVP patients  [25, 28]  would suggest that clinicians should avoid uncontrolled therapeutic interventions, such as the use of ICD devices for primary preventive use  [29] .\n\nMV surgery remains the gold-standard of care for patients with severe MVP and MAD. The presence of MAD does not impact the surgical outcome  [29, 32] , and the surgical correction of MAD appears to be beneficial for reducing the occurrence of VAs after surgery  [71] ."

In this regard, it is important to consider that CMR is limited by its time-consuming nature, high cost and reduced availability, TEE is limited by its semi-invasive nature, and, finally, TTE may be affected by its dependence on acoustic windows and low spatial resolution  [16] . Finally, only very limited information is available on MAD assessment in MVP individuals by three-dimensional (3D)-TTE or 3D-TEE  [30] ."
