      "title": "1.. Introduction",
      "text": "Pay for performance (P4P) programs, in which providers are paid financial incentives for achieving quality goals, have been widely adopted across the U.S. More than 40 private sector P4P programs currently exist.  1  In the public sector, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has established a Value-Based Purchasing Program for hospitals and physicians for Medicare patients, and more than half of states have implemented P4P in their Medicaid programs.  2 o date, studies of the impact of P4P on clinical outcomes have revealed mixed results.  [3] [4] 4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9]  Physicians' attitudes toward P4P programs potentially affect the success of P4P programs,  [10] [11] [12] [13]  yet only a few studies have evaluated the attitudes and experiences of physicians participating in these programs.  [14] [15] ] [16]  Concurrently with the growth of P4P programs, there has been increasing interest in paying patients directly to engage in health behaviors such as quitting smoking and taking their medications.  [17] [18] ] [19]  While studies have assessed patient attitudes about incentives,  [20] [21] [22] [23]  to our knowledge no studies have evaluated how physicians feel about incentives for patients. Physicians' attitudes toward rewarding patients financially could also influence the effect of these incentives in a clinical practice setting.\n\nThis study was conducted as part of a multicenter cluster-rando-mized controlled trial of four financial incentive interventions to reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) with statins among patients with high cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. The separately published clinical trial found that only financial incentives shared between the physician and the patient were superior to control in improving patient statin adherence (39% vs 27%) and reducing LDL-C at 12 months (-33.6 mg/dL vs -25.1 mg/dL). Notably, improvement relative to control was not observed in the physician incentives only arm (31% statin adherence and -27.9 mg/dL change in LDL-C).  24 iven the mixed results of this and other P4P programs to date, the present study raises three questions to explore how physician attitudes might influence such programs:\n\n1. How did primary care physicians (PCPs) perceive various components of a financial incentive program before and after participating in the program? 2. Do PCP attitudes about financial incentives differ by physician or practice characteristics? 3. Are PCP attitudes about financial incentives associated with patient clinical outcomes in the setting of this P4P program?\n\nwith patients, the effectiveness of incentives in changing patient behavior, and the effect of incentives on the patient-physician relationship."

In the physician incentives arm, the PCP was eligible to receive a maximum of $1024 per patient over a year (a payment of $256 for each time a patient met the quarterly LDL-C goal). In the patient incentives arm, the patient was eligible to be entered into a daily lottery if s/he took the statin the day before and reached the quarterly LDL-C goal, with a mean expected payout of $1022 per year for perfect adherence. In the shared incentives arm, the physician and the patient were each eligible to receive payouts as described above but at half the expected value. In the control arm, neither the physician nor the patient was eligible for financial incentives based on LDL-C outcomes. In all arms, physicians were compensated for participation via relative value unit credits and patients were compensated via payments totaling $335 each.\n\nWe surveyed physicians to examine their perspectives on participating in the financial incentive program, and how these perceptions were associated with their patients' clinical outcomes. We supplemented these quantitative analyses with post-study interviews of a number of physicians from all four arms."

At the time of study enrollment, clinical guidelines recommended initiation of statins for patients meeting these criteria. Study coordinators met with eligible and interested physicians to describe study procedures, review patient lists, and conduct baseline surveys. Baseline data included physician demographics, years of practice, and annual visit volume.\n\nParticipating physicians' patients who met eligibility criteria were sent letters describing the study and offering the option of enrolling online or by phone."

Three questions inquired about agreement with offering financial incentives to physicians, and were identical to those asked by Young et al. in a survey of physician attitudes regarding P4P programs in the U.S.  11  Two questions inquired about agreement with offering financial incentives to patients and were written to mirror physician questions. Responses were measured on a 5-point scale.\n\nAfter randomization, PCPs randomized to the physician incentives or shared incentives arms were asked to complete the PAI-26 survey, a validated 26-item instrument for assessing provider attitudes toward various aspects of a P4P program.  10 Wording was modified to reflect a forward-looking perspective. Responses were measured on a 5-point scale, and different subsets of questions were averaged to calculate scores for seven subdimensions of physician attitudes toward pay-forperformance programs: awareness and understanding, clinical relevance, cooperation, concern for unintended consequences, control, financial salience, and impact on clinical behavior. Higher scores reflect more positive attitudes.\n\nAt the conclusion of the intervention period (15 months), all PCPs were asked to repeat the 5-item survey on general agreement with offering financial incentives. PCPs in the physician incentives or shared incentives arms were additionally asked to repeat the PAI-26 survey, with wording modified to reflect a backward-looking perspective.\n\nAt the end of the intervention, all PCPs were asked how they would distribute a hypothetical $1000 financial reward for reducing and maintaining LDL-C: to the physician, to the patient, or equally shared between the physician and the patient."

The target was based on literature suggesting 30 is a reasonable number to achieve saturation.  26, 27 We targeted PCPs for interviews in 6 waves, formed as all of a PCP's patients completed the 15-month visit for the study over a 4month period.

These physicians generally understood the incentive structure, thought the incentives were clinically relevant, and did not think the incentives would have unintended consequences on their practices (mean score \u22653.97). They agreed less strongly that the incentive was sufficiently large, or that they could adequately control their patients' outcomes or get the necessary cooperation from other staff (mean score 3.02-3.59). They were mostly neutral about whether the incentives would have a strong impact on their clinical practice (mean score \u22642.75).

      "title": "4.. Discussion",
      "text": "We report the results of the first study to evaluate physicians' attitudes on participating in a P4P program that offered incentives to both patients and physicians. Our results can be summarized in three key findings:\n\nFirst, PCPs generally agreed with the concept of offering financial incentives to physicians and to patients, and these attitudes remained stable over time. These results suggest broad and deep acceptance of financial incentives in the context of actually using them. Furthermore, while some have worried that explicit financial incentives threaten important elements of the social contract between physicians and patients, the majority of respondents stated that the study had no effect on their relationship with patients, and may have even improved the patient-physician relationship. Because nearly all PCPs approached for the underlying study agreed to participate, it is unlikely that the favorable attitudes we observed are the result of selecting from those PCPs already agreeing to participate in a study of financial incentives.\n\nSecond, two-thirds of PCPs opted to share financial incentives between physicians and patients. This offers support that physicians would be open to participating in shared incentive programs, which is promising given that the underlying trial found shared incentives to be the most effective.  24 hird, we found relationships between PCPs' attitudes about financial incentives and their patients' clinical outcomes. Notably, the main finding of the separate clinical trial-that shared incentives were superior to control in reducing LDL-C-was observed in the present analysis only when PCPs agreed with offering incentives or when PCPs opted to share a hypothetical $1000 incentive. This suggests that physician attitudes may have an impact on the effectiveness of incentives, at least in the setting of shared incentives.\n\nThe mechanism by which physician attitudes toward financial incentives influence the effect of incentives is unknown. Young et al. have advanced a \"professional control perspective\" in which physicians respond more strongly to financial incentives that support their professional goals and autonomy. They found that PCPs participating in a P4P program for diabetes care performed better if they believed the performance targets were important for promoting their professional goals and did not threaten their autonomy.  14 This is consistent with the findings from our study, in which PCPs believed that LDL-C was a clinically relevant target, and responded more strongly to shared incentives when they believed in sharing incentives with patients.\n\nThis study has some limitations. First, a majority of our PCP sample was male and white non-Hispanic, and therefore may not be representative of the broader PCP population. Second, each PCP had relatively few patients enrolled in the study and earned modest incentive totals overall (mean of $3246 in the physician incentive arm and $1597 in the shared incentive arm). This may have dampened the effect of our incentive program. Third, toward the end of the study, new clinical guidelines were issued that deemphasized specific LDL-C goals in reducing CVD risk.  28 While our finding of physician support for incentives will likely apply to similar concrete outcome measures, it is unclear if it will hold true for more complex outcome measures. Fourth, the quantitative analysis component was designed to be exploratory rather than hypothesis-driven, and thus there is a possibility that some findings were significant by chance. However, our finding that physicians responded more strongly to incentives that matched their beliefs is consistent with existing theoretical frameworks.  14"

Shea and coauthored by Tianyu Liu, David A. Asch, Kevin G. Volpp, Jingsan Zhu, Wenli Wang, Andrea B. Troxel, Aderinola Adejare, Darra D. Finnerty, Karen Hoffer, submitted to Healthcare as an Article Type. Authors collectively affirm that this manuscript represents original work that has not been published and is not being considered for publication elsewhere. We also affirm that all authors listed contributed significantly to the project and manuscript. Furthermore we confirm that none of our authors have disclosures and we declare no conflict of interest.\n\nConsultant arrangements: None Stock/other equity ownership: None Patent licensing arrangements: None Grants/research support: None Employment: None Speakers' bureau: None Expert witness: None.\n\nAppendix A. Pre-and post-study survey questions 1. How much do you agree or disagree that (5= strongly agree, 1= strongly disagree) a. Physicians should be rewarded when they provide higher quality care b. Financial incentives for physicians are an effective way to improve the quality of health care c. Financial incentives are more effective as an incentive compared to non-financial incentives such as peer-recognition d. Patients should be rewarded when they adhere to treatment e. Financial incentives for patients are an effective way of promoting adherence 2. Consider a population of patients with high cholesterol and high CVD risk. Suppose you had $1000 per patient to pay out in incentives for improving the care of these patients and you could choose whether to allocate the funds to patient incentives or physician incentives, in both cases tied to reduction and maintenance of LDL. Which would be more effective? a. $1000 per patient to physicians b. $1000 to patients c. $500 per patient to physician; $500 to patients"
