      "title": "1. Introduction",
      "text": "World report on aging and health from World Health Organization (WHO) in 2015 shows that the problem of global population ageing is becoming more serious. The proportion of population aged over 60 years old will increase from 12 % in 2015 to 22 % in 2050. With a twice growing speed, the number of elderly people aged 60 and over will reach 2 billion during next 35 years  [87] .\n\nThe situation in Asian countries is worse in terms of the evergrowing number of elderly people. For example, the proportion of ageing population in Japan has exceeded 30 %. China has been facing similar situation. In around 1980, China carried out one-child policy. Now those children become adults. Part of them study abroad, and many of them get employed in urban cities. So it made a result to leave their parents at hometown alone to become empty nesters  [11] .\n\nBy 2050, ageing population in many countries will rise to the similar level, which causes a series of problems all around the world. The medical systems in many countries are taking heavy burdens, while the quantity of medical facilities and personnel is seriously inadequate  [4] . One possible solution is incorporation of both wearable computing and Internet of Things (IoT) technology into health monitoring services  [35, 44, 51] . It can renovate traditional medical facility based services. The capability of community health services can be enhanced in terms of daily care, chronic disease management, rehabilitation, health training and consultation, etc.  [36] . For example, Health Corners (i.e, self-service healthcare or body check rooms) were deployed in various main cities in China since 2015. Also, mobile healthcare applications based on smart phones become flourishing. It exhibits the trend that healthcare services will be popularized to family level in near future  [77] . Posture detections schemes by using the sensor equipped smart devices will be widely used in health monitoring services  [90, 91] . Now, we can see health monitoring has been one of the most popular research topics. The traditional health monitoring mainly includes the following categories.\n\n-Health Cyber-Physical System: Health-oriented mobile Cyber-Physical System (CPS) plays a vital role in existing medical monitoring applications  [23, 28, 31, 32, 94] , such as diagnosis, disease treatment and emergency rescue, etc. Some electronic medical intelligent network systems suitable for a large number of patients have been designed  [33, 81] . The End-to-End delay of medical information delivery is the main concern, especially in the event of an accident, or in the period when there is epidemic disease outbreak. -Mobile Health Monitoring: Several years ago, mobile health monitoring system based on portable medical equipment and smart phones was proposed  [6, 84] . Smart phones are used to collect physiological signals of human body from a variety of health monitoring devices by the virtue of dedicated smart phone application software  [41, 97] . Then those physiological signals are transmitted to medical centers  [42, 57] .\n\nIf necessary, it can also notify caregivers and medical emergency institutions using short message service of mobile phone. -Wearable Computing for Health Monitoring: Over a long period, wearable devices and wearable computing are the key research topics to enable health monitoring  [9, 24, 39, 69, 74, 98] . As a new kind of body sensor nodes, smart phone and smart watch are adopted to measure SpO2 and heart rate in  [55] , however, such measurement data has low accuracy, few signal types and limited medical uses. -Health Internet of Things: Health IoT is another way to provide health monitoring service  [23, 37, 54, 99] . The mobile sensing, localization and network analysis based on IoT technologies can be used for healthcare  [29, 43, 46, 52] .\n\n-Ambient Assisted Living: Ambient Assisted Living (AAL) aims at improving the life quality of patients, and it can notify relevant relatives, caregivers and healthcare experts  [22] . AAL-related technologies include sensing technology, physiological signal monitoring, home environment monitoring [14], video-based sensing  [34] , smart home technology, pattern analysis and machine learning  [16] . Nowadays, AAL focuses on integrating existing IoT technologies to provide the patients with more life convenience  [26, 100] . However, it is not concerned about the mobility, flexibility and accuracy of physiological signal acquisition. -Healthcare for Special Population Group: Some researchers focus on health problem of special population groups, such as the elderly people, empty nester, and patients with chronic diseases. In  [49] , researchers use wearable computing to help elderly people to live independently and safely. On basis of the integration of mobile health software applications and wearable devices, a system architecture is designed to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease  [50] , however, there are lack of specific implementation, deployment and mature application cases. -Body Area Network: Existing work on body area network (BAN) focus on sensor node's energy saving, intra-BAN network design  [9] , implantable microsensors, physiological signal acquisition, etc.  [48, 56, 79] . Portable smart wearable health monitoring system based on BAN has been developed  [39] . However, stability, interference [96], security  [82]  and reliability of the system need to be improved.\n\nThe emerging research direction of human-machine emotional interaction based on wearable computing  [19, 94]  has been a great concern in academia. In  [18] , an emotional interaction system named AIWAC is proposed based on wearable computing and cloud computing technology  [64, 80] . AIWAC is composed of 3 parts, namely, collaborative data collection in BAN, emotional analysis and predictive models, emotional interaction and emotional action feedback. Based on AIWAC testbed, a practical emotional interaction mechanism is designed. Srinivasan et al.  [58]  have designed a wearable device used for physiological and psychological data monitoring. This device can acquire the patients' ECG, Impedance Cardiogram (ICG), blood pressure and skin conductance. Then, these physiological data are used to figure out the user's emotional state (use an embedded emotion classifier to compute the user's emotional level). The existing problem is that the device lacks of necessary human-machine emotion interaction. PSY-CHE system  [40]  analyzes the emotional states (depression, hypomania, mixed state, euthymia, etc.) of patients with mental disorder or mental illness by monitoring heart rate variability (HRV), respiration and movement recognition of the patients, thus to achieve the purpose of improving mental disorder diagnosis and management. In  [47, 92] , energy efficient event monitoring and detection systems are proposed based on participatory sensing, including both centralized optimal approach and fully distributed suboptimal solutions.\n\nTo enable emotion care, the system needs to collect data of human's emotion. Because of emotion-care poses higher requirements on the amount and quality of body signals than traditional healthcare  [8] , as well as have affective interactions with the users. Unfortunately, it's infeasible to collect the required emotional data over a long term. How can we design a wearable system which is comfortable, sustainable, high scalable and operation friendly? Practically, all of the aforementioned solutions can not meed the requirements. In this paper, we propose smart clothing  [21, 59, 72] , which is critical to realize sustainable health monitoring for healthcare big data collections over a long period. The population that needs emotion care includes empty nest man, depressive patients, autism children, long distance drivers, pilots and space man, etc., as show in Fig.  1 .\n\nIn summary, although there are many research achievements in health monitoring field. But the shortcomings of the existing solutions in different aspects have failed for realizing long-term health monitoring. Traditional health monitoring approaches are not very useful for chronic diseases with sustainable health monitoring. Furthermore, many chronic diseases are caused by mood and mental problems. Also, long-term unhealthy emotions can lead to chronic disease worsen. Therefore, the service level of health monitoring system needs to be further improved. And new solutions for chronic diseases and emotion care scenarios should be proposed.\n\nIn Fig.  2 , we propose a sustainable health monitoring architecture based on smart clothing. It connects human and cloud in a quite natural way. Moreover, it extends traditional machine to machine (M2M) concept for human-cloud integration  [78] , and composes a closed-loop system of Fig. 2 Architecture of Smart Clothing based Healthcare System human-cloud integration, i.e., human \u2192 machine (Smart Clothing, Robot) \u2192 cloud \u2192 machine (Smart Clothing, Robot) \u2192 human. The proposed smart clothing system includes the following three design issue:\n\n-Intra-SmartClothing System: We need to consider various factors for designing smart clothing, such as the characteristics of a particular user (e.g., body shape, disease type, daily habit), technical feasibility (miniature sensor deployment, energy consumption, etc.), comfort level, implementation cost, etc. -Communications for Inter-SmartClothing: Inter-SmartClothing design focuses on the communication problem of interconnecting smart clothing with outside world. It is the middle segment of the closed-loop system of smart clothing to be connected to cloud. The assist of Inter-SmartClothing also works for contacting local medical service center. -Beyond-SmartClothing (BSC) on Clouds: Many technologies can be integrated in BSC  [65] , such as cloud computing, big data  [12] , machine learning, etc. Then, intelligent cloud services can be provided for various types of users (e.g., patients, immediate family members, medical advisor, etc.). BSC also serves as a public health service platform for hospital, emergency medical aid center and other medical health service institution.\n\nThe remaining part of this paper is organized as follows: Section II points out the importance of health monitoring for chronic disease, and proposes sustainable health monitoring to handle the critical issues of chronic diseases. In Section III, smart clothing design and implementation are presented. Section IV introduces the smart clothing system, which covers smart clothing based data collections, transmissions, cloud-assisted storage and data processing, as well as emotion care system via robotics. Typical applications of smart clothing are introduced in Section V. Section VI outlines some future research issues and trends, and Section VII concludes this paper."

      "text": "With the changing economy and environment of human society, the acceleration of population ageing and chronic disease have become the top threat to human health. And the morbidity keeps rising  [76] . However, it's not easily accessible for people to get and take public health services  [70]  because of the shortage in medical resources and facilities. Those medical resources and systems are focused in urban cities based on population and capital. Up to now, the medical and health systems in some countries (especially the developing countries) are mostly intended to cope with acute diseases and infectious diseases, but prevention and treatment for chronic diseases are not emphasized yet  [2, 75] .\n\nNowadays, the improvement of living standards pushes the rising of chronic disease. In US, 50 % of people suffer from one or multiple kinds of chronic diseases at different levels. 80 % of medical funds are used to treat chronic disease. In 2015, US spends around $2.7 trillion on chronic disease treatment. This is accounts for 18 % of US GDP  [5] . In Asia, the fiscal expenditure of Chinese Government on medical and health services has been increasing constantly, from more than eight hundred billion RMB in 2013 to more than one trillion RMB in 2014  [60, 61] . The expensive medical expenditure brought enormous financial burden to society and local government.\n\nIn 2015, WHO produced a report on chronic diseases. It lists the four major chronic disease types, i.e., cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases and diabetes mellitus. The report indicates that in 2012, most of noncommunicable disease deaths was caused by these four diseases among under 70th age people. Cardiovascular diseases took the largest proportion of chronic death under the 70th age (37 %), followed by cancers (27 %), and chronic respiratory diseases (8 %). Diabetes took up 4 % death and other factors accounted for approximately 24 % of deaths [86]."

      "title": "2.2. Factor Chain to Cause Chronic Disease",
      "text": "The main causes of chronic diseases include three kinds of factors. They are unchangeable factors, changeable factors, and those factors hard to be changed. Age and heredity belong to the unchangeable factors and account for 20 % in the cause of chronic diseases, as shown in Fig.  3 . Living circumstances are critical for one's physical condition. And it is hard to be changed.\n\nIn addition to environmental factor, worldwide social and economic trends, such as population ageing, urbanization, globalization, also bring impact on the cause of chronic diseases. The population ageing is the direct reason of rising numbers of chronic diseases patients. And the urbanization makes the environmental pollution worse. For example, the heavy PM2.5 and haze have stimulated the increase of getting lung disease. Another aspect is the globalization. People are getting used to communicate with friends by mobile devices. The new technologies on social, mobile and networking are making more convenient urban life. However, these phenomenons give a rise of a variety of unhealthy lifestyle. For example, sitting in front of computer for too long time, lack of physical exercise to cause obesity problem, etc. These changeable factors are becoming the largest threat to modern people's health.\n\nAccording to the recent WHO report, the determinants of health come to five different factors. In fact, health facilities, such as the surgeons and medical facilities can solve only 10 % of medical problems. 50 % is dependent on lifestyle such as living habits, eating styles and exercises. 20 % lies on environment and the rest 20 % lies on biological things such as heredity. It shows that most of causes are lifestyle-related. That's why we should pay more attention on health surveillance rather than afterwards treatment  [85] , as shown in Fig.  4 . Due to its intrinsic long-term feature, the chronic disease is not acute enough to be treated in hospital. Thats why national governments are spending lots of money on this problem. Sustaining health monitoring is critical to solve this challenging issue."

      "text": "Sustainable health monitoring has close relationship with health big data, which can be observed from the following two aspects:\n\n-From the data collection point of view: Without long term of physiological data collection supported by sustainable health monitoring, the data volume cannot reach the level of big data. -From cloud intelligence point of view: Health big data analytics on clouds provide intelligence for more efficient health monitoring and make it more sustainable.\n\nThus, health big data is critical for sustainable health monitoring  [93] . Generally, big data is of great significance in optimizing the costs of public and private health systems. Health big data is promoting healthy lifestyles and activities, avoiding the occurrence of chronic diseases (such as hypertension), slowing chronic diseases and transferring dependent patients into the monitoring center. In today's era of big data, it becomes possible to collect massive medical and health data on basis of BAN along with the application of large amount of body area network business platforms  [7] . The research on human activity recognition by using big data technology research has become an important research direction of BAN  [67] . In  [73] , the authors proposed a novel participant selection algorithm to efficiently recruit smart device users to collect high-quality data. [63]  introduces a system which can promote active and healthy lifestyles, and provide people with valuable healthy lifestyle and habits. This system uses biological signal sensors and machine learning algorithms to develop big data model. However, there is only a conceptual framework, there is no actual deployment and validation. In  [45] , they presented a novel concept of quality of service (QoS) index to integrate the multi-dimensional QoS requirements to ensure the degree of QoS satisfactions for big data collections."

Before we assemble a smart clothing, suitable sensor should be design. First, fabric sensor, biosensor and intelligent sensor are integrated with textile biometric materials and high-tech nanometer materials. A smart clothing can not be intelligent without the support of mobile cloud. By comparison, a smart clothing system possesses machine intelligence through a perfect combination of mobile clouds and smart clothing. Compared with traditional wearable devices (defined as wearable 1.0), the smart clothing in this paper is defined as wearable 2.0 with the following features: convenient, comfortable, washable, highly reliable and durable. In addition, it has fashionable appearance as common clothes (as shown in Fig.  5 ). Smart clothing can be applied in fields such as health monitoring, game, entertainment and military affairs. The intelligence of smart clothing derives from sensing intelligence and cloud terminal intelligence. The technical fields involved in smart clothing include: clothing design and manufacturing, material science, low-power wireless communication, sensor network, microelectronic technology, telemedicine, mobile media cloud [83] and big data.

Figure  6  shows the practical smart clothing system developed by the Embedded and Pervasive Computing (EPIC) Laboratory (URL:  http://epic.hust.edu.cn ) at Huazhong University of Technology and Science. The main functional components of smart clothing include human body sensor, data processing module, storage module, wireless communication module and warning module, as shown in Table  1 .\n\nThe fabric of the smart clothing adopts an elastic textile fabric which is suitable for being worn next to skin. The pulse sensor, body temperature sensor, electrocardiography (ECG) sensor, myocardial sensor, blood oxygen sensor, electroencephalographic (EEG) sensor and batteries are all connected with flexible wires.

      "title": "3.4. Washable design of smart clothing",
      "text": "The human body's physiological electrical signals are key indicators of vital signs. They are useful for disease diagnosis and health condition assessment. The electrode is one of the major components for physiological electrical signal collection. In recent years, there is a various progress regarding the manufacturing process and the lifetime of textile structure electrode. This paper proposes to use the textile dry electrode as the sensor components for the electrical signals and integrates the textile dry electrode into clothing to monitor the physiological electrical signals anytime and anywhere. At the same time, it also improves comfort without the feeling of being monitored. Compared with the traditional disposable electrode, the textile structure electrode is more flexible and permeable. In addition, it can be used over a long period without irritating skin, due to its washable feature. The other reason that smart clothing needs to washable, is for repeated usages. Typically, ECG monitoring is the basic function of our smart clothing. Thus, the design of washable ECG electrodes embedded into the smart clothing is critical. It includes the clothes itself, some textile dry electrodes (used for collecting ECG data of the user, integrated into the specific area of the clothes), small terminal device (used for processing of collected ECG data and uploading to the cloud, integrated into the clothes by snap button), flexible conductor (used for connecting the textile dry electrodes to small terminal device). In medical science, it can use up to 10 electrodes to realize 12-lead ECG signal measurement. According to specific situation, we can select the quantity of electrodes when designing the smart clothing. For example, six fixed electrodes are sutured on clothes, and other four optional electrodes can be buckled on clothes by snap fastener. Electrode is connected to smart clothing interface through the flexible conductor. The smart clothing interface is composed of 3 snap buttons. Strategic position layout of six fixed electrodes, as shown in Fig. 9. Electrode 1 and electrode 2 are located in the shoulders location in the front of clothes. And electrode 3 and electrode 4 are located in downside position of the clothes front. Electrode V1 is located in the clothes where corresponding to position of the fourth rib gap of body right parasternal. Electrode V5 is located in the clothes where corresponding to position of the body left anterior axillary line. Four optional electrodes are buckled on clothes by snap fasteners. And the position of the four electrodes V2, V3, V4, V6 are in the front of clothes near the left chest. According to the accuracy of ECG signal needed to collect Fig. 9 Design of Washable Power Cable based \"Conductive Network\" for Smart Clothing\n\nand sustainable work hours of device and the wearing comfort, we can flexibly choose whether to use the four optional electrodes or not. When using 10 electrodes at the same time, the way of 12-lead ECG monitoring can obtain more accurate measurement. In implementation, we can flexibly choose number of electrodes to use according to accuracy and energy consumption.\n\nFlexible conductor is made up of ordinary fiber and superfine stainless steel fiber, which are conductive and washable. It does not need to be covered by copper or silver. It is integrated into the clothes along the clothes edges, and does not affect the beauty and comfort of clothing.\n\nSmart clothing interface is composed of 3 snap fastener. A snap fastener is a pair of interlocking discs. It made out of a metal or plastic. A circular lip under one disc fits into a groove on the top of the other. It is holding them fast until a certain amount of force is applied. The light and handy device is directly combined with clothes, convenient and comfortable.\n\nFigure  10  shows the design of the connecting points in the interface button. Small terminal device has 3 external male buttons buckled on 3 snap buttons of Smart clothing interface. It collects electrical signals of textile electrode.\n\nIn addition, we also integrate blood oxygen saturation and body temperature sensor into smart clothing (as shown in Fig.  9 ). Using these sensors, accuracy of healthcare can be greatly improved. Electrode 3 and electrode 4 on smart clothing are also compound used for respiration monitoring of human body. Usually these two electrodes are used for ECG measurement. When needing to monitor respiration, we can set the two electrodes to respiration monitoring electrodes through signal acquisition terminal."

      "text": "How to collect the physiological indices including ECG, respiration, heart rate, blood oxygen saturation and temperature is the key technique for the smart clothing. The ECG and respiration can be collected by several textile dry electrodes on the smart clothing. The heart rate can be calculated by the original ECG. And the blood oxygen saturation can be detected in a noninvasive way with the optical sensors on the clothing. The body temperature can be collected through the NTC (Negative Temperature Coefficient) thermistors.\n\nOne of the advantages for smart clothing based monitoring is its motion capturing and strong anti-interference ability. The user may have some movements under various environments, or even do vigorous exercise which will certainly introduce a larger number of interference signal during monitoring. The main interference signal includes two types of noise. They are physiological noise and environmental noise. Physiological noises includes some low-frequency noise produced by breathing and the electrode displacement, which can also incur baseline drift, and high-frequency noise is generated by the movement which produces myoelectricity signal, etc. Environmental noise includes power-line interference of power system, electric spark interference, radio interference, etc. Although studies have shown that noises mixed in monitoring signal can be separated from the original signal, in practice the noise interference and original signal are overlapped on the spectrum, which cause noises can't be effectively eliminated. It is critical to keep ECG signal complete. For example, T-ST signal losses in ECG monitoring will lead to some misdiagnosis of heart disease. However, it's a challenging issue to achieve this with noise interference."

The modules are responsible for the collection, storage and transmission of the signals of the smart clothing as shown in the Fig.  11 . Data processing module collects and processes potential signal from snap buttons by microprocessor, and processes the received ECG signals to obtain user's heart rate, and then send the heart rate data to display module. At the same time, the data will be transferred to storage module, or directly to wireless communication module. The data processing module is used to receive and process various signals from the sensors, convert them into suitable format, facilitating local storage. Storage module is used for temporary data storage. When the data amount reaches a certain threshold, the data will be automatically transferred to wireless communication module. The wireless communication module will transmit the data to mobile phone , which further delivers the data to cloud. In some applications, the cloud will send results back to the wireless communication module through mobile phone. For example, an alarm will be triggered by cloud-based disease prediction, and the the wireless module receives the critical information from smart phone, and users can understand their immediate health status."

They are ECG, respiration, heart rate, body temperature, and blood oxygen. Then, specified frequency is set to monitor these physiological indexes.

The data also can be uploaded into health cloud platform for on-demand retrieval. For patients resting in bed, we can also add some environmental monitoring, such as video surveillance, temperature, humidity, noise, air quality (PM2.5, formaldehyde, volatile chemicals, and carbon dioxide, etc.), intensity of electromagnetic radiation, etc. Combining the patient's physiological indexes, the environmental data, and medical expert system, we can provide personalized health diagnosis to the patient.\n\nSmart clothing software system is divided into the following four parts: the patient intelligent mobile terminal application software, the doctor intelligent mobile terminal application software, health cloud platform service software and PC client software. The whole software ecosystem can realize the data collection, monitoring, storage and visualization. For the application of emotion care, we need to mainly solve problem of ECG signal collection under network dynamics.

Connecting sensors with pickup assembly through wired way is a big challenge. In some other occasions, like exercise recommendation  [95]  and body rehabilitation training, some motion sensors may be distributed on parts which are distant from each other, such as head, arms and legs, shoes inside and so on. So connecting all sensors through wired way (flexible wire) is not practicable. Thus it needs to establish a BAN to transmit information. Signal pickup and transmit assembly are integrated in forebreast. And sensors to collect the data for ECG, temperature, blood pressure are connected in pickup assembly through wired way. Those sensors that are far from the pickup assembly and hard to be got (like ECG on the head, pressure sensor in the shoes) are connected to pickup assembly through wireless way. Therefore, we will establish a BAN mixed with wired and wireless ways. But technical challenges are as follows:\n\n-To realize the BAN based on flexible cloth, it needs research about connecting technology of tensile flexible cloth, keeping stable electric conductivity of flexible connection at 150% stretch. -Meanwhile multi-sensor node requires inner transmit network of pickup assembly. Tackling the redundancy and relativity of sensor nodes, when some sensor nodes break down, will establish new sensor group through dynamic distribution path to ensure long-term effectiveness of signal pickup. -Flexible skin temperature sensor network monitors shell temperature in each part of the human body in real time. Sensors of temperature measure is changeable, but wearable flexible temperature sensors remain to be developed. Adopting temperature-sensitive semiconductors (including thermistors and temperaturesensitive diodes and so on) materials, utilizing textile fiber processing and manufacturing technology, integrate the temperature-sensitive conductive materials with the clothing structure by printing, coating and weaving and so on to make temperature sensor units.
