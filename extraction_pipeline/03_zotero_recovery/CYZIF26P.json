  "title": "Automated Text Message-Based Program and Use of Acute Health Care Resources After Hospital Discharge A Randomized Clinical Trial",
  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE Postdischarge outreach from the primary care practice is an important component of transitional care support. The most common method of contact is via telephone call, but calls are labor intensive and therefore limited in scope. \n OBJECTIVE To test whether a 30-day automated texting program to support primary care patients after hospital discharge reduces acute care revisits. \n DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A 2-arm randomized clinical trial was conducted from March 29, 2022, through January 5, 2023, at 30 primary care practices within a single academic health system in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Patients were followed up for 60 days after discharge. Investigators were blinded to assignment, but patients and practice staff were not. Participants included established patients of the study practices who were aged 18 years or older, discharged from an acute care hospitalization, and considered medium to high risk for adverse health events by a health system risk score. All analyses were conducted using an intention-to-treat approach. INTERVENTION Patients in the intervention group received automated check-in text messages from their primary care practice on a tapering schedule for 30 days following discharge. Any needs identified by the automated messaging platform were escalated to practice staff for follow-up via an electronic medical record inbox. Patients in the control group received a standard transitional care management telephone call from their practice within 2 business days of discharge. \n MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary study outcome was any acute care revisit (readmission or emergency department visit) within 30 days of discharge. \n RESULTS Of the 4736 participants, 2824 (59.6%) were female; the mean (SD) age was 65.4 (16.5) years. The mean (SD) length of index hospital stay was 5.5 (7.9) days. A total of 2352 patients were randomized to the intervention arm and 2384 were randomized to the control arm. There were 557 (23.4%) acute care revisits in the control group and 561 (23.9%) in the intervention group within 30 days of discharge (risk ratio, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.92-1.13). Among the patients in the intervention arm, 79.5% answered at least 1 message and 41.9% had at least 1 need identified. \n CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this randomized clinical trial of a 30-day postdischarge automated texting program, there was no significant reduction in acute care revisits.",

      "text": "Transitional care management after hospital discharge is both a priority and challenge for health systems. Nearly 15% of all discharged inpatients are readmitted to the hospital within 30 days; including emergency department (ED) returns, the rate of overall acute care revisits is even higher.  1, 2 r patients, the period of time after discharge is challenging, as they adjust to new medication regimens, coordinate follow-up care, and recover strength.  3, 4 A variety of transitional care management programs have aimed to provide patients with enhanced support during this time and mitigate gaps in care, often with the overall aim of reducing subsequent acute care use.  5, 6 e most common approach has been to use nurse-led telephone calls to identify needs shortly after discharge.  7, 8 While these calls have proven effective in some settings, they are limited in scope and operationally burdensome.  9, 10 We hypothesized that an automated texting platform could improve efficiency and effectiveness beyond calls alone by automating large-scale outreach (requiring staff involvement only after a need has been identified), offering a low-friction medium for patient engagement, and enabling asynchronous communication.\n\nA 30-day automated texting program was designed and piloted wherein patients received check-in messages from their primary care practice on a tapering schedule after hospital discharge.\n\nIn a difference-in-differences analysis, implementation of this program at a single primary care practice saw high levels of engagement and was associated with a significant reduction in acute care revisits.  11 In the present study, we tested the effectiveness of this program in a randomized clinical trial conducted across 30 primary care practices in the University of Pennsylvania Health System (UPHS)."

In addition, they received automated text messages from their practice, via the Way To Health platform. On enrollment (day 0), patients received an introductory message describing the program and advising them how to reach out or opt out at any time.\n\nBeginning the day after enrollment (day 1), patients received check-in messages on a tapering schedule (eTable 1 in Supplement 2). These messages asked, \"Is there anything we can help you with today?\" If they answered no, there was no further action. If they answered yes, a follow-up message asked them to further categorize their need (eg, \"I need help with my medicines\"). The eMethods in Supplement 2 provides the full script of messages. Patients could also reach out anytime outside of a scheduled check-in context by texting in \"Call.\"\n\nEscalations (instances in which a patient identified a need) were routed to an inbox in the EMR that was monitored by practice staff during business hours. Patients would receive a follow-up telephone call from the practice care manager (a registered nurse) within 1 business day (generally the same day).\n\nPatients were given the opportunity to opt out at any time. Patients who did not respond to 3 consecutive check-in messages received an additional message asking whether they needed further help or no longer wanted to receive the messages; if they did not respond to this, messages would continue according to the usual schedule."

Outcomes and patient demographic characteristics were obtained from the EMR, which also records acute care visits in regional systems outside of Penn Medicine.\n\nFor the intervention arm, additional feasibility and acceptability measures were obtained from the Way To Health platform, including satisfaction, measured at the conclusion of the 30-day program with a 1-item Net Promoter Score (NPS) question: \"On a scale from 0 (unlikely) to 10 (extremely likely), how likely are you to recommend Penn Medicine's discharge follow-up program to a friend or colleague?\"  16 The NPS varies from -100 to 100, calculated as the percentage of scores of 9 or above reduced by the percentage of scores 6 or below (eMethods in Supplement 2 provides further details)."

Continuous and binary outcomes were compared between intervention and control arms using\n\n2-sample t tests and Pearson \u03c7 2 tests. Prespecified subgroup analyses included risk group (UPHS risk score of 4-5 [medium] or \u05466 [high]) and age (<65 or \u054665 years). To assess subgroup effects, we conducted a stratified analysis by subgroup using Pearson \u03c7 2 and, in a logistic regression model, interacted the arm with a binary indicator for the baseline factor of interest. Additional prespecified exploratory analyses included a logistic regression model with fixed effects at the practice level, and adjusting for demographic (age, gender, self-reported race and ethnicity and insurance type) and clinical (length of stay and UPHS risk score) covariates. Race and ethnicity data were considered important in evaluating any baseline demographic variation in the intervention and control populations. All statistical analyses used Stata software, version 16.1 (StataCorp LLC). Results Study Population A total of 4736 patients were randomized to the intervention (2352) or control (2384) arms, with a mean (SD) age of 65.4 (16.5) years. Of these, 2824 (59.6%) were female, 1912 (40.4%) were male, 66 (1.4%) were Asian, 2322 (49.0%) were Black, 2128 (44.9%) were White, 164 (3.5%) were Hispanic or Latino, 2768 (8.5%) were insured by Medicare, and 911 (19.2%) were insured by Medicaid (Table 1). The mean (SD) risk score was 5.5 (1.6), length of stay was 5.5 (7.9) days, and the number of acute care visits in the past 12 months was 3.3 (5.2). Of the 5048 patients who were initially enrolled at the time of upload of the HealthShare Exchange reports, 174 in the intervention group and 138 in the control group were recognized as ineligible after automated randomization based on repeat discharges during the study period (2), low risk score (1), and discharge from a non-acute care facility (309) (Figure)."

      "text": "We built a 30-day automated texting program with the aim of providing an efficient approach to support patients after discharge and, in turn, reduce acute care revisits. The program was integrated within existing practice workflows, demonstrated high levels of engagement and satisfaction, and   b Of those to whom the NPS question was sent, which\n\nwere those who made it to the end of the 30 days (ie, the total in the intervention arm minus those who opted out or did not have working number) (n = 2131).\n\nidentified needs in a substantial number of patients. Nonetheless, the patients in the intervention arm were no less likely to be readmitted or need other acute care services.\n\nEnrollment was generally smooth. Patients were identified through an existing workflow, which generates reports that could be uploaded to the platform for automated enrollment; the waiver of research consent allowed us to emulate the experiences in standard clinical deployment. A total of 3.9% of the participants had a nonworking telephone number and 5.5% of the participants opted out of the program; these latter groups were included in an intention-to-treat analysis, which might dilute potential treatment effects, but this was a pragmatic trial (designed to evaluate interventions in routine clinical practice conditions) and most clinical deployments are likely to face similar figures.\n\nEngagement with the program was high (79.5% responded to at least 1 message) and consistent with both the pilot study and other work that has compared text messaging with traditional call-based approaches.  17 e intervention was conceptually appealing and supported by the encouraging results of the pilot study in which the same intervention in a largely identical population was associated with a 41% reduction in the odds of a 30-day acute care visit in a difference-in-differences analysis.  11 vertheless, when evaluated in this prospective randomized trial, the intervention showed no effect relative to control in any of the prespecified measures. Why did the intervention work in the pilot study and not in the randomized trial? The results of the pilot study might have been spurious, perhaps because of unmeasured confounding residual to the difference-in-differences approach. Or perhaps the pilot study, run at a single practice, benefitted from idiosyncratic operational elements (eg, a care managers' unique relationship with the patients, patients' trust) not well represented in the much wider implementation.\n\nThis is why we conduct larger prospective trials rather than rely on either our loyalty to an appealing clinical design or the results of an observationally controlled pilot study. Despite the high engagement and satisfaction with the program, it was nonetheless insufficient to alter patients' clinical trajectories. That is disappointing, but the reason to approach the problem was that it was already known to be challenging: acute care revisits are the outcome of a complex set of clinical and social forces. An emergent theme of transitional care research has been that the most successful programs have been multimodal and intensive. Remote postdischarge contact-most often via telephone-is a common component of these programs,  18, 19  but they may also include predischarge education, dedicated transitional care coordinators, home visits, and remote physiologic monitoring.  [20] [21] 1] [22] [23] [24]  For those that offer benefit, the active ingredients or the right combination of active ingredients are hard to identify and likely harder to generalize across patients.  [25] [26] [27]  There is still potential value in an automated texting approach, given that call-based programs are operationally burdensome. We did not test a call replacement approach, and as such saw an overall increase in interactions with the practice during the 30-day period (0.77). Future work should compare a call only-based and text only-based approach directly, with the goal of comparing effectiveness and operational efficiencies. The text-based approaches may have value even if they offer no value beyond human calls."

      "text": "This study had strengths, including streamlined enrollment of a large number of patients in a relatively short period of time. The program was well integrated into the staff's preexisting workflows, and the escalations were routed directly into the EMR where they could be easily seen.\n\nThe limitations of this study include that it took place within a single academic health system, although across a large number of practices. It also targeted patients discharged from a wide range of hospitals, and patients-including those in the control arm-may have received overlapping outreach from other health systems. There was no significant difference in effect of the intervention, however, between patients discharged from internal and external hospitals. While external encounter data for the patients in this study were generally input into the EMR as they became available, it is possible that some external visits were missed by this process; this, however, would have occurred randomly"

Participants were assigned either to usual postdischarge transitional care management or usual care plus receipt of a 30-day automated text messaging program. The texting program was built and managed by Way to Health, a platform created with National Institutes of Health funding to provide automated technology infrastructure in support of clinical care and care delivery innovation research. Electronic medical record (EMR) data were collected for 60 days after discharge. The complete protocol is available in Supplement 1. This study was reviewed and approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board. We followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials Extension (CONSORT Extension) reporting guideline (with pragmatic extension) and Standards for Quality Improvement Reporting Excellence 2.0 (SQUIRE) reporting guideline. The trial operated under a waiver of informed consent given that (1) both arms continued to receive usual care, (2) text outreach involved no more than minimal risk to patients, (3) once enrolled in the texting program, patients were free to opt out at any time, and (4) requiring informed consent would substantially limit the external validity of the study."
