      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "Smartphone addiction refers to excessive dependence on smartphones, to the extent that it has a negative impact on the psychological, social, school, and/or work aspects of one's life. In recent years, smartphone addiction has manifest across multiple age groups  [14] , afecting up to 40 percent of Americans  [21] . Many young people who have had access to smartphones at a young age perceive these devices as an extension of the self and develop a strong attachment to such technology  [34] . One survey  [14]  revealed that 54 percent of teens admit to spending too much time on their cellphones, while 75 percent of parents express concerns about their teen's screen time. Smartphone addiction among adolescents has been linked to maladaptive coping strategies  [84]  and problematic relationships with parents and/or peers  [67] .\n\nNumerous automated sensing applications have been developed to track screen time. Apple and Google have developed tools  [5, 23]  to measure phone use or individual app usage time, while providing reminders and usage limits. Note however that implementing these tools requires motivation to reduce screen time and the ability to self-monitor, both of which are uncommon among adolescents. Research has shown that parental involvement can ameliorate problematic behaviors  [52] ; however, most existing parental control applications lack features that promote teen self-regulation. They also lack mechanisms aimed at facilitating collaboration  [115] , tend to be viewed as invasive, and undermine one's sense of autonomy  [50] . Adolescents and parents must be included in any plan aimed at moderating smartphone addiction  [73] .\n\nIn the HCI community, numerous researchers have examined the issue of smartphone addiction and digital health. Simon et al.  [76]  described a lack of clarity in the way we perceive and discuss our relationship with smartphones. One approach to managing smartphone use involves intervention mechanisms aimed at creating a meaningful experience with one's smartphone  [66, 93] . In interviews with adolescents and their parents, Hung et al.  [60]  sought to develop methods by which to incorporate self-monitoring with parental support mechanisms. Their results revealed preliminary design opportunities to integrate data correlated with phone use behaviors (e.g., lifestyle or wellbeing) to highlight the impacts of adolescents' smartphone addiction. However, to the best of our knowledge, none of the prior HCI studies has further explored how to integrate these types of correlated data (e.g., phone use, lifestyle, wellbeing) into a system prototype for assisting parentadolescent pairs who are currently receiving psychiatric treatment for smartphone addiction.\n\nIn the current study addressing adolescents undergoing psychiatric treatment for smartphone addiction, we sought to promote healthy parent-adolescent communication by combining selfmonitoring with data-sharing. We created a system aimed at facilitating the sharing of data pertaining to phone usage, lifestyle, and well-being. Using a prototype of the proposed system, we conducted a technology probe study with seven dyads of adolescents and their parents with the aim of gaining insights by which to improve the system.\n\nThe major contributions of the current paper include the following:  (1)  We unpacked the experiences of adolescents and their parents in sensing and sharing data pertaining to smartphone usage, lifestyle, and well-being. We also elucidated the means by which stakeholders make sense of these types of data and the intricacies of mediating the behaviors of adolescents striving to overcome smartphone addiction. (2)  We shed light on the means by which behavioral data obtained via sensors and self-reporting complement eforts to moderate smartphone usage. (3) Finally, we unravel the communication dynamics based on the sharing of phone usage data between adolescents and their parents, and the means by which values and needs are addressed in the design of the proposed system."

      "title": "BACKGROUND & RELATED WORK",
      "text": "Smartphones are an essential part of everyday life. These devices provide convenient access to the virtual world, which features countless entertainment options and constant gratifcation  [30] . However, smartphone use can become harmful when an individual becomes overly attached to it, emotionally and behaviorally  [32, 89] . Studies have linked smartphone addiction to emotional issues  [30]  and cognitive problems  [72] .\n\nThe term Smartphone Addiction is widely used to describe a pattern of problematic smartphone use associated with a lack of self-control  [40]  and corresponding negative efects  [72, 74, 82] . Other related behaviors include gaming disorder, internet addiction, and nomophobia  [100, 117] . It appears that among adolescents of Generation Z  [38] , reliance on smartphones has increased during the COVID quarantine period  [94] . In the current study, Our study operationalizes smartphone addiction as symptoms of dependence on smartphones to the extent that it has a negative impact on psychological, social, school, and/or work aspects of life. Our research focused on a group of adolescent patients (11 to 17 years), who were clinically diagnosed with smartphone addiction based on the following symptoms: (1) smartphone usage interfering with one's sense of time or the fulfllment of basic needs (sleeping, eating, or maintaining personal hygiene);  (2)  smartphone usage leading to feelings of irritation or depression when denied access to a smartphone; (3) demands for more usage time or better mobile devices; (4) smartphone usage leading to behaviors that jeopardize interpersonal relationships, educational/career opportunities, or health (e.g., lying, bickering, aggression, and poor achievement).\n\nIn the following, we review related research on the selfmonitoring of smartphone use, parental regulation of smartphone use, and smartphone usage within the context of lifestyle and wellbeing."

      "text": "Adolescents undergo rapid physical, psychological, socio-cultural, and cognitive changes  [53] , as they seek to gain respect from others and establish a sense of identity and autonomy. Nonetheless, their capacity for self-control is immature  [42, 105] , which makes them susceptible to behavioral problems like smartphone addiction. There has been relatively little research on the relationship between addiction and autonomy in adolescents and young-adults  [64] ; however, the importance of autonomy in development has long been recognized  [43] . Autonomy can facilitate development  [98]  and a lack of autonomy can lead to problematic behavior  [51] . Hong et al.  [59]  reported that a lack of autonomy increases susceptibility to boredom, which can lead to problematic phone usage.\n\nVarious technological devices have been devised to facilitate the self-monitoring of smartphone usage, while taking into account one's need for autonomy  [1, 5, 16, 18, 22, 23] . Some systems use apps to track usage, while others set time limits or provide reminders  [2] . Researchers have also sought to motivate users to use these devices by incorporating elements of games  [6, 13] . It appears that these devices are efective in raising awareness about screen time; however, there is little evidence that they facilitate control  [119] .\n\nResearchers have also reported on a link between smartphone addiction and the physical condition of the individual (e.g., daytime sleepiness, energy levels, or physical symptoms potentially caused by excessive use of phones)  [4, 33, 39]  and mood  [25, 27, 41, 63, 84] . Unfortunately, usage tracking systems are prone to false positive signals or fail to present data in context  [68, 107] , both of which make it difcult to accurately describe one's physical condition and mental status.\n\nAnother approach to characterizing and contextualizing one's physical condition and/or mental status  [33, 75, 107]  is to record subjective perceptions and attitudes. Lee et al.  [78]  introduced a daily journal to record smartphone use to evaluate the therapeutic efects of interventions. In that study, the adolescents were given autonomy over their own behaviors (i.e., they were free from parental control). Their system proved efective in mediating smartphone addiction; however, it is unclear how this afected parent-adolescent communication."

Google Family Link  [9] , have been developed to facilitate parental regulation by monitoring phone usage, setting reminders, or even blocking access to applications. However, the results of many such interventions are the opposite of what was intended. Parental monitoring has been shown to exacerbate online game addiction  [116]  and other forms of technology abuse  [47, 77, 80] , while generating tension in the parent-adolescent dyad  [37, 58] . Note however that a failure on the part of parents to afect meaningful changes can be attributed to the problematic usage of devices by parents  [46, 62] , parenting style  [65] , the quality of parent-adolescent relationships  [71] , and the openness of communication  [55] . The dominant narratives revealed that many parents have shifted from limiting (i.e., restrictive mediation) to collaborating (i.e., active mediation)  [92, 109] , or combining both approaches  [101, 106] . Steinfeld  [106]  concluded that a balanced combination of limiting and collaborating can provide the adolescents with the supports they need to develop boundaries and the skills by which to self-regulate internet activities. Imposing restrictions does not necessarily afect internet usage; however, parental recommendations pertaining to website selection and using the internet with their children has been shown to have a positive efect on online education  [79]  and developing healthy media habits  [88] . Efective mediation depends on parents understanding of the technical aspects of media the means by which their children interact with it. Note that technological literacy can also help to avoid parent/child confict  [92] . Taken together, it appears that parents play a key role in establishing boundaries pertaining to smartphone use. Nonetheless, efective communication often requires assistive tools."

      "title": "Beyond Regulating Smartphone Use:",
      "text": "Lifestyle and Well-being\n\nA number of researchers have adopted a more balanced approach to mitigating smartphone addiction by promoting outdoor activities with family members  [66]  or cultivating healthy habits  [35, 102, 111] . Kawas et al.  [66]  developed the NatureCollections app to promote outdoor experiences in order to ease screen time tensions between parents and tweens. Shen et al.  [102]  developed an app for the self-monitoring of smartphone usage and healthcare behavior. A number of apps list screen time as a factor associated with overall wellness  [111]  or obesity in adolescents  [31, 35, 83] . As digital natives, teenagers are competent and fexible when utilizing personal informatic tool for self-tracking meaningful life factors, especially when they are self-motivated  [95, 96] . There is evidence supporting the efectiveness of recording mood, daily activities, and thoughts on mental wellness  [28] . However, merely self-monitoring specifc behaviors (e.g., anger  [44] ) is seldom sufcient. This has prompted researchers to incorporate support from parents  [91] , teachers, and health professionals  [31]  to promote constructive changes in behavior. This study investigated the use of mobile and wearable technologies in supporting adolescents and their parents in the monitoring of phone usage, lifestyle indicators, and well-being status. We conducted a two-week technology probe study  [61]  with seven parent-adolescent dyads in order to characterize the efects of sharing lifestyle data on smartphone addiction. We also sought to gain insights to guide the design of intervention systems.\n\nBased on a review of the literature, we posited the following research questions:\n\n\u2022 RQ1: How can data related to smartphone, lifestyle, and well-being be used to reduce smartphone abuse by adolescents and enhance adolescents' awareness of phone usage behavior? \u2022 RQ2: How can the sharing of phone use, lifestyle, and wellbeing data with parents be used to enhance parents' awareness of smartphone behavior by their adolescent children? \u2022 RQ3: How can the sharing of phone use, lifestyle, and wellbeing data with parents afect parent-adolescent communication related to smartphone overuse?"

      "text": "We conducted a technology probe study  [61]  involving seven dyads of adolescents with smartphone addiction and their parents. This study was approved by the Institutional Review Board of Taipei City Hospital (IRB No.: TCHIRB-11002012).\n\n3.1 TechLifeProbe for Compiling and Sharing of Data Related to Smartphone Usage, Lifestyle, and Well-being\n\nOne previous study identifed the challenges involved in overcoming smartphone addiction by adolescents  [60] , as follows: (1) Difculties in depicting smartphone usage based solely on screen time;\n\n(2) A failure to depict the impact of smartphone usage; and (3) Poor communication between adolescents and parents concerning smartphone usage. We considered these challenges in conjunction with the research questions identifed in section 2 when designing the TechLifeProbe, which combines a wearable wristband tracker, a diary reporting system, a mobile phone app (installed on the adolescents' or parents' phone), and a backend server. The proposed system has three main functions: (1) Automating the collection of data related to phone use and lifestyle; (2) Provide the means to maintain a diary and share the contents with parents, and (3) a user interface by which to summarize and share collected data. In the following, we describe the design and implementation of the proposed system and characterize the efects of these functions on phone abuse behaviors.\n\nwearable wristbands to facilitate the self-monitoring of phone usage and the impact of smartphone addiction on lifestyle (i.e., sleep conditions and activity levels). The wristband tracker (Fitbit Charge 2  [12] ) records sleep duration and activity levels (i.e., step counter). The TechLifeProbe phone app is installed on the phone of the adolescents to allow the automatic tracking of app usage. The adolescents may also submit self-reports on their personal well-being via a diary reporting service. The TechLifeProbe phone app is also installed on the phone of the parents so that they can submit reports on their observations of the child. All collected data is uploaded to a backend server to facilitate sharing between adolescents and parents.\n\nUsers and parents alike are encouraged to use the Diary reporting service every evening before going to sleep. Self-reported data tends to be more contextualized for recording mood, daily activities that impact physical well-being, and feelings indicative of mental wellness  [28, 75, 107] . Adolescents tend to be impulsive, such that they seek the immediate pleasure of using their phone while disregarding the adverse consequences on their health or well-being  [118] . Furthermore, they tend to be optimistic when reporting on their well-being. Thus, we sought to include feedback from parents, due to the fact they live with the subject and are privy to the details of the subject's life. In this study, we leveraged an existing online survey tool  [7] . We designed a diary reporting service acquiring self-reports from adolescents and observational data from their parents once a day (e.g., keeping the diary before going to bed at night), which contains a parallel set of probing questions. Pressing a button in the diary region of the main page (Figure  1 (a) and (b)) opens the diary module. Upon completion of the daily diary, the phone app automatically visualizes the responses to questions on the main page using APIs provided by the survey tool  [7] .\n\nThe diary contains self-report questions for adolescents and observations for parents pertaining to the following issues: (1) The physical condition of the adolescent (e.g., energy level rated on a scale from 1 (no energy) to 5 (full energy) or physical symptoms potentially caused by excessive phone use  [4] ); (2) The overall mental status of the adolescent (e.g., mood status on fve representative categories evenly distributed in a valence-arousal emotional space  [110] ); and (3) The main factors contributing to well-being (e.g., phone use, sleep, exercising, academic performance, interpersonal relationship, or family communication). The adolescents are asked whether they actually discuss the issue of phone use with their parents. The parents are asked whether they give their children reminders or suggestions. Adolescents and parents are both asked whether they use the numbers collected by the Fitbit and the interactions between adolescents and their parents. They are also asked whether the sensing data and parental feedback raised their awareness, afected their intention, or moderated their smartphone addiction.\n\ninterface visualizes sensing and diary data (Figure  1 ). Figure  1(a)  presents a screenshot of the main page listing lifestyle factors, app use logs, and diary responses. At the top of the main page, the log region presents the device usage history based on data automatically collected via the built-in screen time APIs. It also presents lifestyle data recorded by the wristband tracker. The interface also includes a dashboard card and screen usage card. The dashboard card presents the sleep hours, total app usage time, and step count during that day. To enable detailed analysis of phone use data without complicating the interface, we divided each day into three time slots: (1) a morning slot from 0:00 to 8:00, (2) a day slot from 8:00 to 16:00, and (3) a night slot from 16:00 to 24:00. Most adolescents sleep during the morning slot, attend online courses in the day slot, and do homework or recreational activities in the night slot. We also display the three apps that used most frequently during each slot.\n\nThe diary region at the bottom of the main page displays a button that triggers the diary reporting service followed by a side-by-side comparison view of self-reports and parental feedback (Figure  1(b) ). Data pertaining to the physical and mental well-being of the adolescent (mood, energy level, physical symptoms, and phone usage activity) is presented at the same time. Note that the adolescents and their parents can choose a time to discuss discrepancies or other issues.\n\nFigure  1 (c) illustrates usage via a bar chart listing the three apps most frequently used in each time slot. At the top of the fgure, we can see the accumulated app usage time in the three time slots. This information can be used by the adolescents (and/or their parents) to easily identify the time slot(s) associated with the worst app abuse. Note that many apps can be used for academic purposes (e.g., Wikipedia or Khan Academy) as well as recreational purposes (e.g., social media or video games). At the bottom of the fgure, we can see the three most frequently used app \"categories\"  [3]  and corresponding usage times. By reviewing the time spent using apps in diferent categories, the adolescents and their parents can avoid mistaking productive technology use behaviors (e.g., time using Education-type apps) with unproductive behaviors (e.g., time using Game-type apps)."

Our study sample included seven dyads of smartphone-addicted adolescent patients (3 males and 4 females; P1 \u223c P7) aged 11 to 17 years old (Mean = 14.29 years old; SD = 2.14) and their parents (1 male and 6 females; F1 \u223c F7) aged 40 to 58 years old (Mean = 49.57 years old; SD = 5.56). Note that the cohort was based on psychiatrist referrals. The patients used mobile devices for an average of 8.57 (range from 4 to 11) hours per day. All of the patients had previously been diagnosed with an addiction to using social media apps and/or mobile phone games, most of which require an internet connection. The Chen Internet Addiction Scale (CIAS)  [69, 70]  scores ranged from 64 to 88, exceeding the cut-of point of 58 and indicating a tendency toward internet addiction (IA). The patients were also administered the Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS)  [33, 39] , which generated mean scores of 22.00 (range = 0 \u223c 32; SD = 6.66), which indicates less than optimal sleep time, poor school achievement, and poor anger control. The adolescents also demonstrated behaviors associated with smartphone addiction, such as attention defcit, poor emotional regulation, lack of impulse control, and lack of social skills.\n\nNote that all of the parents in this study lived with the adolescent patients. Parents F1, F2, and F4 acted as housekeepers at home with their children. The other parents were able to observe their children only after work. All of the parents expressed dissatisfaction with the addictive behavior of their children, often leading to confict. CHI '22, April 29-May 5, 2022, New Orleans, LA, USA Only F5 reported using a parental control app (Family Link  [9] ) to limit screen time.

Psychiatrists randomly selected adolescent patients who had undergone treatment for smartphone addiction or other behavioral disorders triggering addictive smartphone use. The adolescent and their parents were invited to participate in this study. Each dyad underwent screening for eligibility via structured interviews and CIAS questionnaires. Each dyad was then briefed on the goals of the study, and asked to complete the Pediatric Daytime Sleepiness Scale (PDSS). Subsequent appointments were scheduled over the following two weeks. Dyads that lived at a distance from the hospital were excused from revisiting the hospital. Rather, they were permitted to select a meeting place for interviews at a location near their home. All participants signed informed consent forms.\n\nWe collected demographic information (age and gender) and the estimated average daily time spent using a smartphone, based on their past experience. All participants attended a 30-min training session to learn the operations of the TechLifeProbe prototype, how to fll out the diary, how to synchronize behavioral data from the Fitbit device, and how to check usage data, lifestyle sensing data, and self-reports. During this session, we installed the app and paired the Fitbit device to the adolescent's phone. The adolescent was asked to wear the Fitbit device each day throughout the study."

Our analysis of responses collected in Week One found some unique app use or behavioral patterns and prompted a number of additional questions for the post-study interviews. Finally, we asked the participants to fll out a post-study questionnaire in order to gain feedback after using the app.\n\nFollowing the completion of the study, the adolescents and parents were reimbursed with NTD$ 500 (about USD$ 17.9) for the two interviews as well as NTD$ 2000 (about USD$ 71.6) for using the TechLifeProbe in their daily lives for two weeks.\n\nThe evaluation metrics included data from adolescent phones and Fitbit devices and assessments reported in diaries and the post-study questionnaire.\n\n3.5.1 Automated sensing measures.

The two questions were meant to determine whether the data collected by this system enhanced awareness of smartphone-related behavior (Qa), and whether the data helped to facilitate communication among family members (Qb)."

      "text": "Interview data was used to characterize the means by which Tech-LifeProbe was used and its impact, from the perspective of the adolescents and their parents. We then explored the themes describing the efect of the proposed system on parent-adolescent communication.\n\n4.3.1 Usage and impact of the proposed app. Roughly half of the adolescent participants (n = 4) admitted to smartphone addiction. The other two denied this classifcation but admitted to excessive usage. All adolescents reported experiencing difculty in exercising self-control over their smartphone usage. The participants discussed this issue as well as their perception of phone usage and desire to maintain a healthy lifestyle. The study took place during summer break, during which they felt that it was reasonable to spend 'their own' leisure time using a smartphone.\n\n\"Before the summer break, I wasn't able to use my smartphone at school. Now that it is summer break. I can fnally use it as much time as I want. \" -(P6, w1) These contextual constraints (increased leisure time or lockdown) reduced the motivation to moderate cell phone usage. Thus, it is important to fnd methods other than top-down restrictions or self-monitoring to deal with smartphone addiction.\n\nAll of the adolescents reported that they were aware of their smartphone-related behavior before then study and therefore were not inclined to check the phone usage records. Only when making a diary entry or after binge-watching some videos would they scan through the data.\n\n\"I would only use the app when I thought of it, such as in the afternoon when I was not occupied. When I used the app, I would frst check the aggregated records at the top of the screen. \" -(P3, w2) They reported that reviewing the data made them aware of their phone usage, as indicated by the scores for Qa in the post-study questionnaire. Even when they were aware of their phone usage, the adolescents with weak self-control  [54, 118]  confessed to an inability to control themselves in some situations, such as when using social media apps.\n\n\"My mom always complains that I cannot discipline myself. [Did you really try to demonstrate that you can discipline yourself?] I don't even try because I am sure I can't. I don't have friends in my class ... All my friends are in another class, so all I can do is to use the Line app to chat with them. \" -(P5, w2) Some of the adolescents reported a lack of motivation to seriously consider the numbers given them by TechLifeProbe. Even when the usage numbers were very high, they dismissed them, and went on using their phones in the same way as usual. The adolescents were already aware of their phone usage and saw no reason to confrm it. Several of the adolescents expressed greater interest in knowing their lifestyle data (sleep hours or activity levels).\n\n\"I know the time spent on using phone and how long I slept. But I did not know how many steps I have in a day... I want to know how many steps I have ... \" -(P7, w1)\n\nAfter reviewing the lifestyle and/or well-being data, some adolescent participants adjusted their lifestyle (e.g., sleeping earlier) when seeing the numbers revealing poor lifestyle or well-being. Because the phone use behaviors correlate with their lifestyle or well-being, adjusting their lifestyle may improve their well-being and in turn reduce their excessive phone use.\n\n\"The data told me that I wasn't sleeping enough. I remember that one day ... on this day [pointing a date on the app UI], I slept only fve and a half hours. I wonder why I couldn't sleep ... because of using my smartphone? If so, I should probably use it less and go to sleep earlier. I got 7 hours of sleep the next night. \" -(P3, w2) \"After reviewing the numbers in TechLifeProbe, I realized that in the past week, I took way more steps last weekend. Look (pointing to the step numbers) . . . On this day, I hung out with my cousin. My phone use time was about 9 hours, which is less than at home, and the number of steps was way higher. This made my think that outdoor activities might be a good replacement for smartphone use. \" -(P7, w1) 4.3.2 Parent impressions of TechLifeProbe and its Impact. Only one of the parents (F5) used parental control technology. They had either not heard of such technologies or had concerns about the potential backlash from their children. None of the parents had ever used health monitoring nor self-tracking technologies to mediate the lifestyle of their children. Six of the seven parents (not F06) were convinced that their children were \"addicted to\" or \"obsessed with\" their smartphones, and all of them were eager to identify efcient ways to address this issue."

      "text": "Overall, the parent participants reported that the sharing of data enhanced their awareness of their children's condition, including phone use, lifestyle, and well-being. Working parents have no other ways of monitoring their children's phone use, and even stay-at-home parents have only a rough idea. All of the parents reported that automated monitoring improved their understanding of phone usage. The parents also reported that understanding the lifestyle data is crucial to their children's development. Overall, sleep time was the top concern, and many agreed that the Fitbit data was an efective approach to monitoring their sleep time.\n\n\"My son (P1) is in the ninth grade and the doctor said he can still get taller. So, it is important that he go to sleep before 9 pm in order to get enough sleep. [...] This app made me aware of his actual phone use and sleep hours. \" -(F1, w1) Most of the parents reported paying more attention to behaviors they were unable to monitor without causing a disruption. F3 reported using screen time data between 12am to 8am and total sleep hours to monitor his child.\n\n\"I relied on the data of phone use after midnight [i.e., disaggregated phone use time in the morning slot] and her sleep time to understand her situation the night before. Since my daughter and I do not sleep in the same room, the data collected during this specifc period of time is very important for me to understand her habits. \" -(F3, w1) The parents reported that self-reported data complemented their own observations of children's well-being. It also gave them insight into their children's moods and the underlying cases. The found that their children's assessments difered from their own; however, the self-reported data gave the parents an idea of what their children cared about most.\n\n\"[In discussing the main factors contributing to his son's well-being] I think we both reported the factor we thought was most infuential. If he chose \"academic performance\", that probably meant his teacher gave him compliments and it made him feel good, while I chose \"interpersonal relationship\" assuming he was happy because he went out with his friends. The factors afecting his well-being are complicated and interrelated; however, this data still helped me to fgure out what he cares about. \" -(F4, w1) When diary responses from adolescents and their parent were aligned, the children reported that their minds were in in sync and felt good about it. The parents focused more on discrepancies between responses than on consistency. Thus, they tended to scan the diary and attended to details only when there was an obvious diference between their observation and children's self-evaluation.\n\n\"After my daughter (P6) fnished a diary entry, I would check the app to see if our responses were aligned. I noticed that our responses yesterday difered far more than before. \" -(F6, w1) Several of the parents used monitoring data to confrm their own observations or refect on spotty behavioral patterns. One parent stressed that he would not rely primarily on the data itself, but rather use it as reference against his personal observations. \"One day, I noticed that my daughter was playing mobile games because she was holding her phone like this (i.e., horizontally) and continued for the next few days. So, I checked the data backward day by day to see if my observations were correct. \" -(F3, w1) To our surprise, parent participants did not necessarily believe the diary entries, especially when they observed a discrepancy. They tended to assess the data based on their prior knowledge of the child.\n\n\"[What do you think about your daughter's selfreported moods?] She often feels angry and only remembers those angry moments rather than the happy ones. Anger is her baseline mood. \" -(F5, w1) Many of the parents avoided directly raising these questions, relying on their instinctive explanations until they obtained more information. Only when they observed something unexpected would they ask their children about their responses.\n\n\"[How would you use your son's responses to identify main factors that contribute to his well-being?] When he responded with \"phone use\", it meant that he knew that gaming caused trouble with his sleep and emotions. So, I did not follow up on that response. However, when he responded with \"academic performance\", that was unexpected, so I asked him if anything happened in school that day. \" -(F4, w1) Few parents referred to objective monitoring data as well as subjective responses in the self-reports to make inferences. Most of the parents focused strongly on the self-reports. Most of the parents assumed that excessive phone use was a contributing factor to poor sleep quality and well-being.\n\n\"When he reported that \"phone use\" was the main contributor afecting his well-being, I checked whether he was playing [mobile games] late into the night and whether phone use was afecting his sleep. The data indicated that he had not been staying up late playing, so I had to consider other explanations for his moods swings, such as energy levels. \" -(F4, w1) 4.3.3 Impact of Phone Use on Family Communication. Parentadolescent communication pertaining to smartphone addiction was a source of friction. The parents wanted to reduce phone use so that their children would have a more well-rounded life, which is something that the adolescents completely disregarded. The adolescents reported that their parents did not understand why they spent time using their phones (i.e., the practical purposes). Many arguments ensued regarding whether smartphone use had a negative impact on lifestyle. Eventually, the adolescent participants gave up on communicating with their parents, taking refuge in their own opinions.\n\n\"My mother did not know what games are. For example, when I am playing in a match, I can't pause the game, but she wants me to stop playing right away with considering whether this would end the game or afect my rank in the game ... She did not allow me to buy a Desktop PC. She assumed that I would use the PC to play games ... She never considered that I could use it to do meaningful things as well. \" -(P1, w2) Most of the adolescents and their parent remarked that before the study, they regularly had arguments over phone use. Despite making promises with their parents, the adolescents usually failed to exhibit self-control over their phone use.\n\n\"It is hard to communicate with her when dealing with phone use issues, and we used to argue over this issue almost every day. I constantly had to scold her to stop her from using her phone. If she did not listen to me, I would take the phone away from her. It is tiring making and enforcing these rules. \" -(F2, w1) One parent (F5) resorted to a parental control app to limit smartphone use. F5 was satisfed using Family Link prior to the pandemic; however, during the pandemic, her nursing responsibilities kept her away from home and her daughter needed to use the tablet for online courses. Thus, it was difcult to limit her daughter to online courses.\n\n\"[How did you use Family Link to regulate your daughter's pad device use?] Originally, I only allowed her to use her tablet for 30 minutes per day. However, during the pandemic, she needed the tablet for her online courses, so she constantly called me during work for more time. I was too busy to add time every time she reached time limit. So, I ended up removing the time limit once and for all. \" -(F5, w1)\n\nIn this study, we examined how TechLifeProbe prevents negative communication loops and fosters opportunities to improve the smartphone addiction as follows.\n\nMost of the adolescents said that before the study, all discussions pertaining to phone use ended in confict.\n\n\"We had an argument every time I tried to negotiate with my mom about using my phone, because we had our own opinions. [How would you end the arguments?] I used to give my mom the silent treatment, stay away from her, and do my own thing. \" -(P5, w2) Some parent participants commented that to avoid inefective communication, they preferred to communicate with their children when they were in a good mood or not occupied by other life routines. Otherwise, their kids would just ignore what they were saying or pay only cursory attention. All of the parents in this study were living with their children, so they were able to observe their kids in terms of phone use, lifestyle, and well-being. Nonetheless, it is usually easy for adolescents to avoid using their phones in front of their parents.\n\nThus, it is difcult to infer usage based solely rely on the observations of parents. The sharing of phone-use data and corresponding indicators of well-being was meant to foster communication by giving both parties a clear understanding of the extent of the problem. To our surprise, all of the adolescents reported feeling fne about sharing phone use records and other data. In daily life, parents were busy at their daily routine or work. They might have no chance or cannot fnd the right timing to chat with their children as mentioned earlier. On the other hand, the adolescents were also occupied with their studies and felt weird to speak out their inner feelings, not to mention using data to facilitate their communication with parents over smartphone addiction (as also indicated in the average rating towards Qb of the post-study questionnaire). With TechLifeProbe, P4 expressed that he can still communicate with his mom about his CHI '22, April 29-May 5, 2022, New Orleans, LA, USA mood and wellbeing even though he did not actively talk with his mom. \"... I think that TechLifeProbe gave her [P4's mom] a good idea of my feelings every day. [Would you tell her directly?] I wouldn't do that ... it's weird. I don't know, I just want to let her know my feelings and status.\" -(P4, w1) Sharing lifestyle data along with phone use data can not only increase the awareness of parents (Section 4.3.2) but also provide some conversation starters to the adolescents for naturally creating more communication between adolescents and parents. For example, P6 commented that before the study, she seldom talked with their parents during a day, not to mention phone use behaviors.\n\n\"[When would you chat with you mom?] I have to go to school and my mom has to go to work. During the summer break, we have our own life routines, so we rarely chatted. Even when I saw her at home, I would only say hi and have a short conversation. \" -(P6, w1) F6 mentioned that P6 showed of her records of step counts but did not care about the phone use numbers.\n\n\"[Did your daughter chat with you about the numbers?] She would not take the initiative to discuss the numbers with me. I felt she did not care the number that much. However, when she saw progress, she would come to show of the numbers to me, saying, 'You know how many steps I walked today? . . . more than 16,000 steps. ' But she would not tell me when she only walked 2000 steps. She was able to overlook the small step counts and rarely mentioned the phone use numbers.\" -(F6, w2) Other parent participants commented that TechLifeProbe helped them to identify topics of conversation.\n\n\"Sometimes, we joke around. For example, after I saw data indicating that she fell asleep late at night, I would say 'you stayed up late. What were you doing? [with funny tone]' She would respond with 'Nothing. I just couldn't sleep'. The data collected by the app helped me to fnd topics for chatting with my daughter. It is important to communicate with her. \" -(F3, w1) Overall, TechLifeProbe was shown to serve as a communication bufer between adolescents and their parents by deferring discussions to times at which both parties feel comfortable broaching the subject.\n\n\"The data indicated that she got enough sleep and had enough time to play games on her pad device. I realized that it was a good opportunity to chat with her. If she did not sleep enough or play enough, she would not be willing to discuss anything [including phone use issues]. \" -(F5, w2)\n\nIn seeking to regulate phone use behavior, parents would actively provide suggestions and reminders. However, without knowing the context, the suggestions are not always constructive, and as these suggestions accumulate, they begin to feel like nagging. The data collected by TechLifeProbe can encourage parents to take a step back, as long as the numbers indicate that the child is on the right track.\n\n\"The data I receive makes it possible for me to track her problem more precisely. The app presents a lot of data. I can pick one or two factors indicating her phone use behavior. If the numbers show an improvement and I feel she isn't improving, then I can let go of the past problems. However, if the numbers get worse, I pay more attention. Unless she goes too far, it is better to give her control over her phone use. \" -(F3, w1) The parents reported that before the study, they could provide only vague suggestions or reminders based on observations. The data they get from the app can be used as evidence of their assertions and also helps them to assess of the situation more objectively.\n\n\"Before using this app, it was hard to discuss this problem with him. He just did not listen to me, because I did not have evidence on his phone use. With this app, I was able to use the collect numbers as proof. For example, if he used the phone for twelve or thirteen hours, I would mention that he had spent too much time on his phone and ask him when he did his homework?' He could not argue with me. The data allowed me to take a frm stand when communicating with him. \" -(F1, w1) Many of the adolescents reported that the app allowed their parents to make more reasonable suggestions or reminders, by giving them objective numbers to characterize phone use.\n\n\"One day, I paid more attention to my sleep time because my mom saw (in TechLifeProbe) that I had not been sleeping, and asked me if I had gone back to sleep after waking up. [...] This data allowed my mom and I to have a more focused discussion about my sleep issues, instead of asking many questions before getting to the point. \" -(P7, w2) Some of the parents were concerned that continually giving suggestions/reminders would be useless. It would be better to defer suggestions/reminders until they had data indicating the need for intervention.\n\n\"I need to think about how to communicate with her. It would be useless if the timing was not right. I prefer to observe until I fnd an opportunity to talk to her about a specifc problem. For example, if she stayed up very late, I would it as an opportunity to ask her if she had started playing games again ... Otherwise, I wouldn't bother her. I personally care more about her sleep hours, and have grown weary of nagging about her phone use problems all day long. \" -(F2, w1)\n\nThe diary entries were also shown to reduce tensions by clarifying the diferences in opinion.\n\n\"When we took the bus, I asked her, 'Why were there so many diferences between my observations and your self-reports in yesterday's diary. I felt that you were bored when you reported feeling happy. ' She responded that she had gone to grandma's home and received a gift.' Then, I realized why she responded that way.\" -(F6, w1)"

      "title": "Supporting Efective Family Communication on Adolescents' Smartphone Addiction",
      "text": "Communication between parents and adolescents is tricky because children in their adolescent stage are typically seeking autonomy  [43] . Smartphone addiction is complicated by the fact that cell phones function as an expression of autonomy  [51, 59, 98] . Claims that it would be reasonable for adolescents to spend their summer breaks using their smartphones appears to be an attempt to justify screen addiction as well as desire to take control of their time. Thus, any attempt to control screen time could perceived by their children as an attempt to encroach on their autonomy, leading to confict. Under these conditions, this issue cannot be addressed meaningfully in day-to-day interactions. Both parents and children reported their attempts at communication as \"inefective\" due to (1) Timing (both parties are in a bad mood when the topic arises),  (2)  Misalignment in the interests of parents and children with respect to smartphone use, and (3) An absence of shared conversation topics apart from smartphone addiction.\n\nOverall, TechLifeProbe is meant to assist in overcoming nonproductive communication about smartphone addiction between parents and children by  (1)  making it easier for adolescents to see their screen time in context, (2) identifying opportunities to remind adolescents of their actual behavior, and (3) highlighting the common goal of maintaining a healthy lifestyle and achieving wellbeing to serve as a communication bufer. By making adolescents aware of their screen time, it is hoped that many of the issues that lead to friction between parents and children can be resolved. When individuals are aware that they share common goals, they are able to discuss screen addiction from a common perspective. Furthermore, actual numbers provide an objective indication of behavior, which carries considerable weight in promoting change.\n\nThe parents and adolescents both mentioned that sharing detailed lifestyle and phone usage data enhanced their mutual understanding and led to helpful reminders/suggestions. This data made it easier for parents to identify important issues, while giving their children contextual advice, which is far more difcult to gloss over or disregard outright.\n\nThe app also provides constructive topics for conversation. One previous study suggested the building of healthy habits to motivate adolescents to regulate their screen time  [102] . Our results suggest that another fruitful avenue would be to explore alternative topics of conversation, which are of interest to both parties. Taken together, our results suggest that efective communication must be specifc and opportunistic with a focus that extends to practical issues beyond the addiction itself. Researchers dealing with issues such as this must seek to foster communication by  (1)  redirecting the attention of parents and adolescents toward other practical topics, such as health-related issues, (2) suggesting topics of interest for parents and children, and (3) providing objective health-related data for consideration. One approach would involve gamifying the app experience. As with the Forest app  [13] , designers could visualize the interests of both parties using objects (e.g., various types of trees) based on health-related data and the eforts of children to work toward the goal."

      "title": "Aiming to Provide Behavioral Support for Tech Addiction",
      "text": "We found that the adolescents tended to downplay or even deny their technology addiction. Enhancing awareness of smartphone use was not necessarily sufcient to promote meaningful changes in behavior. Several contextual constraints prevented the participants from engaging in behavioral change: (1) Lock down regulations under COVID-19, (2) A lack of alternative social or physical activities, and (3) A highly structured life routine imposed by parents and/or the school. Participants were also limited by personal constraints:\n\n(1) A lack of self-efcacy, (2) Poor self-control, and (3) A sense of entitlement to leisure time.\n\nContextual constraints have been shown to play a key role in addictive behaviors, such as high-intensity drinking  [85] , online gaming  [85] , or internet-related behaviors in general  [26] , become more pronounced when alternatives are limited and environmental constraints/reinforcements are present. The matching law of choice behavior posits that the behavior of an individual is contingent on the options available to them and the amount of reinforcement  [57] . Addictive behaviors is promoted by the reinforcement provided by technology, such as low efort and immediate rewards  [26] , such that other available behaviors are unable to compete. By identifying contextual factors, it is possible to pinpoint constraints specifc to a target population and implement ecological momentary interventions (EMI)  [56] .\n\nFuture designs of TechLifeProbe should consider contextual constraints in implementing interventions. It should be possible to include a geographic information system to identify nearby alternative activities or friends with whom to interact. In the event that physical resources are unavailable, then the application could suggest virtual resources (e.g., meaningful online apps)  [94] . Our fndings also indicated the importance of temporal interventions. Many of the participants reported that they felt entitled to use their smartphones during break times. This indicates the importance of providing interventions during these breaks to direct the participants to engage in alternative activities. Parents can also provide reinforcement and suggestions about alternative activities.\n\nAlternatively, it is possible to leverage the support of parents in providing reinforcement and suggestions about alternative activities. The parents in this study reported that they became increasingly aware of what their children were doing with their smartphones in situations where they could not attend. The data provided by TechLifeProbe also made it possible for parents to triangulate their observations about their children with objective data. The risk factors for pathological addiction manifest at multiple levels, including the biological, psychological, and social  [114] ; therefore, interventions should employ support from multiple sources. In addition to using technological support for mediated intervention, parents can arrange other ways to mitigate technology use, such as physical activities. Parents can also serve the role of positive reinforcement in EMI (outlined in the following subsection).\n\nIt may sound counter-intuitive to use smartphones to deal with smartphone addiction; however, it is important to remember that these devices have become an indispensable part of everyone's lives. Psychologists have described the internet as a socio-cognitive environment in which users engage in miscellaneous practices and that in turn shapes user behaviors. Under these constraints, it is unlikely that it would be possible for most people to withdraw from technology cold turkey  [87] . Thus, the goal should not be to minimize or eliminate technology use. Rather, it is preferable to leverage this technology in developing interventions to deal with pathological behaviors  [104] . Mobile technologies are widely used to monitor individuals struggling with addiction  [56, 108] . Psychologists suggest that interventions for addiction should identify cognitive problems that prevent users from taking advantage of technological contextual afordances  [87, 99] . Adolescents who are still developing their cognitive skills are easily infuenced by apps and the functions of smartphones, which are often framed by their current context  [48] . Nonetheless, they are able to use smartphones in many ways and in multiple contexts with the always-available Internet connectivity and smartphone mobility.\n\nThe adolescents in this study made it clear that they were under personal constraints, such as a lack of self-efcacy, reduced selfcontrol, and a sense of entitlement to use devices during their leisure time. In addressing these constraints, future designs should aim to break down the eforts made by adolescents to overcome their addictions. Researchers have suggested that most internet activities required low efort and provide immediate rewards  [26] . Thus, it has been posited that interventions should provide the same benefts in order to maintain the interest of adolescents as they gradually learn how to control their smartphone addictions through enhanced self-efcacy. Setting high expectations would only deter users and reinforce addictive practices. Incrementally substituting addictive practices with alternatives appropriate to the level of the patients [103] could help to build a sense of efcacy by implementing changes in manageable steps. It should also be possible to employ the methods of persuasive technology (e.g., reducing, tunneling, and tailoring)  [112]  in which tasks are based on the preferences of the user and actions are broken down into manageable sub-tasks.\n\nAs with TechLifeProbe, future developments should focus on enhancing awareness of the impact of behavioral changes through the visualization of technology use patterns, records of physiological data, or self-reported diary, for promoting refection. Researchers have suggested that awareness is associated with adaptive cognitive coping  [97] . The participants in this study made it clear that seeing device usage data compelled them to improve their lifestyles and well-being. Future studies could use quantitative research methods to identify the relationship between awareness and behavioral change. It might also be possible to investigate the efects of awareness designs using longitudinal studies."

      "title": "Assisting Parents to Implement Adequate Parental Control When Needed",
      "text": "In developing the proposed system, we opted not to incorporate parental control features, given that our current research goal is to understand how TechLifeProbe enhances awareness of phone use and facilitates communication between parents and adolescents. As evidenced by dysregulation, impulsivity, and risk-taking  [54] , it is clear that most adolescents who are developing self-control attend only to immediate pleasures and ignore the adverse consequences of long-term and addictive smartphone use  [118] .\n\nChina has recently tightened controls on online gaming  [24] ; however, such eforts afect only a portion of smartphone usage. Nonetheless, many adolescents fnd workarounds to bypass regulations, such as buying fake accounts  [8] . Most importantly, this approach receives criticism for its encroachment into family life  [24] . Given that parents play an important role in supporting adolescents to develop self-control  [81]  and their support is an integral part of setting boundaries in smartphone use  [92, 106] , using government-regulated approaches without involving parents in the mechanism may disrupt the process and spawn other issues at home, such as friction in parent-adolescent communication.\n\nMany parental control apps, such as Family Link, have been developed to assist parents in controlling screen time  [9, 17, 20] . Nonetheless, parents difer considerably in terms of parenting style  [36] . Only half of the parents in the current study agreed with maintaining frm control over phone use with such methods, as they wanted their children to develop a sense of autonomy. Excessive restrictions have been shown to hinder the development of self-control  [90] . F5 reported allowing her daughter to play games only 30 minutes a day and enforcing this restriction using Family Link. Family Link allows for customized time-limit rules; however, they must continually adjust the controls in accordance with the daily routine of the child (e.g., weekday vs. weekend). Transitioning between modes can be inconvenient for both the child and parent, particularly for those with a busy work schedule. Furthermore, children tend to view parental controls as a threat to their autonomy or an invasion of privacy  [29] . Under such conditions, many children would choose not to share phone usage data or manage secret accounts  [10, 11] . Nearly all of the parents in this study reported that their children followed rules when they were in elementary school, but became more difcult as they entered junior high school.\n\nExisting solutions require that parents take full responsibility for setting up rules (e.g., parental control apps  [9, 17, 20] ) or that rely entirely on the child to self-monitor their behavior (e.g., selfmonitoring apps  [1, 5, 16, 18, 22, 23] ). We argue that neither topdown restrictions (from parents) nor bottom-up self-control (by adolescents) are ideal. We prefer the middle ground. The child who had to use Family Link (P5) reported that she would be more willing to use TechLifeProbe than Family Link. The mother of P5 also reported that awareness of phone use clarifed the reasons for the regulations.\n\nThus, a shared understanding of these issues could most economically be achieved by providing grounded visual representations of data related to issues in which both parties are interested, such as lifestyle or well-being. This would make it possible for parents to clarify the reasons for establishing rules. Moreover, future designs should incorporate metrics by which to assess one's self-control  [54]  in order to give the adolescent a sense of self-efcacy by being autonomous, while enabling timely parental interventions when necessary.\n\nFirst, it was difcult to recruit participants during the COVID-19 outbreaks and corresponding lockdown. Furthermore, this study was limited to smartphones and did not address other devices, such as laptops, game consoles, or tablets. TechLifeProbe was developed as an Android application and is inapplicable to the iPhone. In the future, it will be necessary to explore the efectiveness of the proposed system in a broader environment that includes multiple devices.\n\nAdolescents are still developing their cognitive ability, such that they may have been limited in their ability to express their thoughts  [15, 49]  and sometimes provide untrustworthy responses  [45]  to interview questions. This was our primary reason for interviewing their parents with a parallel set of questions. We hoped that this additional data would bridge potential gaps and provide a references to which the adolescents could respond.\n\nFinally, this study was conducted over a period of only two weeks, which is probably not long enough to observe meaningful changes in behavior. Also, due to our small sample size, we provided a more qualitative assessment, which yielded meaningful insights into the potential means by which TechLifeProbe could motivate adolescents to improve their lifestyle and in turn reduce phone use. Future studies should consider running longitudinal research to investigate how other designs enhance awareness and the corresponding behavioral changes."

      "text": "This paper introduces a novel system for monitoring cell phone usage and corresponding data related to lifestyle and well-being. We then assessed the system in a 2-week technology probe study involving seven dyads of adolescents with smartphone addiction and their parents. Qualitative results revealed that this data could be used to motivate adolescents to moderate cell phone use. The sharing of this data with parents was also shown to prevent negative communication loops and generate opportunities to moderate smartphone addiction."
