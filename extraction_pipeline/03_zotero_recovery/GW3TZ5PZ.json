  "title": "Mobile App-Based Interventions to Support Diabetes Self-Management: A Systematic Review of Randomized Controlled Trials to Identify Functions Associated with Glycemic Efficacy",
  "abstract": "Background: Mobile health apps for diabetes self-management have different functions. However, the efficacy and safety of each function are not well studied, and no classification is available for these functions. \n Objective: The aims of this study were to (1) develop and validate a taxonomy of apps for diabetes self-management, (2) investigate the glycemic efficacy of mobile app-based interventions among adults with diabetes in a systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs), and (3) explore the contribution of different function to the effectiveness of entire app-based interventions using the taxonomy. \n Methods: We developed a 3-axis taxonomy with columns of clinical modules, rows of functional modules and cells of functions with risk assessments. This taxonomy was validated by reviewing and classifying commercially available diabetes apps. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, the Chinese Biomedical Literature Database, and ClinicalTrials.gov from January 2007 to May 2016. We included RCTs of adult outpatients with diabetes that compared using mobile app-based interventions with usual care alone. The mean differences (MDs) in hemoglobin A 1c (HbA 1c ) concentrations and risk ratios of adverse events were pooled using a random-effects meta-analysis. After taxonomic classification, we performed exploratory subgroup analyses of the presence or absence of each module across the included app-based interventions. Results: Across 12 included trials involving 974 participants, using app-based interventions was associated with a clinically significant reduction of HbA 1c (MD 0.48%, 95% CI 0.19%-0.78%) without excess adverse events. Larger HbA 1c reductions were noted among patients with type 2 diabetes than those with type 1 diabetes (MD 0.67%, 95% CI 0.30%-1.03% vs MD 0.37%, 95% CI -0.12%-0.86%). Having a complication prevention module in app-based interventions was associated with a greater HbA 1c reduction (with complication prevention: MD 1.31%, 95% CI 0.66%-1.96% vs without: MD 0.38%, 95% CI 0.09%-0.67%; intersubgroup P=.01), as was having a structured display (with structured display: MD 0.69%, 95% CI 0.32%-1.06% vs without:",

      "text": "Diabetes mellitus poses enormous challenges to China's health care system due to its mortality, prevalence, and costs. Of 8.3 million deaths in China in 2010, 37.3% (3.1 million) were attributable to cardiovascular disease, which was also one of the leading causes of disability-adjusted life-years  [1] . Diabetes is not only an independent risk factor for cardiovascular disease  [2] , but also associated with increased mortality from a range of cardiovascular diseases (eg, ischemic heart disease and stroke), as well as noncardiovascular diseases (eg, infections) among Chinese adults  [3] . In 2008, the estimated prevalence of diabetes was 9.7%, accounting for 92.4 million adults with diabetes  [4] . A more recent cross-sectional survey reported an even larger estimate (11.6% among Chinese adults, ie, 113.9 million) in 2010  [5] . In addition, expenditures for the medical care of patients with diabetes were 3.38 times higher than for people with normal glucose tolerance  [6] .\n\nOnce diabetes is diagnosed, lifetime diabetes self-management is critical to glycemic control and is associated with the long-term prognosis for patients with diabetes. Diabetes self-management includes self-monitoring blood glucose, making healthy lifestyle choices (healthy eating, physical activity, tobacco cessation, weight management, and coping with stress), taking and managing medications, preventing diabetes complications (self-monitoring of foot health; active participation in screening for eye, foot, and renal complications; and immunizations), and setting self-selected behavioral goals  [2] . In China, diabetes self-management education and support are provided during outpatient visits and are a huge burden on patients, their families, and the health system. Hence, a more cost-effective way to provide diabetes self-management education and support is essential for reducing the socioeconomic burden of diabetes.\n\nMobile apps are the computer programs or software installed on smart mobile devices, with computing and connectivity capability built right into an operating system. With the rapid and ongoing growth in wireless connectivity, more than 500 million Chinese were smartphone and apps users in 2016  [7] . In addition to their universality, apps provide real-time interactions and data transmission, which can be used in providing diabetes self-management education and support  [8] [9] [10] . Accordingly, the American Diabetes Association (ADA) guideline has stated that mobile apps may be a useful element of effective lifestyle modification to prevent diabetes  [2] .\n\nIn the iTunes App Store for iOS and Google Play for Android, diabetes is one of the top-ranked categories  [11, 12] , with more than 1100 different apps available for download. In contrast, according to a recent systemic review  [13] , there were only 5 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) assessing the effectiveness of apps in diabetes self-management. The contrast between the number of commercially available apps and the number of RCTs of apps demonstrates a shocking lack of evidence to support the recommendation of a specific app for diabetes self-management. Consequently, it is extremely difficult for clinicians and patients to choose a safe and effective one among the thousands of available apps  [14] .\n\nDespite their variety and complexity, apps for diabetes self-management always share a limited number of basic functions, which can be classified into several simple categories (eg, self-monitoring, education, alerts and reminders, and communication)  [15] . Therefore, indirect evidence from systematic reviews of existing RCTs can give insight into the efficacy of each app function, which is helpful in estimating the effectiveness of a specific app and making recommendations for effective functions. Nevertheless, prior systematic reviews involving mobile app-based interventions with multiple functions have not attempted to investigate their differential effectiveness  [16] [17] [18] . As a result, it remains unclear how their functions contribute to the efficacy of apps.\n\nTo address functional efficacy, a classification of app functions is required  [19] . Moreover, the classification should be comprehensive, with not only considerations of functions but also recommendations for clinical practice  [15] , as well as risk assessment  [20, 21] . However, existing classifications are inconsistent, and they primarily focus on functions  [16, 17, 20, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Inconsistency and incompleteness have limited their use in classifying functions of diabetes self-management apps.\n\nThe aims of this systematic review of RCTs were to (1) develop and validate a taxonomy of apps for diabetes self-management, (2) perform a meta-analysis investigating the effects of mobile app-based interventions on glycemic control in adults with diabetes, and (3) explore the contribution of different functions to the glycemic efficacy of entire app-based interventions using the taxonomy and subgroup analyses."

Multimedia Appendix 1, part A, shows the flow chart of taxonomy development.

We searched the iTunes App Store (Apple Inc, Cupertino, CA, USA) and Google Play (Google Inc, Mountain View, CA, USA) (for the United States and China, February 1, 2016) using the terms \"diabetes\" OR \"blood glucose\" to identify apps for diabetes management. Apps with real-time interactions and any functions supporting self-monitoring of blood glucose were included. We excluded apps that were duplicated or were designed for health care providers. Apps that did not have English or Chinese versions and that had not been updated for at least 5 years were also excluded."

We also excluded studies if their participants were children, adolescents, or pregnant women who required different therapeutic strategies for a more challenging or strict glycemic control  [2] . Studies of apps for continuous glucose monitoring or continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion were excluded due to their medical devices nature. We excluded interventions without real-time interactions (eg, frequent interactions or passive interactions).\n\nTwo reviewers (YW and YD) independently screened titles and abstracts and then full texts to select eligible studies.

      "text": "We designed a preliminary taxonomy with a functional axis, a clinical axis, and a risk axis as shown in Multimedia Appendix 1, part C. The functional axis consisted of 5 technical modules (ie, log, structured display, general education, personalized feedback, and communication) whose descriptive details were refined by previous classifications. The clinical axis consisted of 5 diabetes management modules (ie, monitoring, medication management, lifestyle modification, complication prevention, and psychosocial care) referring to the ADA guideline  [2] . Functions were specified by crossing the functional axis (module) and the clinical axis (module), where we made sure that each function belonged to a functional or clinical classification, or both.\n\nWe developed the risk axis based on the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) risk-based recommendation  [36] . This recommendation classifies functionalities of mobile health technology into 3 categories: administrative (eg, general-purpose communication and population health management), which pose limited or no risk to patient safety; health management (eg, some clinical decision support and medication management), which pose potential but generally low risks; and medical device (eg, medical device accessories and medical device clinical decision support software), which present a relatively higher risk to patient safety. We assessed the risks of functions as low, potential, and high, accordingly.\n\nDuring validation, we identified 1559 apps by searching the iTunes App Store and Google Play and excluded 1414 apps that were duplicated, were not for diabetes-management, were without English or Chinese versions, and had not been updated for at least 5 years. The remaining 145 eligible apps were downloaded onto smart mobile devices. After excluding those without real-time interactions and designed solely for health care providers, we included 96 apps and classified them by the preliminary taxonomy. As we could well classify all functions among the included apps by the taxonomy, and we identified all modules in the taxonomy in the included apps, we proposed the final taxonomy after this validation (Table  1 ). c Medications for diabetes include insulin, oral antidiabetic agents, aspirin, antihypertensives, lipid-lowering medications, and vaccines.\n\nd Self-monitoring parameters include blood glucose, blood pressure, heart rate, and pulse.\n\ne Other medical parameters include cholesterol levels, hemoglobin A 1c , urine test, and ketones. f Activities include steps, duration, heart rate, and consumed calories; diets include food, water, nutritional values, carbohydrate counting, and calorie calculator; weight includes body mass index, body fat, and circumference. g Complication-related status includes smoking, drinking, snoring, feet, eyes, teeth, and sensory status.\n\nh Acute complications include hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia; chronic complications include cardiovascular disease and microvascular complications (ie, nephropathy, retinopathy, neuropathy). i Clinical decision making is recommending treatment (eg, oral agents and insulin) by algorithms alone without the participation of health care providers. j Self-management decision making is decision making on lifestyle modification by algorithms.\n\nk N/A: not applicable."

This process excluded 55 studies, with the reasons listed in Multimedia Appendix 3. We included 12 trials from 13 references in a qualitative systematic review, evaluating 12 independent app-based interventions involving 974 outpatients with diabetes. Figure  1  shows the flow of study selection.\n\nAcross the 13 included references, the HbA 1c was obtained from 12 trials with 974 participants after a median follow-up period of 6 (range 3-12) months, and severe hypoglycemia was extracted from 4 trials of 346 participants after a median follow-up of 6 months. There were 5 trials that enrolled patients with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM), 5 with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and 2 with both types of diabetes.\n\nOf the 12 included mobile app-based interventions, 1 is available in the iTunes Store and Google Play at the time of our study  [37] . After taxonomic classification, all 12 included interventions had monitoring as a diabetes management module, followed by lifestyle modification (11/12, 92%), medication management (8/12, 67%), and complication prevention (2/12, 17%). Psychosocial care was not distinguished in any of the included interventions. For functional modules, all 12 interventions had a log as a basic functional module, followed by communication (9/12, 75%), a structured display (8/12, 67%), personalized feedback (8/12, 67%), and general education (6/12, 50%). To be noted, the included interventions only had patient-clinician communication instead of general communication.\n\nVarious technologies were applied for data transmission between users and mobile devices. Across the 12 included trials, 6 (50%) used wireless transmission through Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, near-field communication, or public switched telephone network, 5 (42%) used manual entry, and 1 (8%) used wire transmission through a data port connection.\n\nOf the 12 included app-based interventions, we determined 3 (25%) to be of high risk due to having a clinical decision-making function. The definition of the clinical decision-making function was recommending treatment (eg, oral agents and insulin) by algorithms alone without the participation of health care providers. We determined that the other 9 interventions (75%) carried potential risk.

However, the funnel plot was found to be asymmetrical (Multimedia Appendix 5), with Egger test indicating a potential publication bias (P=.008). Overall, we used the GRADE approach to rate the quality of the evidence for HbA 1c as low due to the potential publication bias and study limitations (lack of allocation concealment, lack of blinding of participants and personnel, incomplete outcome data, selective reporting, and other biases as shown in Figure  2  and Figure  3 ; Multimedia Appendix 6).\n\nWe performed a post hoc exploratory analysis for 5 trials enrolling patients with T1DM and 5 trials enrolling patients with T2DM.

      "text": "As most commercially available apps for diabetes self-management were not tested by RCTs, both the patients and the clinicians needed indirect evidence to guide their assessment while choosing apps. The purposes of this review were to investigate the glycemic efficacy of mobile app-based interventions, and to explore the differential effectiveness of their functions. We could not use existing classifications for the functions of the app-based interventions because of inconsistency and incompleteness. As a result, we developed and validated a comprehensive taxonomy for the functions of diabetes self-management apps. To our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive taxonomy with clinical, functional, and risk axes, and this is the first review exploring the contribution of each function to the effectiveness of entire apps.\n\nThe meta-analysis of 12 RCTs demonstrated that app-based interventions were associated with a statistically and clinically significant HbA 1c reduction of 0.48% (95% CI 0.19%-0.78%). We noted larger HbA 1c reductions for patients with T2DM (MD 0.67%, 95% CI 0.30%-1.03%) than those with T1DM (MD 0.37%, 95% CI -0.12%-0.86%). The exploratory subgroup analyses showed that having a clinical decision-making function in app-based interventions was not associated with a greater HbA 1c reduction (with clinical decision making: MD 0.19%, 95% CI -0.24%-0.63% vs without: MD 0.61%, 95% CI 0.27%-0.95%; intersubgroup P=.14). There were no excess adverse events related to the included app-based interventions."

      "title": "Comparison With Prior Work",
      "text": "Consistent with previous reviews involving mobile app-based interventions  [16] [17] [18] , our study indicated that the use of mobile app-based interventions is associated with a clinically significant HbA 1c reduction in the diabetes management of adult outpatients. Our results suggested that glycemic control of adult outpatients with diabetes can benefit from apps. A subgroup analysis of diabetes types showed a larger HbA 1c reduction in patients with T2DM than in those with T1DM. This difference is consistent with a previous review  [17]  and may be explained, at least in part, by the complexity of the management of T1DM  [2] . Patients with T1DM, especially those at a young age, require intensive management, which increases the burdens placed on the management of T1DM. Our result suggested that current apps may not be good enough to support the intensive management of T1DM.\n\nOur study developed a 3-axis taxonomy for diabetes apps, with rows of functional modules, columns of diabetes management modules, and cells of functions with risk assessments. The functional, clinical, and risk axes were developed based on previous classifications, the ADA's guidelines, and the FDA's risk recommendation, respectively. The 3-axis design of the taxonomy is comprehensive and decreases the possibility of misclassification. Additionally, this 3-axis design is applicable for diseases other than diabetes by adjusting the modules in the clinical axis. The validation process guarantees that our taxonomy can be used to classify commercial diabetes apps. Differences in the detected effect sizes in subsequent subgroup analyses indicated the utility of our taxonomy.\n\nOur taxonomy has some advantages. First, it is a comprehensive taxonomy with functional, clinical, and risk axes. The taxonomy permits subsequent exploratory subgroup analyses of multifunction apps, which give insights into the efficacy and risk of each module in diabetes apps. Comparatively, existing classifications appear to be incomplete or inconsistent. Previous classifications have mainly focused on the functions of apps, which, as a result, have made them applicable only for functional evaluation  [16, 17, [22] [23] [24] [25] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Some similar functions in these classifications have diverse definitions and descriptive details. Moreover, some functions lack clinical considerations, such as education, feedback, and decision support  [16, 17, [23] [24] [25] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Only 1 classification addresses risk assessment  [20] . These classifications, on the one hand, demonstrate a requirement to classify apps comprehensively, and on the other hand, they indicate the limitation of each independent classification. Second, our taxonomy can be of some help in the development and evolution of diabetes apps. App developers are usually technicians without a clinical background. As a result, the evidence-based guidelines for diabetes management are easily ignored during app development. For example, we found that complication prevention and psychosocial care were uncommon in the app-based interventions we examined. However, complication prevention behaviors and emotional well-being are associated with positive diabetes outcomes according to the guidelines  [2] . Previous reviews also suggested that diabetes apps lacked essential modules and neglected evidence-based guidelines  [15, 50] . With a clinical axis of diabetes management modules developed based on guidelines, our taxonomy makes it straightforward for app developers to follow evidence-based guidelines during the design and development of diabetes apps. Third, our taxonomy permits subsequent exploratory subgroup analyses of multifunction apps, which give insights into the efficacy and risk of each module in diabetes apps.\n\nOur exploratory subgroup analyses suggested a limited efficacy of clinical decision making, which was defined as recommending treatment (eg, oral agents and insulin) by algorithms alone without the participation of health care providers and was determined to be high risk according to our taxonomy. Traditionally, clinical decisions are made during a face-to-face interview after a complete assessment. Built-in clinical decision support systems, however, are less likely to collect data and assess status as thoroughly as face-to-face consultations do. Without adequate data and well-designed algorithms, clinical decision-making functions can make inappropriate decisions and pose risks to patients  [51, 52] .\n\nAdditionally, complex data collection may cause technical difficulties. Despite the above-mentioned issues, clinical decision making can be found in diabetes apps both in trials  [44] [45] [46]  and in app stores  [23, 28] . Therefore, we suggest that app developers should employ caution to add clinical decision making into diabetes apps, and patients should consult with health care providers on using apps for diabetes self-management.\n\nOur subgroup analyses indicated that having a complication prevention module in the apps was associated with a greater HbA 1c reduction. Complication prevention behaviors such as smoking cessation and hypoglycemia prevention are critical components of diabetes management according to current guidelines  [2] . However, only 2 included app-based interventions had a complication prevention module. Further studies are needed to confirm the efficacy of a complication prevention module. Meanwhile, having a structured display module was associated with a larger HbA 1c reduction. The structured display module may improve blood glucose self-monitoring behaviors by displaying structured self-monitoring of blood glucose profiles. Having a structured display is consistent with current clinical guidelines, in which self-monitoring of blood glucose is a critical element in the management of diabetes  [2] .\n\nHaving a lifestyle modification in app-based interventions was associated with a trend toward reduced HbA 1c , as was having a general education module. The modules of lifestyle modification and general education may raise awareness of lifestyle change and self-management. Since these 2 modules pose limited risks to patients with diabetes, it might be reasonable to add lifestyle modification and general education to diabetes apps.\n\nThe data suggested limited glycemic efficacy of having a personalized feedback module. However, considerable uncertainty and limitations exist regarding its efficacy. Given that the personalized feedback module has a relatively high risk, further evaluation is required before adding a personalized feedback module to diabetes apps. Consistent with a previous review  [15] , our review found that none of the interventions included a general communication function. Particular attention should be paid to the complexity and variety of the patient-clinician communication function as shown in Multimedia Appendix 8. As for the technologies, direct data transmission between users and mobile devices using wire or wireless connections was associated with a trend toward reduced HbA 1c , which could be explained by the convenience and accuracy of the technology."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "Our study also has some limitations. First, the exploratory and observational nature of our subgroup analyses and the possibility of misclassification prevented us from drawing a solid conclusion about the modular efficacies and risks. Second, we examined only 12 trials in our study, which may limit the strength of this systematic review. Third, we noted the asymmetry of the funnel plot, which indicated a potential risk of publication bias in our systematic review."

Mobile app-based interventions improve glycemic control in adult outpatients with diabetes, especially in those with T2DM.

Safety issues such as hypoglycemia and other adverse events are being overlooked and need attention in future investigations."
