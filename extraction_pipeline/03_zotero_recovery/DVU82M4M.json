  "title": "Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews [Intervention Review] Mobile phone text messaging and app-based interventions for smoking cessation",
  "abstract": "Background Mobile phone-based smoking cessation support (mCessation) offers the opportunity to provide behavioural support to those who cannot or do not want face-to-face support. In addition, mCessation can be automated and therefore provided affordably even in resource-poor settings. This is an update of a Cochrane Review first published in 2006, and previously updated in 2009 and 2012. \n Objectives To determine whether mobile phone-based smoking cessation interventions increase smoking cessation rates in people who smoke. \n Search methods For this update, we searched the Cochrane Tobacco Addiction Group's Specialised Register, along with clinicaltrials.gov and the ICTRP. The date of the most recent searches was 29 October 2018. \n Selection criteria Participants were smokers of any age. Eligible interventions were those testing any type of predominantly mobile phone-based programme (such as text messages (or smartphone app) for smoking cessation. We included randomised controlled trials with smoking cessation outcomes reported at at least six-month follow-up. \n Data collection and analysis We used standard methodological procedures described in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions. We performed both study eligibility checks and data extraction in duplicate. We performed meta-analyses of the most stringent measures of abstinence at six months' follow-up or longer, using a Mantel-Haenszel random-effects method, pooling studies with similar interventions and similar comparators to calculate risk ratios (RR) and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). We conducted analyses including all randomised (with dropouts counted as still smoking) and complete cases only. \n Main results This review includes 26 studies (33,849 participants). Overall, we judged 13 studies to be at low risk of bias, three at high risk, and the remainder at unclear risk. Settings and recruitment procedures varied across studies, but most studies were conducted in high-income countries. There was moderate-certainty evidence, limited by inconsistency, that automated text messaging interventions were more effective than minimal smoking cessation support (RR 1.54, 95% CI 1.19 to 2.00; I 2 = 71%; 13 studies, 14,133 participants). There was also \n Mobile phone text messaging and app-based interventions for smoking cessation (Review)",

Two studies comparing text messaging with other smoking cessation interventions, and three studies comparing high-and low-intensity messaging, did not show significant differences between groups (RR 0.92 95% CI 0.61 to 1.40; I 2 = 27%; 2 studies, 2238 participants; and RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.95 to 1.06; I 2 = 0%, 3 studies, 12,985 participants, respectively) but confidence intervals were wide in the former comparison. Five studies compared a smoking cessation smartphone app with lower-intensity smoking cessation support (either a lower-intensity app or non-app minimal support). We pooled the evidence and deemed it to be of very low certainty due to inconsistency and serious imprecision. It provided no evidence that smartphone apps improved the likelihood of smoking cessation (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.66 to 1.52; I 2 = 59%; 5 studies, 3079 participants). Other smartphone apps tested differed from the apps included in the analysis, as two used contingency management and one combined text messaging with an app, and so we did not pool them. Using complete case data as opposed to using data from all participants randomised did not substantially alter the findings."

      "title": "How the intervention might work",
      "text": "The benefits of mobile phone-based smoking cessation support (mCessation) interventions are: the ease of use anywhere at any time; cost-effective delivery and scalability to large populations, regardless of location; the ability to tailor messages to key user characteristics (such as age, sex, ethnicity); the ability to send time-sensitive messages with an 'always on' device; the provision of content that can distract the user from cravings; and the ability to link the user with others for social support.\n\nA key benefit of the use of mobile phones for health programmes is their widespread uptake in those areas where health services are not easily accessible or used. In 2018, the number of mobile phone subscriptions globally topped 8 billion, with the developing world now having more mobile phone subscriptions than population (population penetration of 102%; ITU 2018). There is evidence to suggest that people from lower socioeconomic groups may prefer mCessation interventions due to the greater feeling of control associated with the ability to decide when and where they engage with messages, and the perception of around-the-clock support (Boland 2017). Focusing mCessation efforts on the populations in greatest need, could help to address the health inequalities that come about from high use of tobacco and lack of accessible health promotion and prevention services in low-resource settings globally.\n\nFurthermore, initial research suggests that the use of text messaging for smoking cessation is cost effective. Guerriero 2013 found that the cost of text message-based support was GBP 278 per quitter. When the future health service costs saved (as a result of smoking cessation) were included, with 0.5 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) gained per quitter, text-based support was considered to be cost saving."

      "text": "Smartphones (mobile phones with a computer operating system) are fast becoming the computer of choice, or at least the most accessible computer, in many countries. According to the International Telecommunications Union only 36.3% of low-and middle-income countries has a computer in the household, but 61% have mobile broadband subscriptions (allowing mobile phones to access to the Internet; ITU 2018). Therefore, it was important to update this review to include studies on the effectiveness of smartphone apps, as well as text messaging interventions, for smoking cessation."

We considered bias due to incomplete outcome as low risk where numbers lost to follow-up were clearly reported for each group, the overall loss was not greater than 50%, and the difference between groups was not greater than 20%, or sensitivity analysis showed that the direction of effect was not sensitive to different imputation methods for loss to follow-up.\n\nEach review author recorded information in study reports relevant to each relevant domain and then judged each domain as either at low, high, or unclear risk of bias.

Gritz 2013 was excluded at this update, as their intervention (telephone counselling and help line) was significantly different from the other interventions included in this review. A telephone help line intervention does not need to be carried out using a mobile phone specifically. Therefore, 11 of the previously included studies were included at this update, as well as one previously 'ongoing' study that was changed to 'included' as the study is now complete and data was available (Danaher 2019).\n\nFor this update of our review, the new literature search identified 370 studies (Figure  1 ). Many were duplicates, or unrelated and were immediately excluded at the title and abstract screening phase.\n\nWe screened the full-text of 71 reports of 62 studies, excluding 16 studies, and leaving 14 new studies eligible for inclusion at this update (Abroms 2017; Alessi 2017; Augustson 2017; Baskerville 2018; BinDhim 2018; Chan 2015; Cobos-Campos 2017; Garrison 2018; Herbec 2019; Liao 2018; Peiris 2019; Squiers 2017; Wilson 2016; Yu 2017). Data were supplied by the authors for two studies (Danaher 2019; Herbec 2019). Reasons for excluding studies included: intervention that was not predominantly a mobile phone programme; not a randomised controlled trial; relapse prevention only; or no abstinence outcome measured at \u2265 6 months follow-up (see Characteristics of excluded studies table for further details).

Bock 2013 (USA) found usual in-person recruitment methods slow and shifted to online recruitment methods during the study. Baskerville 2018 (Canada), Borland 2013 (Australia), Danaher 2019 (USA), Garrison 2018 (USA), Squiers 2017 (USA), Herbec 2019 (UK), and Abroms 2014 (USA) also used online recruitment via Internet advertisements. In Abroms 2014 this initially led to some fraudulent participants who were discovered and disqualified, and extra procedures were put in place to prevent this from happening again. Free 2009 and Free 2011 recruited via advertisements at UK primary care centres, smoking cessation clinics, pharmacies, newspapers, websites, bus billboards and on the radio in the UK, and Liao 2018 used similar advertising methods in China. Rodgers 2005 also used direct advertising via websites, email, and posters at tertiary institutions across New Zealand. Similarly Whittaker 2011 (New Zealand) used a wide range of advertising media, including M\u0101ori-specific media, and targeted young people. Alessi 2017 recruited through email, flyers, and print advertisements and Ferguson 2015 (Australia) used advertisements in papers, radio, and Facebook. Abroms 2017 was embedded in the Text4Baby text message (three messages a week) health information programme for pregnant women in the USA. Women who had smoked at least one puff in the past two weeks were eligible to also receive Quit4Baby text messages (between one to eight messages a day) to support smoking cessation. Augustson 2017 recruited through Nokia Life Tools, a service providing more than 100 million users with tools pre-installed on their Nokia mobile phones, in urban and rural areas of China's Zhejiang, Heilongjiang and Shaanxi provinces. BinDhim 2018 recruited through the Apple App Store in several countries (Australia, Singapore, UK, USA). Participants were advised that by downloading the app they would be participating in a study. Chan 2015 recruited through a Quit and Win competition in Hong Kong that was promoted in shopping malls and other public areas. Wilson 2016 mailed letters to potential participants in the US Veterans Administration health system. Naughton 2014 was set in primary care practices in the UK with trained smoking cessation advisors providing smoking cessation advice; Cobos-Campos 2017 in two health clinics in Spain with health advice provided by a doctor or nurse; and Tseng 2017 in large urban HIV clinics. Haug 2013 recruited in vocational schools and differed from the other studies by allowing the inclusion of occasional smokers (at least four cigarettes in the past month or at least one in the preceding week). Peiris 2019 (Australia) recruited via an Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Service, a regional community event, and the New South Wales Government telephone coaching service. Yu 2017 recruited in maternal-child health centres in China after asking mothers about household second-hand smoke exposure. The intervention included messages on both the harms of second-hand smoke (to the mother and her husband) and additional messages to the husband to encourage quitting. Four studies deliberately targeted young adults (Baskerville 2018 in Canada, Haug 2013 in Switzerland; Squiers 2017 in USA; Whittaker 2011 in New Zealand). Most studies had similar proportions of men and women or slightly more women than men. The exceptions were Abroms 2017, as the intervention was targeted at pregnant women (100% women), Wilson 2016, which recruited 89% male veterans, and the studies in China, where the rates of smoking in women are low (Chan 2015 > 80% men, Liao 2018 94.6% men, Yu 2017 100% men). Intervention programmes Text messaging All studies tested automated text messaging interventions. Eighteen of the included studies used text messaging (SMS) as a central component of the intervention (Abroms 2014; Abroms 2017; Augustson 2017; Bock 2013; Borland 2013; Chan 2015; Cobos-Campos 2017; Ferguson 2015; Free 2009; Free 2011; Haug 2013; Liao 2018; Naughton 2014; Rodgers 2005; Tseng 2017; Squiers 2017; Whittaker 2011; Yu 2017). Whittaker 2011 sent text messages containing links to theoretically driven video messages from 'ordinary' role models coping with quitting. Several studies paired text messages with in-person visits or assessments (Bock 2013; Cobos-Campos 2017; Haug 2013; Naughton 2014). The text message interventions varied in length from one week (Chan 2015), to five weeks (Ferguson 2015), six weeks (Augustson 2017; Yu 2017), eight weeks (Bock 2013; Squiers 2017), three months (Abroms 2017; Haug 2013; Naughton 2014; Tseng 2017), and six months (Abroms 2014; Cobos-Campos 2017; Free 2009; Free 2011; Liao 2018; Rodgers 2005; Whittaker 2011), or were variable (Borland 2013). Eight studies did not state that text messages were tailored to the individual (Abroms 2017; Augustson 2017; Chan 2015; Cobos-Campos 2017; Liao 2018; Tseng 2017; Squiers 2017; Yu 2017). In other studies using text messages, the degree of individual tailoring varied: \u2022 Abroms 2014 tailored messages to include first name, quit date, top three reasons for quitting, money saved by quitting, and use of quit-smoking medications; \u2022 Bock 2013 and Haug 2013 tailored messages to the stage of readiness to quit; \u2022 Borland 2013's programme could be interacted with by reporting changes in smoking behavior (e.g. a quit attempt, relapse), so that appropriate stage-specific messages could be sent; \u2022 Ferguson 2015 tailored their intervention text messages to contain advice and encouragement tailored to participants' current quit status (preparing to quit, first week of the quit attempt, second week of attempt etc.) \u2022 Free 2009 and Free 2011 tailored the messages to information collected at baseline about the individual; \u2022 Naughton 2014 individually tailored messages using 24 items from the iQuit questionnaire and information on smoking status at three and seven weeks; \u2022 Rodgers 2005 matched participant characteristics to messages by keyword to create an individualised programme; Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews \u2022 Whittaker 2011's participants selected the role model from whom they wished to receive messages. A number of text messaging interventions included interactive components such as: \u2022 the ability to text for more support in the instance of cravings or lapses (Abroms 2014; Bock 2013; Free 2011; Liao 2018; Naughton 2014; Rodgers 2005); \u2022 an optional Quit Buddy in Rodgers 2005 and Free 2011; \u2022 a Quit support network in Bock 2013; \u2022 polls and quizzes (Rodgers 2005); \u2022 regular checking in on smoking status (Haug 2013). Borland 2013 was the only study to include some degree of choice. Participants received offers of support via a personalised tailored Internet programme, a text message programme, both programmes, a choice of all three, or a minimal control. For the purposes of meta-analyses, we compared the text message group with the control group. Some of the included interventions were somewhat related to each other. The text messaging intervention in Rodgers 2005 was developed in New Zealand, and later adapted and tested in a UK pilot study (Free 2009), and then a large randomised controlled study (Free 2011). The intervention in Abroms 2017 was developed for pregnant women from the same group's previous intervention for adult smokers in Abroms 2014. The Augustson 2017 intervention in China was adapted from the smoke-free text programme that was evaluated in Squiers 2017. For further details of the messaging interventions across individual studies see the Characteristics of included studies table. The control conditions used in the text message studies could be categorised into four groups. \u2022 Minimal smoking cessation support (13 studies): the control programmes across the studies in this category varied from no smoking cessation support (Haug 2013; Yu 2017), to nonsmoking-related text messages sent two-weekly (Free 2009; Free 2011; Rodgers 2005; Whittaker 2011), or weekly (Liao 2018), to written or Internet untailored materials (Abroms 2014; Chan 2015; Ferguson 2015), to links to smoking cessation support (Borland 2013; Rodgers 2005), or regular general health advice provided by a clinician (Cobos-Campos 2017). Abroms 2017's control group participants received standard non-smoking-related Text4Baby text messages (three a week) without the extra smoking cessation-related Quit4Baby text messages. \u2022 Another form of smoking cessation support (matched to support received by the intervention group, but without the text messaging intervention; four studies): support varied across studies and included a single session of smoking cessation counselling plus non-smoking-related text messages (Bock 2013); smoking cessation behavioural support and pharmacotherapy (Naughton 2014), and behavioural support and pharmacotherapy (Tseng 2017). Participants in the comparison arm of Yu 2017 received inperson counselling and materials on establishing a smoke-free home. \u2022 Another form of smoking cessation support (not matched in the intervention arm; two studies): an Internet-based interactive smoking cessation programme (Borland 2013), and a fiveminute smoking cessation counselling session (Chan 2015). \u2022 Higher-versus lower-frequency text messaging. Three studies examined the effect of higher-versus lower-frequency text messages (Augustson 2017; Liao 2018; Squiers 2017). In Augustson 2017 this was comparing 91 messages over six weeks (three a day initially, followed by two a day, then one a day), with one text message a week for six weeks. In Liao 2018 this was three to five messages per day compared with three to five messages per week. Squiers 2017 compared smoking assessment and quit date messages only, with those messages plus motivational preparatory messages for two weeks prior to quitting, and with all of those messages plus six weeks of follow-up post-quit messages. Smartphone apps Five studies tested the effectiveness of smoking cessation smartphone apps alone (Baskerville 2018; BinDhim 2018; Garrison 2018; Herbec 2019; Peiris 2019). These apps varied considerably in intervention content and components. The app in Baskerville 2018 was described as comprehensive and evidence-informed, including components such as a quit plan, contingency reinforcement, a link to an online Facebook community, supportive messages through the app, web-based distraction, information and performance feedback, access to evidence-based cessation services. BinDhim 2018 described their app as a decision aid (based on the Ottawa Decision Support Framework drawing from a number of psychological and behavioural theories) with additional support with push notifications, messages, diary and benefits tracker. The Garrison 2018 app training modules taught mindfulness for smoking cessation and how to work through cravings. Herbec 2019 included craving management tools within an app that supported smokers to be smoke free for 28 days.\n\nThe control conditions used in these smoking cessation app studies could be categorised into two groups:\n\n\u2022 minimal non-app smoking cessation support that included: a printed self-help guide (Baskerville 2018), and encouragement to access available smoking cessation services (Peiris 2019); \u2022 less intensive app support that included an app that provided only basic information. In BinDhim 2018 this included information only on quitting (no structured process or support). Garrison 2018 delivered experience sampling to query smoking, craving, and mindfulness in real time, and the control app in Herbec 2019 was designed to be a minimally credible intervention that resembled the intervention but without key intervention components."

This was video recorded on the mobile phone and submitted using multimedia messaging. The CO result was provided via interactive voice response call. In the reinforcement arm of the trial, this was supplemented by negative CO test results (not smoking), which were rewarded with chances to win prizes. Therefore, the study had two arms that received mHealth CO monitoring as well as counselling and nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), with one of the arms also receiving rewards for smoking abstinence.

Two studies used self-reported four-week or 30-day point prevalence abstinence at six-month follow-up (Abroms 2017; Haug 2013), three studies used self-reported seven-day point prevalence at six months (Augustson 2017; Bock 2013; Danaher 2019), one used selfreported point prevalence abstinence at 32 weeks (Squiers 2017), one at 12 months (Yu 2017), and an additional four studies used sixmonth biochemically verified measures of seven-day point prevalence (Chan 2015; Ferguson 2015; Garrison 2018; Tseng 2017). Chan 2015 also provided biochemically verified seven-day point prevalence abstinence rates at 12-month follow-up.

In this case participants knew if they were receiving text messages or using an app. Therefore, we did not assess performance bias, and instead judged the likelihood of detection bias. We did not deem a study to be high risk for this domain where there was biochemical verification of abstinence, or where both arms received the same amount of face-to-face contact (or none).\n\nIn most cases, studies collected outcomes electronically and remotely (Abroms 2014; Augustson 2017; Baskerville 2018; BinDhim 2018; Bock 2013; Danaher 2019; Free 2009; Free 2011; Garrison 2018; Squiers 2017).

Cobos-Campos 2017 collected outcomes in person in the clinic and this was not blinded, however this was mitigated by biochemical verification of quitting. A number of the trials sought biochemical verification of longterm abstinence with salivary cotinine (Abroms 2014; Free 2009; Free 2011), urinary cotinine (Liao 2018), or expired CO (Cobos-Campos 2017; Garrison 2018). Chan 2015 assessed both CO and cotinine concentrations. Abroms 2017 biochemically validated their primary outcome at three months, but not at six months, and Rodgers 2005 validated abstinence at six weeks but not long-term follow-up. Similarly, Naughton 2014 used verification at four weeks only.\n\nWilson 2016 stated that they planned to verify abstinence at all follow-up points using salivary cotinine; however it is not stated whether the abstinence rates reported in their trial registry entry were the validated rates or not. However, as data was collected remotely this study was still deemed to be at low risk of bias for this domain. In fact, we deemed all studies to be at low risk of detection bias."

Therefore, it is not clear how much the clustering adjustment influences the result from this study and our meta-analyses. Rodgers 2005 suggested that some participants in their control group may have thought their incentive at follow-up (a month of free text messaging) depended on reporting quitting. This could account for an unexpected increase in control group participants reporting quitting from six weeks (109 participants) to six months (202 participants reporting no smoking in the past seven days), which could have led to an underestimation of the effect of the intervention."

In this update, we separated out comparisons ensuring that only similar interventions and similar controls were pooled in meta-analyses.\n\nOur analyses found moderate-certainty evidence (Summary of findings for the main comparison), that text messaging interventions are more effective than minimal smoking cessation support (Abroms 2014; Abroms 2017; Borland 2013; Chan 2015; Cobos-Campos 2017; Ferguson 2015; Free 2009; Free 2011; Haug 2013; Liao 2018; Rodgers 2005; Whittaker 2011; Yu 2017). Text messaging added to other smoking cessation interventions also appeared more effective than the other smoking cessation interventions alone (Bock 2013; Naughton 2014; Tseng 2017; Yu 2017; Summary of findings 2). However, when text messaging was compared with other smoking cessation interventions, the analysis did not find evidence that either the text messaging intervention or the other smoking cessation interventions resulted in superior quit rates. It is important to highlight that there were just two studies in this analysis and they each had slightly different contexts: Borland 2013 included people not seeking cessation support and participants were given 'suggestions about resources to use'; Chan 2015 was in the context of a Quit & Win contest.\n\nWe were also able to assess the effect of higher-versus lower-intensity text messages on long-term abstinence rates, using data pooled from three studies providing direct\n\ncomparisons (Augustson 2017; Liao 2018; Squiers 2017). The frequency of messaging did differ somewhat between studies (e.g. Augustson 2017 used on av-Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews erage 15 versus 1 text message per week; Liao 2018 used 21 to 35 versus 3 to 5 messages per week; and Squiers 2017 used, on average, 16 versus 5 versus 1 text message per week), but overall, this analysis did not provide evidence that the intensity of the text messaging intervention impacted on abstinence rates. On average high intensity interventions resulted in abstinence rates of 26.6% versus 27.1% in low intensity interventions. Studies of smartphone apps also included various control programmes. We found no evidence for a benefit of high intensity smartphone apps when compared with lower-intensity smoking cessation apps (BinDhim 2018; Garrison 2018; Herbec 2019), or minimal non-app smoking cessation support (Baskerville 2018; Peiris 2019\n\n), but we judged the evidence to be of very low certainty, meaning we have very little confidence in the effect estimate (Summary of findings 3) .\n\nDanaher 2019 was the only intervention that used both text messaging and a smartphone app and found that this combination resulted in higher quit rates than a web-based smoking cessation intervention."

      "title": "Overall completeness and applicability of evidence",
      "text": "Our review includes 26 studies with 33,849 participants. In comparison with previous reviews, there is now a much greater number of eligible studies, with increased sample sizes and including a greater diversity of settings and countries. We also found a large number of ongoing studies (n = 34), the results of which are likely to increase the diversity of contexts even further. This is the first update of this review where there were randomised controlled trials of smartphone apps eligible to be included. In 2011, a review of available smoking cessation apps found them to be lacking in adherence to cessation guidelines or theory (Abroms 2011). In this review the included smartphone apps, although few in number, tended to be based on evidence or theory and were tested in high-quality randomised controlled trials.\n\nThere has been criticism that smartphone apps may not be widely accessible to all, as they may rely on a certain degree of digital literacy and technology access that may not be widely dispersed in the population. It is important to note that in the included studies of smartphone apps there were reasonably high levels of education: 84% of participants in Garrison 2018 had greater than high school education; in BinDhim 2018, 53.7% had graduate level or higher education; in Baskerville 2018, 55.5% had post-secondary education or higher; Danaher 2019 included 70% with a high school graduate education and higher; and in Herbec 2019, 68.7% had a post-16 years qualification.\n\nA common criticism of randomised controlled trials is that whilst they might provide evidence of effectiveness in a clinical trial setting, these data are not applicable to 'real-world' settings. We are aware that many countries are implementing mCessation interventions and encourage routine monitoring and evaluation of these programmes, which will provide important 'real-world' evidence for consideration alongside the research evidence."

      "title": "Certainty of the evidence",
      "text": "There was moderate-certainty evidence that text messaging increases quit rates by approximately 50% when compared to minimal support for smoking cessation (Summary of findings for the main comparison). We downgraded the evidence by one level due to inconsistency as there was substantial unexplained statistical heterogeneity. This means the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different.\n\nThere was also moderate-certainty evidence that text messages increase quit rates by approximately 60% when tested as an addition to other smoking cessation support (Summary of findings 2). We downgraded results by one level due to imprecision: there were fewer than 300 events overall, and confidence intervals encompassed minimal benefit and substantial benefit.\n\nThere was very low-certainty evidence regarding the effect of smartphone apps compared to lower-intensity support (Summary of findings 3). This is due to inconsistency (considerable unexplained statistical heterogeneity) and very serious imprecision, with confidence intervals encompassing both clinically significant harm and clinically significant benefit."

      "title": "Potential biases in the review process",
      "text": "A wide variability of control group programmes is potentially important in ensuring that the studies can provide the best information for decision makers who may want to compare mCessation with what already exists in their context. However, it could also lead to difficulties in the interpretation of the results. In some cases control groups received substantial smoking cessation support and the details of this were not always clear. This is supported by the fact that in some cases high quit rates, over what might have been expected, were observed in control groups (Rodgers 2005; Squiers 2017), with high rates in both the intervention and control groups in another study  (Augustson 2017) . This could indicate some degree of trial effect (everyone does better just through being involved in a research study), social desirability bias, or that minimal mobile phone interventions (just for reminders, prompts or data collection) may also be effective in producing behaviour change. High-intensity control groups leading to high quit rates could have underestimated the relative effect of mobile phone interventions.\n\nThough we searched trial registries, there remains a risk that there were eligible but unpublished studies we failed to identify. Reassuringly, a funnel plot (Figure  3 ), showed no evidence of asymmetry."

    {
      "title": "Implications for research",
      "text": "Research in diverse populations and contexts is still required in order to understand what types of mCessation might be effective for particular groups and those most in need of support. The heterogeneity in text message programmes and the variation in functionality within the apps means further research is also needed to understand the effective elements, components and durations of these types of interventions. The variety of control programmes in the studies reviewed, and the often unexpectedly high abstinence rates in control groups, is an issue that may require further research in order to determine the actual size of the effect of interventions and potentially the 'minimal' effective mCessation intervention. More large-scale randomised controlled trials are needed in order to establish whether mobile app interventions are effective for smoking cessation."

Discussion included personal reasons for quitting, skills-based items, and craving control strategies. Self-reported smoking status was documented. The study also provided 8 weeks of transdermal nicotine (typically 21 mg patches for 4 weeks, 14 mg for 2 weeks, and 7 mg for 2 weeks). All participants were instructed that an IVR system would send prompts to conduct CO selftests up to 3 times daily between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. for the next 4 weeks, with the exact number and timing not disclosed. When prompted, participants used the video-record function on their study cell phone (with a front-facing lens) to record the CO self-test process, and sent the date and time-stamped video to research staff using multimedia messaging. Participants also reported the CO results and number of cigarettes smoked using the IVR. Video test results were compared against IVR reports to confirm accuracy (confirmed in all but 2 instances).\n\nmHealth reinforcement: as above, plus mHealth reinforcement participants earned chances for prizes contingent on on-time and smoking-negative breath tests (CO \u2264 6 ppm). Earnings were determined immediately via computer algorithm during IVR calls, and were available for redemption after IVR reports were confirmed against video clips."
