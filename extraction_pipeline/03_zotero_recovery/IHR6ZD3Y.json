  "abstract": "Background: We conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) delivered via a mobile phone messaging robot to patients who had their total hip arthroplasty or total knee arthroplasty procedures postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Methods: Ninety patients scheduled for total hip arthroplasty or total knee arthroplasty who experienced surgical delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic were randomized to the ACT group, receiving 14 days of twice daily automated mobile phone messages, or the control group, who received no messages. Minimal clinically important differences (MCIDs) in preintervention and postintervention patientreported outcome measures were utilized to evaluate the intervention. Results: Thirty-eight percent of ACT group participants improved and achieved MCID on the Patient-Reported Outcome Measure Information System Physical Health compared to 17.5% in the control group (P \u00bc .038; number needed to treat [NNT] 5). For the joint-specific Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Joint Replacement and Knee Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Joint Replacement (KOOS JR), 24% of the ACT group achieved MCID compared to 2.5% in the control group (P \u00bc .004; NNT 5). An improvement in the KOOS JR was found in 29% of the ACT group compared to 4.2% in the control group (P \u00bc .028; NNT 5). Fourteen percent of the ACT group participants experienced a clinical important decline in the KOOS JR compared to 41.7% in the control group (P \u00bc .027; NNT 4). Conclusion: A psychological intervention delivered via a text messaging robot improved physical function and prevented decline in patient-reported outcome measures in patients who experienced an unexpected surgical delay during the COVID-19 pandemic.

      "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has necessitated innovations in healthcare delivery with an emphasis on telehealth applications. Automated mobile phone messaging robots (\"Chatbots\") are a form of telehealth that utilizes software to deliver programmed text-based conversations to patients outside of traditional healthcare settings. During the COVID-19 pandemic automated mobile phone messaging has been utilized by the World Health Organization and others to communicate details regarding the COVID-19 pandemic to patients around the world  [1e3] . Previous works have also utilized automated mobile phone messaging robots to communicate with patients to obtain information regarding blood pressure  [4] , opioid utilization [5e7], physical activity in patients with diabetes  [8] , and to obtain patient-reported outcome measures (PROMs)  [9e12] . Interventions have also been performed utilizing this modern communication technique including medication adherence  [13, 14] , office appointment reminders  [15, 16] , blood pressure management  [17] , and as an adjunct to traditional communication techniques after hip and knee arthroplasty  [18, 19]  and spine surgery  [20] .\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has led to significant changes in musculoskeletal healthcare delivery with elective surgery delay or cancellation becoming commonplace. Total hip (THA) and knee arthroplasties (TKA) have been affected with an estimated 30,000 primary THA and TKA procedures delayed or canceled per week during the early portion of the COVID-19 pandemic  [21] . Additionally, osteoarthritic hip and knee pain was found to increase in 54% of patients since the delay of their surgery due to COVID-19  [22] . Surgical delays and cancellations caused by the COVID-19 pandemic have created a projected backlog of surgical cases that may last up to 2 years or longer necessitating further surgical delays  [23] . Furthermore, as COVID-19 and its variants remain active throughout the United States, it is likely that healthcare systems will continue to have unexpected surgical cancellations either due to worsening outbreaks or hospital protocols requiring postponement of surgery for patients who test positive in the days prior to their procedure.\n\nAcceptance and commitment therapy (ACT) is a psychological intervention that seeks to decrease avoidable suffering and helps individuals to live according to self-identified personal values  [24, 25] . ACT attempts to augment an individual's psychological flexibility utilizing 6 core cognitive processes: Acceptance, Defusion, Contact with the Present Moment, Self-as-Context, Values, and Committed Action  [24] . ACT has proven efficacious in the management of chronic pain when compared to standard pharmacological treatment alone [26e29] and in decreasing opioid utilization in at-risk orthopedic surgery patients  [30] .\n\nGiven the limitation in providing traditional care to patients with debilitating hip and knee osteoarthritis during the COVID-19 pandemic, we conducted a randomized controlled trial to evaluate the effectiveness of ACT delivered via an automated mobile phone messaging robot to patients who had their scheduled primary THA or TKA procedures indefinitely postponed due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Our null hypothesis was there would be no clinical difference in PROMs during the 2-week intervention period between participants receiving the ACT messaging protocol and the control group."

      "text": "This randomized controlled trial was pre-registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT04329897) and reporting is consistent with CONSORT guidelines. Ethical approval of this study was provided by the Institutional Review Board. Participants were enrolled from April 6, 2020 until April 20, 2020 at a single academic medical center in the United States.\n\nAdults (!18 years of age) who had previously been scheduled for primary THA or TKA and had their surgery delayed indefinitely due to the COVID-19 pandemic were deemed eligible for the study. Those eligible were called by the research team and underwent the informed consent process. If a potential participant did not have a personal mobile phone or could not receive text messaging, they were ineligible for participation in the study. At the time of consent participants were required to complete electronic forms comprised of a basic demographic questionnaire and baseline PROMs consisting of the Patient-Reported Outcome Measure Information System (PROMIS) Global Health 10 Short Form with Mental Health (PROMIS MH) and Physical Health (PROMIS PH) component summary scores, PROMIS Pain Intensity 1A Short Form, PROMIS Pain Intensity 3A Short Form, PROMIS Pain Interference 8A Short Form, PROMIS Emotional Distress -Anxiety 8A Short Form, and either the Hip Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Joint Replacement (HOOS JR) or Knee Disability and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score Joint Replacement (KOOS JR) depending on whether the patient was scheduled for THA or TKA. Participants in both groups also completed a questionnaire that was previously utilized to assess patient thoughts and concerns regarding the COVID-19 pandemic  [22] .\n\nFollowing completion of all PROMs, participants were randomized into the control or ACT groups using a standard online random number generator with a range set from 1 to 10 and a 1:1 ratio by a research assistant. Participants who received an odd number from the 1 to 10 range were placed in the ACT group and received the ACT messaging protocol, while participants given an even number were placed in the control group and did not receive any mobile phone messaging over the 2-week study period. During the 2-week study period, patients were not contacted by their surgeon to reschedule surgery. A 2-week study period was chosen in an effort to ensure patients would be able to complete the protocol prior to their surgery being rescheduled.\n\nThe ACT group patients received automated mobile phone text messages twice a day (morning and evening) communicating an ACT-based intervention for 14 days with day 1 starting the day after enrollment into the study. All participants received the same morning and evening messages during the 2-week study period. All messages can be found in full in Appendix. Control group participants did not receive the ACT intervention or any other form of communication from their surgical team over the 2-week study period. The ACT messages were developed by our study group (CAA, ER, NAB) in conjunction with a pain psychologist (VK) specializing in ACT for chronic pain. These messages utilized the core fundamentals of ACT  [24]  with the objective of helping recipients develop better coping skills for their osteoarthritic pain during the current COVID-19 pandemic. At the end of each delivered message, participants were prompted they could receive additional messages if they replied \"More.\" The opportunity for additional messages was provided so we might begin to understand the volume of communication participants would be interested in engaging with. A message bank of additional messages was then accessed by the software and another message was sent (Appendix). At the conclusion of the 14-day study period, participants in both groups were again contacted by telephone and asked to complete a repeat set of PROMs via an electronic email link. Participants in the ACT group were also asked if they would recommend ACT delivered by automated mobile phone messaging to a friend or family member if they were experiencing a delay in their surgical care.\n\nChanges in PROMs from enrollment to postintervention were calculated by subtracting either postintervention scores from   [31, 32] . We analyzed our results against MCID values provided in prior reports in the literature, when available, and utilized the \u00bd standard deviation method when prior MCIDs were not available. We utilized the MCID values in Table  1  to assess both clinically relevant improvement and clinically relevant decline across all PROMs  [31,33e37] .\n\nThe distributions of continuous variables were evaluated for normality using the Shapiro-Wilk test and through evaluation of Quantile-Quantile Plots and Histograms  [38] . Based on these results, potential between-group differences in age were evaluated using the Wilcoxon rank-sum test, while PROM scores at each time point and changes in scores were compared between groups using t-tests  [38] . Categorical participant characteristics (surgery type and gender) as well as COVID-19 questionnaire responses were compared between groups utilizing chi-squared or exact tests, as appropriate. Using chi-squared tests  [38] , we compared the proportion of participants meeting MCID cut-off points in a positive direction, as an indicator of clinical improvement, and a negative direction, as an indicator of clinical worsening. The number needed to treat (NNT) was calculated by determining the absolute risk reduction (ARR) and dividing 1/ ARR  [38] . An a priori power analysis determined that a total of 84 participants would provide 90% power to detect a difference of 30% in worsening of PROMs between groups at an alpha level of 0.05. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software version 9.4 (SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, NC). ACT, acceptance and commitment therapy; FMLA, Family Medical Leave Act; THA, total hip arthroplasty; TKA, total knee arthroplasty.\n\na The COVID-19 questionnaire was administered prior to the intervention to both arms of the study."

      "text": "A total of 90 patients were enrolled in the study (45 in each group). There were no significant differences between the control vs ACT group in median (interquartile range [IQR]) age (63 (36-77) vs 65 (28-84) years, P \u00bc .448), proportion female (37.8% vs 33.3%, P \u00bc .660), or proportion indicated for TKA (60% vs 62.2%, P \u00bc .839), respectively. There were no significant differences between study groups in views or experience of the impact of COVID-19 at enrollment (Table  2 , all P > .05). Likewise, there were no significant differences between study groups for any PROMs at enrollment. Following the 2-week study period, PROMs were completed by 100% of participants (45 of 45 patients) in the ACT group and 89% of participants (40 of 45 participants) in the control group. All preintervention and postintervention PROMs are presented in Table  3 . All patients in the ACT group received a full 14 days of messages.\n\nAll MCID analyses are presented in Table  4  and Figure  1 . Thirtyeight percent of participants in the ACT group achieved an improvement greater than or equal to MCID on the PROMIS PH compared to 17.5% in the control group (P \u00bc .038; NNT 5). Twentyfour percent of participants in the ACT group improved by an MCID on the joint-specific HOOS JR or KOOS JR compared to 2.5% in the control group (P \u00bc .004; NNT 5). Sixteen percent of ACT group participants experienced a clinically important decline in the HOOS JR or KOOS JR compared to 33% in the control group (P \u00bc .066). Eighteen percent of participants in the ACT group achieved an improvement in MCID on the HOOS JR with no participants having an improvement in the control group (P \u00bc .227; Fig.  1 ). Twenty-nine percent of TKA participants experienced a clinically important improvement in the KOOS JR compared to 4.2% in the control group (P \u00bc .028; NNT 5) (Fig.  1 ). Fourteen percent of ACT group patients experienced a decline in the KOOS JR greater than MCID compared to 41.7% for the control group (P \u00bc .027; NNT 4). Although there was a greater proportion who experienced an increase (>10%) in pain severity (PROMIS Pain Intensity NRS) and interference (PROMIS Pain Interference) in the control vs ACT group, these PROMs did not reach statistical significance (Table  4 , Fig.  1 ).\n\nTwenty-nine percent of participants asked for more messages during the course of the study on at least 1 day. The mean number of days more messaging was requested was 4.23 \u00b1 3.4 days. The mean number of requests per day was 1.69 \u00b1 1.82 with 72% of participants requesting more messaging one time per day. Seventyfive percent of participants indicated that they would recommend  the mobile phone ACT messaging system to a family member or loved one if they were experiencing delay in their surgical care."

      "text": "Participants in the ACT arm reported stable or improved responses to administer PROMs compared to a consistent decline in the control group across PROMs at the end of the 2-week study period (Fig.  1 ). The most robust response to our intervention was experienced by those who had their TKA procedure postponed. A preoperative decline in PROMs is important as prior work has demonstrated that declining preoperative function and pain scores in the setting of THA and TKA portend to lower postoperative functional status  [39, 40] . Over the 2-week study period, the control group in our study experienced a decay and worsening of PROMs which is consistent with findings from a survey during the early pandemic period delivered by the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons  [22] . Contrastingly, the ACT group experienced either a clinically important improvement from their preintervention state or a smaller decline than the control group across PROMs (Table  4 , Fig.  1 ). We suspect that abrupt cancellation of surgery with an unknown date of rescheduling during the COVID-19 pandemic may have had an impact on participants' pain and function. This is supported by the relatively large percentage of patients in the control group who experienced a clinically significant decline in multiple PROMs over the study period. Our study found that a simple, 2-week intervention focusing on twice daily text messages delivered by a \"Chatbot\" was able to prevent clinically significant decline, and at times improve, multiple PROMs for patients who are delayed in receiving surgical care of their arthritic hip or knee condition. These findings have large implications for patients who may experience an unexpected surgical delay due to a variety of reasons. Even before the COVID-19 pandemic, it was not uncommon for patients to have surgery postponed for additional preoperative testing or optimization. Our results indicate that it is likely that THA and TKA patients who encounter a surgical delay during the COVID-19 pandemic may have a clinically significant decline in their hip or knee function. As such, we believe that measures should be put in place to preserve their functional status and prevent worsening of symptoms given the negative impact of declining preoperative PROMs on postoperative outcomes  [39, 40] . Our described mobile phone ACT-based communication protocol can be utilized to stabilize pain and joint-specific PROMs in the setting of surgical delay of THA and TKA. Additionally, this technology and communication intervention could be studied in other patient populations including patients with minimal and less severe osteoarthritis of the hip and knee.\n\nACT has demonstrated positive results in the management of chronic pain across multiple patient populations  [26e30] . Previous work also demonstrated decreased opioid utilization and pain scores at 3 months after various orthopedic procedures, including THA and TKA, when utilizing a one time, preoperative 5-hour ACT interventional workshop  [30] . Additionally, healthcare communication strategies during the COVID-19 pandemic have necessitated physical distancing between patients and the healthcare system. Telehealth solutions consisting of automated mobile phone messaging have been adopted in the United States  [3]  and abroad  [1, 2]  during the pandemic with high reported success. We demonstrate that ACT delivered through an automated mobile phone messaging robot influenced various PROMs in the setting of delayed THA and TKA. Three-quarters of patients in our ACT intervention arm stated they would recommend this technology and method of communication in the future if a family member was going to experience a delay in their surgical care. Our findings during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrate that our software messaging platform is an acceptable form of communication with a focus on a contextual psychological intervention. Healthcare systems should consider utilization of ACT and mobile phone messaging robots to communicate with patients who are experiencing delays in their surgical care.\n\nThis trial has limitations. The intervention was limited to 2 weeks in duration which might not be the ideal duration for this intervention in this population. At the initiation of our investigation, there was no way to identify how long the pandemic would continue. We determined a two-week study period with a twoweek follow-up period would most likely allow us to complete the study while still in the pandemic conditions the study was initiated under. Further study of ideal length in time of intervention utilizing this technology and communication is warranted. Additionally, the length of the effect of our intervention is unclear given our follow-up time period. Participants received multiple PROMs in this investigation which may or may not fully encompass the complexities of their pain, anxiety, and hip and knee function.\n\nAlthough we included in this study what we felt to be the most appropriate PROMs, other questionnaires may have added to our findings. Additionally, the best methods for determining an MCID for a PROM has been greatly debated with no definitive conclusion. Utilization of alternative MCID cutoffs or formulation methods may alter the clinical significance of our results. Finally, our results represent the findings from a Midwestern and largely rural patient population. Further similar investigations should be performed in other demographic regions and in locales representative of the broader population in terms of socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, and political views that may have effected personal responses to the COVID-19 pandemic. This randomized controlled trial demonstrated that ACT delivered via an automated mobile phone messaging robot can prevent clinically significant decline, and at times improve physical function and joint-specific PROMs in patients who experience a surgical delay of THA or TKA due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Future investigations should consider the longer term impact of our designed intervention and should also consider altering the duration of the ACT software messaging protocol in order to determine the ideal duration and timing of delivered therapy. Healthcare systems should consider utilization of an ACT messaging protocol to preserve physical function and joint-specific PROMs when caring for patients with operative hip and knee arthritis who are experiencing surgical delay."
