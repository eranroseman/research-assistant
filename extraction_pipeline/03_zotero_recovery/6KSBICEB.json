  "title": "A study of generative large language model for medical research and healthcare",
  "abstract": "There are enormous enthusiasm and concerns in applying large language models (LLMs) to healthcare. Yet current assumptions are based on general-purpose LLMs such as ChatGPT, which are not developed for medical use. This study develops a generative clinical LLM, GatorTronGPT, using 277 billion words of text including (1) 82 billion words of clinical text from 126 clinical departments and approximately 2 million patients at the University of Florida Health and (2) 195 billion words of diverse general English text. We train GatorTronGPT using a GPT-3 architecture with up to 20 billion parameters and evaluate its utility for biomedical natural language processing (NLP) and healthcare text generation. GatorTronGPT improves biomedical natural language processing. We apply GatorTronGPT to generate 20 billion words of synthetic text. Synthetic NLP models trained using synthetic text generated by GatorTronGPT outperform models trained using real-world clinical text. Physicians' Turing test using 1 (worst) to 9 (best) scale shows that there are no significant differences in linguistic readability (p = 0.22; 6.57 of GatorTronGPT compared with 6.93 of human) and clinical relevance (p = 0.91; 7.0 of GatorTronGPT compared with 6.97 of human) and that physicians cannot differentiate them (p < 0.001). This study provides insights into the opportunities and challenges of LLMs for medical research and healthcare.",

      "text": "Generative large language models (LLMs) such as the ChatGPT  1  have surprised the world by answering questions conversationally and generating textual content such as emails, articles, and even computer codes, triggering enormous enthusiasm in applying LLMs to healthcare  [2] [3] [4]  . People are enthusiastic about LLMs in the potential to facilitate documentation of patient reports (e.g., a progress report)  3, 4  , improving diagnostic accuracy  5  , and assisting in various clinical care  6, 7  , while at the same time concerning the hallucinations and fabrications  7, 8  , bias and stereotype  9  , and risks of patient privacy and ethics  10  . Yet, this enthusiasm and concerns are based on ChatGPT, which is not designed for healthcare use  1  . Until now, it is unclear how this disruptive technology can help medical research and potentially improve the quality of healthcare.\n\nLanguage model is a simple statistical distribution used in natural language processing (NLP) to formulate the probability of a sequence of words or the next word in a sequence. Surprisingly, when it is used as a learning objective to train a specific neural network architecture named transformer, and when the model size is very large such as billions or hundreds of billions of parameters, important artificial intelligence (AI) emerges. For example, LLMs can learn knowledge from one task and apply it to another task (i.e., transfer learning), learn from very few labeled samples (i.e., few-shot learning), and learn without human-labeled samples (i.e., zero-shot learning)  [11] [12] [13]  . The LLM pretrained using decoder-only transformer such as GPT-3 is known as generative LLM as it can generate human-like text. The conversational ability of LLMs is achieved using prompt-based text generation  14  , the key technology guiding LLMs to generate reasonable answers and contextual contents.\n\nThis study aims to develop a generative LLM using real-world clinical text and evaluate its utility for medical research and healthcare. We train GatorTronGPT using 82 billion words of deidentified clinical text  15  from University of Florida (UF) Health and 195 billion diverse English words from the Pile  16  dataset. We train GatorTronGPT from scratch using the GPT-3  17  architecture. We formulate biomedical relation extraction and question answering using a unified text generation architecture  18  to evaluate how GatorTronGPT could benefit medical research using 6 benchmark datasets. To examine the utility of text generation in the clinical domain, we apply GatorTronGPT to generate 20 billion words of synthetic clinical text, which are used to train synthetic NLP models using BERT  19  architecture, denoted as GatorTronS ('S' stands for synthetic). We compare GatorTronS models with GatorTron  15  , a clinical NLP model trained using real-world 90 billion words of text, to test the hypothesis that generative clinical LLMs can be used to generate synthetic clinical text for medical research. To test if LLMs could be used in healthcare, two internal medicine subspecialists from endocrinology (NSO) and cardiology (MMA) manually evaluate clinical paragraphs written by Gator-TronGPT compared with real-world paragraphs written by UF Health physicians. Figure  1  shows an overview of the study design.\n\nThis study provides valuable insights into the opportunities and challenges of LLMs for medical research and healthcare."

Table  1  compares GatorTronGPT with GatorTronS and GatorTron on model architecture, training dataset, parameter size, and whether the model is a generative LLM, to help differentiate the three LLMs.\n\nGatorTronGPT for Biomedical natural language processing Table  2a  compares GatorTronGPT with four existing biomedical transformer models on end-to-end relation extraction of drugdrug interaction, chemical-disease relation, and drug-target interaction.

The GatorTronGPT model with 20 billion parameters tied with BioLinkBERT on the MedQA dataset achieving the best performance of 0.451. GatorTronGPT also achieved the second-best performance of 0.776 for the Pub-MedQA dataset compared with the best performance of 0.782 from BioGPT.

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "This study develops a generative clinical LLM, GatorTronGPT, using the GPT-3 architecture  13  with 277 billion words of mixed clinical and English text. GatorTronGPT achieves state-of-the-art performance for four out of six biomedical NLP benchmark datasets. Our previous GatorTron  15  model, trained using an encoder-only BERT architecture with 8.9 billion parameters, also achieved state-ofthe-art performance on six clinical NLP benchmark datasets. The two studies demonstrate the benefit of LLMs for biomedical and clinical research. GatorTronGPT can generate synthetic clinical text for developing synthetic clinical NLP models (i.e., GatorTronS), which achieve better or comparable performance to GatorTron, an NLP model trained using real-world clinical text, demonstrating the utility of synthetic clinical text generation. The physicians' Turing test show that GatorTronGPT can generate clinical text with comparable linguistic readability and clinical relevance to realworld clinical notes. This study provides valuable insights into the opportunities and challenges of generative LLMs for medical research and healthcare.\n\nWe discover an important utility of synthetic clinical text generation. To date, there has been a gap in accessing and sharing large-scale clinical text and clinical LLMs due to the sensitive nature of clinical text and the fact that automatic deidentification systems cannot remove 100% protected health Generative LLMs aspire to become a \"Unified Field Theory\" to unify most fundamental NLP tasks using a single model architecture. It might be still early to judge if LLMs will become the one and only foundation model  12  for NLP, but it looks like we are closer than ever. Generative LLMs have the potential to impact medical research in many aspects. In addition to performance improvement demonstrated in this study, generative LLMs provide a unified solution using prompt-based text generation  25  , which leads to a new paradigm of \"one model for all NLP tasks\" and has better few-shot learning and transfer learning ability to deliver portable clinical NLP systems  13, 26  . The evaluation of GatorTronGPT shows that clinical LLMs can be used to generate clinical-relevant content with the potential to help document  3  and code patient information in EHR systems, thus reducing the extensively onerous documentation burden for clinicians  [27] [28] [29]  . The prompt-based text generation of LLMs can potentially help compose treatment plans by integrating instructions from clinical guidelines and patients' historical records in EHRs. The conversational ability of LLMs provides opportunities to develop intelligent EHR systems with human-like communication  2  , where healthcare providers, patients, and other stakeholders can communicate in an intelligent electronic health record (EHR) system. Industry stakeholders such as Epic and Nuance have been reported to be exploring these potentials  30, 31  .\n\nOur Turing test focuses on (1) linguistic readability; (2) clinical relevance; and (3) physicians' ability to differentiate synthetic and human notes. The statistical tests show that there are no significant differences in linguistic readability (p = 0.22; 6.57 of GatorTronGPT compared with 6.93 of human) or clinical relevance (p = 0.91; 7.0 of GatorTronGPT compared with 6.97 of human).\n\nFurther, physicians cannot differentiate them (p < 0.001), suggesting the potential utility of GatorTronGPT for text generation in healthcare. Two physician evaluators find that the texts written by GatorTronGPT generally lack clinical logic, indicating that more research and development are needed to make this technology mature for healthcare. Our Turing test focuses on statistical differences not utility in real-world clinical practice, which should be examined in future studies when this technology matures. A recent study  32  examined an LLM developed at New York University, i.e., NYUTron, and our previously developed Gator-Tron  15  for prediction of readmission, in-hospital mortality, comorbidity, length of stay, and insurance denial, demonstrating the potential utility of LLMs in healthcare.\n\nWhile LLMs are promising for healthcare applications, much more research and development are needed to achieve this goal. Current general-purpose LLMs are designed for conversation as a chatbot outside of healthcare. Therefore, the current use of ChatGPT for healthcare is more like a typical case of intended use versus actual use as described in the medical device regulation  33  . Domain-specific LLMs are needed for clinical applications. Due to the noisy data and probabilistic nature of text generation, LLMs are prone to confabulation or hallucination, which is dangerous for healthcare. In this study, we adopted robust decoding strategies (e.g., nucleus sampling) to alleviate potential off-target text generation. Researchers are exploring solutions such as reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF)  34  to reduce hallucinations, but it is still a not yet solved limitation of current LLMs. Future studies should explore strategies to better control the hallucinations at a minimal level to ensure the safety of using LLMs in healthcare. The security and risk of LLMs must be carefully examined in healthcare settings. We applied a de-identification system to remove PHIs from UF Health notes before training GatorTronGPT, future studies should carefully examine if Gator-TronGPT has potential risk of speaking out PHIs and quantify the potential risk of re-identify real-world patients. Synthetic data, though generated by AI models, may still mirror the characteristics of its source material (e.g., UF health clinical notes). For example, ChatGPT has been reported to accidentally leak sensitive business data from a private company  35  . In addition, people are increasingly aware of the potential bias of AI applications in healthcare. Bias inherited from the original training data may be imitated and sometimes even amplified by AI models, which may cause systematic bias to specific patient groups  36  . Future studies should explore strategies to mitigate potential bias and ensure fairness of LLM applications. Like any medical AI applications, it is necessary to carefully examine this disruptive new technology to guide its application and make it \"approved \" AI-enabled medical tool  37  ."

At UF Health, we collected approximately 290 million clinical notes from 2011-2021 from over 126 departments, approximately 2 million patients and 50 million encounters from inpatient, outpatient, and emergency settings  15  . We merged the UF Health clinical corpus with the Pile  16  dataset to generate a large corpus with 277 billion words. We performed minimal preprocessing for the Pile dataset and applied a de-identification system to remove 18 PHI categories defined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) from the UF Health notes."

      "text": "Following our previous study  15  , we performed a minimal preprocessing procedure. First, we removed all empty notes and the notes with less than 10 characters followed by performing a deduplication at the note level using the exact string match strategy. Then, we leveraged an internally developed preprocessing tool ( https://  github.com/uf-hobi-informatics-lab/NLPreprocessing ) to normalize the clinical text. The normalization processing consists of three steps including (1) unifying all text into UTF-8 encoding, removing illegal UTF-8 strings, and removing HTML/XML tags if any; (2) sentence boundary detection where we normalize the clinical notes into sentences; (3) word tokenization where we used heuristic rules to separate punctuation and special symbols (e.g., slash, parenthesis) from words (e.g., converting \"(HbA1c)\" to \"(HbA1c)\" and \"excision/ chemo\" to \"excision/chemo\") and fixing concatenations (e.g., missing white space like converting \"CancerScreening \" to \"Cancer Screening\"). After preprocessing, we performed another deduplication at the sentence level using the exact string match strategy.\n\nTo de-identified the UF Health clinical notes, we adopted an internally developed de-identification system which consists of an LSTM-CRFs based model and a postprocessing module replacing system-detected protected health information (PHI) entities with dummy strings (e.g., replace patients' names with [**NAME**]). We adopted the safe-harbor method to identify 18 PHI categories defined in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). The LSTM-CRFs model for PHI detection was trained using the publicly available 2014 i2b2 de-identification datasets and an internal dataset with over 1100 clinical notes from UF Health annotated for PHI removal (named as UF-deid-dataset; not publicly available due to IRB restrictions). After three years of continuous customization and improvement at UF Health, the current model achieved an overall F1 score of 97.98% (precision of 96.27% and recall of 99.76%) on the UFdeid-dataset test set, which means our de-identification system can remove 99.76% of all PHIs. Detailed information about the development of the de-identification system can be accessed from our previous paper  38  ."

We used a total number of 560 NVIDIA DGX A100 GPUs from 70 superPOD nodes at UF's HiPerGator-AI cluster to train GatorTronGPT by leveraging both data-level and model-level parallelisms implemented by the Megatron-LM package  40  . (See  https://github.com/NVIDIA/  Megatron-LM  for more details) We monitored the training progress by training loss and validation loss using 3% of the data and stopped the training when there was no improvement."

      "title": "GatorTronGPT for biomedical relation extraction and question answering",
      "text": "End-to-end relation extraction is an NLP task to identify the triplets <concept1, concept2, relation> from biomedical text. Question answering is to identify the answer for a given question and the context. Following previous studies  18, 41  , we approached the two tasks using a unified prompt-based text generation architecture. Specifically, we adopted a fixed-LLM prompt-tuning strategy  42  to attach a continuous embedding (i.e., virtue tokens) to the input sequence [virtual tokens; x; y] as a soft prompt to control the text generation; the LLM was not changed during training. We provide details in the Supplement.\n\nEnd-to-end biomedical relation extraction. We compared the two GatorTronGPT models with four existing transformer models including GPT-2  43  , REBEL, REBEL-pt  25  , and BioGPT 18 on three biomedical tasks for end-to-end relation extraction using three benchmark datasets including drug-drug interaction  44  (DDI), BioCreative V chemical-disease relation  45  (BC5CDR), and drugtarget interaction  46  (KD-DTI).\n\nGPT-2. GPT-2 was trained using text data from 8 million webpages with 1.5 billion parameters, which is a scale-up of the first generation of GPT45 model. The GPT model outperformed previous transformer models on 9 out of 12 NLP tasks, whereas, the GPT-2 model further demonstrated text generation ability, which laid foundation for complex NLP tasks such as machine reading comprehension and question answering.\n\nREBEL and REBEL-pt. REBEL is a transformer model based on the BART architecture designed for end-to-end relation extraction using sequence-to-sequence modeling, which outperformed previous relation extraction models based on classifications. REBEL-pt is an enhanced version of REBEL by further fine-tuning it using the triplets derived using Wikipedia hyperlinks.\n\nBioGPT. BioGPT is a domain-specific generative transformerbased LLM developed using the GPT-2 architecture and the Pubmed biomedical literature, which achieved good performance in NLP tasks including relation extraction and question answering in the biomedical domain.\n\nFollowing the previous study  18  , we formulated both biomedical relation extraction and question answering as a prompt-based text generation model and applied prompt-tuning (p-tuning) algorithms. We concatenate learnable soft prompts (also called virtual prompt embeddings) with the word embeddings from the context (i.e., input sentence). The sample sequence is constructed as [prompt, context, relation], where the prompt is generated using a LSTM model and the relation is the gold standard label including the head entity, tail entity, and their relation type. During the inference, the context and the prompt are used as the input for our GatorTronGPT model to condition and let the model generate the relations. We converted the original relation triplets into a sequence representation. For example, there is an \"agonist\" relation between a drug -\"Igmesine\" and a target \"Opioid receptor sigma 1\", which was converted as: \"the relation between [Igmesine] and [Opioid receptor sigma 1] is [agonist]\". Thus, the relation extraction can be solved as a text generation. During inference, we converted the generated text back to triplets for evaluation. We fine-tuned and evaluated our GatorTronGPT on the end-to-end relation extraction task across four biomedical datasets: BC5CDR (chemical-disease-relation extraction), KD-DTI (drug-target-interaction extraction), DDI (drug-druginteraction extraction) and 2018 n2c2 (Drug-ADE-relation extraction). The precision, recall, and F1 score were used for evaluation.\n\nBiomedical question answering. We compared GatorTronGPT with six existing transformer models using three widely used benchmark dataset including PubMedQA  47  -a biomedical question answering dataset collected from PubMed abstracts, which requires answering questions with 'yes/no/maybe' ; MedMCQA  48  -a large-scale multi-choice question answering dataset designed to address real world medical entrance exam questions covering 2400 healthcare topics and 21 medical subjects; and MedQA-USMLE  49  -a multi-choice dataset collected from the professional medical board exams. These datasets have been widely used to evaluate LLMs  18, [47] [48] [49]  .\n\nGiven a question, a context, and candidate answers, we concatenated the context and the candidate answers into a source sequence and compose the target sequence as: \"the answer to the question given possible options is:\", \"answer\": \"C\". Then, we adopted soft prompts instead of hard prompts (manually designed clear text phrases) in p-tuning. Specifically, we used a randomly initiated embedding as soft prompts, which were fine-tuned in the training. For the PubMedQA dataset, we explored the provided artificially generated text data. Specifically, we automatically labeled the generated text using our p-tuning model developed using the training set and experimented to feedback different proportion of auto-labeled data into training. The best performance was achieved by using 5% of the auto-labeled artificially generated text data. For p-tuning, we used the implementation in NVIDIA NeMo  50  , which is optimized for LLMs. We used the following parameters in our p-tuning: a global batch size of 32, virtual tokens for p-tuning 15, encoder MLP with encoder hidden size of 2048, max sequence length of 4096 for PubMedQA (long abstracts), 2048 for MedMCQA and MedQA-USMLE, and a fused Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 1e-4 and a weight decay of 0\u202201, betas of 0\u20229 and 0\u202298, a cosine annealing scheduler monitoring validation loss with a 50 step warm up. For example, the below is a prompt we used for MedQA-USMLE. {\"taskname\": \"usmle-qa\", \"prompt\": \"QUESTION: A 23-yearold man comes to the physician for evaluation of decreased hearing, dizziness, and ringing in his right ear for the past 6 months. Physical examination shows multiple soft, yellow plaques and papules on his arms, chest, and back. There is sensorineural hearing loss and weakness of facial muscles bilaterally. His gait is unsteady. An MRI of the brain shows a 3-cm mass near the right internal auditory meatus and a 2-cm mass at the left cerebellopontine angle. The abnormal cells in these masses are most likely derived from which of the following embryological structures?\\nMULTIPLE CHOICES: (A) Neural tube\\n(B) Surface ectoderm\\n(C) Neural crest\\n(D) Notochord\\nTARGET: the answer to the question given possible options is: \", \"answer\": \"C\"} GatorTronGPT for synthetic clinical text generation. We sought to test the hypothesis that LLMs can generate synthetic clinical text to train synthetic NLP models useful for medical research. We applied GatorTronGPT to generate synthetic clinical text according to a set of seeds without any fine-tuning, which is a typical zeroshot learning setting. Then, using the generated synthetic clinical text, we trained synthetic transformer-based NLP models using our previous BERT-based GatorTron architecture  15  , denoted as GatorTronS ('S' stands for synthetic). We trained GatorTronS models using different sizes of synthetic clinical text and compared them with the original GatorTron model trained using UF Health clinical text. To make it comparable, we trained GatorTronS using the same architecture and number of parameters (i.e., 345 million) as GatorTron  15  . We provide detailed information in the Supplement.\n\nSynthetic clinical text generation. Following previous studies  51  , we approached synthetic clinical text generation using an iterative sampling algorithm and applied top-p (i.e., nucleus sampling) sampling and temperature sampling to balance the diversity and quality of text generation  51  . We approached the synthetic clinical text generation as an open-ended text-to-text generation task  52, 53  , where the generated clinical text is restricted by the context (e.g., the prompts). Specifically, given a sequence of m tokens X pre \u00bc x 1 x 2 :::x m as input context, the task is to generate the next n continuation tokens X cont \u00bc x m\u00fe1 x m\u00fe2 :::x m\u00fen until reaching the max length of 512 tokens. We generate text through iteratively sampling from the pre-trained language model GatorTronGPT one token at a time by conditioning on the preceding context:\n\nwhere P\u00f0x i jx 1 x i\u00c01 \u00de is the next token distribution. We adopt Topp (nucleus) sampling  54  during sampling to select words whose cumulative probability exceeds a predefined threshold p.\n\nwhere V \u00f0p\u00de is the top-p vocabulary used to sample the next word. This approach dynamically adapts the number of words considered at each step based on their probabilities, balancing diversity and coherence of the generated text. We set the parameter of top-p sampling at 0.9 and the parameter for temperature sampling at 1.2 according to our empirical assessment. We sampled the beginning 15 tokens from all sections of the de-identified notes from the MIMIC III database  22  and generated approximately 8 million prompts. We also tried several random seeds in GatorTronGPT to generate multiple documents from one prompt. We controlled Gator-TronGPT to generate a maximum length of 512 tokens.\n\nSynthetic NLP model development. We applied GatorTronGPT to generate different sizes of synthetic clinical text including 1 billion, 5 billion, 10 billion, and 20 billion words of clinical text and developed corresponding synthetic NLP models, denoted as GatorTronS. Following our previous study  15  , we trained Gator-TronS using the same architecture of GatorTrona BERT architecture with 345 million parameters.\n\nComparison with existing transformer models. We compared GatorTronS models with ClinicalBERT 55 -an existing clinical transformer model and GatorTron  15  , the current largest clinical transformer model trained using >90 billion words of text, using 5 clinical NLP tasks including clinical concept extraction, medical relation extraction, semantic textual similarity, natural language inference, and question answering.\n\nTuring test of text generation for healthcare settings. We randomly sampled 30 narrative sections from real-world UF Health clinical notes, including \"past medical history\", \"history of present illness\", \"assessment/plan\", and \"chief complaint\". For each of the 30 sections, we extracted the beginning 15 tokens as a seed for GatorTronGPT to generate a synthetic paragraph up to 512 tokens. We cut off the 30 real-world clinical sections to 512 tokens, removed all format information, and randomly mixed them with 30 synthetic sections written by GatorTronGPT. Two UF Health physicians (NSO, MMA) manually reviewed the 60 paragraphs of notes to evaluate: (1) linguistic readability on a 1(worst) to 9 (best) scale, (2) clinical relevance and consistency on a 1 to 9 scale, (3) determine if it was written by a human physician or GatorTronGPT. Percent agreement and Gwet's AC 1 were calculated to evaluate interrater reliability  56  ."

Our study further demonstrates that, without additional human annotation and augmentation of training data, a larger clinical GPT-3 model can generate synthetic clinical text to train synthetic NLP models outperforming NLP models trained using real-world clinical text. Text generation using generative LLMs could mitigate the risk of exposing patient privacy and improve accessing and sharing of large-scale clinical text and NLP models, thus enabling the next generation of clinical text analytics using synthetic clinical text."

Our study further demonstrates that, without additional human annotation and augmentation of training data, a larger clinical GPT-3 model can generate synthetic clinical text to train synthetic NLP models outperforming NLP models trained using real-world clinical text. Text generation using generative LLMs could mitigate the risk of exposing patient privacy and improve accessing and sharing of large-scale clinical text and NLP models, thus enabling the next generation of clinical text analytics using synthetic clinical text."
