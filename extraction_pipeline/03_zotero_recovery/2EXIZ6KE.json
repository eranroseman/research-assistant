  "abstract": "Objective the aim of the MeDication reminder aPPs to improve medication adherence in coronary heart Disease study was to evaluate the effectiveness and feasibility of using publicly available high-quality medication reminder applications (apps) to improve medication adherence compared with usual care in patients with coronary heart disease (chD). an additional aim was to examine whether an app with additional features improved adherence further. Methods Patients with chD (n=163) were randomised to one of three groups: (1) usual care, (2) a basic app or (3) an advanced app with interactive/customisable features. the primary analysis compared usual care versus app use on the primary outcome of the 8-item Morisky Medication adherence scale (MMas-8) at 3 months. secondary outcomes included blood pressure and cholesterol levels. results the mean age was 57.9 years and 87.7% were male. at 3 months, patients using an app had higher adherence (mean MMas-8 score 7.11) compared with the usual care group (mean MMas-8 score 6.63) with a mean difference between groups of 0.47 (95% ci 0.12 to 0.82, p=0.008). there was no significant difference in patients using the basic app versus the advanced app (mean difference -0.16, 95% ci -0.56 to 0.24, p=0.428). there were no significant differences in secondary clinical outcome measures. Conclusion Patients with chD who used medication reminder apps had better medication adherence compared with usual care, and using apps with additional features did not improve this outcome further. these data suggest medication apps are likely to help patients with chronic health conditions adhere to medicines, but further examination of whether such benefits are sustained is warranted.

[4] [5] ] [6]  Mobile technology is a potential tool to improve medication adherence. In a recent meta-analysis, text messaging was shown to improve medication adherence in chronic diseases.  7 Currently, there are numerous smartphone applications (apps) that claim to improve adherence through programmed regular reminders but very limited evidence that such apps are effective.\n\nTherefore, we aimed to evaluate, in a randomised clinical trial (RCT), the effectiveness and feasibility of using publicly available high-quality medication reminder apps to improve medication adherence compared with usual care in patients with CHD and to determine whether an app with additional features improved adherence further."

These participants were not provided information about the medication reminder apps being used in this study, including the names of the apps, to avoid cross-group contamination.\n\nThe two medication reminder apps were both freely available in the Australian iTunes and Google app stores. These apps were selected through a previously reported systematic review and stepwise process to assess the features and quality of publicly available apps.  9  Briefly, apps were classified as basic or advanced medication reminder apps if they had additional interactive and customisable features. The app ranked with the highest quality in each category was selected to be evaluated in this study.\n\nParticipants allocated to the interventions received instructions and assistance to download an app on their smartphones, input their current list of cardiovascular medications and set daily reminders at the time when each medication was usually taken. The basic app provided simple daily reminders, similar to an alarm or text message, to prompt the participants to take their medications at the correct time every day. These simple reminders were non-interactive and occurred one time only. The advanced app provided additional interactive and customisable features including: (1) daily reminders, which could be snoozed, rescheduled and/or marked as a 'taken' or 'missed' dose; (2) default settings, in which scheduled reminders occurred up to three times at 10 min intervals; and (3) other medication-related features including medication refill reminders, adherence statistics, ability to export and share information with others and ability to alert other people, such as family members, if the participant missed a medication dose."

Secondary outcomes included systolic and diastolic blood pressure (BP), total and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, number of pills missed in the last 7 days and medication knowledge. All outcomes were measured at both the baseline and 3-month follow-up assessments. BP and heart rate were measured using an automated BP monitor (Omron HEM 7121, Omron Healthcare). Two resting, seated measurements were taken, at least 5 min apart, and the mean value was used in the analyses. Fasting blood samples were analysed by local pathology laboratories.\n\nAfter study completion, a feedback questionnaire was collected. For app users, questions addressed their perceptions on acceptability and utility of the app, and for usual care patients, questions addressed whether they had downloaded and used any other medication reminder apps during the study period."

Analyses followed a prespecified statistical analysis plan. All data were analysed according to the participants' original assigned groups.\n\nThe primary analysis compared the primary and secondary outcomes measures in app users (basic and advanced apps) to the usual care group. For the primary outcome, the mean MMAS-8 score at 3 months was determined using analysis of covariance with baseline values of the MMAS-8 score as the covariate. Interaction between baseline MMAS-8 score and treatment groups was checked, and sensitivity analyses were done (online supplementary material 1). For the secondary outcomes, an independent t-test was used, and the mean difference (with 95% CI) was calculated to compare the continuous outcomes. For the categorical variables, the rate ratio with a 95% CI was estimated, and a \u03c7 2 test was used to compare the outcomes between groups. Summaries of baseline variables are presented as means and SD or medians and IQR for continuous variables, and as frequencies and percentages for categorical variables. Prespecified subgroup analyses, including age, sex, level of education and medication adherence at baseline, were planned to be performed on the primary outcome if there was a significant (p<0.05) treatment effect.\n\nAdditional analyses were conducted to assess differences in the primary and secondary outcomes between the three groups (usual care vs basic app vs advanced app). If the p value in the threegroup analysis was significant, then further analyses comparing usual care versus basic app, usual care versus advanced app and basic app versus advanced app were performed. No adjustments for multiple comparisons were made in the additional analyses. All analyses were performed using statistical software SAS V.9.4 and SAS Stat V.14.2 and SPSS V.24."

      "text": "The MedApp-CHD Study found that using medication reminder apps improved medication adherence compared with usual care at 3-month follow-up in patients with CHD. A significant improvement in medication adherence, although numerically small, with a low-cost, simple and likely scalable app intervention could have significant population impact. We did not identify additional benefits of using more complex apps compared with more basic ones, indicating that patients are likely to derive benefit with existing basic medication reminder apps. We also found no significant differences in secondary outcomes measures. This indicates that differences were nil or small, and a limitation of this study is the lack of power to detect change in the clinical parameters. Medication adherence is extremely important for patients with CHD and chronic diseases. While there are thousands of health apps available, there is minimal evidence for their effectiveness in improving health or medication adherence. Also, the quality of most apps is uncertain as there are no regulations or quality assessment for apps not considered medical devices. In our previous review, we found there were 272 medication reminder apps available in the Australian iTunes and Google app stores, and the majority were low quality.  9 Other reviews have found similarly large numbers of medication adherence-related apps (between 101 and 645 apps) in other app stores.  [13] [14] ] [15]  Our study is one of the few that can provide objective evidence of efficacy of medication reminder apps.\n\nOur findings are consistent with findings from smaller non-randomised studies in different study populations. Three small prepost intervention studies (12-50 participants) have found that app interventions improved medication adherence at 1, 2 and 7 months in children and adolescents with asthma and patients with hypertension.  [16] [17] 7] [18]  In addition, one RCT found that a smartphone app was associated with higher adherence to ticagrelor compared with the control group at 6 months (83.4% vs 77.2%, p=0.025) in postmyocardial infarction patients (n=174).  19 aken together, this evidence suggests that medication reminder apps are useful and improve medication adherence.\n\nOur findings do not support our hypothesis that an advanced app with additional interactive and customisable features could improve medication adherence further. However, these   additional features may make the app more appealing to download and/or interact with. Previous research has suggested that a feature to track a health-related behaviour, such as tracking medication-taking behaviour in the advanced app, is valued by app users.  20 Features that are more complex may help add interest and increase engagement and could contribute to the longevity of user engagement. Although long-term engagement with apps and factors related to attrition of app use needs further evaluation in future studies, the majority of app users in the current study reported finding the apps useful and reported they would continue to use the apps after the end of the study.\n\nIt is important to acknowledge that the majority of study population was already classified as having medium and high medication adherence at baseline and that the incremental improvement in medication adherence demonstrated in our study and other previous studies is small. However, this small improvement should be balanced against the low-cost and likely scalable use of medication reminder apps. Currently, the basic and advanced medication reminder apps have been downloaded by more than 10 000 and 1 million people, respectively, in the Google Play Store and this number may be larger, as the data on number of downloads through iTunes are unavailable. While findings from our control group indicate few people currently take these up, health providers prescribing the use of free medication reminder apps could potentially facilitate wider use."

      "text": "\u25ba Medication adherence is a challenge for patients with chronic health conditions, and improving medication adherence improves health outcomes. \u25ba This study indicates that a low-cost, readily available intervention can improve medication adherence and as such could be a scalable intervention with significant potential population impact. However, further research is required to assess whether benefits are sustainable.\n\nwith CHD did not own a smartphone and those who did were younger than patients who did not. Our findings are similar to other studies that have evaluated smartphone ownership and found that 37%-39% of patients did not own a smartphone and those who did were older than smartphone owners.  21 22 owever, the technology and ownership barrier are likely to be rapidly overcome with smartphone subscriptions increasing worldwide. Given the estimated 4.22 billion active subscriptions in 2017,  23  the number of patients who are able to participate in app-based intervention studies will likely increase in the near future.\n\nThe MedApp-CHD study was an independent evaluation using two high-quality apps identified through a systematic process. An important strength of the MedApp-CHD Study is that it used apps that were freely available and, therefore, already being used by large numbers of people compared with studies that evaluated new apps designed specifically for research purposes. However, this study has several limitations. First, this was a small study with short-term follow-up and had limited power (~20%) to detect any meaningful differences in clinical outcomes measures. That is, it only had adequate power to detect a difference of 9.4 mm Hg in systolic BP and 0.51 mmol/L in LDL cholesterol, which are very large differences to be achieved in such a short period of time. Nonetheless, although not significant, there was a trend to lower systolic BP and LDL cholesterol in the app users compared with usual care patients. Second, the primary outcome was self-report medication adherence, which is potentially subject to bias due to social desirability responding.  24 Social desirability might have affected how participants responded the MMAS-8 questions, as people tend to present a favourable image of themselves, especially during the first contact with the research team at baseline. However, self-report is the simplest, most common, practical and inexpensive method of measuring adherence to medications in a clinical setting,  25  and a widely used and validated questionnaire was used in this study.  [10] [11] 1] [12]  In addition, the improvement in medication adherence was small, when compared with another study that have reported that a change of 2.0 in MMAS-8 score would represent a meaningful change in medication adherence.  26 Future studies will be necessary to determine whether this small improvement would be clinically relevant. Nonetheless, the MedApp-CHD results provide useful preliminary data to design and conduct future bigger and longer term app-based studies. Lastly, although this study was conducted in a tertiary hospital that serves a diverse population, there was a very high proportion of middle-aged men enrolled in the study. Therefore, our findings might not be generalisable to other populations, especially females and elderly people. Also, as there is no 'one-size-fits-all' intervention for medication"
