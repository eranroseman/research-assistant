  "title": "Using the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research to Inform the Design of the Mobile Inspecci\u00f3n Visual con \u00c1cido Ac\u00e9tico System: Mixed Methods Case Study",
  "abstract": "Background: There is growing evidence supporting the use of mobile health (mHealth) interventions in low-and middle-income countries to address resource limitations in the delivery of health information and services to vulnerable populations. In parallel, there is an increasing emphasis on the use of implementation science tools and frameworks for the early identification of implementation barriers and to improve the acceptability, appropriateness, and adoption of mHealth interventions in resource-limited settings. However, there are limited examples of the application of implementation science tools and frameworks to the formative phase of mHealth design for resource-limited settings despite the potential benefits of this work for enhancing subsequent implementation, scale-up, and sustainability. \n Objective: We presented a case study on the use of an implementation science framework in mHealth design. In particular, we illustrated the usability of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) for organizing and interpreting formative research findings during the design of the mobile Inspecci\u00f3n Visual con \u00c1cido Ac\u00e9tico (mIVAA) system in Lima, Peru. \n Methods: We collected formative data from prospective users of the mIVAA intervention using multiple research methodologies, including structured observations, surveys, group and individual interviews, and discussions with local stakeholders at the partnering organization in Peru. These activities enabled the documentation of clinical workflows, perceived barriers to and facilitators of mIVAA, overarching barriers to cervical cancer screening in community-based settings, and related local policies and guidelines in health care. Using a convergent mixed methods analytic approach and the CFIR as an organizing framework, we mapped formative research findings to identify key implementation barriers and inform iterations of the mIVAA system design. \n Results: In the setting of our case study, most implementation barriers were identified in the CFIR domains of intervention characteristics and inner setting. All but one barrier were addressed before mIVAA deployment by modifying the system design and adding supportive resources. Solutions involved improvements to infrastructure, including cellular data plans to avoid",

      "text": "With the increasing number of mobile phone and data subscribers worldwide, mobile health (mHealth; ie, the use of mobile technologies for delivering health services and information) has become a global phenomenon  [1, 2] . In many low-and middle-income countries (LMICs), mHealth interventions have been successfully used to mitigate health system challenges, including human resource, infrastructure, and information constraints  [2] [3] [4] . Despite the multitude of mHealth interventions that have been piloted in LMICs, few have ultimately been brought to scale or had lasting sustainability  [5] . The reasons for this leaky pilot-to-scale pipeline are varied, but a key reason may be the failure to identify and address implementation barriers, especially during the early stages of mHealth intervention development  [6, 7] .\n\nStrategies to support the effective translation of evidence-based interventions to real-world settings fall within the purview of implementation science  [8] . Implementation science tools and frameworks can guide the exploration of implementation factors, facilitate the contextualization of those factors, identify evaluation metrics and benchmarks, and provide clues to enable intervention scale-up and sustainability  [9] . In recognition of the benefits of implementation science in the context of scaling mHealth interventions, the World Health Organization and others have published several guiding documents that incorporate implementation science principles and methodologies in mHealth intervention design, evaluation, and reporting  [3, 10, 11] . These guiding documents emphasize best practices such as early stakeholder engagement; needs assessment; contextual adaptation of intervention components; interoperability with extant systems; and assessment of process outcomes such as intervention acceptability, fidelity, and adoption to explain intervention effectiveness or a lack thereof. However, in the current research paradigm, the assessment of implementation factors typically occurs concurrently with or after the evaluation of mHealth intervention effectiveness (eg, using hybrid effectiveness-implementation study designs)  [12] . As a result, there are limited illustrations of how implementation science tools and frameworks may be used to pre-empt barriers, inform mHealth intervention design, and increase the chances of successful implementation and scale-up  [13] .\n\nThe formative phase of mHealth intervention design provides a novel opportunity to assess any unique technical or practical considerations that may influence implementation. These considerations may include acceptability of mHealth interventions in an LMIC setting, mobile phone literacy of end users, and the cultural appropriateness of intervention components. In addition, data may be needed on the feasibility of stand-alone mHealth interventions or the organizational paradigm shifts that are needed to support integration of mHealth into the health system, clinical workflows, and existing data collection and management mechanisms  [14] . Hence, conducting formative research to thoroughly understand the implementation environment, barriers, and facilitators is critical for informing mHealth implementation, scale-up, and sustainability. Despite this need, existing implementation science tools and frameworks are rarely applied to the formative phase of mHealth design.\n\nIn this paper, we describe the formative research phase for an mHealth intervention-namely, the mobile Inspecci\u00f3n Visual con \u00c1cido Ac\u00e9tico (mIVAA) system for cervical cancer screening-as a case study on the use of implementation science frameworks to identify implementation barriers and inform intervention design. We present the utility of the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research (CFIR) as a convergent framework to organize formative research findings and highlight key implementation barriers. We further motivate the use of such an approach to elucidate and mitigate potential stumbling blocks for the success of mHealth implementation, which can be addressed before investment in pilot studies."

      "text": "In Peru, cervical cancer is a significant contributor to mortality and morbidity among women of reproductive age. The incidence of cervical cancer in Peru is nearly twice the global rate (23.2 compared with 13.1 per 100,000 women)  [15, 16] . Evidence-based strategies such as early screening and preventative treatment can reduce morbidity and mortality from the disease  [17] . Effective screening tests such as the Papanicolaou smear and, more recently, human papillomavirus DNA testing have successfully reduced the incidence of and mortality from cervical cancer in the United States and other high-income countries  [18] [19] [20] . However, many of these strategies require resources (eg, laboratories) or personnel for implementation, and their widespread use in community-based prevention programs may be limited in LMIC settings. Thus, the World Health Organization recommends visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) in situations where the capacity for human papillomavirus testing is lacking  [17] . In VIA, health workers examine the cervix with the naked eye for aceto-whitening, which is a sign of precancerous lesions.\n\nLa Liga Peruana Contra el C\u00e1ncer (La Liga) is a nonprofit organization based in Lima, Peru. La Liga routinely organizes free large-scale screening campaigns using both Papanicolau smears and VIA with community outreach mobile units that travel around the Lima metropolitan area to low-income neighborhoods. However, the slow turnaround of Papanicolau smear results and lack of patient access to reliable means of transportation mean that approximately 77% of screened-positive women in community settings are lost to subsequent clinic-based follow-up. In consultation with key decision makers at La Liga, the use of teleconsultation with a mobile phone-based software platform combined with visual counseling using a patient's cervical images was identified as a potential strategy to reduce this loss to follow-up. We hypothesized that this strategy may decrease loss to follow-up by using images of patients' own anatomy to reinforce the need for clinic-based follow-up among women with suspected cancer or precancer and by increasing access to early preliminary diagnosis through expert feedback when available. Hence, La Liga partnered with Duke University and a Peruvian partner, Medical Innovation and Technology, for the design of the mIVAA system. The mIVAA system is a mobile phone-based telemedicine platform that permits the documentation of magnified cervical images for remote and asynchronous expert colposcopist feedback. Imaging of the cervix can be achieved with the built-in mobile phone camera or through a USB-connected digital colposcopy device such as a pocket colposcope  [21, 22] . Formative research was conducted to inform the design and implementation of the mIVAA system in La Liga's community outreach units with the goal of identifying and mitigating implementation barriers to the maximum extent possible during the intervention development and pilot."

      "title": "Theoretical Framework",
      "text": "The CFIR is a framework of implementation factors often used to assess readiness for implementation and comprises 5 overarching domains: intervention characteristics, inner setting, outer setting, characteristics of individuals, and process  [23] . CFIR constructs have been shown to map well to common implementation challenges in the use of digital technologies  [13, 24] . The CFIR has been used to evaluate the implementation of mHealth interventions in low-resource contexts, including for longitudinal assessment of 2-way SMS interventions on HIV therapy adherence and an app tracking communicable disease transmission in Uganda  [25, 26] . However, in both of these studies, the CFIR was used after the rollout of the mHealth intervention. The CFIR can be applied earlier in the development of interventions; however, there are limited examples of the use of this framework to guide mHealth intervention development in formative research.\n\nWe selected the CFIR for our case study as it is a well-studied and widely used framework for implementation research. Furthermore, it contains a comprehensive list of implementation factors that can be evaluated by researchers, including those with a limited background in implementation science. Finally, it also permits the description of factors related to both the general implementation context and intervention-specific factors.\n\nOur findings demonstrate the utility of the CFIR for organizing implementation factors emerging during the formative phase of mHealth design as well as for guiding mHealth intervention development and implementation."

The system can be used by midwives to acquire cervical images of patients in community settings and share them with expert colposcopists based in La Liga's brick-and-mortar clinics for feedback to inform triage options. Midwives concurrently perform Papanicolau smears; however, the mIVAA system augments the naked-eye visual examination and allows for documentation via imaging."

Using consensus discussions with JJ and other key decision makers at La Liga, the study team arrived at potential system features that were illustrated in the mock-ups. In the second step of the rapid analysis, the study team presented the outputs to the study participants during group discussions to elicit feedback and any residual concerns or barriers related to mIVAA implementation. This feedback was used during subsequent discussions to refine the system design, and additional potential solutions were brainstormed with the study team members at La Liga and Medical Innovation and Technology to determine a course of action for system development and implementation. The rapid analysis approach was necessary to facilitate progress toward system development and pilot evaluation within the time frame of the study funding  [31] ."

A member of the research team, HWR, conducted an initial data-driven content analysis looking for mentions of potential barriers to the implementation of mHealth interventions. She documented each potential barrier, any proposed solution, and all representative quotes for each barrier. In addition, she categorized each barrier under the relevant CFIR construct using a table in Microsoft Word. The barriers and CFIR categorization were subsequently reviewed with 2 other study team members, LV and RJP-B, and each potential barrier was discussed until consensus was reached for categorization under a CFIR construct. In addition, RJP-B evaluated the quotations, and a single representative quote was selected for each barrier.

Most identified barriers fell within the domain of intervention characteristics, including the constructs of adaptability (eg, internet connectivity), complexity (eg, role definition), and cost (eg, compensation for colposcopists' time). In addition, there were 5 potential barriers related to the domain of inner setting, with most of these related to how colposcopists would receive and process images captured with the mIVAA system and the resulting referrals. Other potential barriers included pragmatic considerations such as availability of electricity in mobile units to power digital devices and the potential impact of vibrations in the mobile units on image quality, process concerns such as time to clean and sterilize the USB-connected imaging devices between patients, scheduling an increased number of follow-up appointments in La Liga's electronic health record system, and financial implications of the reduced number of patients able to be screened each day with the mIVAA system.\n\nWe identified 4 potential barriers to implementation that were not specific to the mIVAA system (Table  S3  in Multimedia Appendix 1). These included time to sterilize speculums between clinic days (compatibility), the cost and distance of follow-up colposcopy for patients (patient needs and resources), incorrect patient phone numbers in the electronic health record system (patient needs and resources), and staff tardiness and presence at mobile units (other personal attributes). As these barriers may still affect the successful implementation of the mIVAA system, they informed data collection instruments for the pilot study.\n\nTable 1.

A potential barrier, the ability to edit responses on the mIVAA software, could not be addressed in the pilot study because of budgetary limitations. An additional concern was that patients participating in the mIVAA intervention might mistake the results from the mIVAA screening with the final results from Papanicolau smear cytology. We did not directly address this as participants in the mIVAA intervention received the exact same counseling regarding Papanicolau smear results as women not participating in the intervention; therefore, there should not be a difference in understanding of the importance of Papanicolau smear cytology results.\n\nTable 2.

      "title": "Principal Findings",
      "text": "Our study describes the use of the CFIR framework to identify and organize implementation barriers in the mHealth design phase. In our case study, formative research activities informed changes to system design based on identified barriers before piloting and evaluation. We used a mixed methods analytic approach relying on both quantitative and qualitative methods in this formative research phase. The survey data indicated that the participants were favorable to the implementation of new technology related to cervical cancer screening. The individual interview, group interview, and clinic flow observation data were triangulated as, in many cases, they pointed to the same barriers, such as the need for clear role delineation when transmitting images from the mIVAA system. However, in a few cases, a data source surfaced a unique barrier. For example, it was only through the clinic observations that we discovered the need to stabilize the device to prevent shaking from mobile clinics being parked on loosely packed earth. Using a framework such as the CFIR to organize this information is valuable for categorizing potential implementation barriers and facilitators. Previously, Westgard and Fleming  [33]  explored the use of the Active Implementation Frameworks to guide the design and implementation of an mHealth system for monitoring child health in the Amazon region of Peru. Although the Active Implementation Frameworks provide a comprehensive combined framework, their classification into 5 separate iterative frameworks can make them difficult to apply, especially for teams without formal implementation science expertise or limited resources for formative research. In addition, we did not use a technology-specific framework such as the technology acceptance model or the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology as we were interested in the broader implementation context and how to best integrate this intervention into the organizational structure, including external and internal influences.\n\nThe CFIR has been shown to map well onto the main challenges and findings of eHealth and mHealth research  [13, 25] . It was designed for use in formative research; however, assessment of the use of the CFIR has shown that this tool has been mainly applied to studies already in the pilot phase of implementation or beyond  [24, 26, [34] [35] [36] . In the rare instances where it has been used before the pilot of an intervention, it has been useful in identifying and addressing barriers to implementation in an efficient manner  [37] . We selected the CFIR post hoc as a convergent database for the qualitative and quantitative data collected during our formative research and found it to be a comprehensive framework for organizing formative research data. Using the structured constructs of the CFIR allowed us to identify areas that will require additional data collection to ensure future sustainability in the eventual scale-up of the mIVAA system.\n\nFormative research is an iterative process that both informs the constructs of the CFIR domains and serves to strengthen them by formalizing stakeholder input and providing a discussion point for brainstorming solutions. We were able to refer to Tables  1  and  2 , created through the use of the CFIR domains and constructs, during the rollout of the subsequent pilot study and ensure that the identified barriers were appropriately addressed. The use of a framework to guide formative research could be a time-and cost-saving measure and provide a systematic mechanism to ensure that facilitators are taken advantage of and barriers are addressed before rollout. However, it is important to recognize that there may be financial implications to addressing barriers before implementation (eg, purchase of additional equipment and updating of software) that should be accounted for by the implementing institution when budgeting for formative research and pilot studies.\n\nIn our study, the CFIR framework revealed a conducive implementation climate and readiness for implementation. There was a strong shared understanding of the need for an intervention to reduce loss to follow-up for women after cervical cancer screening as well as significant investment on the part of La Liga in terms of staff, space, and clinic time. In addition, the constructs under the domain of characteristics of individuals were favorable for implementation based on the survey data collected on provider and staff attitudes toward innovation in cervical cancer screening.\n\nWe found that the constructs under the domains of intervention characteristics and inner setting were most likely to elicit potential barriers that could be addressed before pilot implementation, which is similar to the findings of the limited previous work using the CFIR in a preimplementation setting  [38] . The formal process of formative data collection was the least applicable to the domain of outer setting, which mainly describes the political and organizational environment surrounding the intervention. Political and organizational information was gathered before our group interviews and observations through conversations with La Liga leadership and desk research. A key need identified through these discussions was clear role definition for the midwives as only trained medical doctors and colposcopists are permitted to review cervical images as per Peruvian regulations. Our findings indicate that prioritizing interview and observation guides that emphasize the constructs within the domains of intervention characteristics and inner setting may maximize the study team's ability to elicit potential barriers and address them before piloting an intervention."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "This is a case study and may be limited by the study context, but we believe that the process is widely applicable to other work on the design and implementation of mHealth interventions. In addition, our formative work included a relatively small sample size of participants; however, given the overall size of La Liga's organization, this included most stakeholders and representative voices from all involved staff and clinicians. All participants were recruited through La Liga, their employer, including through a study research coordinator who was also an employee of La Liga. Although the participants provided informed consent and were able to decline participation at any time, this may have exerted some influence on their decision to take part in this study. We took multiple precautions to ensure that the study data translated from Spanish were accurate in meaning and tone; however, we acknowledge that there is always a limitation in using translated transcripts as some nuance may be lost.\n\nAs a consequence of timing constraints, we were only able to use rapid analysis findings to elicit feedback from participants during the group discussions. We then validated our convergent mixed methods analysis findings with a select few stakeholders from La Liga, including KDMV and JJ. However, we emphasize that, for future work, stakeholder insight is critical, especially when conducting formative research in an LMIC setting. Owing to the post hoc selection of the CFIR as the convergent framework, we only report on implementation factors that emerged in the data. For instance, we did not collect in-depth data on constructs related to the outer setting. Future studies may benefit from structured data collection tools that a priori encompass all CFIR domains."

The CFIR framework can be used to map and prioritize potential barriers to the implementation of mHealth interventions revealed during formative work. In our experience with an mHealth-enabled cervical cancer screening device, focusing on formative work exploring constructs under the domains of intervention characteristics and inner setting elicited the most key barriers to implementation. Future mHealth studies may choose to develop data collection tools to specifically query these domains."
