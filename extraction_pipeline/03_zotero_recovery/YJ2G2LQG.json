  "title": "Validation of a physical activity assessment tool for individuals with schizophrenia",
  "abstract": "Objective: Increasing physical activity must be one component of lifestyle interventions designed to prevent or treat obesity in schizophrenia and there is now a need to develop low cost, practical and accurate measures of physical activity in this population to identify the prevalence of physical (in)activity and to assess the effectiveness of physical activity interventions. The objective of this study was to provide preliminary validation of the Short-Form International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ), a measurement tool that could prove useful for both clinicians and researchers in the field. Method: Reliability and validity data were collected from a sample of 35 outpatients with a DSM-IV diagnosis of schizophrenia. Test-retest repeatability was assessed within the same week and criterion validity was assessed against an RT3 accelerometer. Spearman's correlation coefficients are reported based on the total reported physical activity (minutes) and estimated energy expenditure. Result: We found a correlation coefficient of 0.68 for reliability and 0.37 for criterion validity based on total reported minutes of physical activity. There was a nonsignificant correlation (0.30; p N 0.05) between the RT3 data and estimated energy expenditure derived from the IPAQ. Conclusion: Although not without limitations, the Short-Form IPAQ, when used with individuals with schizophrenia, exhibits measurement properties that are comparable to those reported in the general population and can be considered as a surveillance tool to assess levels of physical activity.",

      "text": "Obesity is a common problem for individuals with schizophrenia, a problem that has been exacerbated more recently with the increased use of second gene-0920-9964/$ -see front matter D 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.schres.2005.10.020 ration antipsychotics, many of which are associated with the risk of weight gain and metabolic disturbance (e.g.,  Casey et al., 2004; De Nayer et al., 2005; ADA et al., 2004) . For individuals with schizophrenia, there is a marked increase in standardized mortality ratios for both natural and unnatural causes of death and much of this increment may be attributed to the increased prevalence of coronary heart disease risk (e.g.,  Cohn et al., 2004; Mackin et al., 2005) , and obesity in this population (e.g.,  Coodin, 2001; Susce et al., 2005) .\n\nA greater awareness of the scope and magnitude of this problem has turned our focus to developing strategies in managing this weight gain and assessing the impact of pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions (see  Faulkner et al., 2005) . While it is difficult to identify the relative contributions of disease-specific factors such as genetics, medication side-effects, or lifestyle factors such as diet and inactivity, it is clear that helping individuals with schizophrenia become more physically active must be one component of any such interventions for two reasons. First, current best practice guidelines in the management of obesity dictate that pharmacological interventions (e.g., sibutramine, orlistat, topirimate) be used in conjunction with nonpharmacological strategies  (Birt, 2003; Faulkner et al., 2003; Padwal et al., 2004) . Second, regardless of weight loss, physical inactivity is itself a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and merits the same level of concern as other cardiovascular disease risk factors (e.g.,  Wei et al., 1999) . In short, it is clear that physical activity should be incorporated into clinical practice; however, the systematic study of physical activity in this population has only begun  (Richardson et al., 2005) .\n\nTo advance knowledge about physical activity in schizophrenia we need to adopt a behavioural epidemiological framework  (Sallis and Owen, 1999) . There is an extensive research supporting the links between physical activity and health (see  Department of Health, 2004) , and research efforts must now focus on developing methods for accurately measuring physical activity in order to identify the prevalence of physical (in)activity in a population, assess the effectiveness of physical activity interventions, and examine relationships between physical (in)activity and other outcomes of interest to researchers. Until we know we can validly and reliably assess physical activity in this population progress in developing effective interventions will be delayed. Consequently, the objective of this study was to provide preliminary validation of one possible tool for use by both clinicians and researchers in the field.\n\nThe most common way of assessing physical activity has been the use of self-report questionnaires as they are easy and inexpensive to administer and are nonreactive (i.e., they do not influence a respondent's behaviour). Such instruments are generally evaluated in terms of their reliability and validity. Reliability refers to the consistency with which the instrument assesses physical activity. To establish validity it is customary to compare levels of self-reported physical activity with objective assessments of physical activity  (Sallis and Owen, 1999) . There are now a number of measures available with acceptable evidence of reliability and validity (see  Sallis and Saelens, 2000)  which can be selected on the basis of the type of information required by researchers or practitioners and the available resources.\n\nFor three reasons, we chose to select the Short-Form International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) for assessment purposes, a scale primarily developed for population surveillance of adults and found to have acceptable measurement properties  (Craig et al., 2003) . First, in pilot work we found the instrument to be acceptable to respondents and investigators. It was easy to administer and was relatively undemanding for participants. Second, in addition to vigorous and moderate physical activity this tool assesses walking which is the most common type of physical activity reported in the population we are investigating  (Richardson et al., 2005) . Third, the IPAQ is easily accessible (at  http://www.ipaq.ki.se/ ) and translated versions are becoming available which may promote consistency in measurement within and between countries in examining physical activity and schizophrenia. Accordingly, we replicated the procedures reported by  Craig et al. (2003)  in the validation of the IPAQ in a sample of individuals with schizophrenia."

      "text": "After approval from the Research Ethics Board, thirty-five outpatients were recruited from the Schizo-phrenia Program at the Centre for Addiction and Mental Health in Toronto. Prospective participants were identified by a research nurse in consultation with the patient's attending psychiatrist and other clinicians involved in their care. We included in the validation study patients with a diagnosis of schizophrenia, schizophreniform or schizoaffective disorder and the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI;  Sheehan et al., 1998)  was administered to both confirm a DSM-IV diagnosis of these disorders and screen for comorbid disorders. Both patients with more recent onset schizophrenia/schizoaffective disorder (within 5 years of first treatment) and those with more chronic illness (N 5 years since first treatment) were included. Potential participants were excluded if there was: an incapacity to provide informed consent, a current DSM-IV diagnosis of substance abuse disorder, a major medical or surgical event within the last 6 months, or a change in dose of their psychotropic medications in the last month."

      "text": "Each participant was seen on two visits, scheduled one week apart. After receiving the participant's written consent to take part in the research study, semi-structured interviews were conducted by the same research nurse to collect demographic data (age, gender, marital status, living arrangements, time of onset, medication, and occupation), assess weight and height using standard hospital scales, and complete the Short-Form IPAQ. Participants completed the interviewer-administered IPAQ with the aid of a structured recall format that asked participants to recall activities for each of the last seven preceding days in morning, afternoon, and evening time periods. We used the seven-day reference period instead of asking what subjects dusuallyT did in a week given the preference for this format in the initial validation of the IPAQ  (Craig et al., 2003) . At the second contact, participants again completed the IPAQ with interviewer assistance (test-retest reliability).\n\nData from the IPAQ were summarized according to walking, moderate (activities that take moderate physical effort and make dyouT breathe somewhat harder than normal such as carrying light loads, bicycling at a regular pace, or easy swimming), and vigorous activities (e.g., activities that take hard physical effort and make dyouT breathe much harder than normal such as heavy lifting, digging, aerobics, or fast bicycling) per week. On the basis of what activities subjects self-reported, the interviewer also clarified the perceived intensity of that specific activity. Total weekly minutes of physical activity was calculated and converted into a MET (metabolic equivalent) energy expenditure estimate by weighting the reported minutes per week within each activity category by a MET energy expenditure estimate assigned to each category of activity. MET levels were obtained from the 2000 compendium of physical activities  (Ainsworth et al., 2000) . The weighted MET-minutes per week (MET min week \u00c0 1 ) were calculated as duration \u00c2 frequency per week \u00c2 MET intensity, which were then summed across activity domains to produce a weighted estimate of total physical activity from all reported activities per week (MET min week \u00c0 1 ).\n\nAs the self-reported IPAQ data was not normally distributed, nonparametric Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated as a primary indicator of agreement between visits. Total physical activity was also categorized to determine the proportion of the sample who met the  USDHHS (1996)  or  DoH (2004)  physical activity guidelines of bat least 150 min week \u00c0 1 of at least moderate-intensity physical acti-vityQ and to examine whether this categorization was repeatable.\n\nTo assess criterion validity, participants also wore a Stayhealthy Inc. (Monrovia, CA) RT3 tri-axial motion detector during the seven-day period ( www.  stayhealthy.com ). The RT3 is the size of a pager and is worn on the waist. It continuously tracks activity through the use of piezo-electric accelerometer technology that objectively measures motion in three dimensions, giving output measures in mediolateral (x), anterposterior ( y), and vertical (z) dimensions in 1-min intervals. By entering participant's gender, age and height, total energy expenditure (MET) can be estimated. During the first assessment, participants received briefing about using the accelerometer and were provided with written instructions and a data collection sheet. This sheet also allowed participants to record the times when the unit was on and the time off, and information about an activity during the day when the unit may have been removed (during swimming for example). Initial reports confirm that the RT3 is a valid tool for the assessment of physical activity  (DeVoe et al., 2003; Powell and Rowlands, 2004; Rowlands et al., 2004) .\n\nThe raw RT3 data were prepared for analysis using a Microsoft Excel macro to identify the time spent in physical activity. For this, the RT3 counts had to be greater than the equivalent of 3.3 MET min \u00c0 1 estimates (MET level for walking;  Ainsworth et al., 2000) .\n\nAdditionally, for the data to be included in the analysis at least 600 min of registered time was required each day for at least five days (including one weekend day)  (Craig et al., 2003) . The total amount of physical activity recorded by the RT3, expressed as estimated METs per week, was used as the criterion measure in the validity analyses. Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated as a primary indicator of agreement between the IPAQ data (total minutes per week and MET min week \u00c0 1 ) and RT3 data (MET min week \u00c0 1 ). Confidence intervals are also reported. All statistical analyses were conducted using SPSS (Version 12.0)."

Walking was the most common physical activity self-reported by participants but only a quarter of participants (25.7%) met the minimum public health recommendation of 150 min week \u00c0 1 of at least moderate-intensity activity at either assessment point. Over 75% of the sample reported no vigorous physical activity, and greater than 40% reported no moderate physical activity, at either point. There was a nonsignificant increase in the total amount of self-reported minutes of physical activity over the seven-day period (t = 0.54, p N 0.05).\n\nTest-retest reliability data for the IPAQ are shown in Table  3 . The Spearman correlation coefficient was 0.70 and 0.68 for test-retest MET min week \u00c0 1 and total minutes of physical activity per week. The categorical estimates of recommended amounts of 150 min of at least moderateintensity physical activity between contacts were repeatable, with percent agreement of 83%. Further analysis by intensity level indicated that the repeated recall of vigorous activities and walking was better than moderate physical activities as indicated by correlation coefficients and confidence intervals.\n\nIn terms of criterion validity, there was fair agreement between total minutes of physical activity derived from the IPAQ and RT3 estimated MET min wk \u00c0 1 (Spearman's q = 0.37; p b 0.05 [95% CI: 0.04-0.63]).

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "This validation study suggests that the IPAQ, when used with individuals with schizophrenia, exhibits measurement properties that are comparable to those reported in the general population. For comparison purposes with other self-report assessments, reliability correlations range from 0.34 to 0.89 and criterion validity correlations range from 0.14 to 0.53  (Sallis and Saelens, 2000) . With an international sample,  Craig et al. (2003)  reported a pooled q of 0.76 for reliability and 0.30 for criterion validity for the Short-Form IPAQ. In comparison, we report 0.68 and 0.37, respectively, based on total reported minutes of physical activity, and 0.70 and 0.33 based on estimated energy expenditure. Given this comparability, researchers and practitioners should consider the Short-Form IPAQ suitable as a surveillance tool to assess levels of physical activity among individuals with schizophrenia.\n\nHowever, it is clearly far from perfect and demonstrates the limitations of self-report tools to assess physical activity in general  (Montoye et al., 1996) . Depending on perspective, for individuals with schizophrenia the Short-Form IPAQ performs as well, or as poorly, as it does for nonclinical populations. In terms of reliability, the greatest variability was found in the reporting of dmoderateT activities (defined as those activities that require moderate physical effort and result in the person breathing somewhat harder than normal). Although physical activity tends to be relatively stable over time, it can be difficult ascertaining whether any differences observed reflect problems with the questionnaire, recall, or to actual differences in physical activity over time  (Lowther et al., 1999) . Further work is required in developing methods of aiding participants to recall different types of activities that reflect different intensities, and the use of cards visually depicting different activities may assist this process. The Short-Form IPAQ performed well in classifying individuals as either above or below a threshold of physical activity and even this level of information should prove useful to clinicians and researchers in more objectively quantifying an individual's physical activity.\n\nIn terms of criterion validity, there was a significant variability in agreement as indicated by the reported confidence intervals. This indicates a lack of mea-\n\nTable 3 Test-retest Spearman's reliability coefficients for the Short-Form IPAQ Spearman's q and confidence intervals Categorical measure of N150 min week \u00c0 1 [% agreement] Total MET min week \u00c0 1 0.70** y [95% CI: 0.48-0.8] Total minutes of PA per week 0.68** z [95% CI: 0.45-0.83] 0.83 Vigorous physical activity 0.69** [95% CI: 0.46-0.83] Moderate physical activity 0.50** [95% CI: 0.2-0.71] Walking 0.68** [95% CI: 0.45-0.83] y Correlation coefficient based on total MET per minutes summed across all physical activity dimensions using generic MET estimates for vigorous, moderate and walking activity. z Correlation coefficient based on the sum of vigorous, moderate and walking minutes per week. **p b 0.01; *p b 0.05.\n\nsurement precision particularly in comparing energy expenditure derived from the IPAQ with the accelerometer data. These results suggest that our subjects were more accurate at estimating total time of physical activity as opposed to differentiating the intensity of that activity. This again may be due to the subjects having greater difficulty when estimating moderate versus vigorous physical activity in keeping with evidence that there is better recall of more structured and/or vigorous exercise  (Sallis and Saelens, 2000) .\n\nAs discussed, careful prompting and assistance by an interviewer is required in helping respondents differentiate their physical activity behaviour by intensity. This lack of precision also underscores the need for future examination of any potential population variability in the validity and reliability of the IPAQ. For example, the influence of various other factors, such as clinical symptoms, body mass index, illness chronicity, medications and their side-effects may underpin the variability in precision we report here. This variability does infer that objective measures such as pedometers or accelerometers should ideally be used to assess physical activity. Accelerometers have been successfully used in previous work with this population (e.g.,  Poyurovsky et al., 2000)  and these monitors are small, easy to use and our participants enjoyed using them. However, due to their lower cost and feasibility, pedometers may be the most suitable tool for epidemiological work  (Bassett, 2000; Le Masurier and Tudor-Locke, 2003)  particularly as walking represents the most common physical activity reported.\n\nWhile these type of objective measures are important research tools, in actual clinical practice, questionnaires such as the IPAQ offer a more feasible means of assessing physical activity because of their practicality, applicability, nonreactiveness, and now as our data suggest, some accuracy for individuals with schizophrenia. With such a tool, we can begin to more closely examine the prevalence of (in)activity in the schizophrenic population and systematically examine the modifiable factors that may influence physical activity that can then be targeted for change in interventions. These are critical questions that deserve urgent attention in light of the rapidly growing concerns regarding the newer antipsychotics and their propensity for weight gain and metabolic disturbances. Beyond this, further research will be required to examine whether the Short-Form IPAQ or alternative self-report tools are sensitive to monitoring intervention-related changes in physical activity for individuals with schizophrenia."
