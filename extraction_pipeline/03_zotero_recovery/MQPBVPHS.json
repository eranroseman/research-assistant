However, to date, there is limited evidence that available medication reminder apps are effective. This study aims to determine the impact of medication reminder apps on adherence to cardiovascular medication when compared with usual care for people with coronary heart disease (CHD) and to determine whether an advanced app compared with a basic app is associated with higher adherence. Methods and analysis Randomised controlled trial with follow-up at 3 months to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of medication reminder apps on medication adherence compared with usual care. An estimated sample size of 156 patients with CHD will be randomised to one of three groups (usual care group, basic medication reminder app group and advanced medication reminder app group). The usual care group will receive standard care for CHD with no access to a medication reminder app. The basic medication reminder app group will have access to a medication reminder app with a basic feature of providing simple daily reminders with no interactivity. The advanced medication reminder app group will have access to a medication reminder app with additional interactive and customisable features. The primary outcome is medication adherence measured by the eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale at 3 months. Secondary outcomes include clinical measurements of blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and medication knowledge. A process evaluation will also be performed to assess the feasibility of the intervention by evaluating the acceptability, utility and engagement with the apps. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been obtained from the Western Sydney Local Health Network Human Research Ethics Committee (AU/RED/HREC/1/ WMEAD/3).

Recently, a meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) investigating interventions to improve adherence to multiple cardiovascular medication in a CHD population found that interventions significantly improved the odds of being adherent; however, the interventions varied widely, and the majority of the interventions were complex, comprising several components.  9 hen compared with simple one-component interventions, such as a text message intervention, the complex interventions were found to have similar results."

      "text": "In 2014, there were around 7 billion mobile phone subscriptions globally.  10 In addition, mobile subscriptions with internet access were expected to reach 2.3 billion in 2014.  10 In Australia, 86% of the household access the internet via mobile or smartphones.  11 This growing mobile phone ownership makes it a promising tool to deliver healthcare interventions, so-called mHealth interventions. mHealth interventions can be used to deliver education to patients and health professionals, to collect data, to diagnose, screen and monitor patients, to offer treatment and behavioural change support, as well as to facilitate communication between patients, health professionals and health services.  12 Systematic reviews have shown that interventions delivered by mobile phone text messages can improve appointment attendance,  13  preventive care  14  and smoking cessation.  15 Health interventions can also be used to improve medication adherence by sending regular reminders to the patients aiming to reduce forgetfulness, a known non-intentional reason for non-adherence. A meta-analysis of text messaging interventions to improve adherence to medication in chronic diseases showed that text message reminders were associated with increased odds of being adherent.  16 Although cost-effectiveness analyses of mHealth interventions are limited, a text messaging intervention in a population with CHD has been shown to be cost-saving.  17 artphone apps for medication adherence More recently, the use of smartphone apps has been proposed as a potential tool to improve adherence. The increasing popularity of apps is evident as there has been exponential growth in numbers of apps available in online stores. This plethora of health apps has triggered a growing interest in mHealth research; however, the majority of research has focused on designing and testing new mHealth interventions instead of testing what is already available to the general public. There has also been relatively little research that examines which characteristics and features make health apps more effective. To design this study, we first conducted a systematic search and a stepwise process to identify high-quality medication reminder apps. 18  We identified around 300 medication adherence apps, of which about half were broadly classified into those with basic features of simple timed medication reminders and the other half into those with more advanced features including interactivity and customisation.\n\nAlthough these medication reminder apps are readily available to the public and have the potential to improve the effectiveness and reduce the costs of traditional interventions to improve medication adherence,  19  there is no published evidence that such apps are effective in improving medication adherence. In addition, it is important to investigate whether having medication information in the app is associated with improvements in medication knowledge, and whether daily reminders will be well accepted by patients. In a population with CHD, who are usually overwhelmed with a high pill burden and complex medication regimens, such apps might be a successful strategy to improve medication adherence and potentially improve clinical outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. Aims 1. To determine whether medication reminder apps compared with usual care alone will improve adherence to cardiovascular medications at 3 months; 2. to determine whether an advanced medication reminder app with additional interactive and customisable features compared with a basic medication reminder app with no interactivity is associated with higher adherence; 3. to determine the impact of the apps on blood pressure (BP) and cholesterol levels at 3 months; 4. to determine whether the intervention is associated with higher medication knowledge; 5. to determine whether the intervention is associated with lower health services utilisation; 6. to determine feasibility of the intervention by evaluating the acceptability, utility and engagement with the apps."

      "title": "Basic medication reminder app group",
      "text": "Participants allocated to the basic medication reminder app group will have access to a basic medication reminder app in addition to standard care. The basic medication reminder app has a basic feature, which is the ability to provide simple daily reminders with no interactivity to reinforce correct medication-taking behaviour. The basic app reminders will act similarly to an alarm or text message to remind the patients when it is time to take their medications. The basic app provides a one-time only reminder at each scheduled time, with no ability to snooze or reschedule the reminder. There is also no ability to register whether the medication was taken or not, once the reminder alerts the patient to take the medication. As the basic app was developed by a non-for-profit Australian organisation,  18  it has a database of medications available in the Australian market, which includes consumer medicine information for some of the medications, providing additional information on what the medication is used for, how it works and side effects. In addition, the basic app has non-medication-related features (table  1 ), including:\n\n(1) ability to track clinical measurements, in which the patients can, for example, record BP levels in the app whenever they measure their BP either at home or during a medical consultation, (2) information content about heart attack symptoms and action plan and (3) healthy diet information with recipe suggestions. At the initial visit, after the baseline assessment and concealed randomisation, the researcher will provide an initial training session on how to use the basic app as described in the 'apps training session' section below."

      "title": "Advanced medication reminder app group",
      "text": "Participants allocated to the advanced medication adherence app group will have access to an advanced medication reminder app in addition to standard care. The advanced medication reminder app has additional features that make it more interactive and customisable than the basic app. These additional features aim to support prospective memory, which is the ability to remember to do something in the future, by providing daily reminders for medication taking, as well as retrospective memory, which is the ability to remember something that was done in the past, by tracking taken or missed medication doses. This important tracking feature allows the patients to record whether the medication was taken and at what time it was taken, providing a tool for the patients to better control their medication adherence. The advanced app also allows that patients to snooze the reminder, if they cannot take their medication immediately after the reminder alerts them. By default, if the patient does not click that he/she took the medication when the first reminder pops in the smartphone screen, the reminder will be repeated up to three times at 10 min intervals or until the patient registers that the medication was taken, whichever occurs first. However, the snooze time length can be customised according to the patient's preference, for example, every 5 min. Importantly, if the patient does not confirm that they have 'taken' their medication after the three default reminders, the dose is counted as 'missed'. Similar to the basic app, the advanced app has a medication database and provides consumer medicine information in a written form or in videos. Other medication-related features are (table  1 ): (1) refill reminders, in which the patients can set up reminders to alert them when they are running out of pills and prompt them to refill their prescriptions at a pharmacy; (2) medication adherence statistics, where the patients can check their weekly adherence rates based on the number of 'taken' and 'missed' doses; (3) exporting and sharing data, where the patients can send their medication list and adherence reports to family members or healthcare providers via email and (4) the ability to provide alerts to other people, for example, a family member, when the patient misses a dose, which can provide peer support to encourage medication adherence.\n\nThe advanced app also has non-medication-related features (table  1 ), including: (1) the ability to track clinical measurements, like the basic app; (2) the ability to record doctors and appointment details and set up appointment reminders; (3) the ability to record personal medical information in the 'diary' section of the app and (4) information content on general health, provided as health tips that are regularly updated in the app. At the initial visit, after the baseline assessment and concealed randomisation, the researcher will provide an initial training session on how to use the advanced app as described in the 'apps training session' section below."

The researcher will also demonstrate how to edit or delete a medication if the medication dosage or timing is changed or suspended by the treating doctor. Finally, the researcher will demonstrate how to access the consumer medicine information available for some of the medications. After entering the medications in the app, the researcher will point out that every day, at the scheduled time, a reminder will pop-up on their smartphone screen, alerting them that it is time to take their medication. It will be emphasised that the reminders are set up by time, meaning that at 08:00, for example, the reminder will alert them to take all the medications scheduled for that time.\n\nFor the advanced reminder app group, after setting up the reminders for the cardiovascular medication, the researcher will demonstrate to the participants how to track if they have taken their daily doses. Every time that a reminder pops-up on their smartphone screen, the participant will be instructed to click on one of the following options: (1) take, (2) snooze or (3) skip the dose. The researcher will also show that a dose is confirmed as 'taken' with a green check mark on the top of each pill icon in the app. In addition, it will be shown that the patients can access this information by viewing the medication adherence statistic feature, which will show a percentage of pills taken per week. Other medication-related features, mentioned above in the 'Advanced medication reminder app group' section, will also be demonstrated to the participants; however, it will be explained that these are optional features that they can use according to their own needs.\n\nAs part of the training, the researcher will also explain that the participants can use the non-medication-related features of the app if they wish; however, they are not required to use these features regularly for the purposes of the study."

Medication adherence will also be a secondary outcome by asking the participants how many pills they have missed in the previous 7 days at 3 months and by calculating the proportion of days covered (PDC)  24  using prescription refill data obtained through data linkage with the Australian Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) at 3, 6 and 12 months. In Australia, prescription refills for cardiovascular medications are dispensed every month at the pharmacy as a 28-day or 30-day supply, and a record of each dispensing is included in the PBS data, enabling the calculation of PDC at 3, 6 and 12 months. Other secondary outcomes include clinical measurements of BP and cholesterol levels, and medication knowledge.\n\nParticipants will be followed up 3 months after enrolment at a face-to-face interview with a researcher who is blinded to the group allocation. The data collection will include self-reported medication adherence questionnaires, as well as clinical assessments of the BP and heart rate. A medication knowledge questionnaire, adapted from a validated questionnaire,  25  asking whether the participants know the names of their prescribed medications and what they are for, will also be administered. Participants will also be asked about the occurrence of any recent cardiovascular clinical events and hospitalisations, and a fasting blood sample will be collected to check the participants' cholesterol levels. At the end of the interview, after the blinded follow-up assessment, the participants will be asked which group they were assigned to. To avoid cross-group contamination, the researcher will not mention the names of the apps being used in the study during the enrolment visit. This strategy may not ensure that participants allocated to the control group will not download another medication reminder app during the study; however, at the follow-up interview, control patients will be asked whether they downloaded and used any medication reminder app during the study period. Participants allocated to the basic and advanced medication reminder app groups will be asked to complete an additional self-reported questionnaire about the acceptability and utility of the smartphone app. Participants who are unable to attend a face-to-face interview will be asked to answer the questionnaires over the phone, and the clinical information will be obtained through their medical practitioner. At the end of the study, data about prescription refill rates and health services utilisation will also be obtained through data linkage with the Australian Medicare Benefits Scheme (MBS) and PBS.

We will also calculate relative risks, 95% CIs and two-sided p values for both primary and secondary outcomes. We will also perform a sensitivity analysis, in which participants with missing data for medication adherence at the follow-up, for example, patients who withdrew from the study or were loss of follow-up, will be considered non-adherent (non-responder imputation).

We also acknowledge that the intervention is not likely to change cardiovascular clinical events and hospitalisations, given the short-term follow-up. If this intervention is shown to be feasible and acceptable, a future larger trial with hard outcomes and a cost-effectiveness evaluation can expand the knowledge in this area.\n\nIn conclusion, while the use of new technology, such as smartphone apps, is an attractive option, evidence is needed to help guide health providers and health services as to whether they should recommend such technologies to patients. Overall, this study will inform future research on the development of mHealth interventions that are likely to be transferrable across chronic diseases and open up a new approach for reinforcement of medication adherence and healthy behaviours."

  "abstract": "IntroductionThe growing number of smartphone health applications available in the app stores makes these apps a promising tool to help reduce the global problem of non-adherence to long-term medications. However, to date, there is limited evidence that available medication reminder apps are effective. This study aims to determine the impact of medication reminder apps on adherence to cardiovascular medication when compared with usual care for people with coronary heart disease (CHD) and to determine whether an advanced app compared with a basic app is associated with higher adherence.Methods and analysisRandomised controlled trial with follow-up at 3 months to evaluate the feasibility and effectiveness of medication reminder apps on medication adherence compared with usual care. An estimated sample size of 156 patients with CHD will be randomised to one of three groups (usual care group, basic medication reminder app group and advanced medication reminder app group). The usual care group will receive standard care for CHD with no access to a medication reminder app. The basic medication reminder app group will have access to a medication reminder app with a basic feature of providing simple daily reminders with no interactivity. The advanced medication reminder app group will have access to a medication reminder app with additional interactive and customisable features. The primary outcome is medication adherence measured by the eight-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale at 3 months. Secondary outcomes include clinical measurements of blood pressure and cholesterol levels, and medication knowledge. A process evaluation will also be performed to assess the feasibility of the intervention by evaluating the acceptability, utility and engagement with the apps.Ethics and disseminationEthical approval has been obtained from the Western Sydney Local Health Network Human Research Ethics Committee (AU/RED/HREC/1/WMEAD/3). Study findings will be disseminated via usual scientific forums.Trial registration numberACTRN12616000661471; Pre-results",
