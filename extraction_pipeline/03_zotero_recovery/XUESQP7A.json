  "title": "Effectiveness of digital health using the transtheoretical model to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes in impaired glucose tolerance patients: protocol for a randomized control trial",
  "abstract": "Background: There is high prevalence of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) in Saudi Arabia that is still increasing. Early diagnosis of prediabetes, and immediate, effective intervention is yet unestablished. Conventional health promotion approaches are used to educate prediabetic patients. Behavior modification is very effective in prediabetics to delay T2DM. Thus, the main objective of this study is to examine the effect of the new behavioral model, the Transtheoretical Model short messages (text 4 change) to modify lifestyle to prevent or delay the onset of T2DM, through promotion of a healthy diet and increased physical activity, in impaired glucose tolerance patients. Another objective is to estimate the impact of this model on markers of cardiovascular and metabolic risks as T2DM is one of the modifiable risk factors to prevent cardiovascular diseases. Methods: This is a randomized controlled trial. One thousand and sixteen, eligible Saudi adults will be recruited from the Heart Health Promotion study (HHP), which was conducted at the King Saud University from July 2013 to April 2014. These adults were at a higher risk of developing T2DM within 2-3 years. The research team's database has a contact list and they will recruit individuals over 6-8 weeks. All participants will be randomized at a 1:1 ratio into two groups, receive group education about lifestyle modifications and written information about diet and physical activity. Text 4 change SMS texts will be sent only to the intervention group. All participants will be assessed at baseline, 6, 12, 18, 24, 30, and 36 months for behavioral change using a World Health Organization (WHO) STEPS questionnaire and for glycated hemoglobin, biochemical and anthropometric measurements using standard methods. Discussion: This new approach for promoting the importance of behavior modification in prediabetics is expected to delay and/or prevent the development of T2DM in Saudi Arabia, subsequently reducing the risk of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality too. Results from this study will promote an innovative and high-tech way to decrease the burden of cardiovascular diseases in Saudi Arabia.",

      "title": "Background",
      "text": "Impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and impaired fasting glucose (IFG) are intermediate conditions sometimes called prediabetes, where blood glucose levels are above normal but below diabetic thresholds  [1] . Seventy percent of individuals with prediabetes eventually develop type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)  [2] . While people with IFG have a 20-30% chance of developing diabetes over the course of 5-10 years  [3] [4] [5] , this chance escalates to 90% if the individual is diagnosed with IGT  [6] . In Saudi Arabia, the prevalence of both prediabetes and T2DM is high  (18. 3 and 11.9%, respectively) and increases with age  [7] . Even though T2DM is treatable, it is usually associated with other comorbidities such as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia and obesity. These conditions in patients with T2DM contribute to the development of cardiovascular diseases (CVD). Thus, T2DM is one of the modifiable risk factors that can decrease the risk of several chronic diseases such as CVD, and reduce its associated mortalities. A population-based study from England showed that prediabetes may convert back to normal glycemia  [8] . Furthermore, landmark clinical trials have proven the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions towards a healthy diet and sufficient physical activity to reduce or delay the occurrence of T2DM by 50% in prediabetic individuals  [9] [10] [11] . The Center For Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and the American College of Sports Medicine have demonstrated that accumulation of 10,000 steps per day on most days of the week is an important component of improving glycemic control, insulin sensitivity, and/or cardiovascular (CV) risk in patients with T2DM  [1, 12] .\n\nTargeting this at risk population of prediabetics and increasing their awareness about the importance of a healthy lifestyle will help in the long run, to significantly decrease the prevalence of T2DM in Saudi Arabia. While many educational programs have been used to promote health in the Saudi community, the use of a digital approach is still in its early stages  [7] . Nowadays, the daily use of smartphones is vital due to their efficiency, connectivity and functionality. This makes the delivery of educational messages easier and more convenient.\n\nPrediabetes complications have been associated with the long-term burden of CVD, which is a major cause of death among diabetic patients  [13, 14] . The risk of developing CVD increased 2-4 fold compared to age-sex matched patients without diabetes  [15] . Worldwide, 43% of diabetes patients are more likely to die prematurely, and the rate of these deaths was higher in developing countries compared to developed countries  [16] . Diabetes has a negative impact on the individuals' productivity and quality of life  [17] . Diabetes also places a heavy economic burden on individuals, families, societies and countries. For example, globally, in 2017 diabetes consumed USD 727 billion from the health expenditure. In 2014, 14% of the total health expenditure of Saudi Arabia was utilized for diabetes management  [18] . Recent studies showed that the prevalence of prediabetes among the general population in Saudi Arabia was 25.5% in 2014  [19] , and 27% among university employees and their families in 2016  [20] .\n\nThe 2018-2020 National Transformation Program delivery plan, one of the Kingdom's Vision 2030 programs, aims to improve health outcomes through e-Health. Over the last decade, the mobile phone short message service (SMS) has been increasingly used to deliver interventions designed to enhance healthy behavior  [21] . SMS messages have the advantage of being inexpensive, convenient, reach the intended person instantly, and can be tailored to the individual  [22] . In Saudi Arabia, the mobile phone market witnessed the fastest growth in the Middle East region with 23 million smartphones in use in 2017  [23] .\n\nTheory-led interventions base components of a health intervention on behavioral change, this theory has been constructed and called 'the Transtheoretical Model (TTM)'  [24] . TTM has been used to improve adherence to medications in patients with CV risk factors  [25, 26] , and to prevent or delay the onset of T2DM in people with IGT  [27, 28] . It has also been used effectively to predict or measure behavioral change in eating habits  [29]  and physical activity  [30] .\n\nTTM posits that behavior change passes through five stages, which are precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance (Table  1 ). These stages indicate the individuals' willingness to change their behavior ranging from long-term inactive (i.e. precontemplation stage) to long-term active (i.e. maintenance) behavior. Each stage has processes of change that are methods to move an individual from one stage of behavior to the other (Table  2 )  [24] . For example, raising consciousness (a process of change) is more effective with an individual in the precontemplation and contemplation stages rather than a person in the maintenance stage. Consequently, tailoring interventional messages based on the individual's stage of change would be more effective in progressing them to the next stage of change  [32] .\n\nTherefore, this study aims to examine the effect of an interventional TTM based on short messages (text 4 change) of lifestyle modification to prevent or delay the onset of T2DM. The intervention will promote a healthy diet and increased physical activity among subjects with IGT. The design for this trial is parallel groups, the allocation ratio will be 1:1, and superiority framework."

      "text": "The content of the messages is derived from the WHO resources for a healthy diet,  [31]  physical activity and diabetes, Saudi National Diabetes Prevention and Control Program educational material  [43] , studies with similar interventions, online social listening, and clinical and personal experiences of Saudi culture  [44] . The messages will be in formal Arabic with the infusion of some phrases and words from the common Saudi dialect. Messages are written in the second person, using you, your, and yours. Each stage of change of the TTM has a designated number of messages to promote a healthy diet and physical activity. The messages' content was created according to the specific processes of change for each TTM stage. A total of 371 Arabic messages will be created by a health communication specialist and the project manager, who is well-acquainted with the target audience from a previous study. The specialist is wellacquainted with the Arabic speaking target population's local accent, sentiments and culture. The messages' content is based on international and national credible providers of health information and will be jointly prepared with a team of certified health educators. The messages will undergo cycles of feedback by a public health mental health specialist, a language reviser, and non-study participants from the target audience before the actual launch.\n\nIn the early stages of change (PC and C stages) that mainly require raising awareness, and contain nearly all essential messages needed to take the decision of change, every two messages are followed by a reminder, conveying the information mentioned in the previous messages every week (three for physical activity and three for a healthy diet). Reminders may take the form of text messages or multimedia messages (e.g. videos and infographics). For the following stages of change, where action is expected in the very near future or happening, the three weekly messages (for a healthy diet and physical activity) focus mainly on helping participants make a smooth transition through the process of change by providing a variety of messages conveying different alternatives of the same idea to achieve the goal of the stage.\n\nThe number of messages to cover 6 months are distributed as:"

Messages will most probably be sent in the morning between 10 and 11 am. On each assigned day, they will receive two messages (one for physical activity and the other for diet) according to their stage of change. The easy SMS manager allows a message length of 70 Arabic language characters. If this limit is exceeded, it will be counted as two messages instead of one, thereby increasing the cost. The system uses a standardized communication protocol assuring the delivery of text messages to the participants; however, receiving text messages from the participants or exchanging messages is not permitted (i.e. it is a one-way system) To ensure that messages were delivered, they will also be sent to one of the authors' smartphones. At every visit, each participant will be asked about the number of messages received to ensure that all messages have been delivered and seen."

The t-test or Mann-Whitney test will be used to compare numeric variables. Repeated measures analysis of variances or Friedman's test will be used to evaluate repeated measures over the follow-up period.\n\nThe incidence rate and cumulative incidence rate will be computed for incidence of T2DM among the intervention and control groups. Additionally, comparison between the incidence of T2DM among different age groups and gender will be evaluated. Kaplan-Meier survival curves and log-rank tests will be used to compare the intervention and control groups as well as the different risk groups for progression to T2DM, and transition and/or relapses from different stages of TTM.\n\nHazards ratios with 95% confidence intervals will be calculated and the adjustment of known confounders will be adopted in the Cox regression model. In all the analyses, P-values < 0.05 will be considered statistically significant.\n\nThe principal analyses of primary and secondary outcomes will use the intent-to-treat approach. The intentto-treat analyses will include all participants in their randomly assigned treatment groups regardless of a participant's adherence to the assigned treatment regimen.\n\nAll data entry will be anonymous and identification numbers will be saved in a password-protected log file with the primary investigator. Backup of entered data will be created monthly to avoid any loss of collected data. An interim analysis of data will be conducted 12 months after recruitment of the last participants. Interim analysis aims to evaluate the completeness and accuracy of the collected data and early detection of any difficulties."

Furthermore, the IRB at King Saud University's College of Medicine requires 6-monthly study progress reports, projects are monitored by random audits and require the submission of an annual report for protocol approval continuation.\n\nTo avoid possible bias, the laboratory staff, biostatistician, health educator, and principal investigator will be blinded to the participant's group allocation until the end of the study.

The intervention will promote a healthy diet and increase in physical activity among subjects with IGT. We are targeting the eligible participants from the HHP study for this trial. The well-trained research team will deliver the intervention according to the TTM stages, to measure behavioral changes in the prediabetic participants. Therefore, the effectiveness of the SMS messages on behavioral change can be tested as proposed and planned.\n\nThis trial has been designed to address the scarcity in published studies about the effectiveness of lifestyle modification in preventing the occurrence of diabetes, using SMS as an intervention following the TTM model. Furthermore, the current trial will also provide evidence for progression and risk reduction in this category of participants with IFG or IGT. Applying this new approach to promote the importance of lifestyle modification in prediabetics is expected to delay and/or prevent the development of T2DM in Saudi Arabia. Subsequently, the risk of CV morbidity and mortality will also be reduced. Thus, results from this trial will promote an innovative and high-tech way to decrease the burden of CVD and diabetes management in Saudi Arabia."
