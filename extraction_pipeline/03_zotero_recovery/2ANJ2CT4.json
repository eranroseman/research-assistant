  "title": "Effects of type 2 diabetes behavioural telehealth interventions on glycaemic control and adherence: a systematic review",
  "abstract": "We reviewed the effect of behavioural telehealth interventions in type 2 diabetes on glycaemic control and diabetes self-management. The databases CINAHL, Medline and psychINFO were searched in August 2012. Peer-reviewed journal articles that were published in English with a randomised controlled trial design using a usual care comparison group, and in which the primary intervention component was delivered by telehealth, were selected. Relevant outcome measures were glycaemic control and one or more diabetes selfcare area of: diet, physical activity, blood glucose self-monitoring (BGSM) or medication adherence. Interventions were excluded if they were primarily based on a telemonitoring. The search retrieved 1027 articles, from which 49 were selected based on their title and abstract. Fourteen articles (reporting 13 studies) met the eligibility criteria for inclusion. Four studies reported significant improvements in glycaemic control. Five of eight studies on dietary adherence reported significant treatment effects, as did five of eight on physical activity, four of nine on blood glucose self-monitoring, and three of eight on medication adherence. Overall, behavioural telehealth interventions show promise in improving the diabetes self-care and glycemic control of people with type 2 diabetes.",

      "text": "Diabetes is responsible for the eighth-highest burden of disease in Australia. Type 2 diabetes accounts for 92% of the burden due to diabetes,  1  and affects 3.8% of Australians.  2  Glycaemic control is strongly associated with diabetes-related morbidity and mortality,  3  with higher glycaemia predicting increased physical, mental, psychological and psychosocial comorbidities. Improvements in glycaemia to the recommended glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1c ) level of \u22647% 4 are significantly related to a reduced risk of micro-and macrovascular complications.  5 Maintaining essential diabetes self-care practises that include regular physical activity, healthy eating, blood glucose self-monitoring (BGSM) and medication adherence is integral to achieving this.  4  However the majority of diabetes patients remain poorly controlled (HbA 1c \u22658%), which indicates that regular, accessible and effective type 2 diabetes self-management support is required.\n\nTelehealth may assist type 2 diabetes patients by improving accessibility to health care services. This may be of particular importance in rural and regional areas. Currently 26% (230,700) of Australians with diabetes live in inner regional, and 12% (110,400) in outer regional or remote areas.  6 Whilst general practitioners (GPs) are the primary care providers for patients with type 2 diabetes, only 20% of all GPs are based outside metropolitan city areas.  7 Telehealth also presents a convenient, cost-effective way for patients with mobility or motivational problems to receive regular support, including the elderly and patients with complicated diabetes.\n\nTelehealth applications including telephone counselling, videoconferencing and educational telephone-based interventions have been favourably received with good acceptability and uptake by type 2 diabetes patients.  8 Telehealth interventions have also shown efficacy in improving psychosocial, psychological and clinical outcomes in diabetes.  9 Previous reviews of diabetes self-management telehealth interventions have reported the effect of both isolated telephone support  10  and multi-component interventions. Whilst behavioural interventions and ongoing support are acknowledged as being cornerstones for effective type 2 diabetes self-management,  11  the efficacy of behavioural telehealth interventions specifically aimed at improving glycaemic control and diabetes self-care remains unexplored.\n\nWe have therefore conducted a systematic literature review of the effects of behavioural type 2 diabetes telehealth interventions."

      "text": "The EBSCOHOST research databases CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), Medline and psychINFO were searched using the terms: (diabet* and random*) and (tele* or mobile or SMS or smart phone or video* or ehealth). There was no limit on the date of publication.\n\nEligible studies were peer-reviewed journal articles published in the English language that reported evaluating the effects of telehealth interventions on glycaemic control and at least one diabetes self-care outcome out of: physical activity, diet, blood glucose self-monitoring, and medication adherence. Studies had to be randomised controlled trials and included either a usual care comparison, or an active treatment control (where the telehealth condition received the same treatment). Included studies had a sample comprising adults (\u226518 years) with the majority having type 2, rather than type 1 diabetes. The intervention could not primarily be telemonitoring, and must have been exclusively for diabetes management. Studies where medication titration was a major component were excluded, as intensive medication therapy would confound the effects of behavioural change on glycaemic control. Abstracts and titles were screened, and those that appeared to fulfil the eligibility criteria were retrieved (as were ones where eligibility was not able to be determined from the abstract). Backward and forward searches of retrieved articles and relevant systematic reviews were performed to identify additional potentially eligible studies.\n\nThe Cochrane Collaboration's tool for assessing risk of bias  12  was used as a marker for each study's internal validity. Assessments were performed by indicating a yes/no judgement on each of the six domains of validity, and studies deemed to have a high risk of bias were excluded from the review. Data from each study was abstracted and stored in a spreadsheet that included the study's purpose, nature of the intervention, study conditions, outcomes and results."

      "title": "Interventions",
      "text": "The majority of study interventions involved participants receiving regular telephone calls from trained staff (mainly study nurses,  [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18]  but also psychologists/social workers,  19  PhD 20 and Master's 21 students). An exception was the study by Bell et al.  22  in which each participant was sent 30-to 60-second video messages via their mobile phone every 24 hours on diabetes self-care topics. Two studies  16, 23  involved participants receiving automated telephone disease management (ATDM) calls to supplement nurses' follow-up calls. All interventions included diabetes education.\n\nThe active intervention period ranged from 5 weeks  14, 18  to 12 months,  13, 16, 17, 24  and periods for final outcome assessments ranged from 3 months  15, 20, 21  to 12 months post-baseline.  13, [15] [16] [17] 2, 24  In most studies (69%), endpoint measures were taken directly post-intervention. Five studies assessed short-term maintenance,  14, 15, 18, 22, 25  with the longest interval between postintervention and final assessments being 6 months.  22 ycaemic control Four  [20] [21] [22] 24  of thirteen studies reported significant treatment effects on glycaemic control. Thr e also reported significant treatment effects on diabetes self-care. 20, 21, 24  Two 20,21 assessed all four self-care outcomes in addition to glycaemic control, and reported significant improvements in them all. The majority of significant results for glycaemic control were measured directly following the active intervention period, at 3 months 20,21 or 12 months. 24  In Bell et al.'s study,  22  significant improvements in HbA 1c were seen 3 months into the 6-month intervention, but were not maintained at the 6-month post-baseline assessment.\n\nWhilst five studies reported on the dosage of intervention received by intervention group participants,  14, 16, 17, 22, 24  only two of them evaluated dosage relationships with glycaemic outcomes.  22, 24 Both reported significant intervention dosage effects on glycaemic improvements. Walker et al.'s study  24  --a telephone intervention offering \u226510 calls over a year --indicated that intervention group participants completing more than five telephone calls had a significantly greater reduction in HbA 1c . Bell et al.  22  found significant betweengroup interactions for HbA 1c at the 3-month post-baseline follow-up, but no differences at 12 months post-baseline, which was 6 months post-intervention. However, further analyses revealed that \"persistent viewers\" (who viewed >10 video messages a month) experienced a significant reduction in HbA 1c of 0.6% over 12 months, compared with \"early cessation\" participants who did not view the videos or stopped viewing videos within 2 months postenrolment."

      "title": "Dietary adherence",
      "text": "Five of eight studies (63%) that assessed the effects of interventions on dietary adherence reported significant improvements.  13, 20, 21, 24, 26 In four of these, dietary improvements were found directly following the active intervention.  20, 21, 24, 26 There was no notable distinction between the type of dietary and lifestyle intervention offered by studies reporting significant improvements in diet and ones where no significant effect was found.  14, 18, 25 While Kim & Oh's positive study  20  included dietitian reviews of patient meal plans, Trief et al.  25  used dietary goal setting as the primary focus of their telephone counselling intervention, but found no significant dietary improvements. Differences in the study populations may have accounted for the difference in results: in Trief et al.'s study,  25  most participants were obese, and dietary changes may have presented a significant motivational hurdle."

Sustained exercise can reduce insulin resistance and improve glycaemic control,  27  and most studies only tested for effects on glycaemic control immediately post-intervention. A delayed effect of increased physical activity on glycaemic control may have occurred, provided that behavioural changes were maintained. Furthermore, different types of physical activity (e.g. resistance vs. aerobic) has differential impacts on glycaemia.  28 Measures that are sensitive to specific activity changes would help to determine the clinical value of reported improvements."

      "title": "Blood glucose self-monitoring",
      "text": "Four of nine studies (44%) that measured BGSM found significant improvements in frequency.  16, 17, 20, 21 Studies reporting significant effects required participants to regularly selfreport their blood glucose levels to the researcher or nurse, indicating possible effects of accountability on monitoring. However, the findings should be interpreted with caution, as self-report surveys rather than objective assessments were used both for regular BGSM reports during the study and study outcome measures. Only one study  22  provided diabetes supplies at no cost to participants. The cost of increased BGSM may have been a deterrent to increasing self-monitoring in some participants."

      "title": "Medication adherence",

In Walker et al.'s study,  24  significant improvements in medication adherence were reported on ASK-20 items, but not on items from the Morisky Adherence Scale. Only one study reported the intervention group experiencing significant improvements in glycaemia as well as medication adherence.  21 However, significant improvements in three other diabetes self-care outcome measures relevant to the present review also occurred, and those changes may have collectively influenced glycaemic improvements. The study of Walker et al.  24  was the only one to compare medication adherence in insulin-dependent compared with non-dependent type 2 diabetes: It found no significant difference between these sub-groups. Future studies should include analyses of changes in medication adherence within diabetes treatment sub-groups to detect any mediating effects of treatment burden."

      "title": "Study quality and validity",
      "text": "Overall, improvements in study quality and validity of reporting are required, with internal validity being moderate at best amongst the studies. In five studies, it was unclear whether allocation was concealed,  15, 19, 20, 21, 25  presenting a risk of exaggerated treatment effects.  12 ost studies used relatively small sample sizes,  [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] 25, 26  which may have resulted in difficulties detecting significant treatment effects. Trief et al.  25  cited individual differences between study conditions as a potential source of bias in their results. Most studies used samples comprised mainly of ethnic and socioeconomic minorities,  13, 14, 16, 17, 19, [20] [21] [22] 24  presenting problems for external validity."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "Considerable heterogeneity between study processes and outcomes meant that it was difficult to draw firm conclusions. However, the present review demonstrated that behavioural telehealth interventions can significantly improve both glycaemic and diabetes self-care outcomes in type 2 diabetes patients. Of the diabetes self-care outcomes that were examined, physical activity and dietary adherence most commonly demonstrated improvements in response to telehealth.\n\nThe longest study post-intervention follow-up period was only 6 months.  22 Longer intervals between post-intervention and final endpoint follow-up measures would provide a better indication of the longevity of treatment effects and enable detection of \"sleeper\" (delayed) effects. This may also assist with determining optimum times for booster appointments in real-world implementations of telehealth interventions.\n\nIn order to optimise the effect of telehealth for type 2 diabetes, systematic evaluations of different dosages and durations of interventions are also needed, as are studies of specific subgroups of patients (e.g. insulin dependent/non-dependent). Only two studies in the present review reported relationships between intervention exposure and clinical improvements, with both revealing stronger effects from more substantial interventions.  22, 24 e studies reviewed typically had samples of poorly controlled type 2 diabetes patients. Whilst that allows significant treatment effects to be detected, it excludes participants who may benefit from a behaviourally focused telehealth intervention. As shown in Piette et al.  16  and Wolever et al.,  19  sub-group analyses according to HbA 1c allow the detection of treatment effects in cohorts of participants within higher baseline HbA 1c ranges. Undertaking subgroup analyses may be a solution for including individuals with reasonable glycaemic control in behavioural telehealth trials for diabetes. Furthermore, a focus on community sampling, rather than recruiting primarily from diabetes outpatient clinics and/or from minority groups, would enable greater generalisability of results.\n\nFinally, research in this field requires substantial improvements in study methodology, including blind assessment and allocation concealment. Clearer reporting of study processes and outcomes would enable methodological quality and more confident conclusions to be drawn from reviews. up times Reported outcomes (relevant to review) and associated measures Effects of interventions Anderson, D.R.
