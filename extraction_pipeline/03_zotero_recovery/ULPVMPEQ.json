  "title": "Emerging trends in gamification for clinical reasoning education: a scoping review",
  "abstract": "Background Clinical reasoning is a fundamental skill in healthcare education, crucial for diagnosing and managing patient care effectively. Traditional pedagogical techniques often fall short in fully engaging students or simulating real-life medical decision-making complexities. Gamification, which applies game-design elements in educational settings, has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance learning outcomes by making the educational process more interactive and engaging. This scoping review aims to comprehensively map the existing literature on gamification techniques used to enhance clinical reasoning education, identifying trends, gaps, and opportunities for future research. \n Methods The review followed the Joanna Briggs Institute (JBI) methodology and the Arksey and O'Malley framework for scoping reviews. A systematic search of Medline, Scopus, and Web of science, complemented by hand-searching reference lists. Studies published between 2014 and 2023, focusing on gamification applied to clinical reasoning education for healthcare professionals and trainees, were eligible for inclusion. Two independent reviewers screened and selected studies, and data were extracted using a pre-defined tool. Findings were synthesized using both quantitative summaries and qualitative thematic analysis. \n Results Fifty-three studies met the inclusion criteria, representing research from 20 countries, with the United States contributing the largest proportion (28.3%), followed by Germany (9.4%) and France (7.6%). The majority of studies were cross-sectional (28.3%) or pilot studies (22.6%). Gamification was most frequently applied in university and academic settings (37.7%), followed by clinical and hospital-based training (18.9%), and digital platforms and simulations (17.0%). Medicine (28.3%) and nursing (22.6%) were the most targeted disciplines, with pharmacy (13.2%) following. Serious games were the most common gamification technique (45.3%), with additional strategies including escape rooms (11.3%), board and card games (7.5%), and branching case-based games (5.7%). Most studies (88.7%) referenced at least one theoretical framework, predominantly game-based learning theories (34.0%), followed by constructivist learning (13.2%) and experiential learning theories (13.2%). However, cognitive theories, directly relevant to clinical reasoning, were referenced in only 11.3% of studies, highlighting a theoretical gap. Conclusions Gamification offers diverse and flexible strategies for enhancing clinical reasoning education across healthcare disciplines and settings. However, significant gaps remain, including limited longitudinal evidence, inconsistent use of validated reasoning assessments, underutilization of cognitive reasoning theories, and a lack of standardized design and reporting frameworks. Moreover, research predominantly focuses on medicine and nursing,",

      "text": "In recent years, gamification has emerged as a developing paradigm in education, integrating game design, game elements, and educational strategies to enhance learners' motivation and performance  [1] [2] [3] . In one of the most gamified professional environments-healthcare education-where academic success is directly linked to patient outcomes, gamification has been recognized for its potential to improve clinical reasoning skills among trainees and practitioners  [4, 5] . Clinical reasoning is one of the core competency in healthcare, allowing practitioners to analyze clinical data, apply evidence-based guidelines, and arrive at diagnostic and therapeutic decisions  [6] [7] [8] . However, the specific strategies through which gamification is integrated into clinical reasoning education remain underexplored, forming the central purpose of this scoping review. The rapid advancement of digital technology has created unprecedented opportunities to integrate game-based elements into healthcare education  [3, 9, 10] . These innovations hold promise for overcoming traditional barriers in medical curricula, particularly learner engagement and knowledge retention. Despite growing interest and apparent benefits, the literature on gamification in clinical reasoning education remains fragmented and subject to variable interpretation. This review aims to synthesize existing evidence, providing insights for educators, curriculum developers, and policymakers in medical and healthcare education."

      "title": "Evolution of gamification in education and healthcare education",
      "text": "Gamification, defined as the application of game-based methods and processes in educational or training environments, aims to increase learners' intrinsic motivation for voluntary learning activities  [11] [12] [13] . In educational settings, this approach translates into the integration of points, levels, badges, leaderboards, and storylines into learning activities, making them competitive, hard, and engaging  [1, 9, 12] . A meta-analysis by  Sailer and Homner (2020)  found that gamification has a moderate positive effect (g \u2248 0.49) on cognitive learning outcomes and a smaller but significant effect (g \u2248 0.26) on motivational outcomes  [14] . Research suggests that gamification enhances learner engagement and motivation; both of which are essential not only for initiating learning but also for ensuring knowledge retention in healthcare education. For example, gamification has been used in healthcare education as a tool to improve knowledge acquisition, advance clinical skills, and enhance professional competencies  [3, 10, [15] [16] [17] . Studies by  Gentry et al. (2019)  and  Lumsden et al. (2016)  have demonstrated that gamified learning environments support the development of clinical skills and reasoning by providing realistic, safe, and controlled settings that foster active learning and critical thinking  [5, 18] . These findings suggest that while gamification enhances engagement and knowledge acquisition, its efficacy depends on contextual factors such as game design quality, instructional alignment, and learner characteristics."

      "title": "Clinical reasoning in healthcare",
      "text": "Clinical reasoning is a complex cognitive process that implicates the integration of knowledge, skills, and critical thinking in patient care  [4, 5, 19] . It is the cognitive process that involves thinking about information in healthcare and is much different from mere problemsolving or decision-making  [6, 20] . This, therefore, points out the importance of clinical reasoning in health education against structured teaching and assessment in the curricula of medical and health professions. Many medical schools have brought to the limelight the teaching of clinical reasoning, all in an aim to improve patient care by reducing diagnostic errors  [21] [22] [23] . Despite its potential benefits, gamification in healthcare education presents several challenges and risks  [24, 25] . One recurring concern is the inconsistent efficacy reported across the literature. Systematic reviews by Dicheva et al.  (2015)  and Subhash & Cudney (2018) reported high variability across gamified interventions, with some studies showing substantial learning gains and others reporting no significant effect  [18, 26, 27] . This heterogeneity creates uncertainty for educators and instructional designers, making it challenging to identify best practices for effective gamification in clinical reasoning education. Key concerns include the superficial use of gamification elements, where game mechanics are implemented without deep integration into learning objectives; an overemphasis on competition, which may reduce motivation for some learners and create unintended disparities in engagement; high resource demands, including significant with limited attention to interprofessional reasoning and underrepresented fields such as dentistry, rehabilitation, and allied health. Future research should prioritize theoretically informed gamification design, apply robust reasoning outcome measures, and explore emerging technologies such as AI-enhanced adaptive gamification and immersive virtual reality simulations to support clinical reasoning development. Addressing these gaps will ensure that gamification evolves from a promising innovation into a rigorously evidence-based strategy for enhancing clinical reasoning competence in healthcare education.\n\ntime and financial investment for initial development; and variability in efficacy, as gamified approaches differ widely in design, execution, and educational impact  [1, 28] . The inconsistent results across studies may contribute to uncertainty among educators and developers regarding best practices. Moreover, the great diversity found within gamified approaches and the inconsistency of its efficacy according to the literature, in all probability, this situation is likely to raise questions or concerns between educators and developers.\n\nThis scoping review aims to comprehensively map the existing literature on the application of gamification techniques to enhance clinical reasoning education among healthcare professionals. The review seeks to identify the types of gamification strategies used, the educational contexts in which they are applied, the healthcare disciplines targeted, and the theoretical frameworks underpinning these interventions."

      "text": "Overall, 47 out of 53 studies (88.7%) explicitly referenced at least one theoretical framework, while 6 studies (11.3%) lacked a clearly articulated theoretical foundation. The most frequently applied theoretical category was Game-Based Learning and Gamification Theories, referenced in 18 studies (34.0%)  [17, 32-34, 42, 45, 46, 48, 51, 56, 57, 61-63, 67, 71, 73, 75] . These frameworks emphasize the integration of game mechanics-such as points, badges, leaderboards, and narrative progressioninto educational design to enhance learner motivation, engagement, and performance. This finding highlights the strong theoretical connection between gamification and game-based learning principles in health professions education.\n\nConstructivist Learning Theories were the second most common, applied in 7 studies (13.2%)  [60, 64, 70, [76] [77] [78] 81] . These theories emphasize active, learner-centered knowledge construction, aligning well with problembased learning, collaborative case-solving, and interactive game design. This theoretical orientation reflects the shift toward active learning pedagogies in clinical reasoning education.\n\nExperiential Learning Theory, which focuses on learning through direct experience, reflection, and iterative improvement, appeared in 7 studies (13.2%)  [15, 40, 44, 52, 53, 72, 79] . This highlights the close relationship between simulation-based gamification and experiential learning principles, particularly in case-based reasoning and serious games designed to mimic real clinical decision-making.\n\nCognitive Theories were referenced in 6 studies (11.3%)  [42, 43, 54, 55, 68, 80] , particularly those focusing on clinical reasoning development. These theories address how learners process clinical information, apply critical thinking strategies, and balance intuitive versus analytical reasoning. While cognitive theories directly align with the goal of improving clinical reasoning, their relatively limited use suggests a gap in cognitive science integration within the gamification literature.\n\nA smaller group of studies applied other theoretical foundations, reflecting the diversity of approaches in gamification research. Specifically, Immersive Learning appeared in 3 studies, emphasizing the importance of realistic, simulation-based environments in supporting clinical reasoning development  [16, 36, 58] . Active Learning  [37, 39]  and Self-Determination Theory  [41, 66]  were each reported in 2 studies, highlighting the role of learner engagement, autonomy, and intrinsic motivation in gamified interventions. Meanwhile, Adult Learning Theory  [38] , Behaviorism & Transformative Learning  [47] , and Personalized Learning  [74]  were each applied in a single study, demonstrating occasional use of more specialized or context-specific educational models. These minority frameworks complement the broader trends, indicating that while theoretical grounding is present in most studies, there is no singular guiding paradigm, and the theoretical diversity reflects the evolving and exploratory nature of gamification research in clinical reasoning education."

      "text": "This scoping review identified 53 studies published between 2014 and 2023, highlighting a growing interest in using gamification to enhance clinical reasoning education in healthcare professions. The sharp increase in publications after 2019 reflects both the accelerated adoption of technology-enhanced learning during the COVID-19 pandemic and the increasing recognition of gamification as a valuable educational strategy in health professions education  [82, 83] . Similar publication surges have been reported in related areas such as simulationbased education and serious games, indicating that gamification is now seen as part of a broader movement toward experiential and technology-enhanced learning in clinical training  [83]  . The wide international representation-spanning 20 countries-demonstrates gamification's global appeal. However, the predominance of studies from the United States (28.3%), Germany (9.4%), and France (7.6%) highlights a concentration of research in higher-income, Western contexts. This geographical skew raises important questions about the transferability of gamification strategies to diverse educational and cultural contexts, particularly in low-resource settings  [84] . Future research should prioritize studies in underrepresented regions to ensure findings are globally relevant and culturally adaptable. The predominance of crosssectional studies (28.3%) and pilot studies (22.6%) reflects the exploratory nature of much gamification research in clinical reasoning education. While these designs provide valuable initial insights into feasibility and learner engagement, they offer limited evidence regarding longterm educational impact  [85, 86] . The relatively small proportion of experimental studies (13.2%) highlights the need for more rigorous research designs capable of establishing causal relationships between gamification techniques and reasoning outcomes. This aligns with broader critiques of gamification research in health professions education, where enthusiasm for innovation has often outpaced methodological rigor. Gamification was most applied in university and academic settings (37.7%), with a focus on undergraduate and postgraduate education. This is consistent with health professions education's increasing emphasis on active learning and competencybased training during pre-licensure education. Gamification's integration into clinical and hospital-based training (18.9%) further highlights its potential to bridge classroom learning and workplace reasoning development, particularly in residency programs and clinical placements. Interestingly, a substantial proportion of studies (17.0%) implemented gamification via digital platforms and simulations, reflecting both the increasing digitalization of health professions education and the flexibility of gamification for remote or hybrid learning contexts. However, the limited use of gamification in continuing professional development and community-based education highlights an underutilized opportunity to support reasoning development across the career continuumfrom novice learners to experienced clinicians."

      "title": "Gamification techniques applied to enhance clinical reasoning in healthcare education",
      "text": "Gamification interventions targeting clinical reasoning were most frequently applied in medicine (28.3%) and nursing (22.6%), reflecting the central roles of these professions in clinical decision-making and their long history of educational innovation  [87] . Pharmacy (13.2%) was also well-represented, particularly in studies focusing on medication management and reasoning processes linked to pharmacotherapy  [88] . However, other professionssuch as dentistry, rehabilitation, and allied health-were less frequently studied, highlighting a potential gap. This is particularly important given the growing emphasis on interprofessional education (IPE), where effective clinical reasoning requires collaborative decision-making across multiple disciplines  [89, 90] .\n\nThis scoping review also reveals that a broad spectrum of gamification techniques has been applied, underscoring the flexibility of gamification in meeting diverse educational needs. Serious games were the most used (45.3%), consistent with broader trends in health professions education  [91] . Serious games engage learners in authentic scenarios, encouraging pattern recognition, hypothesis generation, and decision-making under uncertainty, all of which are essential for clinical reasoning  [19] . Such techniques have been shown to promote both System 1 (intuitive) and System 2 (analytical) reasoning processes  [92] . In addition to serious games, several lower-tech and collaborative approaches were applied, including escape rooms (11.3%), which simulate time-pressured clinical problem-solving in teams. Board and card games (7.5%) offered accessible, small-group formats that fostered collaborative reasoning through structured reflection and peer discussion. Similarly, branching case-based games (5.7%) placed learners into evolving patient cases requiring decisionmaking at critical junctures, with consequential feedback at each step. Such designs parallel the script concordance approach, where learners navigate diagnostic uncertainty by comparing their decisions to expert reasoning.\n\nEmerging approaches such as AI-enhanced gamification and flipped gamified learning signal future directions for innovation  [49] . AI-enhanced games offer personalized, adaptive feedback based on real-time performance, while flipped approaches embed pre-class gamified exercises to prepare learners for deeper in-class clinical reasoning discussions  [93] . These adaptive and blended approaches align with trends toward personalized learning and justin-time reasoning support in health professions education  [94] ."

      "title": "Theoretical frameworks guiding gamification interventions",
      "text": "The review findings demonstrate increased theoretical grounding in gamification research, with 88.7% of studies explicitly referencing at least one theoretical framework. This represents progress compared to earlier critiques that gamification research lacked pedagogical rigor  [28] . The most applied frameworks were game-based learning and gamification theories (34%), which emphasize using points, badges, leaderboards, and narratives to enhance learner motivation and engagement  [95] . While engagement is valuable, these frameworks are insufficient for clinical reasoning education because they do not explicitly address the cognitive processes underlying diagnostic reasoning  [96] . Constructivist learning theories (13.2%) and experiential learning theory (13.2%) were also frequently applied, reflecting gamification's alignment with active learning and problem-based learning (PBL) principles  [97, 98] . In these frameworks, learners build understanding through authentic case experiences, where reflection on reasoning processes plays a central role in learning  [98] .\n\nHowever, despite their relevance, cognitive theories were cited in only 11.3% of studies, indicating a significant theoretical gap. Clinical reasoning is fundamentally a cognitive process that involves interpreting clinical cues, forming, and testing hypotheses, and continuously refining diagnostic scripts  [99] . Cognitive frameworks such as dual-process theory [100]-which describes the interplay between fast, intuitive (System 1) and slower, analytical (System 2) reasoning-offer valuable insights that could enhance future gamified designs  [92] . Cognitive load theory could further guide game complexity, ensuring that reasoning challenges are cognitively stimulating without overwhelming learners  [101] .\n\nFurthermore, script theory offers a developmentally informed model for supporting clinical reasoning through gamification  [102] . By scaffolding learners' development of diagnostic scripts, games can gradually expose learners to more ambiguous or complex cases, helping to develop the adaptive expertise necessary for clinical practice  [102] . A smaller proportion of studies applied Self-Determination Theory, emphasizing the importance of supporting learners' autonomy, competence, and relatedness to foster intrinsic motivation  [103] . Given the centrality of confidence and self-regulation in clinical reasoning, integrating autonomy-supportive game mechanics (e.g., meaningful choices, flexible pathways) could enhance both engagement and cognitive growth  [104] ."

While the findings illustrate a growing interest in gamified approaches, several critical gaps and challenges remain, pointing to important directions for future research."
    },
    {
      "title": "Limited longitudinal and outcome-based research",
      "text": "The first major gap is the absence of longitudinal research assessing the long-term effects of gamification on clinical reasoning competence. Most of the included studies focused on short-term engagement, motivation, and selfreported learning, but very few applied validated clinical reasoning assessments or tracked outcomes beyond the immediate intervention period. This limits our understanding of whether gamified learning translates into lasting improvements in diagnostic accuracy, clinical decision-making confidence, or real-world performance. Future studies should incorporate performance-based assessments, such as script concordance tests, thinkaloud protocols, and structured diagnostic reasoning rubrics, to better evaluate the cognitive and metacognitive impact of gamified reasoning interventions."
    },
    {
      "title": "Underutilization of cognitive theories in gamification design",
      "text": "The second gap relates to the underutilization of cognitive theories in gamification design. Despite clinical reasoning being fundamentally a cognitive process, only a small proportion of studies explicitly applied cognitive learning theories. While Self-Determination Theory and game-based learning frameworks were frequently cited, theories such as Dual-Process Theory, which explains the interplay between intuitive and analytical reasoning, were rarely considered. Similarly, Cognitive Load Theory, which offers critical insights into balancing challenge and cognitive burden in learning tasks, was seldom applied to guide gamification design. The limited attention to Script Theory, which describes how clinicians develop and refine illness scripts over time, also represents a missed opportunity. To design more cognitively effective gamified learning experiences, future research must actively bridge the gap between gamification mechanics and cognitive reasoning science."
    },
    {
      "title": "Lack of standardization in gamification design and reporting",
      "text": "A third area for development is the lack of standardized design and reporting frameworks for gamified reasoning interventions. The scoping review found considerable heterogeneity in the design, duration, and complexity of gamified interventions, making it difficult to compare results across studies or synthesize evidence into generalizable conclusions. Some interventions used high-fidelity serious games with immersive 3D simulations, while others employed low-tech board games or simple pointbased incentives. This variability underscores the need for a taxonomy of gamification techniques, distinguishing fully immersive games, branching case simulations, collaborative escape rooms, and hybrid game-based platforms. Applying standardized reporting guidelines, such as the GAMER framework for gamification in medical education, would enhance methodological transparency and support future meta-analyses in this field."
    },
    {
      "title": "Limited research in interprofessional and multidisciplinary",
      "text": "The fourth gap relates to disciplinary and interprofessional scope. Most studies targeted medicine and nursing, with relatively limited representation from pharmacy, dentistry, rehabilitation, and allied health professions. Given that clinical reasoning is inherently interprofessional, especially in complex patient cases requiring collaborative care, this disciplinary imbalance represents a missed opportunity. Future research should explore how gamification can support reasoning development across multiple professions, fostering team-based diagnostic skills. Designing gamified learning experiences that deliberately require interprofessional collaboration, such as multidisciplinary escape rooms or virtual team-based serious games, could better prepare learners for the realities of collaborative clinical reasoning in practice."
    },
    {
      "title": "Emerging technologies and the future of gamified clinical reasoning",
      "text": "Finally, technological innovation presents both a gap and a future opportunity. Emerging approaches such as AI-enhanced gamification, personalized adaptive game platforms, and immersive virtual reality (VR) simulations remain underexplored in the context of clinical reasoning education. AI-based systems could dynamically adjust case complexity and feedback based on learners' evolving reasoning performance, while VR could provide authentic, high-stakes reasoning scenarios in a fully immersive format. Mobile gamification platforms, offering justin-time reasoning practice, could also help clinicians refine reasoning skills in the flow of work. As technology evolves, future research should critically evaluate these innovations, ensuring that technological enhancement serves pedagogical and cognitive goals rather than becoming an end."

The findings demonstrate that gamification is a versatile, engaging, and increasingly theory-driven approach that has been applied across various educational settings, healthcare disciplines, and reasoning competencies.\n\nSerious games, escape rooms, branching case simulations, and gamified digital platforms offer diverse strategies for fostering clinical reasoning, catering to both individual diagnostic decision-making and collaborative reasoning in team-based settings. Encouragingly, most studies reference theoretical frameworks, yet gaps remain in the integration of cognitive science to support higher-order reasoning processes."
