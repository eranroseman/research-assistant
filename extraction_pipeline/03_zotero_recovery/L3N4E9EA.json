  "title": "Text Message Behavioral Intervention for Teens on Eating, Physical Activity and Social Wellbeing (TEXTBITES): Protocol for a Randomized Controlled Trial",
  "abstract": "Background: Obesity is among the most significant health challenges facing today's adolescents. Weight gain during adolescence is related to cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and some cancers in later life. Presently, adolescents living in Australia have limited access to age-appropriate obesity prevention services. Objective: This study aims to investigate whether a two-way text message program, with optional telephone health counseling, improves body mass index (BMI) z score and lifestyle outcomes in adolescents who are overweight. Methods: This study will be a single-blind randomized controlled trial (N=150) comparing a two-way text message intervention, with optional telephone health counseling, to usual care in adolescents (13-18 years old, inclusive) who are overweight (recruited from a pediatric weight management clinic and the broader community in Sydney, Australia). The intervention group will receive a six-month text message program, which consists of two-way, semipersonalized, lifestyle-focused text messages (four messages/week) in addition to usual care. The control group will be assigned to receive usual care. The study also includes a follow-up at 12-months. The primary outcome is a change in BMI z score at six months. Secondary outcomes are changes in waist-to-height ratio, diet, physical and sedentary activity levels, sleep quality, quality of life, self-esteem, self-efficacy, social support, and eating disorder and depression symptoms. Also, we will examine acceptability, utility, and engagement with the program through a study-specific process evaluation questionnaire, semi-structured telephone interviews, and an analysis of health counselor communication logs. The analyses will be performed by the intention-to-treat principle to assess differences between intervention and control groups. \n Results: The study opened for recruitment in December 2019. Data collection is expected to be completed by December 2021, and the results for the primary outcome are expected to be published in early 2022. Conclusions: This study will test the effectiveness of an interactive two-way text message program compared to usual care in improving BMI z score and lifestyle outcomes in adolescents with overweight. This interactive, innovative, and scalable project also aims to inform future practice and community initiatives to promote obesity prevention behaviors for adolescents.",

      "text": "The global prevalence of obese and overweight adolescents has significantly increased over the last five decades, with 18% of the global population of children and adolescents being overweight or obesity in 2016  [1] . No developed countries have successfully halted the continuing upward trend in the prevalence of obesity and being overweight since 1980  [1] . For example, in 2017-2018, 25% of adolescents aged 12-17 years old and living in Australia, were overweight or obese  [2] . Among older adolescents (16-17 years old) residing in Australia, there has been a 57% increase in the incidence of obesity in the last three years  [2] . In the United States of America, 20.6% of adolescents aged 12-19 years old had obesity in 2013-2014  [3] .\n\nPreventing obesity during adolescence is important because adolescence is a life stage when risk factors and lifestyles are established  [4, 5] . Once obesity is established, weight loss and weight maintained after weight loss are difficult to achieve  [6] . Consequently, gaining excess weight during adolescence is likely to lead to being overweight and obese in adulthood  [7] . Weight gain during adolescence is associated with higher risk and earlier onset of cardiovascular disease  [8] , type 2 diabetes  [9] , and some cancers  [10] . Moreover, adolescent obesity has adverse psychosocial outcomes, including weight stigma  [11]  and reduced quality of life and self-esteem  [12] . Long term weight regulation is related to diet and physical behaviors that are adopted during adolescence and track throughout life  [4] . Therefore, to halt the rise in the prevalence of overweight and obese adolescents, scalable, low-cost, and engaging strategies are needed.\n\nSeveral lifestyle risk factors have been associated with excess weight gain during adolescence, and adolescents that are living in developed countries are not achieving national recommendations. Firstly, consuming the recommended intake of fruits and vegetables may prevent unhealthy weight gain  [13] , yet only 4% of adolescents living in Australia, aged 12-17 years old, meet national guidelines for fruit and vegetable intake  [2] . Secondly, adolescents remain the highest consumers of discretionary foods and sugar-sweetened beverages, despite the evidence that consumption increases the risk of obesity and being overweight  [14, 15] . In Australia and the United States, over 60% of adolescents drink a sugar-sweetened beverage daily, adding 143 kilocalories per day. Moreover, discretionary foods account for a significant portion of adolescents' total energy intake (>40% in Australian adolescents)  [16] . Finally, short sleep duration  [17] , insufficient physical activity levels, and increased screen time are associated with an increased risk of obesity  [18, 19] . Both physical activity and sedentary screen-based behavior guidelines are met by less than 4% of adolescents aged 13-17 years old  [20] , and night-time technology use can have harmful effects on adolescent sleep duration  [21] .\n\nDespite the apparent risk for weight gain during adolescence, evidence to inform effective interventions for this population is lacking. A 2019 Cochrane review of 31 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) testing the effectiveness of a range of interventions, which included diet or physical activity components or both, designed to prevent obesity in adolescents found limited effective interventions for adolescents aged 13-18 years old  [22] . There has been more investment in childhood obesity prevention research, with over 85 RCTs conducted in children aged 6-12 years old. Moreover, the diet and physical activity strategies delivered to adolescents in the studies did not reduce their body mass index (BMI) z score, and there has been limited investigation of digital intervention modalities. Current attrition rates for traditional, in-person obesity prevention and management interventions in adolescents remain highly variable, with 27% to 73% of participants dropping out of interventions for reasons including the intervention not meeting the adolescent's expectations  [23, 24] . Digital technology has been identified as an engaging intervention modality for overweight and obese adolescents  [25] . Thus, mobile phone interventions hold promise for delivering interventions that are scalable, low-cost, and engaging.\n\nCurrently, over 90% of adolescents living in Australia and the United States own a mobile phone  [26, 27] , and text messaging remains a primary means of communication between adolescents  [27] . There is a small body of evidence which indicates one-way text message interventions can promote weight loss in adults  [28] . Emerging research has shown that text messages are a feasible and acceptable form of communication in interventions for adolescents with obesity  [29] [30] [31] [32] . However, there is limited high-quality evidence for the role of two-way text messages to improve obesity prevention behaviors in adolescents who are overweight. Therefore, the primary aim of this study is to test the effectiveness of a two-way, semipersonalized text message program, with optional health counseling, compared to usual care for improving adolescents' BMI z score. This study also aims to determine if the text message program can improve lifestyle outcomes. The study will also examine acceptability, utility, and engagement with the program."

      "text": "The TEXTBITES (TEXT message Behavioral Intervention for Teens on Eating, physical activity, and Social wellbeing) study is a single-blind, multi-center, randomized controlled trial, which delivers a six-month obesity prevention program via text messages to adolescents who are overweight. The study also includes a twelve-month follow-up (Figure  1 ). The sites include public hospitals and a pediatric weight management clinic at a public children's hospital in Sydney, Australia. Participants will be recruited via referral from the pediatric weight management clinic, and from the local community via print and digital advertisements at community centers, high schools, and tertiary education providers. A log of all recruitment strategies utilized will be kept. The target sample size is 150 adolescents aged 13-18 years old inclusive, who are overweight. Participants will be randomly allocated to either a control or intervention group. The control group will be assigned to receive usual care. For this study, usual care is defined as accessing available health services and information for adolescent obesity prevention. The intervention group will be allocated to receive the six-month, two-way text message program for obesity prevention that provides practical tips and information, motivation, and support for lifestyle modification for healthy eating, physical activity, and mental wellbeing behaviors, in addition to usual care. Trained research personnel blinded to the group allocation will conduct assessments at baseline, six-, and twelve-months during a face-to-face interview."

      "text": "After obtaining written informed consent from adolescents and their parents or guardians (if <18 years old) and completing the baseline assessment, the research assistant will enter the data into a secure web-based database. Then randomization will occur via a centralized, computerized randomization program in a uniform 1:1 allocation ratio (control: intervention). Randomization is based on a permuted randomized block design, where the strata are gender, age, and recruitment site. The randomized block method contained block sizes of 2 and 4 in a ratio of 2:1 to minimize imbalance in small strata groups. A randomization list was generated by an independent statistician using RandomiseR package  [33]  within the R computing environment (The R Foundation, Vienna, Austria). For each participant, the computer system automatically produces a study identification number, which will be used on all study documents. On the following Monday, after the baseline visit, the computer system automatically sends the assigned text message program to the participant. Therefore, the researcher conducting all face-to-face assessments remains blind to the study allocation. As an additional precaution and for safety Partridge et al JMIR RESEARCH PROTOCOLS XSL \u2022 FO RenderX purposes, there will be an independent, unblinded researcher monitoring all incoming text messages.\n\nA 20% (30/150) subsample of participants will be randomly assigned to wear an accelerometer for seven days to validate the self-reported physical activity questionnaire. These participants will receive a second layer of randomization, which will be nested within each treatment arm at a ratio of 1:5. A total of 15 participants with accelerometers will be in the text message intervention group, and 15 participants will be in the control group."

      "text": "The text message content was co-designed with adolescents and research/health professionals and using established scientific methods  [37] . The bank of 107 unique text messages are based on seven behavior change techniques with demonstrated effectiveness in adolescent obesity prevention interventions  [38] , and on evidence-based health information found in current national obesity prevention, nutrition, and physical activity guidelines  [36, 39, 40] . Findings from previous text message development research with adolescents were also applied to ensure the text message style and language were appropriate and engaging for adolescents  [31, 32, 41, 42] .\n\nEach intervention participant will receive a customized and semipersonalized set of text messages sent on four random days per week, including one weekend day, and at random times (Table  1 ). Each unique text message will only be sent only once during the 6-months. If the participant is attending high school, the weekday text messages will only be sent before or after school hours (8:00 AM to 9:00 AM or 3:30 PM to 7:30 PM). Text messages are based on four priority areas, namely, healthy eating behaviors (n=26), physical activity behaviors (n=18), mental wellbeing (n=21), and general behaviors (n=34), and a total of 6 text messages prompt communication with the health counselor. One welcome message and one final text message are included in the bank of 107 text messages. General behavior messages are focused on the environmental impact of eating and activity, food environment, time management, and practical tips.\n\nThe text messages will be semipersonalized by using the participant's name and selecting text message content relevant to the participant's characteristics, such as age. Participants can also update their personal information (eg, mobile phone number or change in school attendance) throughout the study. Messages are sent at no cost to the participants; however, text message replies to the study team will be paid for by the participant at standard short message service (SMS) rates set by their mobile phone provider. The intervention will encourage two-way communication, with participants monitored by the health counselor on weekdays. All replies and responses will be reviewed in regular weekly team meetings."

The health counseling calls will employ complementary theoretical approaches to the text messages, including motivational interviewing, goal setting, self-monitoring, barrier identification, and problem-solving  [43, 44] . The personalized health counseling calls will last 10-15 minutes and will be delivered according to a standardized protocol. The university-qualified health counselor (allied health professional) will monitor and respond to participants' request for a call each month, either via text message or phone call, within three working days. Participants are allowed a total of six health counseling calls in total over six months. The health counseling calls will enable participants to set behavioral goals, discuss barriers and enablers to behavior change, and their overall progress.

Each week messages will be selected from the message bank by the software sequencer system that ensures that participants are receiving the correct messages (intervention vs control). Both intervention and control groups will receive a welcome text message at the beginning of the study and a concluding message at the end of the 6-months. Each text message will have a unique signature to ensure that participants know these messages are from the TEXTBITES study. All participants will be given brief training at baseline on how to read, delete, and save a text message, and how to unsubscribe if required. Training will also include safe and acceptable times to read the text messages (eg, reminding participants they must not read the text messages or use any other mobile phone functions if they are driving). All participants will also be provided with the research personnel's contact details and will be contacted at least once during the intervention period to organize the six-month follow-up assessment and once during the follow-up period to facilitate the twelve-month follow-up assessment.\n\nA researcher will manage a study mobile phone, and a record will be kept of any incoming messages from participants, and all out-going replies from the study health counselor throughout the study. Any analysis of these incoming text messages will be performed at the group level, except for reporting examples of individual quotes, which will be anonymized to protect the participant's identity. Participants from either group can withdraw from the study at any time with or without giving a reason by replying \"STOP\" to any of the messages or contacting a member of the research team, which will activate a process of review and withdrawal from the study. If a reason for withdrawal is provided, it will be recorded."

At the 6-month follow-up, both control and intervention participants will be asked if they accessed any other health-related information or programs regarding weight management or lifestyle behavior change. Intervention participants will be invited in person, or by telephone, to take part in a semistructured telephone interview at six-months. A minimum of 15 interviews will be conducted and will be consecutive until no new themes or categories emerge (thematic saturation). However, it is anticipated that at least 30-40 participants will be invited to take part. These interviews will be conducted by telephone and will last approximately 30 minutes. Participants will be purposively selected to ensure that a variety of views are explored and to obtain a mix of participants in terms of age and ethnicity."

Planned subgroup analyses will investigate interactions between treatment and subgroups, including categories of age, socioeconomic status, and ethnicity, to explore trends for future studies. A significance level of 0.05 will be used. All analyses will be undertaken using SAS version 9.4 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina, United States).\n\nProcess evaluation data, including questionnaire data, interview data, and text message management data, will be analyzed using mixed methods. Descriptive analysis will be used to examine questionnaire data and software analytics. Interviews will be conducted by a trained qualitative interviewer, digitally recorded and transcribed. Interview data will be analyzed thematically, and coding based on emergent themes using the NVIVO Software program, version 12 (QRS International Pty Ltd, Victoria, Australia)."

      "title": "Primary Findings",
      "text": "The study will evaluate an innovative means of delivering a simple obesity prevention program to adolescents who are overweight and are at risk of obesity using an RCT. It is hypothesized that the intervention group will see improvements in primary and secondary outcomes compared to control post-intervention (six-months) and at follow-up (twelve-months). If effective, this study will inform translational research to improve BMI and lifestyle outcomes for adolescents, and to prevent the transition to obesity in young adulthood. Results of the process evaluation will assess the barriers and enablers to widespread implementation of the text message program, with the ultimate goal of providing adolescents with age-appropriate, evidence-based, and accessible obesity prevention services.\n\nThe simple and innovative text message program addresses a critical gap in obesity prevention for adolescents, given their risk of future chronic diseases. Text messages are an appropriate and accessible intervention delivery modality for this population group. The benefit of text messages is that they do not require an internet connection to receive, offer an interactive modality to communicate with health professionals, can be delivered with minimal personnel, and may provide a socially equitable intervention for most adolescents. As such, text message interventions show the potential to reduce socioeconomic disparities in health care and deliver a scalable, low-cost intervention to a wide population. To date, there have been only eight RCTs investigating text messages for obesity prevention or management in adolescent populations  [30, [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] . The interventions were mostly multicomponent mobile health interventions, and there was limited process evaluation data to help understand the effects of the text message component. Taken together, currently, there is limited high-quality research investigating obesity prevention interventions delivered via text message for adolescents. Hence, the TEXTBITES study aims to address this research gap."
