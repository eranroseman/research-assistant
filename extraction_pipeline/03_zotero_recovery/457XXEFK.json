      "text": "According to The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Control Hypertension (U.S.\n\nDepartment of Health and Human Services, 2020), the prevalence of hypertension in the U.S. is a pressing issue. 45% of the adults in the U.S. suffer from hypertension, only 2 out of 3 receive treatment, and only 1 out of 4 have it controlled. Hypertension is not only a risk factor for heart disease and stroke. It can also lead to heart failure, kidney disease, pregnancy complications, and cognitive decline, among other health issues  (Whelton et al., 2017) .\n\nHypertension is directly and indirectly linked to over 500,000 deaths per year in the U.S. (CDC WONDER Online Database website, 2019) and has a substantial economic impact. The total medical costs associated with hypertension in the U.S. are $130 billion and are only expected to rise  (Kirkland et al., 2018) . Employers incur an additional $10.3 billion annually due to absenteeism from work associated with hypertension  (Asay, 2026) .\n\nGiven the stagnation and potential decline in the proportion of U.S. adults with controlled blood pressure  (Muntner, 2020) , exploring innovative approaches is crucial. A meta-analysis of randomized trials has found that home blood pressure self-monitoring is more effective than standard blood pressure monitoring in the healthcare system. IDIs can facilitate home self-monitoring while reducing costs and the time required from healthcare providers. They can provide patients round-the-clock access to vital health education, personalized information, and tailored feedback  (Cappuccio et al., 2004 ). Therefore, the potential of IDIs as a treatment option for the U.S. adult population with hypertension warrants further research."
