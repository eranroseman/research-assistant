  "abstract": "Introduction: Carbohydrate restriction markedly improves glycemic control in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) but necessitates prompt medication changes. Therefore, we assessed the effectiveness and safety of a novel care model providing continuous remote care with medication management based on biometric feedback combined with the metabolic approach of nutritional ketosis for T2D management. \n Methods: We conducted an open-label, nonrandomized, controlled, before-and-after 1-year study of this continuous care intervention (CCI) and usual care (UC). Primary outcomes were glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c ), weight, and medication use. Secondary outcomes included fasting serum glucose and insulin, HOMA-IR, blood lipids and lipoproteins, liver and kidney function markers, and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP). Results: 349 adults with T2D enrolled: CCI: n = 262 [mean (SD); 54 (8) years, 116.5 (25.9) kg, 40.4 (8.8) kg m 2 , 92% obese, 88% prescribed T2D medication]; UC: n = 87 (52 (10) years, 105.6 (22.15) kg, 36.72 (7.26) kg m 2 , 82% obese, 87% prescribed T2D medication]. 218 participants (83%) remained enrolled in the CCI at 1 year.

      "title": "PLAIN LANGUAGE SUMMARY",
      "text": "Treatments for type 2 diabetes (T2D) have improved, yet T2D and being overweight are still significant public health concerns. Blood sugar in patients with T2D can improve quickly when patients eat significantly fewer dietary carbohydrates. However, this demands careful medicine management by doctors, and patients need support and frequent contact with health providers to sustain this way of living. The purpose of this study was to evaluate if a new care model with very low dietary carbohydrate intake and continuous supervision by a health coach and doctor could safely lower HbA1c, weight and need for medicines after 1 year in adults with T2D. 262 adults with T2D volunteered to participate in this continuous care intervention (CCI) along with 87 adults with T2D receiving usual care (UC) from their doctors and diabetes education program. After 1 year, patients in the CCI, on average, lowered HbA1c from 7.6 to 6.3%, lost 12% of their body weight, and reduced diabetes medicine use. 94% of patients who were prescribed insulin reduced or stopped their insulin use, and sulfonylureas were eliminated in all patients. Participants in the UC group had no changes to HbA1c, weight or diabetes medicine use over the year. These changes in CCI participants happened safely while dyslipidemia and markers of inflammation and liver function improved. This suggests the novel care model studied here using dietary carbohydrate restriction and continuous remote care can safely support adults with T2D to lower HbA1c, weight, and medicine use."

      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "The number of people living with diabetes worldwide nearly quadrupled since 1980, estimated at 422 million in 2014  [1] . In the USA, the Centers for Disease Control reports 30.3 million adults presently live with diabetes, and it is among the leading causes of death  [2] . Treatment modalities for type 2 diabetes (T2D) have demonstrated varying success. Intensive lifestyle interventions are effective treatments for obese individuals with T2D when weight loss is achieved and sustained  [3] . Evidence for improved cardiovascular outcomes in patients with T2D prescribed glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonists (GLP-1) and sodium glucose co-transporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT-2) is increasing  [4, 5] . Forty percent of patients undergoing bariatric surgery demonstrate substantial improvements in glycemic control after 1 year and many achieve T2D remission  [6] . Despite advancements in treatment options, cost, side effects, adherence, and disease progression remain barriers.\n\nGuidelines for T2D management recommend lifestyle change and weight loss  [7, 8] . However, a fraction of individuals are successful at long-term weight loss maintenance and true disease remission is uncommon  [3, 9] . Mediterranean-style, DASH, and plant-based diets, sometimes with prescribed energy restriction, are recommended, but effectiveness data are limited  [7]  and low fat diets have not been shown to be superior for weight loss  [10] . Commercially available weight loss programs have demonstrated short-term success in glycemic control, but continued success at 1 year is uncommon  [11] .\n\nGlycemic control can be achieved quickly with carbohydrate restriction via very low energy diets (400-800 kcal day -1 ; VLCD)  [12] . However, VLCD are necessarily temporary and outcomes often revert when patients resume former dietary patterns. Alternatively, nutritional ketosis, achieved by consuming moderate protein and greatly reduced carbohydrate, results in similarly increased serum betahydroxybutyrate (BHB) concentrations as observed during VLCD, which signifies a shift to using fat as the body's primary fuel source  [12] . This nutritional therapy may help patients achieve sustainable glycemic control without prescribed energy restriction. Benefit may accrue from decreased circulating glucose and insulin  [13] , ketone signaling  [14, 15] , or eventual weight loss. Studies utilizing carbohydrate restriction observed improved glycemic control and cardiometabolic markers, but were often short-term trials of small groups, excluded subjects prescribed insulin, or infrequently monitored or achieved ketosis  [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] .\n\nThe chronic nature of diabetes care presents an additional challenge requiring sustained behavioral change that is difficult to support with traditional medical care including infrequent provider contact  [21] . Adherence to lifestyle changes may be poor in the absence of support from providers and peers. We therefore hypothesized that a comprehensive care model that supports patients to achieve sustained nutritional ketosis while eating to satiety may have robust benefits in T2D management. This intervention utilizes continuous care through intensive, digitally enabled support including telemedicine access to a medical provider (physician or nurse practitioner), health coaching, nutrition and behavior change education and individualized care plans, biometric feedback, and peer support via an online community. Thus, the purpose of this study was to assess the effectiveness and safety of a novel care model (Virta Clinic, Virta Health; San Francisco, CA, USA) for the management of T2D after 1 year. Secondary aims were (1) to determine if a difference in primary outcomes existed between participants who self-selected on-site versus web-based education delivery and (2) explore the time course of biomarker change at 70 days and 1 year into the CCI. Primary endpoints to assess effectiveness of the intervention were change in glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA 1c ), body weight, and medication prescription after 1 year. Secondary outcomes, including clinical biomarkers of associated physiological systems and adverse events, were assessed to determine safety of the intervention."

Adults diagnosed with T2D were recruited via clinical referrals, local advertisements, and word of mouth in Lafayette, Indiana, USA and surrounding region from August 2015 through March 2016. This study was approved by the Franciscan Health Lafayette Institutional Review Board. All procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 Helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. Informed consent was obtained from all individual participants included in the study."

      "text": "Participants in the CCI underwent history and physical exam followed by laboratory testing to ensure they met inclusion and exclusion criteria (Supplementary Materials A). Upon qualifying, CCI participants received biomarker tracking tools including a cellular-connected body weight scale (BT003, Body Trace; New York, NY, USA), a finger-stick blood glucose and ketone meter (Precision Xtra, Abbott; Alameda, CA, USA), and a blood pressure cuff if hypertension was diagnosed (BP742 N, Omron Healthcare, Inc.; Lake Forest, IL, USA). Access to a web-based software application (app) was provided for biomarker reporting and monitoring, education, and communication with remote care team (via telemedicine) consisting of a health coach and medical provider (physician or nurse practitioner) for advice and medication management. Social support was provided via an online peer community. Participants in the CCI retained their primary care provider (PCP) for conditions other than metabolic disease, and care coordination between the PCP and CCI provider occurred as needed. Frequency and type of biomarker tracking were individualized on the basis of care needs and recorded by participants in the app; initial participant instructions were to weigh and measure blood BHB concentration daily, and to measure blood glucose one to three times daily. The remote care team monitored this information; a medical provider made medication changes as indicated by the participant-reported biomarkers (Supplementary Materials B).\n\nParticipants were provided individualized nutrition recommendations that allowed them to achieve and sustain nutritional ketosis with a goal of 0.5-3.0 mmol L -1 blood BHB. Participants were encouraged to report daily hunger, cravings, energy, and mood on a four-point Likert scale. These ratings and BHB concentrations were utilized to adjust nutritional guidance. With the insulin resistance characteristic of T2D, patients typically require total dietary carbohydrates to be restricted to less than 30 g day -1 to achieve nutritional ketosis. Health coaches monitored blood BHB concentrations logged by participants and worked with participants individually to adjust dietary carbohydrate intake to a level that would allow them to achieve nutritional ketosis. Daily protein intake was initially targeted to a level of 1.5 g kg -1 of reference (i.e., medium-frame ''ideal'') body weight and adjusted as necessary to aid participants in achieving nutritional ketosis based on participant-logged blood BHB concentrations. Participants were coached to incorporate dietary fats to satiety. Participants were advised to consume adequate intake of omega-3 (eicosapentaenoic acid and docosahexaenoic acid) and omega-6 (linoleic acid) polyunsaturated fats  [22] , while it was recommended that the remainder of their intake from fat come from both monounsaturated and saturated sources. Other aspects of the diet were individually prescribed to ensure safety, effectiveness, and satisfaction, including consumption of 3-5 servings of non-starchy vegetables and adequate mineral and fluid intake for the ketogenic state. At onset of dietary changes, participants were advised to consume a multivitamin, 1000-2000 IU vitamin D3, and up to 1000 mg omega-3 daily. If participants exhibited signs of magnesium depletion (e.g., muscle twitches or cramps), daily supplementation (500 mg magnesium oxide or 200 mg magnesium chloride) was suggested. If participants exhibited headaches, constipation, or lightheadedness, adequate sodium and fluid intake was recommended. BHB concentrations were also utilized as a marker of adherence to nutritional ketosis. Behavior change strategies were utilized by the remote care team and tailored to the needs of each participant to help achieve glycemic control. Examples of techniques utilized include education of natural consequences, shaping knowledge, goal setting, self-monitoring, feedback, monitoring and reinforcement from health coach and medical provider, selfbelief, social support, relapse prevention, associations, and repetition.\n\nParticipants in the CCI self-selected how they would receive most of their education: (1) via on-site group education classes that met weekly for 12 weeks, bi-weekly for 12 weeks, and monthly for 6 months (n = 136; CCI-onsite) or (2) via web-based, recorded educational content viewed independently through the app (n = 126; CCI-web). Educational content was the same regardless of delivery method (Supplementary Materials C), and all other aspects of care were the same. During on-site classes, health coaches presented educational content and medical providers met with participants individually. Participants receiving web-based education could schedule visits with the CCI medical provider if desired. Apart from education delivery, both groups received remote care from health coaches."

This group was observed at baseline and 1 year as reference for typical disease treatment and progression over 1 year within the same geographical, health care, and laboratory locations. UC participants attended a separate information session and informed consent was obtained followed by laboratory testing to ensure they met all inclusion and exclusion criteria.

Missing values were estimated from 700 imputations from multivariate normal regression. The number of missing data points for each measure can be determined from the difference between all participants and completers in Tables  1  and  S1 . Across all biomarkers, 4% of baseline values and 24% of 1-year values were missing (due to dropout, incalculable values, or inability to procure timely samples) and thus imputed to conduct the intention-to-treat analysis. Two-sample t tests were used to test whether baseline differences and differences between 1-year biomarker changes were significant. Within-group changes were tested using paired t test and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) when adjusted for baseline covariates (sex, age, baseline BMI, insulin use versus non-use, and African-American race). Although tables present triglyceride and hsCRP summary statistics in clinical units, significance levels were obtained from log-transformed values to reduce skewness. For completer analysis, percent change was calculated as the mean difference (Table  2 ) divided by the mean baseline value (Table  1 ). Significant changes in medication use and the proportion of patients with HbA 1c at least 48 mmol mol -1 (C 6.5%) were tested using McNemar test with continuity correction in completers, and linear regression of the changes in the dichotomous states when missing outcome data were imputed. Standard deviations are presented within parentheses and standard errors following ''\u00b1''. Nominal significance levels (P) are presented in tables; however, a significance level of P\\0.0017 ensures simultaneous significance at P\\0.05 with Bonferroni adjustment for the 30 variables examined. Results presented are intention-to-treat analyses (all), where missing values were estimated by imputation, unless otherwise noted. Participants who withdrew or lacked biomarkers at 1 year were not included in the analyses of completers."

In the CCI, HbA 1c was significantly reduced 17%, from 60 \u00b1 1.0 mmol mol -1 (7.6 \u00b1 0.09%) at baseline to 45 \u00b1 0.8 mmol mol -1 (6.3 \u00b1 0.07%) after 1 year (nominal significance P\\1.0 9 10 -16 ; Fig.  1 ). Eighty-five percent (174/204) of CCI participants completing 1-year HbA 1c testing observed a decline greater than 2.2 mmol mol -1 ([0.2%) in the measure. When adjusted for multiple comparisons, significant within-CCI reductions were observed in fasting glucose (-22%, P\\1.0 9 10 -16 ), fasting insulin (-43%, P = 6.7 9 10 -16 ), C-peptide (-23%, P = 2.2 9 10 -16 ), HOMA-IR derived from fasting insulin excluding exogenous users (-55%, P = 3.2 9 10 -5 ), HOMA-IR derived from C-peptide (-29%, P = 1.0 9 10 -13 ), weight from clinic measurements (-12%, P\\1.0 9 10 -16 ), weight from home scales (-13%, P\\1.0 9 10 -16 , Fig.  2 ), triglycerides (-24%, P\\1.0 9 10 -16 ), high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (-39%, P\\1.0 9 10 -16 ), ALT (-30%, P = 2.4 9 10 -10 ), AST (-21%, P = 5.1 9 10 -7 ), and alkaline phosphatase (-13%, P\\1.0 9 10 -16 ). HDL-cholesterol increased 18% (P\\1.0 9 10 -16 ) and calculated LDL-cholesterol increased 10% (P = 5.1 9 10 -5 ) while apolipoprotein B (ApoB) concentration was unchanged (P = 0.37) for participants in the CCI. There were no significant differences in mean biomarker changes between CCI-web and CCI-onsite (see Table  S2  in the electronic supplementary material). In contrast to the CCI, patients enrolled in UC for 1 year showed no Bonferroni-adjusted significant change for any of the biomarkers measured (Table  2 ).\n\nFollowing 1 year of CCI, usage of all diabetes medications combined (excluding metformin) was reduced significantly (56.9 \u00b1 3.1% to 29.7 \u00b1 3.0%, P\\1.0 9 10 -16 ) through decreased prescriptions for DPP-4 (9.9-6.3%, P = 0.11), insulin (29.8-16.7%, P = 4.3 9 10 -9 ), SGLT-2 inhibitors (10.3-0.9%, P = 9 9 10 -7 ), sulfonylureas (23.7-0%, P\\1.0 9 10 -16 ), and thiazolidinediones (1.5-0.4%, P = 0.23) (Fig.  3 ). GLP-1 prescriptions were statistically unchanged (13.4% at baseline to 14.4% at 1 year, P = 0.67), and metformin decreased slightly (71.4-65.0%, P = 0.04) for CCI participants. Forty percent (31/78) of CCI participants who began the study with insulin prescriptions (average dose of 64.2 units) eliminated the medication, while the remaining 60% (47/78) of insulin users reduced daily dosage from 105.2 to 53.8 units (P\\0.0001). Patients enrolled in UC for 1 year showed no Bonferroni-adjusted significant change for prescription of medication. For the 34 UC participants that continued using insulin, the average daily dose increased from 96.0 to 111.9 units.\n\nThe proportion of participants in the total imputed CCI group with HbA 1c below 48 mmol mol -1 (\\6.5%) increased from 19.5 \u00b1 2.4% to 69.8 \u00b1 3.1%. Of those in the CCI with HbA 1c reported at 1 year, 72% (147/204) achieved HbA 1c below 48 mmol mol -1 (6.5%) and 60.3% (123/204) of participants achieved HbA 1c below 48 mmol mol -1 (\\6.5%) while taking no diabetes medication or only metformin. Of those in the CCI with HbA 1c below 48 mmol mol -1 (\\6.5%) at 1 year, 42.3% (52/123) were prescribed no diabetes medication and 57.7% (71/ 123) were prescribed metformin only. The proportion of the total imputed CCI group with fasting glucose below 6.99 mmol L -1 at 1 year increased from 34.9 \u00b1 3.3% to 58.4 \u00b1 3.9%, and the proportion with class III obesity decreased from 45.5 \u00b1 3.1% to 19.6 \u00b1 2.8%.\n\nCompared to UC, the CCI showed significant Bonferroni-adjusted (P\\0.0017) net reductions in HbA 1c (nominal significance for the twogroup comparison, P\\10 -16 ; Fig.  1 ), fasting glucose (P = 2.1 9 10 -6 ), fasting insulin excluding exogenous users (P = 4.6 9 10 -5 ), C-peptide (P = 5.3 9 10 -5 ), HOMA-IR derived from insulin excluding exogenous users (P = 6.0 9 10 -5 ) or derived from C-peptide (P = 3.0 9 10 -5 ), weight (P\\10 -16 ), triglycerides (P = 1.0 9 10 -6 ), hsCRP (P = 9.3 9 10 -7 ), ALT (P = 4.6 9 10 -5 ), and alkaline phosphatase (P = 3.1 9 10 -8 ). All of these group differences remained significant when adjusted for the baseline age, sex, insulin medication use, and body mass index (Table  2 ). The CCI decrease in diabetes medication use was significantly greater than the changes in the UC group for all diabetes medications (P\\10 -16 ) and all diabetes medications excluding metformin (P = 9.0 9 10 -9 ), including sulfonylurea (P = 3.3 9 10 -7 ) and insulin (P = 0.0002) (Fig.  3 ).\n\nThe CCI-web and CC-onsite sub-cohorts provide replication of the above results. Specifically, Table  S2  (see electronic supplementary material) shows that within-group Bonferroni significance was achieved separately for the mean 1-year reductions in HbA 1c , fasting glucose, fasting insulin, C-peptide, HOMA-IR, triglycerides, and hsCRP, and the significant increases in HDL-cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol.

      "text": "This study evaluated the effectiveness and safety of an alternative treatment model for T2D that utilized continuous remote care to provide a high level of outpatient support combined with individualized nutrition enabling longterm maintenance of behavioral and metabolic change via nutritional ketosis. This trial prospectively observed adults with T2D undergoing treatment via this novel care model and a comparison group of adults with T2D undergoing usual care treatment. Following 1 year of CCI, participants achieved a 14 mmol mol -1 (1.3 \u00b1 0.1%) decline in HbA 1c concurrent with 12% weight loss and reduction in medication use. Consistent conclusions were reached with intention-to-treat analysis and analysis of completers. A usual care group showed no change in diabetes status or related biomarkers over the year."

      "title": "Effectiveness",
      "text": "The CCI reduced HbA 1c by 14 mmol mol -1 (1.3%) at 1 year. HbA 1c reductions up to 7 mmol mol -1 (0.6%) via intensive lifestyle intervention  [25]  and 11 mmol mol -1 (1.0%) via an energy-restricted low-carbohydrate diet with partial food provision delivered via an outpatient setting  [26]  were previously reported. The present intervention achieved 12% weight loss at 1 year; previously studied interventions elicited 4-9% weight loss in patients with T2D  [25, 26] . The regular monitoring of weight, glucose, and BHB as biometric feedback Fig.  4  Beta-hydroxybutyrate concentrations of CCI completers. Note: For each individual in the graph, the BHB concentration on a given day was computed as the 3-day trailing mean (to reduce day-to-day variation). On dates where no BHB concentrations were recorded during the 3-day time window for a given participant, the most recent 3-day mean preceding the date was used. Line graph depicts mean (95% CI) over time for BHB measured at home and reported via the app. Dots and error bars represent the mean \u00b1 SE from laboratory measured BHB at baseline, 70 days, and 1 year for participant, health coach, and medical provider may have provided behavior reinforcement. Further, it seems plausible that this multicomponent care model allowed for greater improvements compared to interventions that provided a subset of components. A recent primary care-led weight management intervention utilizing a 3-5 month VLCD resulted in a 10 mmol mol -1 (0.9%) reduction in HbA 1c and 10% weight loss at 1 year; 46% of participants achieved HbA 1c below 48 mmol mol -1 (\\6.5%) while taking no medications  [27] . While only 25% of participants in the present investigation achieved this measure of diabetes remission, the protocol for the present investigation discontinued metformin prescription only because of contraindication, intolerance, or patient request given its efficacy for T2D prevention and recommended use in certain populations  [7] . An additional 35% of participants in the present investigation were able to attain HbA 1c below 48 mmol mol -1 (\\6.5%) while taking only metformin. The longer duration of T2D and baseline insulin prescription to 30% of participants might be factors influencing the proportion of participants in which glycemic control medications could be discontinued in this investigation.\n\nHbA 1c improved concurrent with medication reductions prescribed for blood glucose-lowering. For each medication class, the sum percentage of eliminations and reductions of prescriptions at 1 year exceeded that observed at 70 days  [23] . Improved glycemic control via a predominantly pharmaceutical approach has demonstrated paradoxical increased cardiovascular risk  [28] . Tight glycemic control can elicit symptomatic hypoglycemia  [29]  or weight gain  [30] , neither of which was observed in CCI. Thus, it is likely the treatment method by which glycemic control is achieved (e.g., pharmacological, surgery, lifestyle intervention) is important to health outcomes and risk.\n\nMost changes in HbA 1c , glucose, insulin, C-peptide, and HOMA-IR occurred in the first 70 days with further improvement observed at 1 year. While the mechanism for improved insulin sensitivity in ketosis is not fully understood, early improvements in HbA 1c and HOMA-IR indicate rapid restoration of liver and peripheral insulin sensitivity and are consistent with improvements observed within 2 weeks of ketosis when measured by euglycemic hyperinsulinemic clamp  [13] . Utilization of blood BHB for self-monitoring with reinforcement by clinicians may have contributed to sustained HbA 1c improvement. Further, BHB acts as a signaling molecule, reducing inflammation and oxidative stress  [14, 15] ; therefore, mild ketonemia may benefit multiple organs and systems. With appropriate dietary formulation, benefits of nutritional ketosis are observed in mouse models of longevity and health span  [31, 32] . Participant mean BHB levels are of similar magnitude to those observed with SGLT-2 inhibitor treatment (* 0.5 mmol L -1 )  [33] . Recent trials  [5, 34]  demonstrate cardiovascular benefits to two SGLT-2 inhibitors; mild ketosis was postulated as a mechanism  [33] . Nutritionally achieved ketosis may have long-term cardiovascular benefits without the pharmaceutical risk profile  [34] . Further, presence of glucose and palmitate has been associated with beta cell apoptosis  [35] . Given the reduced levels of glucose and palmitate observed during nutritional ketosis  [36] , it is plausible that ketosis might play a role in attenuating glucolipotoxicity-induced beta cell death.\n\nBeyond achieving improved glycemic control concurrent with medication and weight reductions, the CCI had broad positive impact on blood pressure, liver enzymes, hsCRP, triglycerides, and HDL-C. Elevated ALT, AST, and ALP are associated with non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis  [37] ; these enzymes were significantly reduced with intervention. Rapid reduction in triglycerides and gradual rise in HDL-C observed following CCI are consistent with previously studied carbohydrate-restricted interventions and carbohydrates are well known to increase triglycerides  [38] . Of the 108 CCI completers with elevated baseline triglycerides (C 1.69 mmol L -1 ), 54% were in normal range at 1 year. Rise in LDL-C at 1 year, occurring with significant triglyceride decrease, was expected as there is less exchange via cholesteryl ester transfer protein  [39] . However, this exchange would not affect particle number and ApoB was unchanged, suggesting an overall neutral impact on LDL lipoprotein-associated cardiovascular risk. In epidemiological studies, utilization of dietary saturated fat in place of carbohydrate was associated with beneficial impact on lipid profile, cardiovascular outcomes, and mortality despite higher LDL-C  [40, 41] . Transiently increased total and LDL cholesterol were also associated with mobilization of adipose cholesterol stores during major weight loss  [42] .\n\nConsistent with population-level studies that observed very low rates of diabetes remission  [43] , the UC group had no change in HbA 1c and other indicators of glycemic status and insulin resistance but a net increase in diabetes medication use. Laboratory tests were generally unremarkable with biomarkers not changing significantly. The same facilities and methodologies were used for both the CCI and UC participants indicating that the changes observed in CCI participants not observed in the UC participants are unlikely to be due to methodological changes in clinical or laboratory data capture.\n\nDespite independent recruitment of the CCI and UC groups, most of their baseline characteristics including HbA 1c and years since diabetes diagnosis were not significantly different. To enable a comparison between the CCI and UC groups, covariate adjustment was utilized to adjust for differences in baseline characteristics including sex, age, baseline BMI, baseline insulin use (user vs. non-user), and African-American race. With or without baseline adjustment, the change over 1 year elicited in the CC and UC groups differ in all primary outcomes-HbA 1c , medication use, and weight-and most secondary outcomes including lipid profile, inflammation, and liver function. In general, the favorable changes observed in the CCI were not observed in the UC cohort. For example, of patients who obtained HbA 1c measurements at 1 year, 60% of CCI participants achieved a HbA 1c below 48 mmol mol -1 (\\6.5%) while taking no diabetes medications or metformin only, whereas only 10% of UC participants achieved this status.\n\nOne interpretation of these results is that the differences in observed outcomes over the year are due to advantages of the CCI over usual care. This suggests a need to incorporate carbohydrate restriction and comprehensive, continuous remote care as options in current guidelines for patients with diabetes as evidence accumulates  [44] . However, alternative explanations are possible that may account for the large degree of difference observed. For instance, patients entering the CCI were recruited knowing that they were making a commitment to lifestyle change, while the UC participants were identified as recent referrals to local diabetes education programs and may not have had similar motivation or expectations of effort as the CCI participants. However, even when motivation is controlled for upon recruitment as an inclusion criterion for participation, additional factors may play a role in retention as evidenced by a recent study with randomization  [45] . Also, the CCI and UC cohorts may also have differed in baseline characteristics that were not captured such as socioeconomic status.\n\nAdditionally, the treatment intensity of the two cohorts was not equal. The UC participants had one or more meetings with a registered dietitian and were under the medical supervision of their primary care provider or endocrinologist with periodic medical visits. In contrast, the CCI participants received a comprehensive and individualized continuous remote care intervention (and in one subgroup, the addition of on-site group classes). A more intensive intervention might have delivered somewhat better results than the investigation's UC group. For instance, a recent in-person group-based intervention for weight loss in T2D adults reduced HbA 1c by 3 mmol mol -1 (0.3%) and weight by 4.0% after a year and medications were reduced in 26% of participants  [46] . Future research might compare interventions of similar intensity with different treatment strategies to begin to understand the contribution of each component of the intervention to the overall effect."

      "text": "No episodes of ketoacidosis, no hypo-or hyperglycemic events requiring assistance, and no adverse events were attributable to the CCI. With improvements or no change in liver, kidney, and thyroid function, safety of the intervention appears favorable. The absence of hypoglycemic events requiring assistance despite relatively tight glucose control may be due to the careful medical provider prescription management, especially rapid downward titration of insulin and sulfonylurea preventing hypoglycemia following dietary changes. Additionally, elevated BHB may have offered protection against hypoglycemic events, as starvation-adapted humans with elevated BHB have demonstrated full preservation of central nervous system function despite profound hypoglycemia induced by exogenous insulin  [47] ."

This study's strengths include its prospective design, large cohort, high retention, duration, replication of findings between the CCI-onsite and CCI-web groups, and the collection of multiple time points in the intervention group allowing assessment of how biomarkers changed over time. This study also included participants prescribed insulin and with long-standing T2D, which were often exclusion criteria for prior studies. The means of recruitment, outpatient setting, and lack of food provision may enhance the real-world application of this study.\n\nWeaknesses of this study include that it occurred at a single site and participants were mostly Caucasian. Socioeconomic and psychosocial status and genetics data were not collected. The study was not of sufficient size and duration to measure hard endpoints (e.g., mortality). Future trials could include a multisite randomized controlled trial with greater racial and ethnic diversity, broader age range, and greater disease severity."
