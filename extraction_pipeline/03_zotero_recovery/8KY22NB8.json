  "title": "Economic Evaluation of Blood Pressure Monitoring Techniques in Patients With Hypertension A Systematic Review",
  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE Blood pressure monitoring is critical to the timely diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. At-home self-monitoring techniques are highly effective in managing high blood pressure; however, evidence regarding the cost-effectiveness of at-home self-monitoring compared with traditional monitoring in clinical settings remains unclear. OBJECTIVE To identify and synthesize published research examining the cost-effectiveness of at-home blood pressure self-monitoring relative to monitoring in a clinical setting among patients with hypertension. EVIDENCE REVIEW A systematic literature search of 5 databases (PubMed, MEDLINE, Embase, EconLit, and CINAHL) followed by a backward citation search was conducted in September 2022. Full-text, peer-reviewed articles in English including patients with high blood pressure (systolic blood pressure \u0546130 mm Hg and diastolic blood pressure \u054680 mm Hg) at baseline were included. Data from studies comparing at-home self-monitoring with clinical-setting monitoring alternatives were extracted, and the outcomes of interest included incremental cost-effectiveness and cost-utility ratios. Non-peer-reviewed studies or studies with pregnant women and children were excluded. To ensure accuracy and reliability, 2 authors independently evaluated all articles for eligibility and extracted relevant data from the selected articles. FINDINGS Of 1607 articles identified from 5 databases, 16 studies met the inclusion criteria. Most studies were conducted in the US (6 [40%]) and in the UK (6 [40%]), and almost all studies (  14 [90%]) used a health care insurance system perspective to determine costs. Nearly half the studies used quality-adjusted life-years gained and cost per 1-mm Hg reduction in blood pressure as outcomes. Overall, at-home blood pressure monitoring (HBPM) was found to be more cost-effective than monitoring in a clinical setting, particularly over a minimum 10-year time horizon. Among studies comparing HBPM alone vs 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) or HBPM combined with additional support or team-based care, the latter were found to be more costeffective. \n CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this systematic review, at-home blood pressure selfmonitoring, particularly using automatic 24-hour continuous blood pressure measurements or combined with additional support or team-based care, demonstrated the potential to be costeffective long-term compared with care in the physical clinical setting and could thus be prioritized for patients with hypertension from a cost-effectiveness standpoint.",

      "text": "Hypertension is a significant risk factor for heart attack and stroke and a major cause of premature death.  1  Globally, nearly 1.3 billion adults have hypertension, with estimated health care expenditures reaching up to $1 trillion over a 10-year period.  2 However, only approximately 20% of patients with hypertension have their blood pressure (BP) under control.  1  While BP measurements have traditionally taken place in clinics under the supervision of health care professionals, there has been increasing interest in transitioning to more convenient methods at home that mitigate the burden placed on patients who require regular visits. Self-monitoring at home has emerged as an effective and more convenient approach in monitoring BP levels in comparison with blood pressure measurements taken at a clinic.  3 Beyond its convenience, this approach informs patients and clinicians about blood pressure changes throughout the day in real time and enables tailored treatment formulation and needed adjustments to mitigate adverse outcomes associated with high BP.  4, 5 However, self-monitoring at home, particularly when combined with additional support and resources (ie, telehealth services, counseling, or collaboration across health care professionals) can also result in added costs to patients, clinicians, hospitals, health care systems, and insurers given the required training and the time spent by clinicians and patients to frequently monitor BP and adjust treatment plans.  6, 7 ltiple studies have explored the costs, benefits, and effects of at-home self-monitoring BP techniques compared with traditional BP measurement in clinical settings.  4, 8 However, to our knowledge, there is no systematic review of the available literature documenting the costeffectiveness of at-home self-monitoring BP techniques for patients with hypertension over the past decade. In this study, we aimed to systematically gather research findings in the existing literature and to identify whether self-monitoring blood pressure at home is more cost-effective than measuring blood pressure at the clinic. By presenting evidence on the comparative effectiveness of self-monitoring programs, clinicians, stakeholders, and patients can make more informed decisions about the added value of transitioning to self-monitoring BP programs."

      "text": "Inclusion criteria were established a priori as full-text, peer-reviewed articles in English language including patients with high BP (systolic BP \u0546130 mm Hg; diastolic BP \u054680 mm Hg) at baseline without any restrictions on comorbidities. To ensure consistency in the study population, we excluded studies with pregnant women and children. All studies needed to include a comparative economic analysis between at-home BP self-monitoring (intervention) and traditional BP measurements in physical clinical settings (usual care). The intervention included patients selfmonitoring their BP at home and transmitting measurements to a health care professional via any means (eg, electronically, short message service, or mail). At-home self-monitoring could involve either periodically taking readings, such as twice each morning and evening during the first week of every month  13  or 3 times per week  14  (referred to as at-home BP monitoring [HBPM]) or utilizing 24-hour continuous BP monitoring (referred to as ambulatory BP monitoring [ABPM]), which uses a portable device to automatically measure a patient's BP at regular intervals, such as every 20 to 30 minutes over a continuous period.  15 he self-monitoring intervention could also be combined with additional behavioral interventions, such as nurse-tailored behavioral interventions  3, 16  or additional pharmacist care.  [17] [18] [19]  No restrictions were placed on the type of clinician, health care setting, or additional interventions studied. The outcome measures included incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs) and incremental cost-utility ratios (ICURs).  13, 20 These were obtained from studies conducting costeffectiveness analysis (CEA) or cost-utility analysis (CUA). CEA is a method of comparing costs with respect to a health outcome measured in nonmonetary values, such as costs added per 1-mm Hg reduction in SBP.  21 CUA is a method often used interchangeably with CEA and measures the health outcomes using quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs)."

      "text": "This systematic review examined the cost-effectiveness of HBPM in comparison with UC. Among the identified studies, approximately 60% determined at-home self-monitoring (HBPM or ABPM) to be cost-effective over usual care, particularly long term. HBPM was also found to be cost-effective when combined with additional support or within TBC compared with HBPM alone. For studies comparing HBPM alone with UC and with ABPM, ABPM was found to be the most cost-effective method.\n\nThe clinical effectiveness of at-home self-monitoring is well-documented in most of the retrieved studies, even among those that used trial time periods of 6 to 24 months and showed improvements in either BP control or reductions in mean BP levels.  [17] [18] [19] 21, 24, 29, [31] ] [32] [33] [34] 40  However, our findings suggest that at-home BP self-monitoring interventions, particularly ABPM and HBPM with additional support or TBC, exhibit superior incremental gains in the long run compared with UC but may not demonstrate well-justified costs given short-term differential outcomes over periods of 6 to 24 months. This is not surprising given the high upfront fixed costs (ie, equipment, training) to implement an at-home self-monitoring intervention and the clinical course and time required to achieve substantially improved health outcomes and to avoid adverse events related to uncontrolled BP. Combined, our findings suggest that clinicians, hospitals, health care systems, third-party payers, and other stakeholders should consider the long-term incremental benefits and improvements in patients' BP, quality of life, and reductions in adverse outcomes, which might well justify both the upfront and longer-term costs of more resource-intensive at-home self-monitoring methods over traditional usual care and at-home self-monitoring only. The documented cost-effectiveness of BP self-monitoring at-home with additional support or TBC aligns with previous studies that conducted reviews and synthesized costs and benefits of self-monitoring methods across various diseases and settings.  4, 37 -home self-monitoring, particularly ABPM, might further enable the detection of masked and white-coat hypertension. These terms refer to the detection of elevated BP in a clinical setting (known as white-coat hypertension) and low BP using HBPM or ABPM, or vice versa (known as masked hypertension).  41 It is currently estimated that 17.1 million adults in the United States have masked hypertension.  27 This is crucial because one-time or limited office measurements, despite being the traditional method, may vary considerably due to different techniques and methods used, particularly in the presence of a physician or nurse.  42 Hence, at-home self-monitoring might be more accurate and allow tailored interventions early on, which are critical to control BP and mitigate the associated risks of masked hypertension or prevent unnecessary treatment uptake due to white-coat hypertension. At-home self-monitoring also has the potential to improve patient and clinician satisfaction, particularly in terms of the convenience of recording and sharing BP measurements from home vs going to the clinic. Moreover, self-monitoring at home facilitates easier communication with the health care professional when needed, particularly if coupled with additional behavioral interventions or additional support and resources, which allow patients to receive timely advice during consultations and enable the health care team to gain a better understanding of the patient's condition.  31 This can thereby increase patient motivation to monitor BP, which would consequently improve the care provided by enabling the health care professionals to better tailor their treatment approach and ultimately enhance patient outcomes.  43 though this study was based on a systematic literature search and the findings are reported and synthesized in a robust manner, we note that the detailed comparison of many study results and their generalizability across different perspectives and settings remains challenging, particularly due to high variability and inconsistency in reported costs. Almost all the studies included in our review\n\nJAMA Network Open | Health Informatics Economic Evaluation of BP Monitoring Techniques in Patients With Hypertension JAMA Network Open. 2023;6(11):e2344372. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.44372 (Reprinted) November 21, 2023 7/11 Downloaded from jamanetwork.com by guest on 06/08/2025 did not account for indirect and intangible costs, such as productivity losses or patient out-of-pocket costs. In addition, given the limited number of studies found in this systematic review that used a societal perspective, future work is needed to conduct cost-effectiveness analyses and evaluations across the various types of BP measurement methods from the societal perspective and incorporate\n\nindirect and intangible patient-level costs. Including such costs might significantly affect the incremental cost differences across competing alternatives and thus findings and future recommendations. Along these lines, we did not find any studies comparing ABPM with HBPM with additional support or TBC-all 3 of which were found to be more cost-effective than UC and HBPM alone in separate analyses. Future studies might consider conducting cost-effectiveness analyses with such comparisons. Finally, we note that patient experiences and preferences related to the differences between various home-based care and monitoring systems vs traditional clinical based care can critically affect patients' adherence and, in turn, prevention, and timely treatment initiation and should thus also be considered when determining the WTP pay for such interventions."

In  ddition, this is the most up-to-date study that systematically gathers and synthesizes the available literature on the cost-effectiveness of at-home self-monitoring for patients with hypertension, to our knowledge.\n\nNevertheless, this study also has some limitations. First, most studies included a single stakeholder perspective and thus might not be generalizable. Second, the reported costs across the studies varied due to the types of cost data being included. The details of types of costs included were not consistently provided, making it challenging to compare findings among different studies.\n\nIn addition, most studies utilized different definitions of cost inputs, with medical and program costs defined differently. More research is needed to further evaluate the cost-effectiveness of selfmonitoring BP at home in comparison with usual care using longer time periods with costs reported in consistent and clear manner and across multiple perspectives."
