  "title": "Factors Influencing Adherence to mHealth Apps for Prevention or Management of Noncommunicable Diseases: Systematic Review",
  "abstract": "Background: Mobile health (mHealth) apps show vast potential in supporting patients and health care systems with the increasing prevalence and economic costs of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) worldwide. However, despite the availability of evidence-based mHealth apps, a substantial proportion of users do not adhere to them as intended and may consequently not receive treatment. Therefore, understanding the factors that act as barriers to or facilitators of adherence is a fundamental concern in preventing intervention dropouts and increasing the effectiveness of digital health interventions. Objective: This review aimed to help stakeholders develop more effective digital health interventions by identifying factors influencing the continued use of mHealth apps targeting NCDs. We further derived quantified adherence scores for various health domains to validate the qualitative findings and explore adherence benchmarks. \n Methods: A comprehensive systematic literature search (January 2007 to December 2020) was conducted on MEDLINE, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, and ACM Digital Library. Data on intended use, actual use, and factors influencing adherence were extracted. Intervention-related and patient-related factors with a positive or negative influence on adherence are presented separately for the health domains of NCD self-management, mental health, substance use, nutrition, physical activity, weight loss, multicomponent lifestyle interventions, mindfulness, and other NCDs. Quantified adherence measures, calculated as the ratio between the estimated intended use and actual use, were derived for each study and compared with the qualitative findings. \n Results: The literature search yielded 2862 potentially relevant articles, of which 99 (3.46%) were included as part of the inclusion criteria. A total of 4 intervention-related factors indicated positive effects on adherence across all health domains: personalization or tailoring of the content of mHealth apps to the individual needs of the user, reminders in the form of individualized push notifications, user-friendly and technically stable app design, and personal support complementary to the digital intervention. Social and gamification features were also identified as drivers of app adherence across several health domains. A wide variety of patient-related factors such as user characteristics or recruitment channels further affects adherence. The derived adherence scores of the included mHealth apps averaged 56.0% (SD 24.4%). \n Conclusions: This study contributes to the scarce scientific evidence on factors that positively or negatively influence adherence to mHealth apps and is the first to quantitatively compare adherence relative to the intended use of various health domains.

      "text": "Digital health interventions  (DHIs)  show vast potential in supporting patients and health care systems with the globally increasing prevalence and economic costs of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), which is the leading causes of death and disability worldwide  [1, 2] . More specifically, mobile health (mHealth) apps are now considered accessible and scalable solutions to promoting behavior change among patients, improving health outcomes, and reducing health care costs  [3] [4] [5] . Correspondingly, the number of available mHealth apps has continuously grown to >300.000, with approximately 200 new mHealth apps released each day  [2, 6] .\n\nHowever, despite increasing evidence and availability, mHealth apps are subject to significant dropout rates, with a substantial proportion of users not adhering to them as intended  [7, 8] . Recent research has shown that up to 80% of all participants in mHealth interventions only engage at a minimum level, do not log into the mHealth app more than once, and do not consistently use the app in the long term  [9] . Another study examining mHealth app use in more extensive real-world settings reported low retention rates, with only 3.9% of participants using mHealth apps for >15 days  [10] . The reported low adherence and high attrition levels further highlight the necessity of developing more effective models, best practices, and interventions  [8, 11] .\n\nAs nonadherence relative to intended use jeopardizes treatment success and, thus, might lead to an increased number of hospitalizations, it is considered a fundamental concern in the development of mHealth apps  [8, [12] [13] [14] [15] . However, the scientific body of literature lacks concise conceptualizations and measures for the intended use of mHealth apps, whereas intervention components and factors influencing adherence remain to be explored  [13, 16] . Following previous studies, we define adherence as \"the degree to which the user followed the program as it was designed,\" which can be paraphrased as \"adherence relative to the intended use\"  [13, 17, 18] .\n\nWith smartphone apps being the primary intervention component, adherence relative to the intended use is principally informed by user acceptance and the use of information technology  [19] . Previous research underscores the necessity of mHealth apps that must be first accepted and used in an intended way to then achieve a desired health behavior change  [3, 19] . Correspondingly, previous research has identified factors affecting the uptake of and engagement with health and well-being smartphone apps  [11, [20] [21] [22] [23] . Many of these strategies and factors, such as well-designed reminders, self-monitoring features, and embedded health professional support, have been applied across various health domains  [11, 20, 21] . Some of these factors, such as reminders, can be further applied as retention methods and strategies for cohort studies in general and may thus extend the scope of DHIs  [24, 25] .\n\nIdentifying the factors that influence adherence relative to intended use may support and extend these findings. Given previous research and their relation to technology use and acceptance, we can assume that these factors may be not only generalizable across various health behavior domains but also be applicable to DHIs using alternative information technologies. To our knowledge, no systematic review has been conducted on the factors influencing adherence to mHealth apps designed to prevent or manage NCDs. Furthermore, to the best of our knowledge, no review has previously explored the quantifying of adherence to assess qualitatively identified factors."

      "text": "Preventing intervention dropouts and thus increasing the effectiveness of mHealth apps requires an understanding of the factors that act as barriers to or facilitators of intervention adherence. This review aimed to identify factors influencing adherence relative to the intended use of mHealth apps, which may help stakeholders better plan, develop, and evaluate mHealth apps. To help readers navigate through the identified factors, we further categorized them into intervention-related factors that app developers can potentially improve upon through product changes (eg, the inclusion of certain app features) and patient-related factors that are hardly adjustable (eg, user characteristics). These factors were separated into their potential positive or negative influences on adherence.\n\nIn the absence of a universally agreed-upon approach to measuring adherence to mHealth interventions, we exploratively derived an adherence score as the ratio between the intended and actual use of each study to describe adherence quantitatively and consistently. The primary aim of the resulting adherence score was to quantitatively assess the findings from the qualitative extraction of factors influencing adherence. As the intended use varies substantially across different mHealth apps, we extracted the intended use for each included mHealth app individually. We then compared the intended use with the actual use reported in the corresponding study. To the best of our knowledge, this exploratory approach of a quantified adherence score has not been applied previously. resolved through discussions. The web-based program Covidence (Veritas Health Innovation) was used for the entire process. After applying the search strategies outlined in Multimedia Appendix 2, the resulting database reference lists were imported into the Covidence database. The following Covidence features were used in the process: duplicate removal, title and abstract screening, full-text review, and export of PRISMA flowchart."

Intervention characteristics were app name, smartphone operating system (universal, Android only, or iOS only), type of mHealth app offered (publicly available or research apps), app developer (private company or nonprofit organization), level of personal support (no personal support during the intervention or continuous personal support), external monetary incentives and their value in US dollars, intervention duration in days, and effectiveness of the intervention in terms of health outcomes.\n\nFactors influencing adherence relative to intended use were extracted and characterized as intervention-related factors (factors that developers can potentially improve through product changes) or patient-related factors (factors that can hardly be influenced by app developers, such as user characteristics). These factors were further categorized based on their positive or negative influence on adherence.\n\nInformation on app use comprised intended app use, actual app use, the number of intended intervention interactions, and interaction frequency (eg, daily or weekly intended use). The adherence score was defined as adherence relative to the intended use and was derived as the quantified ratio of intended use to actual use."

The categories were then further refined into the following health domains: NCD self-management (asthma management, diabetes management, CVD management, cancer management, and medication adherence), mental health (anxiety, depression, and multidisciplinary and others), substance use (alcohol, tobacco, and multidisciplinary and others), nutrition, physical activity, weight loss, multicomponent lifestyle interventions, and other NCDs.\n\nIn the second step, intervention-related and patient-related factors that were outlined in the studies as barriers to or facilitators of adherence were qualitatively evaluated, summarized within the health domain, and categorized based on their positive or negative influence.\n\nIn the third step, the adherence score was derived for each study focusing directly on a specific mHealth app (97/99, 98%) and was calculated as the ratio of intended use to actual use. The mean adherence scores were calculated for each health domain.\n\nIn the fourth step, correlations of adherence scores with other extracted variables were examined, and where possible, the qualitative results from step 2 were quantitatively compared for each health domain. Quantitative analyses were performed using SPSS Statistics (version 27; IBM Corp). Correlations of adherence scores with continuous variables (eg, the average age of study participants) were calculated using the Pearson correlation. Correlations with ordinal variables (eg, level of personal support) were calculated using the Spearman correlation.\n\nFinally, a list of universally relevant factors with recommendations for the development and evaluation of mHealth apps was developed."

Of the 97 reviewed apps, 47 (48%) were publicly available, whereas 52 (54%) were exclusively available to study participants. Approximately 38% (37/97) of apps were developed by private commercial companies (eg, software companies), and 64% (62/97) of apps were developed by nonprofit organizations (eg, academic institutes). Of the studies that clearly outlined their study procedure, 34% (32/93) included personal contact with health personnel during the study as an intervention component.

      "title": "Characteristics of Health Domains",
      "text": "As displayed in\n\nTable 1, the included studies evaluating specific mHealth apps were categorized into the following health domains based on the individual app intervention focus: NCD self-management (17/97, 18%); mental health (20/97, 21%); substance use (9/97, 9%); nutrition (7/97, 7%); physical activity (6/97, 6%); weight loss (9/97, 9%); multicomponent lifestyle interventions (8/97, 8%); and mindfulness, including breathing and meditation interventions (9/97, 9%). Studies categorized in the domains of NCD self-management, mental health, and substance use were further subcategorized to report intervention and patient-related factors influencing intervention adherence at a more granular level. The studies (17/97, 18%) targeting NCD self-management were subcategorized into diabetes management (6/17, 35%), cancer management (5/17, 29%), respiratory disease management (3/17, 18%), CVD management (2/17, 12%), and medication adherence (1/17, 6%). Studies categorized in the mental health domain (20/97, 21%) were further divided into apps focusing on anxiety (2/20, 10%), depression (9/20, 45%), and multidisciplinary and other (9/20, 45%). The latter subdomain included other mental health problems such as bipolar disorders or combinations of various mental health problems. Studies in the substance use domain were further separated into apps addressing alcohol (2/9, 22%), tobacco (6/9, 67%), or a mix of various substances (1/9, 11%). Another 12% (12/97) of studies, which was a heterogeneous group targeting NCDs other than diabetes, cancer, CVD, respiratory disease, or medication adherence, were clustered into other NCDs (eg, intestinal and renal disease, insomnia, pain, venous leg ulcers, and dyslipidemia). As outlined in Table 2, the mean number of participants was highest for studies that focused on substance use (2337.6, SD 6344.8; range 9-19,233) and lowest for other NCDs (54.8, SD 48.6; range 15-189), followed by weight loss interventions (73.2, SD 54.4; range 17-176).\n\nAs displayed in Table  3 , the mean participant age was highest in apps targeting NCD self-management (57.7, SD 7.3; range 45-70.9 years) and lowest for mental health apps (35.9, SD 5.9; range 19.9-46.5 years).\n\nFemale populations were generally overrepresented (Table  4 ), especially in studies conducted on mindfulness interventions (76.7%, SD 20.2%; range 44.8%-100%). Only studies conducted on apps targeting substance use featured more men than women (percentage of women: mean 49.3%, SD 14.1%; range 27.7%-78%).\n\nAs outlined in Table  5 , studies conducted on apps for weight loss had the most prolonged mean intervention duration (214, SD 216.3; range 65-730 days), and studies on nutrition had the shortest mean intervention duration (52.5, SD 55.7; range 7-172 days).\n\nTable 6 shows distributions of total intended interactions with the apps over the course of the individual studies. The mean number of total intended interactions was highest for apps targeting weight loss (210.5, SD 213.3; range 52-730) and lowest for nutrition apps (31.8, SD 27.8; range 4-82.5). The distribution of adherence scores by health domain is summarized in Table 7. The mean adherence scores were highest in the domain of other NCDs (69.9%, SD 18.5%; range 33.3%-90.5%), followed by multicomponent lifestyle interventions aimed at changing multiple behaviors simultaneously (61.3%, SD 22.5%; range 32.4%-96%). Apps from the substance use domain had the lowest adherence scores (46.1%, SD 33%; range 9.1%-84%).\n\nMultimedia Appendix 4  [20, ] lists the identified intervention-related and patient-related factors with a positive or negative influence on adherence for each health domain in detail.

The term user-friendliness describes a software interface that enables a simple, clean, intuitive, and reliable user experience (UX). App developers can thus promote adherence by making the app easy to use and providing a compelling and visually appealing app design (eg, by using sufficiently large fonts or highlighting essential app elements)  [53] . Technical problems can be reduced through closed beta tests while optimizing the UX through user interface or UX design changes before app release. Accordingly, the quantitative analysis revealed higher adherence scores for apps created by private app development companies, which may have more technical expertise in developing and publishing apps than public institutions or research groups. Quantitative analysis also revealed higher adherence scores for apps developed by private companies, which may have more expertise across the value chain than public institutions or research groups. As most of the included mHealth apps had a pilot character (ie, developed by small academic teams with no or only short testing periods), it can be assumed that the current body of mHealth apps does not yet realize its full potential in terms of usability and technical stability, thus indicating the potential to improve adherence."

      "text": "In 13% (13/97) of studies across 8 different health domains, reminders, primarily realized through push notifications, were highlighted as an effective method of improving adherence to mHealth app interventions  [31, 39, 40, 62, 63, 69, 73, 79, 83, 88, [92] [93] [94] 113] . Essential to the success of this technique is the consideration of users' individual needs in terms of their schedule, as a user's lack of time undermines adherence  [38] [39] [40] 53, 58, 118] . Ideally, users receive reminders when they are in a state of receptivity, which has also been suggested by previous research on just-in-time-adaptive interventions  [126, 127] . In this regard, working and leisure time schedules should be considered, and the timing of reminders should be adapted accordingly, particularly when patients are in the privacy and comfort of their homes. A recent review reported that reminders are helpful for people with busy schedules and when they are forgetful but also mentioned the risk that push notifications can threaten users' social identity if they are received at an inappropriate time or place  [20] . Therefore, users should be able to customize the reminders and adapt them to their circumstances."

      "text": "In 12% (12/97) of studies from 8 different health domains, personal support from a health care professional during the intervention was cited as a reason for improved adherence  [28, 35, 37, 57, 69, 82, 84, 91, 95, 98, 117, 123] . In this context, the integration of health care professionals past the initial app onboarding can be realized in various ways, including regular clinic visits, complementary telephone support, and communication options with health care professionals integrated into the app. In addition, apps can facilitate communication between patients and health care professionals through automated data exchanges. Quantitative analysis revealed a positive correlation between adherence and level of personal support during the study period for all health domains, which was also confirmed by previous studies  [20, 128] . Consequently, it can be assumed that hybrid systems that combine automated app content with elements of human support achieve higher adherence rates than those achieved by interventions without human support. Although the ideal ratio between human-computer interactions and sole human interactions in mHealth app interventions remains to be explored, new technologies such as conversational agents show promising results in simulating personal support without the need for human support and may enable increased levels of automation  [129] [130] [131] [132] ."

      "text": "Elements of gamification were described as effective in increasing adherence in 12% (12/97) of studies across 6 different health domains  [32, 36, 47, 49, 52, 64, 73, [78] [79] [80] 83, 97, 98] . These elements included levels, reward systems, social characters, contests, and leaderboards. This aligns with other reviews that list rewards and games as factors that positively affect adherence  [20, 125] . However, although game elements such as social competitions may increase engagement by encouraging others, the idea of defeating peers may also have a negative influence  [20] . In 6% (6/97) of studies from 5 health domains, social features were found to positively affect adherence; for example, in the form of social networks, contests, leaderboards, or newsfeeds with social components  [52, 73, 75, 83, 88, 97] . However, social components should be included with caution and ideally tested, as social comparison with less-motivated participants can also harm adherence  [97] . Accordingly, a recent review concluded that social contests increase engagement but may also have a negative effect  [20] . In general, this study supports previous research outlining the positive effects of gamification and social features on DHIs  [133] [134] [135] [136] [137] [138] [139] [140] [141] ."

Thus, developers can increase adherence by automating repetitive tasks to reduce user burden. In this regard, developers are advised to use smartphone sensor technology (eg, a camera to capture food data or accelerometer data to capture physical activity) and complementary devices (eg, a smartwatch to measure heart rate) to remove the repetition and monotony of intervention tasks, which are listed as reasons for nonadherence  [58, 60, 70] ."

However, the qualitative synthesis did not yield results regarding the effect of such monetary incentives as an additional intervention component on adherence. The quantitative comparison between studies with monetary incentives and those without such incentives also found no effect on adherence. However, the monetary value of the incentive, measured in US dollars, had a significantly positive effect on adherence scores. In the context of these findings, app developers may consider whether monetary incentives are helpful and the level of compensation that is sufficient to achieve a relevant effect."

Approximately 3% (3/97) of studies also noted financial costs (eg, data plan use) as a barrier to adherence  [20, 89, 92] . Therefore, developers may want to consider offering their mHealth app free of charge and only transferring large amounts of data when the device is connected to a wireless network. Other studies in this review also reported that time delays within the intervention, long intervention durations, low engagement of other participants, and competitive effects of other mHealth apps were associated with low adherence. The included studies also outlined data protection and user privacy as positively affecting adherence  [20, 47, 57, 82] , which aligns with previous research calling developers to create robust and transparent mHealth apps that satisfy security and privacy demands to foster user acceptance and trust  [142] [143] [144] [145] ."

      "text": "Approximately 43% (42/97) of studies from 9 different health domains reported a wide variety of user characteristics that affect adherence, including age, gender, place of residence, marital status, health status, treatment history, education, employment status, income, and work hours  [26-28,33-38,40,47-50,54,56,58,60,64,66,67,73-75,77-79, 85,86,88,89,95,98,100,102,106,108,114,115,118,119,122] . The quantitative analysis did not reveal significant effects of average age, gender distribution, or pre-existing conditions on adherence across all included apps. Consequently, the results from previous reviews, which indicate higher engagement among female or younger users, could not be replicated  [20, 125] . The specific health domains of NCD self-management and other NCDs showed a significant correlation between adherence scores and the average age of study participants, with the first one being positive and the latter being negative. Further research is required to understand the effects of sociodemographic characteristics and health status on adherence to mHealth apps. The findings of this study suggest that these effects may vary depending on the targeted health domain.\n\nUser characteristics associated with a low adherence were lack of technical competence, lack of health literacy, and lack of experience with mHealth apps, which could potentially be improved through preintervention training. Other negative factors, such as privacy concerns, low expectations of the app, and low trust in the health care professionals conducting the intervention, could potentially be challenged through personal communication in the onboarding phase (eg, by discussing the privacy policy or outlining intervention benefits). As lack of time on the users' side was referenced to negatively affect adherence  [53, 58, 107, 118] , helping patients with time management might also have a positive effect."

Users who were made aware of the intervention on the web (eg, via social media) had lower adherence than users recruited locally and in person. This could explain why apps that were only offered in the context of studies on personal onboarding processes had significantly higher adherence scores than those publicly accessible via app stores. As the mHealth sector further matures and more mHealth apps are made available to the public via app stores, this factor might have an increasingly negative effect on overall adherence. Developers may overcome this issue by optimizing the UX of their mHealth app in the onboarding phase. As highlighted previously, offering personal support from health care professionals before and during the onboarding process is likely to increase adherence."

      "title": "Adherence Scores Across Health Domains",
      "text": "Regarding the third research question, this review outlined the differences between health domains in terms of adherence scores. The adherence score of all 97 included mHealth apps averaged 56.0% (SD 24.4%), representing a generally higher adherence level to mHealth apps than previous research suggests  [9, 10, 146] . This could be attributed to the fact that some studies excluded participants who did not perform a certain level of activity (eg, downloading the app). Regarding the short intervention periods with a median of 60.8 days, it is questionable whether the included health apps could reach similar adherence scores in more prolonged studies. Adherence scores by health domain were highest for the other NCDs (69.9%, SD 18.5%), a heterogeneous group of mHealth apps targeting less common NCDs such as intestinal and renal disease, insomnia, pain, venous leg ulcers, and dyslipidemia. Multicomponent lifestyle interventions aimed at changing multiple behaviors simultaneously (61.3%, SD 22.5%) had the second-highest adherence scores, whereas apps targeting substance use had the lowest (46.1%, SD 46.1%). The relatively low adherence levels of mHealth apps treating substance use could be explained by the nature of their intervention design, making it difficult to differentiate between nonadherent users and users who stopped using the app after a successful behavior change. Another explanation could be that substance use disorders are comorbid with depressive disorders. Several qualitative findings indicate that symptoms or a diagnosis of depression negatively affect adherence  [27, 48, 50, 78, 89] . This also aligns with our findings that apps offering depression support had an even lower average adherence score of 45.3% (SD 28.1%).\n\nAnother explanation and potential bias for the difference in adherence scores are asymmetric distributions of trials compared with real-world applications within health domains, represented by the mean number of participants (substance use 2337.6, SD 6344.8; multicomponent lifestyle interventions 284.3, SD 531.9; and other NCDs 54.8, SD 48.6). In general, studies with a higher number of participants had significantly lower adherence scores (r=-0.228; 96/97, 99%; P=.03). Furthermore, apps that were only offered in the context of scientific studies had a significantly higher adherence score than those publicly available via app stores (r s95 =0.324; P=.001). Surprisingly, these differences could not be explained by longer study duration (r=-0.138; 97/97, 100%; P=.18) or the number of intended app interactions (r=0.040; 97/97, 100%; P=.70). Thus, our study supports and provides quantitative evidence for previous findings outlining engagement within trials to significantly differ from real-world applications [147-149]. Further real-world longitudinal studies are necessary to explain these differences.\n\nAlthough calculating an adherence score as the ratio between intended and actual use has several limitations, this exploratory approach enabled the quantification and comparison of adherence across different mHealth apps to a reasonable extent. The quantitative analysis of adherence scores yielded few significant results but fit qualitative findings regarding positive or negative influences on adherence in most instances, which supports the potential validity of the concept.\n\nThe results of explorative analysis based on adherence scores should be considered cautiously. Although we did not find a significant correlation between study duration or the number of intended app interactions and the adherence score, it is possible that other factors, such as patient characteristics, could influence adherence. Further research is needed to establish effective adherence measures. By reporting this novel quantified measure of adherence for individual studies and collectively for defined health domains, we hope researchers will test and challenge our approach, potentially developing more effective measures that help us quantify adherence and make it comparable across heterogeneous groups of mHealth apps."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "This study had several limitations. The first limitation is the heterogeneity of the included studies. The studies differ in terms of the characteristics of the target populations (eg, type of pre-existing condition, age, gender, education level, comorbidities, employment status, and experience with mobile technologies) and study duration (a few weeks to over a year). In addition, mHealth apps within the studies and their intended use varied significantly. The problem of the undiversified reach of mHealth interventions, predominantly including female and White participants living in high-income countries [150], also accounts for this study. Approximately 90% (87/97) of these studies were conducted in North America, Australia, or Europe. Similarly, women were overrepresented, with an average proportion of 62% (SD 22.8%). Most included studies had a pilot character, with 80% (77/96) of the studies including <200 participants and 73% (71/97) of the studies having a duration of <100 days. Whether individual study results can be replicated in more controlled and longitudinal studies in the future is questionable. In addition, there were differences in terms of additional monetary incentives and the level of personal support complementary to the use of mHealth interventions. Moreover, the mHealth apps investigated in the studies showed substantial heterogeneity in their goals (eg, increasing physical activity and reducing tobacco consumption). Overall, this limited the generalizability of our results. This limitation was overcome by categorizing the results into different health domains. However, mHealth apps also exhibited key differentiating characteristics within their health domain, such as their stage of development (prototype vs established app), developer (nonprofit vs private company), the use of peripheral devices (eg, a smartwatch for passive data collection), app features (eg, social features such as leaderboards and elements of gamification), or the level of quality (eg, in terms of the user interface, UX, or technical stability). Another limitation is that few studies considered individual intervention components separately and evaluated their effectiveness, which complicates the identification of intervention-related factors. A further limitation of this study is the inclusion of nonrandomized studies, which, on the one hand, allowed a more extensive consideration of objective app use data but, by contrast, precluded conducting a risk of bias assessment.\n\nThe calculation of adherence scores as the ratio between intended and actual use also implies some noteworthy drawbacks. The intended use of the mHealth app, which was derived from the study design or study author comments, was also heterogeneous and differed depending on the mHealth app design (eg, tracking daily symptoms or completing a certain number of coaching sessions), interaction frequency (eg, daily or weekly), and interaction duration (weeks to years). Furthermore, the intended use was rarely justified by applying theory, evidence, or rationale, which has also been addressed in previous studies  [13] . In some instances, the intended use could be derived from the intervention design; however, many studies had to be excluded as the app's intended use was unclear or not stated at all. However, it can be positively highlighted that the actual mHealth app use extracted for the adherence score was based on objective app use data in approximately 96% (92/96) of cases."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "This study contributes to the scarce scientific evidence on factors influencing adherence to mHealth apps and is the first to derive quantified adherence scores for various health domains to validate qualitative findings and explore adherence benchmarks. This paper contains various detailed presentations of the central results. The most detailed presentation of adherence factors extracted from individual studies is outlined in Multimedia Appendix 4. We further classify the factors within the defined health domains and report the results collectively. Finally, we discuss the most common factors influencing adherence across all the health domains. As mHealth apps within health domains remain heterogeneous, we encourage readers to always consider information from the corresponding individual studies outlined in Multimedia Appendix 4 when implementing their interventions according to the factors reported in this review.\n\nOur findings indicate that the following intervention-related factors positively influence mHealth app adherence: user-friendly and technically stable app design, customizable push notifications, personalized app content, passive data tracking, an integrated app tutorial, offering the app free of charge, and the integration of personal support into the mHealth app. Furthermore, gamification and social features show promising effects but may be limited to specific health domains. Time delays within the intervention, long intervention durations, low engagement of other participants, and the competitive effects of other mHealth apps were associated with low mHealth app adherence.\n\nRegarding patient-related factors, the following user characteristics were associated with low mHealth app adherence: lack of technical competence, low health literacy, low self-efficacy, low education level, mental health burden, lack of experience with mHealth apps, privacy concerns, low expectations of the app, low trust in health care professionals conducting the intervention, and lack of time on the users' side. Age, gender, and pre-existing condition were frequently mentioned factors but differed across and sometimes conflicted within the health domains. Furthermore, personal user recruitment appeared to positively influence adherence as opposed to web-based user recruitment.\n\nThe adherence score of the 97 included mHealth apps averaged 56.0% (SD 24.4%). Adherence scores were highest for mHealth apps targeting less common NCDs such as intestinal and renal disease, insomnia, pain, venous leg ulcers, and dyslipidemia. Multicomponent lifestyle interventions had the second-highest adherence scores, whereas apps targeting substance use had the lowest. Exploratory analysis of adherence scores revealed quantitative evidence for higher adherence rates within trials than in real-world applications.\n\nOverall, research on the factors that positively or negatively influence adherence to mHealth apps is still limited. The underlying studies often had a pilot character with a short study duration, and the implementation of techniques was inconsistent. As most mHealth apps contain multiple intervention components, causal statements about individual factors are not possible and require more controlled and longitudinal studies in the future. To facilitate future research on mHealth app adherence; researchers should clearly outline and justify the app's intended use, report objective data on actual use relative to the intended use; and ideally, provide long-term use and retention data. Further research is needed to establish effective adherence measures."
