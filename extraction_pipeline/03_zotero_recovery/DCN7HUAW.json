  "title": "Community-based participatory research (CBPR) approaches in vaccination promotion: a scoping review",
  "abstract": "Background Community-based participatory research (CBPR) is a collaborative research approach that engages academic researchers and community stakeholders as equal partners in all research steps to address community concerns and achieve health equity. The CBPR approach has been widely used in vaccination promotion programmes. However, the elements and steps of CBPR-based programmes varied among studies. The purpose of this scoping review was to synthesize the elements and steps, and establish an implementation framework to guide the utilisation of CBPR approaches in vaccination promotion. Methods This scoping review was performed in accordance with Arksey and O'Malley's five-stage framework. A systematic search was conducted on a set of electronic databases and grey literature sources. The retrieved articles were screened according to the criteria of CBPR and vaccination promotion, and data were extracted and recorded on a calibrated and predefined form in terms of study characteristics and CBPR components. Two authors worked independently to complete literature search, study selection, and data extraction. A narrative summary was used in categorising characteristics, and the contents of the included studies were summarised through qualitative analysis. Results A total of 8557 publications were initially screened, and 23 articles were finally included. According to the CBPR conceptual model, the elements in each CBPR component specifically for vaccination promotion included (1) the establishment of community-academic partnership (CAP)s, (2) community capacity building by partner training vaccination knowledge, research literacy, and service abilities and skills, (3) development and implementation of community-based intervention and (4) Outcome evaluation. A CAP was established between academic researchers or institutes and eight types of partners, including community service organisation-related non-government organisations (NGOs), health service institution-related NGOs, religious organisations, government agencies, educational institutions, media agencies, business agencies, and community representatives. The maintenance of CAP was achieved with four key strategies, namely, strengthening communication, forming management groups, sharing resources and information, and providing incentives. Twelve studies provided comprehensive insights into",

      "text": "The mass distribution of vaccines is one of the greatest public health achievements in history and has reduced morbidity, disability and mortality due to various infectious diseases worldwide  [1] . The routine childhood immunisation schedule of the 2009 birth cohort in the United States has prevented approximately 42,000 early deaths and 20 million diseases, saving $13.5 billion in direct cost and $68.8 billion in total cost  [2] . The Global Vaccine Action Plan 2011-2020 (GVAP) set forth various vaccination targets, such as poliomyelitis, measles, diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis, and has proposed a coherent global framework for immunisation  [3] . Building upon the GVAP and unmet vaccination targets, the Immunization Agenda 2030 (IA 2030) called for equitable access to routine vaccines, aiming to ensure that all people benefit from recommended immunisations throughout the life course  [4] . However, the immunisation coverage of many vaccines has not reach the expected level. For example, a systematic analysis examined the coverage of routine childhood vaccination in 204 countries from 1980 to 2019 and demonstrated that global vaccine coverage broadly plateaued over the past decade, with only 11 countries reaching the 90% coverage target for all vaccines in 2019  [5] . Moreover, a pooled analysis quantified the worldwide cumulative coverage of human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccination, indicating that the full course of HPV vaccine in low-income or lowermiddle-income countries had a total population coverage of 1.4%, which was far below the threshold of 70% HPV vaccination coverage in developed countries  [6] . With the end of the GVAP era and the start of the IA 2030 plan, the COVID-19 pandemic presented further challenges to routine immunisation throughout the world in 2020. Academic wisdom and practical experience converges to reach GVAP targets and IA 2030 ambitions, and participatory research emerges as the most accepted and recognised response  [7] .\n\nParticipatory research serves as an umbrella term that covers a variety of interrelated research methods, such as community-academic partnership (CAP), participatory action research, community-engaged research and community-based participatory research (CBPR)  [8, 9] . CBPR originated from public health research in the 1990s and has become the gold standard for participatory research. CBPR not only recognises the inherent complexity of health disparities and the importance of incorporating diverse perspectives, but it also utilises tools and methodologies from various disciplines to comprehensively understand and analyse the multifaceted forces that contribute to these disparities  [10] . This methodology fosters dialogue and joint decision-making among various stakeholders within the community, aiming to ensure equitable allocation of resources, service provision, and health policy development. Previous studies indicated that utilizing CBPR as a collaborative process helped individuals understand the significant system-level changes necessary to address disparities and inequities, and it has been established within health inequity research  [11, 12] . It differs from other participatory research methods and is a collaborative approach that equalises power relationship between academic researchers and community stakeholders, which is an orientation to research that involve community in several phages of research process, such as issue identification, data collection, outcome evaluation, and result dissemination  [13] . The role of each partner is defined at the start of a research project  [14] . CBPR is characterised by the highest level of community participation on the continuum developed by the National Center for Research Resources at the National Institutes of Health, progressing from outreach to involvement and empowerment  [15] . Notably, CBPR is a communitydriven research paradigm that fits well with community needs to improve health and reduce disparity  [16] . A conceptual CBPR model based on extensive literature reviews, CBPR practitioner surveys, and CBPR expert consultations was developed with four major domains: context, partnership dynamics, research, intervention and outcome  [17] . This conceptual model has been utilised in CBPR programmes, but its application within the realm of vaccination promotion requires further enhancement.\n\nCBPR takes predominance in global immunisation strategies, showing potential capacity to boost vaccination equity. One proposed strategy to mitigate disparity associated with vaccines is to prioritize vaccination coverage. Previous studies have achieved preliminary progress in addressing substantial disparities in vaccinepreventable diseases by increasing vaccination rates in different populations. For instance, a study reported that immigrants/migrants such as refugees, asylum seekers, and individuals without legal documentation expressed increased motivation to receive COVID-19 vaccine after a CBPR-based intervention  [18] . A preliminary study showed that CBPR intervention increased HPV vaccination rate to 92.9% in 323 Peruvian female adolescents  [19] . Another large-scale study in Pakistan demonstrated that CBPR intervention achieved a good vaccination rate (74%) for two typhoid fever vaccines administered to 21,059 children aged 2-16 years  [20] . However, owing to the lack of unified theoretical guidance of CBPR approach in vaccination promotion, substantial discrepancy in practical application has emerged among various CBPR programmes. A uniform framework is required to standardise the application of CBPR approaches in boosting vaccination. Therefore, this scoping review was performed to summarise the elements and steps of CBPR approaches and to formulate an implementation framework that can guide the utilisation of CBPR approaches in vaccination promotion."

Firstly, an initial search was conducted in PubMed to find articles related to the topic, and the keywords CBPR and vaccination were identified in the title, abstract and index of papers. Then, using the identified search terms, consisting of Medical Subject Headings terms and keywords on concepts of CBPR and vaccination, the formal search was conducted in the indexed databases including PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. The search strategy was modified based on the specification of each database (Supplementary Material Table  S2 ).\n\nGoogle and Google Scholar were searched for grey literature. The reference lists of the retrieved publications were manually searched for additional relevant literature. The systematic and grey literature search incorporated publication dates from database inception to January 2024.

The PICOS strategy, consisting of population, interventions, comparisons, outcomes and study design, was used in searching the literature.\n\nPopulation (P): The study population covered all age groups which spanned from children to adults. Intervention (I): The eligible intervention was the CBPR approach. The operational definition of CBPR in the study selection process involved the active engagement of community stakeholders as the partners of researchers  [25] . Community and academic partners collaborated at a minimum of two phases of the research process, including subject recruitment, intervention development, intervention delivery, data collection, results interpretation, and dissemination. For example, community partners had influence in the selection of research topics, research decision-making, data collection or research results interpretation and dissemination  [23, 24] . Comparison (C): Eligible comparison included blank control, active control or any other interventions without community participation in the control group intervention. No predefined limitations were imposed on the pre-post design.\n\nOutcome (O): The primary outcome was the vaccination rate for any recommended vaccine for children, adolescents and adults. Study design (S): The original study with an experimental design in terms of randomised controlled trials (RCT), cluster RCT, non-RCT and prepost design was eligible. Qualitative studies, case reports, conference presentations, study protocols, editorials, commentaries, perspectives, letters, and abstracts were excluded.\n\nTwo authors independently assessed the studies for inclusion and exclusion through a sequential process involving title, abstract, and full-text screening. Any disagreements were discussed until a consensus was reached."

As the studies included in our scoping review did not provide sufficient information about the context of vaccination promotion programmes, this scoping review only focused on the other three domains to summarise the application of CBPR approaches. The key results were reported in four aspects: establishing CAP, building community capacity, developing and implementing community-based interventions and evaluating outcomes. An adaptive CBPR-based implementation framework for vaccination promotion was generated according to the three domains in the CBPR conceptual model and four elements in CBPR programmes."

Media agency was the least frequently encountered type of community partner (n = 1), followed by business agency (n = 2) and educational institution (n = 3). These studies involved different numbers of community partners, 69.6% of the studies (16/23) involved two types  [19, 20, 29, 32, 36, 41, 44, 45]  or three types of community partners  [28, 30, 35, 38, 40, 42, 43, 46] , and four studies involved four types of community partners  [31, 33, 37, 39] . One study included six types of community partners  [27] , whereas another study included five types  [34] , and one study solely focused on one type of community partner  [26] .\n\nTable  1  demonstrates the involvement of community partners in six distinct research phases, including subject recruitment, intervention development, intervention delivery, data collection, results interpretation, and findings dissemination. The phases of participation for community partners varied, and most community partners engaged in intervention delivery (n = 22), intervention development (n = 15), subject recruitment (n = 14), and data collection (n = 13). Few community partners engaged in finding dissemination (n = 5) and result interpretation (n = 2).

These studies used four strategies to maintain CAPs by strengthening communication, forming management groups, sharing resources or information, and providing incentives.\n\nMore than two-thirds of these studies (69.6%, 16/23) maintained the established CAPs by strengthening communication through meetings, dialogues, interviews, and community events between academic researchers and community partners during research processes [20, 27-29, 31, 33-35, 37-42, 44, 46]. More than a third of studies (39.1%, 9/23) maintained the established CAPs by forming management groups, such as steering committees, advisory boards, and subcommittees [27, 31, 33, 34, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46]. Nearly half of these studies (47.8%, 11/23) maintained the established CAPs by sharing resources or information between academic researchers and community partners [19, 27, 28, 31, 33, 34, 38-40, 42, 46]. Only one study maintained the established CAPs by providing incentives in the form of reimbursement of transportation costs to community partners [34]. CBPR component: community capacity building by community partner training Community capacity encompasses research literacy and vaccination service-related ability. Research literacy refers to community partners' understanding of research stages and ability to collaborate with researchers effectively throughout the whole research process. Vaccination service-related ability includes knowledge of vaccines and immunisation, effective communication skills and self-efficacy in engaging with a target population. The community capacity building can be achieved by training community partners, and creating opportunities for academic researchers and community partners to express opinions, exchange ideas and share resources. The followings were the contents of training and delivery method, including the individuals responsible for training tasks, training sites, duration and frequency of the partner training sessions, and diverse training methods. Contents of community partner training Most of the included studies (82.6%, 19/23) conducted training for community partners [19, 20, 26-29, 32, 33, 35, 37-46], over half of the studies (56.5%, 13/23) provided detailed training contents [19, 20, 27-29, 32, 38-42, 44, 45], three studies demonstrated prepared training materials based on previous research experience or surveys  [26, 35]  and tools  [40]  and only one study used training materials verified by experienced community health officers  [40] . Table  2  summarises the contents of the training materials for community partners. The contents contained four aspects: relevant knowledge of vaccination  [19, 20, 26-29, 32, 35, 39-41, 44] , and research project introduction  [19, 20, 28, 29, 32, 38, 40, 42, 44]  were the two most common aspects, followed by research literacy and skills  [19, 20, 26, 29, 39, 40, 42]  and service capacities and skills  [29, 35, [39] [40] [41] 44] .\n\nFig.  2  The CAP of CBPR approach for vaccination promotion. CAP was established between academic researchers/institutes and community partners. The eight types of community partners were community leaders/representatives and collaborative organizations, including community service organisation-related NGOs, health service institution-related NGOs, religious organisation, government agency, business agencies, education institutions, and media agencies. Four kinds of strategies could be used to maintain CAPs, which included strengthening communication, forming management groups, sharing resources or information, and providing incentives"

Most studies (n = 22) confirmed the positive effects of community-based interventions on increasing vaccination rates, and the highest observed vaccination rate for HPV reached 92.9%  [19] . However, two studies did not find promising results. One study indicated that the community-based intervention did not lead to considerably different vaccination rates within the intervention group (51.8%) compared with the control group (54.7%)  [40] . The other study showed similar results regarding improvements in the vaccine uptake of three-dose HPV (12.4% vs. 18.0%)  [44] . Nearly half of these studies (n = 11) exhibited moderate increase in vaccine rate, which indicated at least 30% increase in vaccine rate after intervention  [19, 20, 26-30, 33, 38, 42, 45] .

      "text": "CBPR has emerged in the last century as an actionoriented research paradigm to develop and implement community-based interventions, which can redress power imbalance, facilitate mutual benefits, and promote knowledge translations for all stakeholders  [47, 49, 50] . Community participation ensures the credibility of a research project and enhances its usefulness by aligning it with what the community perceives as important social and health goals. This approach is characterised by equitable collaboration between academic researchers and community stakeholders in the whole research process and focuses on translating research findings into practical application within the community and is widely used for community health equity and improvement  [51, 52] . Despite the potential of CBPR-based efforts to address immunisation gaps, their consistent replication and widespread success have yet to be demonstrated, as prevailed by the persistent disparities in immunisation uptake. This may be related to the discrepant and inconclusive core elements and practical steps of CBPR in the field of vaccination promotion  [50] . Therefore, this scoping review was performed to summarise the components of CBPR approaches from the aspects of CAP establishment, community capacity building, intervention development and implementation, and outcome evaluation and to generate a framework to guide the utilisation of CBPR approaches in the process of vaccination promotion."

      "title": "Establishment of CAPs",
      "text": "As the critical component of CBPR, a CAP is characterised by equitable control, relevance to the community of interest, specific aims, and the active involvement of community members and academic researchers  [53] . The establishment of CAP converged to deliver interventions and facilitate the translation of information into practice  [54] , varied in organisational structures and power allocation  [55] . Except the five studies with pre-existing CAP networks, the studies prioritised the establishment of CAPs as the initial step in their CBPR programmes.\n\nThe findings indicated that academic researchers were found to be the most common initiators in the establishment of CAPs, consistent with the findings of previous studies  [53, 56] . The role of academic researchers as primary initiators can be attributed to the community partners' limited awareness of health-related questions and their mistrust of academic research  [57] . The establishment of a CAP is time-consuming and resource intensive, whereas trust is foundational to the sustainability of a CAP  [58] . Further efforts are warranted to build trust in the establishment of a partnership. The included studies utilised the same methods for establishing CAPs as those used in previous studies. These methods involved meetings, conversations, advocacy visits and active invitations  [59, 60] . The meetings, conversations and advocacy visits could help identify key issues and community needs to ensure buy-in from essential stakeholders and constituencies  [19, 27] . Moreover, inviting active support from higher-level organisations greatly facilitated the establishment of the CAPs  [61] . Thus, identifying influential groups or prominent individuals who can increase the likelihood of collaboration with targeted partners is promising method for future research on CAPs. CAP enabled a collaborative partnership among diverse stakeholders, which followed the principles of equal participation in CBPR approach and recognised the strengths of stakeholders in community  [62] . However, previous studies rarely reported characteristics, such as membership numbers or duration of CAP  [53] . By contrast, the findings of this scoping review have provided additional insights into these aspects. The collaborative partnership consisted of a diverse group of members, which included community service organisation-related NGOs, health service institution-related NGO, religious organisation, government agency, business agency, education institution, and media agency. The types of partners and the research phases of participation varied with the unique context of each community and fluctuated across the phases of the research project. This variation in the composition of the CAP networks highlights the importance of tailoring an approach for network construction based on the specific needs and context of a community being served  [63] .\n\nThe types of community partners and their participation in various research phases were similar to those of previous literature  [56, 64] . Community partners were more frequently involved in intervention development and delivery, participant recruitment, and data collection, while researchers were involved in traditional research activities. This division of tasks likely reflected a logical distribution of roles based on respective areas of expertise  [55] . In other words, the background features of community partners influenced their involvement throughout the research process. Community partners with community knowledge and expertise actively contributed to the intervention development and implementation. However, their limited academic literacy and research leadership skills restricted their participation in data collection and results interpretation. Future studies can undertake multiple initiatives to train community partners with regard to research literacy. These initiatives may facilitate community partners to be engaged equitably throughout the research process.\n\nFour strategies can be implemented to reinforce the partnership dynamics in the established CAP, which involved strengthening communication, forming management groups, sharing resources or information, and providing incentives. A successful CBPR partnership could be strengthened by the effective communication through regular group meetings  [42] . Previous study also demonstrated that meetings, dialogues, interviews, and community events were common strategies and can effectively facilitate the maintenance of CAPs  [56] . Other studies inversely validated the importance of communication in CAP, which demonstrated that inadequate communication was a common impediment to CAP establishment  [65, 66] . Forming management groups, such as steering committee that included both community and research representatives, could enhance coordination, clarify roles and responsibilities, and facilitate consensus building in the planning stage or the intervention process  [33, 46] . Financial incentives were the least frequently utilised strategy (n = 5) among the included studies. The lack of financial incentives was a common hindering factor to the construction of CAP, as verified in a systematic review  [53] . Therefore, future studies need to clarify communication channels and ensure financial incentives to mobilise stakeholders joining CAPs."

      "text": "CBPR relies on iterative processes to generate and build knowledge and is an ongoing co-learning effort, in which researchers and community partners work collaboratively to build capacity to address health issues  [67] . Community partner training is a major avenue of community capacity building, providing necessary knowledge and skills for effectively implementing and sustaining CBPR projects. Community partners equipped with community expertise and academic skills are equitably and deeply engaged in the research process, which promotes collaboration between researchers and community partners and bridges the connection between research and community practice  [68] . Among the included studies, only three studies developed the training materials based on previous investigations. For instance, one study developed training contents based on a prior survey of community members' vaccine attitudes and preferences  [35] . One study designed the training by the research team, validated the contents with experienced community health officers, and conducted a pilot testing to ensure the effectiveness of the training  [40] . The limited number of studies developing training based on evidence deviated from the iterative development or the theoretical modelbased design approach employed in previous studies for creating the contents of training programmes  [69, 70] . The integration of validated scientific evidence into training contents likely enhanced their acceptability and applicability, thereby resulting in effective capacity building efforts. The present review examined the value of community participation in refining training materials and designing training courses, which facilitated the development of training programmes to meet the aspirations of trainees and the needs of local communities  [71, 72] . Health knowledge and research literacy were identified as the two most prevalent topics in community partner training. This finding was consistent with a study showing that relevant health and research knowledge were the two main topics in community health worker training  [73] .\n\nThe included studies exhibited wide variations in training delivery in terms of trainers, duration, frequencies, and methods. Among nine studies that specified individuals responsible for training tasks, academic researchers were the most common type (66.7%, 6/9). The exclusion of community partners in training challenged the acceptability and effectiveness of training by ignoring stakeholders' preferences and community needs. A qualitative study among community stakeholders revealed the importance of adopting a collaborative approach to incorporate community stakeholders and researchers to align training competencies  [74] . The included studies conducted training with varied durations and frequencies. Only one study conducted refresher training four months since the start of the intervention  [44] . The importance and impact of training diminished over time  [75, 76] . All these studies underscored the importance of conducting multiple training sessions at an appropriate frequency. Regarding the training method, limited information was disclosed in the included studies (n = 1). Previous studies adopted diverse methods in the training of community partners through didactic presentation, group discussion, and role plays, which may help effectively disseminate and implement curricula to health care workers  [77] ."

This review suggested that most studies engaged community partners in intervention implementation, and some interventions were tailored to the preferences of participants. Such efforts can enhance the receptivity of interventions because community partners were familiar with the communities. In addition, this allowed community partners to deliver interventions to participants in the most suitable and acceptable manner and increase their effectiveness."

By examining these broad outcomes, a more comprehensive understanding of the impacts of CBPR programmes on vaccination and public health can be gained.\n\nImproving the vaccination rate among vulnerable groups could contribute to addressing disparities in vaccine-associated diseases. The involvement of the community in the planning and implementation processes, fully integrated within routine organisational programs, facilitates the equitable distribution of resources and promotes the sustainability of disparities elimination efforts.
