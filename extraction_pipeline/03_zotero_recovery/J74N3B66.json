  "title": "Sustained long-term efficacy of motivational counselling and text message reminders on daily sitting time in patients with rheumatoid arthritis? Long-term follow-up of a randomized, parallel-group trial",
  "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate the 18-month post-intervention efficacy following a four-month individually tailored, behavioral intervention on daily sitting time in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The four-month post-intervention results showed that patients in the intervention reduced their daily sitting time, improved patient-reported outcomes and total cholesterol levels compared to the control group. \n Methods : In an observer-blinded randomized trial, 150 RA patients were included. During four months, the intervention group (n=75) received three motivational counselling sessions and tailored text messages aimed at increasing light-intensity physical activity through reduction of sedentary behavior. The control group (n=75) maintained usual lifestyle. Primary outcome was change from baseline to 18 months post intervention in objectively measured daily sitting time (ActivPAL). Secondary outcomes included changes in clinical patient-reported outcomes and cardio-metabolic biomarkers. A mixed effect repeated measures ANCOVA model in the intentionto-treat population was applied. At 22-months follow-up from baseline, 12 participants were lost to follow-up. Compared to baseline, sitting time in the intervention group decreased 1.10 h/day, whereas it increased by 1.32 h/day in the control group; between-group difference of -2.43 h/day (95%CI: -2.99;-1.86; p<0.0001) favoring the intervention group. For most secondary outcomes between-group differences favored the intervention: VAS-pain: -15.51 mm (-23.42;-7.60), VAS-fatigue: -12.30 mm (-20.71;-3.88), physical function: -0.39 HAQ-units (-0.53;-0.26), total cholesterol: -0.86 (-1.03;-0.68), triglyceride: -0.26 (-0.43;-0.09) and average glucose: -1.15 (-1.39;-0.91) mmol/l. \n Conclusion: Eighteen months after intervention, patients in the intervention group were still significantly less sedentary than controls. Findings suggest that a behavioral approach is beneficial for promoting long-term physical activity and health in patients with RA.",

In comparison, it has been reported that the general population spent up to 62% of their daily awaken time in sedentary behaviors (5).\n\nSedentary behavior has been linked to mortality and poor cardiovascular and metabolic health in the general population (8-10) and with cardiovascular disease in patients with RA (11). Accordingly, a broader understanding of physical activity and the associated health outcomes has emerged, including replacing daily sedentary behavior with light-intensity physical activity through common daily activities (e.g. standing, stepping, domestic chores) (12). This approach has been advocated to patients with chronic disease and mobility limitations (13-15), for whom replacing sedentary behavior with light-intensity activities may be a more suitable conduit than the sole promotion of MVPA. Intervention studies have provided some evidence that it is possible to reduce daily sitting time in different settings and populations of adults through a variety of interventions  (16) (17) (18) (19) (20) .\n\nLimited evidence of the effect of reducing sedentary behavior in patients with RA led to the commissioning of a randomized controlled trial (RCT)  (21) . A feasibility study confirmed that an individually tailored behavioral intervention targeting reduction of sedentary behavior was feasible and acceptable to patients with RA  (22) . The subsequent RCT demonstrated that the intervention was effective for improving health-related quality of life (HR-QoL), general self-efficacy, physical function, pain, fatigue and cholesterol levels compared to an usual-lifestyle control group over a four-month period (23).\n\nHowever, long-term health effects related to the intervention is unknown. Hence, the objective of the present study was to evaluate the 18-month post-intervention efficacy of the fourmonth individually tailored, behavioral intervention, the results of which have been published previously (21;23)."

It was based on behavioral choice theory (26), constructs of the Social Cognitive Theory, i.e. self-efficacy (27), and motivational interviewing techniques (28). In the first counselling session (at week 1) the participants set individual behavioral goals and made action plans for reduction of daily sitting time. At the two later counselling sessions (at week 3 and 10, respectively) attainment of the behavioral goals was reviewed and the goals were modified, and/or new ones were set. The participants were provided with oral and written information about the health benefits of reducing daily sitting time (16;21;22).\n\nImmediately after each counselling session, a communications specialist drafted text messages to the participants reminding them of their individually set behavioral goal(s).

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "We have evaluated the long-term outcomes of an individually tailored, behavioral intervention compared with usual lifestyle in patients with RA. Results regarding the primary outcome, daily sitting time, were encouraging with a between-group difference in change of 2.4 hours in favor of the intervention group. Differences in change for most patient-reported outcomes and for total cholesterol were also sustained, still in favor of the intervention group. In addition, in this longterm follow-up, we also found statistically significant differences in change of levels of triglycerides and average glucose favoring the intervention group, as opposed to immediately following the intervention, where no statistically significant between-group differences for these outcomes were observed. Our results are important on more than one level; first, this is the first trial to specifically target if, and to which degree, reduction in daily sedentary behavior and increase in physical activity of light intensity can be achieved in patients with RA. Second, we included a long-term evaluation of this health promotion approach.\n\nPatients with RA have described different and individual contributors to daily sedentary behavior with fatigue, pain and disability being the most prominent  (40) . Thus, we found it important that the present intervention was individualized and targeted a low-intensity physical activity behavior that was possible to overcome even on days dominated by fatigue, pain and decreased mobility.\n\nThe focus on reducing sedentary behavior and replacing it with light-intensity physical activity together with the individual and everyday life perspective may explain the sustained effect of the intervention.\n\nWhile evidence is rapidly accumulating that it is possible to reduce daily sitting time through a variety of interventions in healthy adults (16-20), there is limited evidence of interventions aiming to reduce sedentary behavior in populations with chronic diseases. In our trial, the intervention group decreased daily sitting time by 1.6 hours four months from baseline (23), and was able to maintain this reduction up to 22 months from baseline (average reduction of 1.1 hours/day in the intervention group). This is consistent with results from a recent randomized controlled trial employing video-coaching and a study website in order to motivate patients with multiple sclerosis to reduce daily sitting time  (41) . A reduction in daily sitting time of 1.65 hours/day in favor of the intervention group was reported, although on a short-term basis (six months post intervention)  (41) . Moreover, sitting time was measured by self-reports, i.e. with a risk of reporting bias that may limit the direct comparison with the results of our trial."

      "text": "Recent studies have shown that regular interruptions of prolonged sitting positively influence cardio-metabolic biomarkers, e.g. postprandial glycaemia (44) and blood pressure (45).\n\nIn our trial, while the total daily sitting time was reduced significantly, there was no significant change in the number of daily sit-to-stand transitions. This may indicate that when the participants interrupted their sitting time, they replaced it with longer bouts of activity (standing/stepping) and may not have focused on the frequency of transitions from sitting to standing. However, we still found statistically significant changes in blood lipids after four months (23) in addition to significant changes in levels of triglycerides and average glucose after 22 months. In a more experimental setting, Duvivier et al (2017) (46) reported significant improvements in 24 h glucose levels and insulin sensitivity in individuals with type 2 diabetes by following a regimen consisting of replacing 4.7 hours of daily sitting time with standing and light-intensity walking compared to structured exercise (46). Together with our results, this indicates that different patterns of change in sitting time can contribute to improvements in cardio-metabolic biomarkers.\n\nWe have reported and compared proportions of participants in the two groups achieving 50 minutes of reductions in daily sitting time (19). However, the minimal clinically important difference for daily sitting time has not yet been determined, although a recent study based on isotemporal substitution analyses found a 2-4% improvement in cardio-metabolic biomarkers from reallocating 30 minutes of sedentary behavior to light-intensity physical activity daily (47).\n\nOur intervention showed highly significant immediate (4 months post baseline) and long-term (22 months post baseline) effects on most self-reported clinical outcomes, e.g. fatigue, pain, HR-QoL and physical function. These results are comparable to those found as a result of aerobic exercise in patients with RA (48), indicating that improvements in symptoms, feelings of confidence, and well-being can be achieved by engaging in a range of physical activity with"

Thus, without disregarding the health benefits of performing moderate to vigorous physical activity it may have important implications for clinical practice and physical activity recommendations for patients with RA if substantial health benefits can be achieved and sustained by replacing sitting time with standing and stepping time in different domains of daily life. More research is needed to investigate whether similar health benefits of this health promotion approach can be demonstrated in other clinical populations characterized by chronic disease and mobility limitations, who may find increases in daily nonexercise activities more appealing than solely focusing on increasing moderate to vigorous intensity physical activity.\n\nBeside the randomized controlled trial design, the blinded outcome assessors, the objective assessments of daily sitting time and the extended follow-up period are all contributors to the quality of the present trial. Participant blinding was not possible. However, with the individual approach, scrutiny of attendance and independent measurements of the primary outcome we consider contamination between the groups to be unlikely. The results showed that the control group in fact increased their average daily sitting time, which may indicate that the controls were not influenced by the intervention participants. However, we lack data with the potential to explain the observed behavioral changes in the control group more thoroughly.\n\nThere are some issues to consider in relation to the use of the ActivPAL monitor in this study. We consider it a strength to the current study that it did not provide any feedback to the participants limiting the possibility that the monitor itself contributed to changes in physical activity behavior. However, although the ActivPAL monitor has been recognized to have high correlation with observations for sitting/lying time, upright time and for detecting reduced sitting time in adults (49) and in patients with RA (30), it does not distinguish between certain activity types, e.g. stepping and cycling (50). Thus, we cannot rule out that the significant changes in selfreported clinical outcomes and lipid profile were reached by activity types not currently available through the ActivPAL software as a spill-over effect of the intervention.\n\nParticipant retention was high with only 12 participants (8%) dropping out during the 22 months, indicating high approval of the intervention and acceptable assessments procedures. However, a total of 467 (58.3%) of the initially invited patients declined to participate in the trial. This may call for additional research into those declining participation with respect to demographic characteristics as well as of which intervention components they found unappealing."

The participants registered their daily sleeping time in order to separate this from sitting/lying in waking time. Secondary outcomes were changes from baseline to 22 months in the following variables: self-reported daily sitting time at work and during leisure time (Physical Activity Scale 2.1 [PAS 2.1]) (31); Number of \"breaks\" in daily sitting time (ActivPAL); Pain (Visual Analogue Scale [VAS]) (32); Fatigue (VAS and the 20-item Multidimensional Fatigue Inventory [MFI 20]) (33); Physical function (Health Assessment Questionnaire [HAQ]) (34); Health-related quality of life (HR-QoL) (Short Form (36) Health Survey [SF-36])"
