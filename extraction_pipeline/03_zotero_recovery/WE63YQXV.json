  "abstract": "Rising rates of NCDs threaten fragile healthcare systems in low-and middle-income countries. Fortunately, new digital technology provides tools to more effectively address the growing dual burden of disease. Two-thirds of the world's population subscribed to mobile services by the end of 2018, while the falling price of connectivity and the 5G networks rollout promise to accelerate the use of digital technology. Properly leveraged, we can employ digital solutions and applications to transform health systems from reactive to proactive and even preventive, helping people stay healthy. With artificial intelligence (AI), health systems can be made more predictive by detecting risk factors and helping health professionals respond faster to prevent disease. Yet this rapid pace of growth has also complicated the digital health landscape. Myriad digital health apps compete and overlap in the public and private sectors, and significant gaps in the collection and analysis of digital data threaten to leave some behind. Established in 2010, the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development is led by ITU and UNESCO and advocates for the transformational impact of broadband technologies for development. Its working group on digital and AI in health, co-chaired by the Novartis Foundation and at different times Nokia, Intel and Microsoft, identifies best practices for countries to realize the potential of digital technology in health and care. Interviewing more than 100 key stakeholders and reviewing over 200 documents, the Working Group set out to identify common challenges that countries face in implementing digital health solutions, and to develop a framework that countries can use to build systems for supporting digital health solutions. Common challenges include a lack of coordination leading to fragmented digital health solutions; lack of systems and workforce capacity to manage data and digital technology, and inadequate financing to support digital health. The working group proposes six building blocks for digital health systems: formulate and execute a national digital health strategy; create policy and regulatory frameworks that support innovation while protecting security and privacy; ensure access to digital infrastructure; ensure interoperability of digital health system components; establish effective partnerships; and sustain adequate financing.",

Rising rates of NCDs, driven by social changes in employment, diet and lifestyle accompanying rapid development and urbanization, threaten fragile healthcare systems in LMICs.  1 , 2  From 1980-2019 the global prevalence of diabetes more than doubled to 9.3 % and is projected to continue rising to 10.9 % by  2045. 3  Approximately 1.13 billion people have hypertension, mostly in LMICs, causing more than 7.5 million deaths each year.  4 ,  5  Although mortality rates from coronary disease have stabilized in high-income countries, prevalence in LMICs leaves hundreds of millions vulnerable.  6 OVID-19 is just the latest example of comorbidity with infectious disease and NCDs: across the developing world 336 million people with diabetes are more likely to contract a range of infectious diseases including HIV, influenza, tuberculosis, and dengue, and to suffer worse outcomes.  7 Similarly, the roughly 175 million people around the world living with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are more vulnerable to any respiratory infection. 8"

Digital health can empower patients to take control of their own health, while enabling health providers and managers to coordinate data and care at the individual and community level. More broadly, digital health can assist LMICs toward achieving UHC by increasing access and quality of care, and by making health systems more efficient and care more affordable.\n\nTwo-thirds of the world's population owns a mobile phone.  9 Mobile data usage has soared from 2.5 petabytes per month in 2014 to 38 exabytes per month in 2019, a 15,000-fold increase.

      "text": "The Working Group set out to 1) identify common challenges that countries face in implementing digital health solutions, and 2) develop a framework that countries can use to build systems for supporting digital health solutions. Its purview encompassed all concepts and activities at the intersection of health and information and communications technologies (ICTs), including mobile health, health information technology, electronic health records, and telehealth; key innovations including cloud platforms, open integration layers, and the development of 5G; and leadership, policy and regulatory issues related to governance, security, privacy, and spectrum allocation for digital health services. This was the first time that a diverse group of experts and stakeholders representing public, private and non-profit expertise assembled to develop a roadmap for the development of digital health systems.\n\nWith a focus on sustainability, the Working Group sought to identify digital health solutions that are fully integrated, scalable, and financially viable (Fig.  1 ).  14 he Working Group met quarterly to review outputs from literature review and stakeholder interviews adjust the strategic trajectory of the project in an iterative, collaborative process. The first phase of the research consisted of key interviews with government officials and other stakeholders, along with a literature review and expert consultations. More than 100 digital health leaders from around the world were interviewed about local conditions and challenges, including experts from Bangladesh, Brazil, Canada, Chile, Estonia, Gabon, Ghana, India, Kenya, Malawi, Malaysia, Mali, Mexico, Nigeria, Norway, Pakistan, the Philippines, Rwanda, Singapore, and South Africa, as well as international organizations. The Working Group collected and analyzed primary and secondary research material from more than 200 reports and compiled the resulting insights and recommendations. Members of the Working Group also contributed their own expertise in key areas."

Common funding challenges include:\n\n\u2022 Fluctuations in health ministry budgets \u2022 Competing priorities and initiatives across agencies \u2022 Short-term budget cycles not aligned with long-term health-system goals \u2022 In LMICs, reliance on external donor support Informed by these findings, the Working Group identified six actions that policymakers, in collaboration with stakeholders, can take to create favorable environments for advancing a sustainable, national digital health agenda. These six actions should be seen as building blocks, where all are necessary and each one reinforces the others Fig.  2 . The recommendations are illustrated by brief real-world case studies identified by the commission.\n\n1. Formulate and execute a national digital health strategy that lays out a compelling vision and provides clear direction to all stakeholders in the health system. A national strategy should provide a supportive, predictable operating environment for solution providers.\n\nHigh-level leadership and multisector collaboration are essential to articulating the vision that guides the content of the strategy. The strategy should include a well-defined monitoring process to track implementation, impact and cost-effectiveness. An efficient monitoring system that generates relevant, actionable data will create a learning system that guides continua improvement.\n\nCase study: In Tanzania, an eHealth Steering Committee responsible for delivering the National Digital Health Investment Road Map 15 is cochaired by Permanent Secretaries from the Ministry of Health and Ministry of Local Government and includes additional leaders from the eGovernment Agency, the Ministry of Communications and Technology, local governments, private hospitals, donors and other partners. It oversees digital health implementation and makes policy decisions. Specific teams within the steering committee are responsible for advising on program management and technical issues, governance, and investments).\n\n2. Institute regulatory and policy frameworks to enable digital health solutions while protecting patients and driving innovation. Three categories of regulation are needed: A) Data management regulation, which securitizes data and safeguards patients' privacy. B) Device regulation, which ensures that only safe, cost-effective, high-quality devices are approved for use, with the degree of regulation kept in proportion to the risk that devices pose to patients C) Regulation of the delivery of care, which ensures that medical practices complemented by digital technology are safe and highquality.\n\nRegulators should consider prioritizing applications for improving prevention and early detection, supporting task-shifting, telehealth and telemedicine, and e-prescription of medicines. The rapid pace of software innovation and especially AI demands that agencies continuously adapt regulatory approaches to ensure safe digital health tools can reach patients quickly.\n\nCase study: In the United States, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) was the first agency to regulate certain health-focused mobile apps by classifying them as medical devices. The agency has since taken several steps to adapt its medical-device regulations to digital health. For example, it provides a streamlined process for launching apps developed by manufacturers with proven quality standards. 15 Government of Tanzania. The Journey to Better Data for Better Health in High-priority infrastructure includes health information exchange architecture, unique citizen or patient IDs, electronic health records or registries, Application Programming Interfaces, and health management information systems that integrate data across regions and diseases."

      "text": "Governments and mobile network operators can accelerate access by promoting the public access points, stimulating competition and incentives for operators to enter new markets, promoting infrastructuresharing, and more efficiently managing radio frequencies.\n\nCase study: The government of Estonia has overseen the development of a nation-wide digital health platform with two critical features. First, an electronic health record system with an online portal stores a unified health record for every patient, which is uniformly populated with data from doctors and hospital workers. Every patient has an online medical history with records accessible to both doctors and them. Second, the platform includes an electronic prescription system connecting every hospital and pharmacy in the country and is used to process 99 % of all prescriptions issued to patients. Physicians prescribe medicines electronically, and patients retrieve their prescriptions at the pharmacy using their ID card. In both systems, data integrity and privacy are protected by blockchain technology.\n\n4. Ensure components of digital health systems are interoperable. Interoperability allows different ICT systems, software applications and devices to communicate and exchange data (Fig.  3 ). Integrating digital health solutions into national health reimbursement systems is crucial for addressing NCDs, which require lifelong treatment that can lead to catastrophic health expenditures. Because creating interoperability involves making both technical and organizational decisions, interoperability coordinating bodies should include diverse stakeholders.\n\nCase study: In Chile, until 2008 electronic health records were used only at individual hospitals and academic medical centers that could afford them. There were no national interoperability standards, data were not shared, and there was a significant data disconnect between public and private health centers. After several years of incremental progress in promoting interoperability, in 2016 the Chilean Public Development Agency (CORFO) created the Centro Nacional en Sistemas de Informaci\u00f3n en Salud (CENS) to promote nationwide software interoperability, build health workers' digital health capability, and provide procedures for certifying software and healthcare workers. CENS now works with international standard-setting organizations and local stakeholders to apply recognized interoperability standards in the Chilean market.\n\n5. Establish and maintain effective partnerships between governments and relevant external stakeholders. While governments lead planning and management and are ultimately responsible for securing infrastructure and financing, other partners bring critical expertise, delivery capacity, access to markets and understanding of the needs of target populations. Mobile network operators and fixed and wireless operators are especially important partners because they offer infrastructure, market expertise, and a mass of customer relationships that are essential for scaling. Governments can build bridges to new partners through health innovation events, support to help small companies bid for contracts, and by creating forums that allow stakeholders to meet and build working relationships.\n\nCaset studies: In 2013, Brazilian telecom Telef\u00f3nica acquired a significant stake in AxisMed, a chronic-care provider, to deliver remote monitoring for chronic patients. Under the service, patients' blood glucose levels and other health data are send to health workers tasked with supporting respective patients. Through this arrangement, AxisMed leverages Telef\u00f3nica's nation-wide base of customers, who can be reached via mobile apps, SMS and video. By providing this service, Telef\u00f3nica has improved new-subscriber acquisition and retention.\n\nSince 2013, the ITU-WHO Be He@lthy Be Mobile (BHBM) initiative is using the empowering potential of ICT, harnessing the reach of mobile phones to deliver health information to the people who lack access to conventional services.  16 Its goals include tobacco cessation, diabetes prevention and cervical-cancer awareness, and the initiative reached more than 2.5 million people in ten countries. Based on its insights, the ITU-WHO partnership developed handbooks to provide guidance and technical expertise on integrating mobile health interventions in national health systems.  17 n Kenya, the MoH, Amref, the MPesa Foundation, Mezzanine, Safaricom and Accenture Development Partners (ADP) developed a partnership that created a scalable platform called Leap. Through SMS text messages and voice recordings, Leap provides community health workers (CHW) access to learning information on relevant topics, such as hypertension and diabetes. Kenya's MoH provided regulatory oversight and shared strategic direction responsibilities with Amref, who also provided project management and community engagement. Safaricom provided extensive use of telecom infrastructure and data centers. ADP provided consulting expertise in areas including program strategy, delivery, technical design, mobility and learning modules, and cofunded the project with the M-Pesa Foundation. As of 2020 Leap has trained more than 53,000 CHWs with a 92 % completion rate. Training through the platform has led to an 88 % attrition rate, helping to reduce the costs associated with replacing CHWs. 18 6. Sustain adequate national financing necessary to bring digital health solutions from proof-of-concept to scale. Public or private insurance can ensure access to digital health solutions while protecting patients and users from financial hardship. If no health insurance schemes exist, other financing models can be used in combination with reimbursement schemes or as a financing bridge until health insurance is established. Donor grants are useful to cover start-up costs. External government financing is also typically used for time-limited public health campaigns. Pay-as-you-use or licensing models can generate a constant revenue stream for providers while matching users' needs. Outof-pocket payment is least preferred but can cover specific needs with a quick adoption rate, and payments for lower-income groups can be subsidized, including through a \"freemium\" approach. Smart design, local integration and maintenance, and bulk purchases can help reduce costs.\n\nCase study: The Senegalese national health agency, Agence de la Couverture Maladie Universelle (ACMU) has developed the Integrated Information System for the Management of Universal Health Coverage (Systeme d'Information de Gestion Inte\u01f5re\u0301 de la Couverture Maladie Universelle). It is digitalizing health insurance by integrating data from health plans, claims and biometric identification systems, with data input from health posts, public health institutions, pharmacies, private clinics and health insurance funds. The ACMU has developed an innovative approach to generating ongoing revenue from all participating stakeholders. This includes financing via user fees collected from participating institutions, transaction fees levied on each electronic payment, and crowdfunding from civil society, the Senegalese diaspora, business and NGOs. Financial projections suggested that this financing approach could produce an US$12.5 million of revenue annually, helping the system to become self-sustaining over time.  19"

      "text": "We found that three conditions are necessary for creating an enabling environment for implementing these recommendations at a national level. The first is visionary national leadership that is committed to digital health. Leaders must understand that significant financing is required, and they should invest political capital in mobilizing it. Investments need to be guided and safeguarded by effective governance mechanisms.\n\nSecond, national leaders need to oversee a governance mechanism and a process of effective intersectoral collaboration between different governmental ministries, particularly ministries of health, IT and finance, and between ministries and external partners. Roles must be clearly defined and governance mechanisms must allow for efficient decision making.\n\nThird, investment and collaboration need to be executed within the context of a sound national ICT legislative, policy and regulatory framework-including, importantly, regulatory standards for interoperability. This ICT framework needs to facilitate alignment between the health sector and the ICT sector and be flexible enough to promote innovations that will inevitably reshape the marketplace for digital health solutions."

      "title": "Digital health system governance",
      "text": "The Working Group found three primary governance mechanisms that governments are using based on where the locus of coordination and accountability lies with respect to the national health ministry. Each offers advantages and drawbacks and should be adapted to the local environment. Countries can also transition between mechanisms as needed.\n\nHealth ministry mechanism: The MoH-typically a unit or department that leads on digital health-is responsible for delivering a digital health solution and mobilizes technical capacity and skills from other ministries, agencies, firms and organizations in order to build and deploy the system. The ICT ministry or agency plays a supportive role in implementation.\n\nGovernment-wide digital agency mechanism: An intragovernmental technology agency provides ICT infrastructure, services and capacity building to all government ministries. MoH drives the digital health strategy and programs but acts as a client of a government-wide technology agency.\n\nDedicated digital health agency mechanism: A designated thirdparty agency or directorate with substantial financial and technical capacity is responsible for enabling and delivering digital health services and programs. Health and ICT policy and strategy is often led by the MoH and a cross-sector ICT ministry or agency."

AI's potential to transform the delivery of health and care makes it critical for policymakers to invest now in the data and digital infrastructure and capacities that will enable countries to roll out AI-based solutions.\n\nThe ITU/UNESCO Broadband Commission's third Working Group on Artificial Intelligence for Global Health, co-chaired by the Novartis Foundation and Microsoft has explored the potential of AI to optimize health systems, close resource gaps, and improve patient health.

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "Digital and AI technology promises to change the way health and care are provided and has the potential to accelerate the achievement of SDG3. By applying six practical building blocks, policymakers, private companies, donors, health consumers and civil society can work together to strategically build health and care systems that help accelerate the achievement of the health SDGs, reduce the burden of NCDs, and aid countries in their path toward UHC. Leadership and regulatory coordination at the national and international levels must play a central role, while solutions should have a human-centered design and be flexible to adapt to local contexts. With growing opportunities to apply AI, health and care systems can better predict highest-risk patients, help health professionals respond faster to prevent disease and support policy makers allocate resources for the greatest impact. This can ultimately transform health systems from being reactive to proactive, predictive and ultimately preventative, to keep populations healthy instead of waiting for people to present when they are sick. Ultimately, the most effective approach to building digital health systems is to deploy a combination of established digital technology while allowing flexibility to innovate with emerging technologies."
