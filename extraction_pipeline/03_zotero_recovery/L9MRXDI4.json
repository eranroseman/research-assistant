      "title": "1.. Introduction",
      "text": "Remote diagnosis systems are becoming increasingly popular and accurate, with enormous advantages such as costeffectiveness, fast and reliable decision support for medical diagnostics, and treatment and prevention of disease, illness, injury, and other physical and mental damages in human beings. *e rise in remote health services (or telehealth) offered by healthcare institutions coincided with the evolution of assisted living systems and environments, aiming to widen the possibility for older and disadvantaged people to access appropriate healthcare services and thus improve their health status and clinical outcome  [1] . With the increase in the innovation of medical technologies, there is a need to adopt medical expert systems that will oversee and control diagnosis and treatment processes  [2] . Medical diagnostic processes carried out with the aid of computerrelated technology which is on the rise daily have improved the experience and capabilities of physicians to make an effective diagnosis of diseases while employing novel signal processing techniques for analysis of patients' physiological data  [3, 4]  and deep neural networks for decision support  [5] . With the rise of the artificial intelligence (AI) techniques, the chatbots have appeared as a promising direction in streamlining the communication between doctors and patients  [6] . Such chats are becoming increasingly popular as remote health interventions are implemented in the form of the synchronous text-based dialogue systems  [7] . Patients with chronic diseases could make the most advantage from the use of chatbots which can continuously monitor their condition, provide reliable up-to-date information, and remind of taking medication  [8] . For the effective use of chatbots in the healthcare domain, the chatbot technology need advanced reasoning capabilities based on the formalization of medical knowledge (semantics) and health state of patients coupled with language vocabularies and dialogue engines  [9] .\n\n*e natural language processing (NLP) technology can serve as an interaction between computers and humans using linguistic analysis and deep learning methods to obtain knowledge from an unstructured free text  [10] . *e NLP systems have shown their uniqueness and importance in the areas of information retrieval mostly in the retrieval and processing of large amount of unstructured clinical records and return structured information by user-defined queries. In general, the NLP system is aimed at representing explicitly the knowledge that is expressed by the text written in a natural language. *ere are few applications of the NLP techniques in diagnosing diseases despite the enormous amount of text-based information, which can be retrieved from patients' self-narrations  [11] . *e main challenges addressed by the application of NLP for medical records are flexible formatting, structure without sentences, missing expected words and punctuation, unusual parts of speech (POS), medical jargon, and misspellings  [12] . Linguistic structures such as coreferences make medical texts difficult to be interpreted  [13] . Moreover, unique linguistic entities such as medical abbreviations make the inference of knowledge from medical texts much harder  [14] .\n\n*is study introduces the use of the NLP model via an SMS and a chatbot platform to improve the health selfassessment and decision support in digital healthcare systems. *e extraction of knowledge from the electronic health record (EHR) is a growing area of interest in medicine, and the use of electronic medical records (EMRs) at the healthcare center and on the cloud  [15]  has provided a vast amount of data to be analyzed. An EMR is a digital record of health-related information that is created, collected, and managed by medical experts  [16] . Compilation of existing and available medical data complications includes integrating NLP into multiple EMRs, ensuring privacy and security of patients' data  [17]  and clinical validation of a tool. All these can be overwhelming to medical research for improving patient care. However, the application of NLP techniques to screen patients and assist medical experts in their diagnosis would serve as a boost in successfully improving healthcare services through effective analysis of narrative text of symptoms provided by a patient.\n\nFor example, Langer et al.  [18]  used several NLP tools along with classification methods to process the drug-related questions. *ey developed a natural language-based interface that enables the users to phrase their queries and get an accurate result up to 81% in classifying drug-related questions. Pendyala et al.  [19]  presented an application which allows machines to take on the function of life support. *e focus of the study was based on medical diagnosis, and an experiment was conducted to show the relationship of information retrieval and text mining to the medical diagnosis problem. *e study concludes that the proposed system would help in improving the goals of providing a ubiquitous medical diagnosis. Fernandez-Millan et al.  [20]  presented a rule-based expert system using the list of likely diseases regarding laboratory test results for diagnosis. *e authors concluded that the proposed system clinically gave a better accuracy and speed, thereby improving the efficiency and quality of service. Atutxa et al.  [21]  used deep learning models to extract the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes from the death certificates written in a regular natural language, obtaining an F-score of 0.963, 0.838, and 0.952 for Hungarian, French, and Italian, respectively. Combi et al.  [22]  proposed an NLP method for the transcoding of natural text descriptions of adverse drug reactions into MedDRA standard terms, reaching an average precision and recall of 91.8% and 86.9%. Evans et al.  [23]  analyzed patient safety incident reports written in free text to categorize incident type and the severity of outcome, reaching an accuracy of 0.891 and 0.708, respectively. Kloehn et al.  [24]  generate explanations for complex medical terms in Spanish and English using WordNet synonyms and summaries, as well as the word embedding vector as a source of knowledge. Sarker et al.  [25]  used fuzzy logic and set theory-based methods for learning from a limited number of annotated examples of unstructured answers in health examinations for recognizing correct concepts with an average F1-measure of 0.89. Zhou et al.  [26]  used deep learning models pretrained on the general text sources to learn knowledge for information extraction from the medical texts. Lauraitis et al.  [27]  used text input acquired by a smartphone app for evaluation of cognitive and motor deficits for people showing symptoms of central nervous system (CNS) disorders as a part of self-administered cognitive testing (SAGE) tests.\n\n*e development of the medical domain-oriented conversational chatbots has been addressed by several researchers. Such conversational agents powered by AI techniques may serve patients with minor health concerns while allowing medical doctors to allocate more time to treat more serious patients  [28]  or find suitable donors  [29] . A chatbot-powered healthcare service can promptly respond to the problems that arise in daily life and to the health state changes of people with chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, or hypertension  [30] . For example, Ahmad et al.  [31]  developed a chatbot that is able to advice on the kind of drugs to be taken based on the data submitted by the user. Avila et al.  [32]  developed a chatbot to find the best prices for medicines and suggest their best possible substitutes. Bao et al.  [33]  suggested a hybrid model composed of a knowledge graph and a textual similarity model to construct a system for responding to medical questions using Hierarchical BiLSTM Attention Model (HBAM). Chaix et al.  [34]  developed a chatbot for patients with breast cancer to provide support and answers to their concerns on their disease as well as to remind taking the prescribed drugs. Denecke et al.  [35]  developed a mobile app with a chatbot that uses the elements of the cognitive behavior therapy to support mentally ill people in addressing their psychological problems. Harilal et al.  [36]  developed a chatbot app aimed at supporting empathetic conversations, sensing the associated emotions, and extending medical advice for people with depression. Huang et al.  [37]  developed an AI-powered chatbot for promoting healthy lifestyle and providing advices for weight management. Hussain and Athula  [38]  developed a chatbot that uses Media Wiki API to extract information from Wikipedia to supplement the chatbot's knowledge for advising diabetic patients on diabetes management. K\u00f6kciyan et al.  [39]  integrated the data from commercial health sensors, EHR, and clinical guidelines with a conversational chatbot that provides further explanations about their overall well-being based on the argumentation-based dialogue. Ni et al.  [40]  suggested a knowledge-driven primary care chatbot system that has an analytic NLP-based engine for understanding the descriptions of patients' symptom, a reasoner for mapping symptoms to possible causes, and a question generator for creating further dialogue questions. On the other hand, Zini et al.  [41]  developed a deep learning framework-based conversational agent to represent a virtual patient that can be used for teaching medical students on patient examination.\n\nMachine learning algorithms, especially SVM, have shown promising results in classifying free text such as Georgian language in medical records  [42] . SVM with a polykernel was used for classifying primary care patient safety incident report content and severity  [23] . However, authors claimed that improving definitions and increased training samples of select categories will further improve performance of the system. Deep learning methods were proposed by Zhou et al.  [26] . *e authors presented transfer learning methods based on the traditional multilayer neural network (NN) model to develop a clinical information extraction system. Other methods in existing studies include an interactive NLP tool for identifying incidents in radiology reports presented by Trivedi et al.  [43] . *e authors implemented and assessed usability based on an open-ended questionnaire and the system usability scale (SUS). *e summary of the selected literature is depicted in Table  1 .\n\nMedical chatbot has been designed and implemented in various clinical areas for developing conversational tools with wide access to medical knowledge and healthcare issues. Existing chatbots are designed for either generic or specific disease purposes. A novel approach based on the AI method was proposed by Madhu et al.  [46]  for designing a simple and interactive medical assistance chatbot for medicine dosage intake considering the age and weight of patients. Mandy chatbot system was designed to assist healthcare staff in automating patient intake process  [40] . *e proposed chatbot is based on three sections which are the mobile app front for patient interaction, the diagnosis section, and the doctor's interface for assessing patient's records. *e chatbots combine NLP with knowledge-driven diagnosis abilities. Similarly, Siangchin and Samancheun  [47]  developed a chatbot application using the auxiliary NLP library. *e system was further compared with traditional ICD-10 application based on analytic hierarchy process (AHP) for analyzing, selecting, and classifying diabetes mellitus, trauma, and external causes. *e integration of NLP and machine learning algorithms has also played a key role in creating chatbot application for disease prediction and treatment recommendation  [48] . Deep learning framework was proposed by Zini et al.  [41]  for enhancing virtual patients' conversational skills. *e authors integrated long-short-term memory networks and CNN for sentence embeddings in a given QA script. Other methods include a study by Roca et al.  [8]  which introduced the chatbotspatient interaction system for specific chronic disease psoriasis. Further study from Rosruen and Samanchuen  [49]  also developed an intent-based approach chatbot known as MedBot using Dialogflow for medical consultant services. *e authors claimed that the proposed system was able to maximize user's convenience, increase service capability, and reduce operational cost.\n\n*e successful adoption of chatbot technology from Table  2  has shown effective interaction between users and machines especially in various domains within the healthcare system. However, there are some limitations with some of the methods proposed in the literature such as challenges associated with the static local knowledge based in chatbots and time consumption during training especially for a specific domain  [38] . *erefore, there is a need for a future study to develop chatbot software with more scalability, increased data sharing and reusability, and improved standard conversation model  [8] .\n\n*e continuous growth of mobile technology has affected every facet of human life around the globe as its support of healthcare objectives through telemedicine, telehealth, and m-health  [52]  has helped to diagnose and treat patients at low cost especially in the developing countries, where there are limited options of diagnosis and treatment. Out of various communication media available on mobile devices, short messaging service (SMS) has proven to be unique and reliable due to its low cost, reliable delivery, personal to users, and not Internet-oriented service  [53, 54] . Considering the need to provide good medical care to everyone including rural dwellers with poor electricity and slow Internet connections, it is therefore important to integrate SMS with a medical diagnosis system, thus establishing an SMS-medical diagnosis system to best meet the needs of a common man  [55] . Considering the overall progress and research efforts made by researchers in improving e-health systems and designing decision support systems (DSS)  [56] [57] [58] , there is still much work to be done for effective understanding and identifying key features based on NLP for enhancing diagnosis, thus improving good health and well-being of the global society at large.\n\nSummarizing the existing medical diagnosis systems (MDS) often adopts poor decisions due to interpretation of the text-based input provided by the patient. *erefore, there is a need to automate MDS for efficient diagnosis of diseases and support their decisions based on the severity of symptoms. Moreover, the medical experts need a platform to keep track of large text-based chunk of knowledge narrated by patients in a natural language, hence improving healthcare delivery for remote patients.\n\n*e contribution of this paper is as follows: (1) we have developed a text-based medical diagnosis system which provides a personalized diagnosis utilizing self-input from users to effectively diagnose diseases. (  2 ) *e proposed system combines the NLP and machine learning algorithms for SMS and Telegram bot. (3) *e system is able to diagnose using a direct approach of the question and answering technique to suggest a medical diagnosis.\n\n*e structure of the remaining parts of the paper is as follows. We present and discuss our methodology and the algorithm used in Section 2. In Section 3, we evaluate and discuss the results. We present conclusions and outline future work in Section 4.  *e implementation of the diagnosis system framework was done using the Python language due to the following functionalities: cross-platform and high availability of thirdparty libraries for tasks relating to machine learning and NLP. *e system uses Python library packages to access the machine learning functions and NLP needed for categorization."

      "text": ". *e knowledge base is the principal source of data in a question and answering system, and it could be in the structured or unstructured format. To develop the knowledge base, the information from a medical database system was collected and divided into categories which are referred to as context knowledge of the disease.\n\n*e main sources of information in the knowledge base are as follows: (1) WordNet  [59] , which provides a lexical database and defines the relationships of words and phrases;\n\n(2) YAGO (Yet Another Great Ontology)  [60] , an open source knowledge base which we use to construct a knowledge graph of common knowledge entities; (3) UMLS (Unified Medical Language System), which combines many medical vocabularies, including ICD-10-CM and SNOMED CT, and is used to link medical terms and extract medical concepts, relationships, or knowledge; UMLS is recognized as a comprehensive knowledge source in the healthcare domain  [61] ; and (4) Disease Ontology (DO)  [62] , which contains a knowledge base of over 10,000 human diseases.\n\nWe used WordNet as WordNet is used in most of the question-answering systems, and it has proved to be useful when dealing with words. An access to WordNet is implemented via WordNet HTTP API. An access to YAGO is implemented using a SPARQL  [63]  query engine, which sends queries to the SPAQL endpoint and returns the semantic fact triples (subject-predicate-object). An access to UMLs is implemented via UMLS REST API using the Python language. An access to DO metadata for a specific DO term is by using the REST metadata API by constructing a HTTP request. *e knowledge base is specified using eXtensible Meta Language (XML), which ensures a common way to specify and share structurally organized data that are not dependent of an application.\n\nFor knowledge representation, we have adopted a threelayer model of disease-symptom-property (DSP) originally suggested in  [64]  as shown in Figure  2 . *e knowledge in the knowledge database is stored as resource description framework (RDF) triples (property, symptom, and disease), while the computational model is adopted from the disease compass  [65] , which allows us to query the causal chains of diseases.\n\nOur knowledge base includes 71 instances of diseases (mainly tropical ones) and 542 pieces of information. *e model (see Figure  3 ) uses the knowledge from the knowledge database and applies the fuzzy rules described in Section 2.6."

For transformation into the feature vector, we used the word embedding  [66]  technique. Word embeddings are the representation of words in the semantic multidimensional space. For our system, we have adopted an available word embedding Glove  [67] , which is based on Twitter data, because it provides a good approximation to common English for an informal communication channel. For an effective training of data, the text messages were preprocessed and converted into feature vectors. *is was achieved based on feature extraction using the word embeddings. *e feature vector of the unlabeled document was then given to the classifier's decision function to return a category for the unlabeled document.

In order to obtain the crisp output, the center-of-gravity (centroid) defuzzification was employed, where the weights are expressed by the degree of membership of the value xi with the concept modeled by the fuzzy set A.\n\n*e process is implemented (Figure  4 ) as follows:\n\n(1) Fuzzification: transforms the crisp inputs into fuzzy values. Expert judgement is used for defining the degree of membership function. During fuzzification, a fuzzy rule controller receives input data (fuzzy variable) and analyzes it according to membership functions. *e final decision is made by selecting the fuzzy rule that achieved the highest score. *e system architecture, which was adopted from  [64] , is presented in Figure  5 ."

In a fuzzy SVM, a fuzzy membership values are used for each data point of SVM, and the SVM is reformulated such that different input points can make different contributions to the learning of the decision surface. Here, the fuzzy membership values are calculated using an algorithm suggested by Le et al.  [70] . First, we use clustering techniques to find clusters of data. Fuzzy membership values of data points belonging to clusters are set to 1, and fuzzy memberships of other data points are determined by their distance to the closest cluster, respectively. *e classifier was trained using a set of training documents which have been processed by the NLP package and converted into word embedding used as feature vectors. *e length of the feature vector is 300 as suggested by Mikolov et al.

We used the system usability scale (SUS), which is a questionnaire to evaluate the ease of use of a system using a Likert scale (five-point scale that varies from strongly disagree to strongly agree).\n\n*e SUS score is able to evaluate usability performance in terms of effectiveness, efficiency, and overall ease of use. SUS is considered as a reliable tool for measuring the usability, and it allows to evaluate a wide variety of products and services. SUS has become an industry standard, with references in over 1300 articles and publications  [75] , which also includes medical chatbots and other NLP-based medical diagnostics systems such as presented by Tielman et al.  [76]  and Valtolina et al.  [77] . SUS is designed to support assessment and comparison of the user experience when interacting with different tools and is recommended to be included in any evaluation of health chatbots  [44] . SUS has only 10 questions. *e results of an SUS fall between 0 and 100, while a score of 68 is considered average. SUS has already been applied before to assess the usability of chatbots  [78, 79] . *e SUS questions are easily adaptable for use with different types of systems; therefore, it was adapted to be used for our study. *e SUS questions we asked are listed in Figure  8 .\n\n*e participants of the usability test comprised 27 participants, including 11 females and 16 males, 13 were aged between 25 and 34, 9 aged between 35 and 44, and 6 aged between 45 and 53. *e study participants have provided an informed consent to take part in this research. Usability study lasted less than 45 min per session. Information booklets informing about the study performed were distributed to the participants, and the participants were requested to communicate with the chatbot by using a mobile phone. All received answers were anonymized.\n\n*e SUS scores were computed using the procedure provided by Brooke  [80] : subtracting 1 from the score for questions 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9, whereas subtracting the score from 5 for questions 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 and multiplying the total of the scores by 2.5 to obtain the final evaluation score.\n\n*e SUS score is assessed as follows: >80.3 (excellent), 68-80.3 (good), 68 (okay), 51-68 (poor), and <51 (bad). As a result of evaluation, the mean SUS score obtained for CUDoctor was 80.4, which is above the threshold of 68, which means that the overall evaluation was excellent. *e results for all SUS questions are presented in Figure  9 . *ey show that the user provided the worst evaluation for Q2 (\"I found CUDoctor unnecessarily complex\") giving a score of 72.7, but still above the threshold of 68. *e best evaluated feature was integration (Q5) with a score of 91.6."

      "text": "Several chatbots with medical-related applications are provided on social networking platforms such as Facebook. For example, the FLORENCE bot that reminds the users when to take their medication and monitors their weight and moods. SMOKEY warns the users on bad air quality. HealthTap provides answers using a database of knowledge that contains similar questions. Google provides the Dialogflow Application Programming Interface (API) for the integration of NLP to the target applications. Woebot provides a cognitive behavior therapy service for patients with and has been tested with depression  [81] . It allowed to reduce their symptoms of depression as evaluated by the depression questionnaire PHQ-9. XiaoIce is a social chatbot that emphasizes emotional connection  [82] , while using deep learning for meaningful response dialogue tasks. Chatbots are also used in suicide prevention and cognitive behavioral therapy, aiming at risk groups such as HARR-E and Wysa  [83] . *e main difference of the system described in this paper is that the service is delivered over the SMS rather than social networks, which require very good Internet connectivity often unavailable in remote rural regions of developing countries. Moreover, the described solution focuses on the niche domain of tropical disease symptom assessment, and we are not aware of any other NLP-based systems focusing on this domain of application."

      "text": "*e timely access to healthcare avoiding unnecessary time wastage of patients is a major issue in sub-Saharan Africa. However, considering the exponential growth of mobile users and the need for a real-time medical diagnosis assistance tool, it is therefore important to explore the need for a cost-effective telehealthcare platform, which allows the earlier detection of diseases and effective communication with patients (users) to a diagnosis system (remote doctor at proxy). Based on the highlighted needs, this study was able to successfully build a text-based medical diagnosis system, which provides a personalized diagnosis utilizing self-input response from users to effectively suggest a disease diagnosis. *e proposed system was able to combine NLP and machine learning algorithm for SMS and Telegram bot. *e system was able to suggest a diagnosis using a direct approach of the question and answering technique to offer a diagnosis. *e limitation of the system is that it is not secure against the false-positive cases of falsely suggesting the disease; therefore, a final diagnosis still must be confirmed by the medical doctor.\n\n*e future recommendations include the automation of this medical diagnosis system to easily recognize diseases, recommend treatments, prescribe a medication, and perform medication adherence. Audio interaction will be incorporated to make the system more interactive. *ese improvements will serve towards reducing cost and mortality rate, thereby reducing the workload burden on medical doctors in underdeveloped regions. 100 95 90 85 80 75 70 65 60 Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4 Q5 Q6 Q7 Q9 Q8 Q10 SUS score Figure 9: Results from usability evaluation of CUDoctor using SUS."
