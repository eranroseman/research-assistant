  "title": "Use of Fitbit Devices in Physical Activity Intervention Studies Across the Life Course: Narrative Review",
  "abstract": "Background: Commercial off-the-shelf activity trackers (eg, Fitbit) allow users to self-monitor their daily physical activity (PA), including the number of steps, type of PA, amount of sleep, and other features. Fitbits have been used as both measurement and intervention tools. However, it is not clear how they are being incorporated into PA intervention studies, and their use in specific age groups across the life course is not well understood. Objective: This narrative review aims to characterize how PA intervention studies across the life course use Fitbit devices by synthesizing and summarizing information on device selection, intended use (intervention vs measurement tool), participant wear instructions, rates of adherence to device wear, strategies used to boost adherence, and the complementary use of other PA measures. This review provides intervention scientists with a synthesis of information that may inform future trials involving Fitbit devices. Methods: We conducted a search of the Fitabase Fitbit Research Library, a database of studies published between 2012 and 2018. Of the 682 studies available on the Fitabase research library, 60 interventions met the eligibility criteria and were included in this review. A supplemental search in PubMed resulted in the inclusion of 15 additional articles published between 2019 and 2020. A total of 75 articles were reviewed, which represented interventions conducted in childhood; adolescence; and early, middle, and older adulthood. Results: There was considerable heterogeneity in the use of Fitbit within and between developmental stages. Interventions for adults typically required longer wear periods, whereas studies on children and adolescents tended to have more limited device wear periods. Most studies used developmentally appropriate behavior change techniques and device wear instructions. Regardless of the developmental stage and intended Fitbit use (ie, measurement vs intervention tool), the most common strategies used to enhance wear time included sending participants reminders through texts or emails and asking participants to log their steps or synchronize their Fitbit data daily. The rates of adherence to the wear time criteria were reported using varying metrics. Most studies supplemented the use of Fitbit with additional objective or self-reported measures for PA. \n Conclusions: Overall, the heterogeneity in Fitbit use across PA intervention studies reflects its relative novelty in the field of research. As the use of monitoring devices continues to expand in PA research, the lack of uniformity in study protocols and metrics of reported measures represents a major issue for comparability purposes. There is a need for increased transparency in the prospective registration of PA intervention studies. Researchers need to provide a clear rationale for the use of several PA measures and specify the source of their main PA outcome and how additional measures will be used in the context of Fitbit-based interventions.",

      "text": "Insufficient physical activity (PA) in all stages of life, from early childhood to older adulthood, is a well-documented public health issue  [1] . Between 2001 and 2016, although the levels of insufficient PA decreased marginally globally, high-income Western countries, such as the United States, reported a 5% increase in the prevalence of physical inactivity  [2] . Insufficient PA is associated with increased risk for a variety of chronic diseases including cardiovascular disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes  [3, 4] . Although the current PA guidelines for Americans recommend at least 60 minutes per day of moderateto vigorous-intensity PA for children and adolescents and 150 minutes per week of moderate-intensity PA for adults, more than 80% of youth and adults do not meet these guidelines  [5] .\n\nAdvances in 21st century technology have introduced the use of commercial off-the-shelf activity trackers (eg, Fitbit and Apple Watch) that allow users to self-monitor their daily PA. As one of the top 5 wearable companies based on shipment volume, Fitbit has produced some of the most popular fitness trackers that are currently available on the market  [6] . These devices allow users to track their daily activities, including the number of steps, type of PA, and amount of sleep, among other features  [7] . Fitbit released its first device in 2009 and its first wrist-worn tracker in 2012  [8] . The brand quickly gained popularity and saw a substantial increase in the use of activity trackers in a relatively short time. In 2014, Fitbit reported only 6.7 million active users compared with 29.6 million in 2019  [9] . In November 2019, Google announced its purchase of Fitbit for US $2.1 billion and publicly committed to accelerating innovation of these devices  [7] .\n\nIn the last decade, researchers have begun to take advantage of Fitbit's public appeal, prominence, and relatively low cost compared with that of other commercial off-the-shelf activity trackers such as the Apple Watch, by incorporating these devices into their studies. This has been facilitated by Fitbit's open application programming interface (API), which allows programmers to collect and store data across multiple devices  [7] . Fitabase is an example of a company that capitalizes on Fitbit's open API and works with researchers to collect, manage, and analyze data from participants' Fitbit devices  [10] . In addition to being a data management platform, Fitabase provides the general public with access to an extensive library containing hundreds of published studies, protocols, and methods papers that report their use of Fitbit devices  [11] . As of  January 7, 2021, 682  articles published between 2012 and 2018 were available on the Fitabase research library  [11] ."

      "text": "Early studies involving Fitbit focused on establishing its accuracy as an objective PA measurement tool, especially in comparison with existing gold standard measurement devices  [12, 13] . The first study using a Fitbit device to assess PA was published in 2012 and assessed its validity in measuring steps taken during self-paced and prescribed PA  [14] . Overall, there have been mixed findings about the accuracy of Fitbit measurements, with some studies indicating step count accuracy 50% of the time compared with research-grade accelerometers  [15]  and others reporting high validity in step count measurements  [16, 17] . In addition to their ability to serve as a PA measurement tool, Fitbit devices are increasingly being used to support self-monitoring and goal setting as a way of promoting PA in intervention studies across the life course  [18] [19] [20] [21] . However, it is not clear how these commercially available devices are being incorporated into PA intervention studies. This gap severely hinders the creation of standardized procedures that operationalize Fitbit use in PA intervention studies (eg, wear time protocols, strategies to boost wear time, and analysis implications)  [22] . An overview of the ways in which Fitbit devices can be used to measure or help achieve the desired intervention effects can further contribute to the evidence base. Notably, Fitbit devices have been used in PA interventions targeting children through older adults. However, differences in use protocols across age groups (eg, models and strategies to boost wear time) are not known. In this context, this narrative review aims to characterize how PA intervention studies across the life course use Fitbit in terms of device selection, intended use (intervention vs measurement tool), wear instructions, rates of adherence to device wear, strategies used to boost adherence, and potential use of additional PA measures. This review provides intervention scientists with a synthesis of information that may inform future trials involving Fitbit devices."

      "title": "Search Strategy and Eligibility Criteria",
      "text": "Given that it serves as a repository of Fitbit-related studies, we first conducted a search of the Fitabase Fitbit Research Library  [11] . As of January 7, 2021, the Fitabase research library included studies published between 2012 and 2018 and retrieved from PubMed, Google Scholar, the Association for Computing Machinery, JMIR, Science Direct, and IEEE. Approximately twice a week during this period, the Fitabase team conducted searches of those sources using the keyword Fitbit. The studies identified in the search were then put through a screening process wherein they were deemed eligible for inclusion in the library only if a Fitbit device was used as a key element of the study (ie, for measurement or intervention purposes)  [11] . In the Fitabase library, we applied preexisting filters to limit eligible studies to those that were (1) intervention studies,  (2)  focused on and reported PA as a main study outcome, and (3) conducted in one of five developmental stages of interest (ie, childhood [9-12 years old], adolescence  [13] [14] [15] [16] [17]  years old], early adulthood  [18-40 years old] , middle adulthood [41-64 years old], or older adulthood [\u226565 years old]). We excluded nonintervention studies, those that did not report a specific target population, and those that did not have full-text articles available. We also excluded intervention studies that used Fitbit devices exclusively to monitor sleep. To capture studies published between 2019 and 2020, we conducted a search of PubMed using the following string search: \"(physical activity[Title/Abstract]) AND (Fitbit[Title/Abstract]) AND (intervention*[Title/Abstract]).\" In addition to applying the inclusion and exclusion criteria specified earlier, we excluded protocol and review papers and qualitative studies."

After finalizing the form, the first author read all the eligible studies and extracted the relevant data. To enhance the reliability of the extracted information, 3 additional coders (RL, MK, and YA) subsequently read the articles and reviewed the extracted data. As part of our protocol, disagreements between authors were resolved through discussion, with the final decision being made by the senior author."

      "text": "This study reviewed the use of Fitbit devices in PA intervention studies across the life course. In addition to differences in study designs and intervention delivery methods, our results indicate considerable heterogeneity in Fitbit use within and between developmental stages. From early to older adulthood, most studies instructed participants to wear their Fitbit daily, either at all times or during waking hours, for the duration of the intervention. Studies conducted among children and adolescents tended to specify more limited device wear periods (eg, 24 hours for 7 days). Within developmental stages, our findings also suggest a lack of consistency in the definition of wear time criteria, which sometimes were used to report different adherence metrics or to exclude incomplete data from study analyses. A total of 8 different types of Fitbit devices were used across all age groups, with Fitbit Flex and Zip being the most predominant and some seemingly discontinuing use as newer devices became available. Regardless of intended Fitbit use (ie, measurement vs intervention tool), strategies to boost wear time were similar across stages, and the most commonly used strategies included sending participants reminders through texts or emails and asking participants to log their steps or sync their Fitbit data daily. Overall, the heterogeneity in Fitbit use across PA intervention studies reflects its relative novelty in the field of research. Across all stages, based on the taxonomy developed by Lyons et al  [95] , the most common behavior change techniques used were self-monitoring and goal setting, regardless of the intended device use. This aligns with previous findings indicating goal setting and self-monitoring as the most commonly used behavior change techniques in studies with activity trackers  [96] . As a self-monitoring technology, Fitbit devices provide real-time feedback that has the potential to stimulate behavior change. Self-monitoring allows participants to establish and track goals that were commonly operationalized through individual or group step count challenges. For example, a classroom-based study\n\nJMIR Mhealth Uhealth 2021 | vol. 9 | iss. 5 | e23411 | p. 25  https://mhealth.jmir.org/2021/5/e23411 (page number not for citation purposes) St Fleur et al JMIR MHEALTH AND UHEALTH XSL \u2022 FO RenderX in children used individual step goals consistent with achieving 60 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) per day  [23] . Additional behavioral change techniques appeared to be developmentally targeted. For example, among children, rewards for meeting step goals were often provided (eg, accruing points toward gift card balance). Through the use of social media platforms, adolescents and adults were provided with performance-based, web-based badges  [41, 97] . Among older adults, group-based PA education along with individual PA coaching or counseling provided social support to encourage the initiation and maintenance of behavior change  [89] .\n\nSimilar to behavior change techniques, the heterogeneity we observed regarding wear instructions and criteria also seemed to be because of developmental considerations. Most studies conducted among children and adolescents opted for instructions that required the device to be worn daily (8-24 hours) for a set data collection period (5-14 days); these studies did not set specific wear time criteria for inclusion in the analyses. Our findings align with previous results indicating a considerable reduction in the use of wearable trackers in youth following the first 2 weeks  [19, 98] . As such, limited device wear time in children and adolescents could potentially be a strategy that aims at capitalizing on wear patterns and usability trends in these groups. Studies conducted during early and middle adulthood tended to specify a minimum wear time criterion for inclusion in analyses based on specific numbers of steps or hours, in addition to daily wear instructions. However, studies conducted in older adults did not set minimum wear time criteria and instructed participants to wear the device daily during waking hours. The less rigid guidelines for device wear adherence among older adults could potentially be a way of increasing feasibility in populations who are less able to meet strict criteria and are less proficient in the use of technology  [99] .\n\nDespite the importance of meeting a minimum threshold of wear time criteria to calculate a reliable estimate of PA, the results from this review also indicated a lack of consistency in the criteria used to define adherence to device wear within developmental stages. A systematic review that examined the length of device wear time required in PA interventions found that most studies conducted among adults did not report minimum device wear and that there was significant variation among studies reporting these criteria  [22] . Corresponding to the lack of uniformity in wear time criteria, different metrics (eg, percentage, mean, and median) were used to report rates of adherence to wear instructions. If not met, the wear time criterion was sometimes used to exclude participants from the data analysis. However, many studies used the wear time criteria to report different metrics of adherence. Overall, the absence of clear reporting with standardized metrics significantly impaired efforts to assess overall adherence rates within developmental stages.\n\nThe most common pattern that emerged across studies was the use of reminder strategies to boost wear time, which did not differ by the intended device use (ie, intervention or measurement). Generally, texts and emails were sent on a daily or weekly basis as PA and Fitbit wear reminders. Manually logging or syncing Fitbit data on a daily basis was also a strategy to indirectly promote Fitbit wear on a daily basis. Results from previous studies indicate that, in addition to forgetting to wear their trackers  [100] , approximately 2% of study participants stopped using their devices each week altogether [101], and study participants also reported using their Fitbit less than 10% of the time following the end of wear-based incentives  [102] . Therefore, these strategies are particularly essential given the evidence regarding decrease in Fitbit wear adherence over time in users and the need for reminder strategies to boost wear time  [103] .\n\nDespite questions regarding the validity of Fitbits for assessing PA [104], most interventions in this review used Fitbit devices for both intervention and measurement purposes (39/75, 52%) or for data measurement purposes exclusively (15/75, 20%). Most studies (45/75, 63%) that were reviewed supplemented the use of Fitbit with additional objective (eg, accelerometers) or self-reported (eg, International PA Questionnaire) measures of PA. It is possible that the addition of other PA measures, even in studies that used Fitbit devices primarily as a measurement or data collection tool, was because of concerns about the uncertainty around the accuracy of measures provided by Fitbit devices  [104] . In addition, the use of other measures (ie, accelerometry or self-reporting) to collect baseline or habitual activity  [48]  could also point to the perceived inaccuracy of data collected from commercially available trackers, which could have a potential impact on activity. Previous studies have also shown that commercially available trackers such as Fitbit devices often overestimate the time spent in MVPA compared with research-grade monitors  [15, 104, 105] .\n\nHowever, the use of additional PA measures is not limited to addressing the accuracy issues. Results from a recent systematic review and meta-analysis of Fitbit-based interventions highlighted that the use of accelerometers and self-report, in addition to Fitbit, is often done to capture PA outcomes other than steps  [106] . With the expansion of the use of Fitbit devices in PA intervention studies, previous studies have raised issues regarding their inability to capture PA constructs such as nonambulatory activities or energy expenditure  [107] . In a recently published paper,  Balbim et al [108]  summarized the challenges and possible solutions to use Fitbit devices in mobile health intervention research. They described challenges and solutions at four different study phases: preparation, intervention delivery, data collection and analysis, and study closeout. For example, during the data collection phase, they point to the inaccuracy or unavailability of wear time data through Fitbit's web API. They then discussed the potential solution of using heart rate data and pre-established rules for determining wear time and manually identifying gaps in heart rate data, indicating nonwear time. They also highlight the tedious and challenging nature of such an endeavor  [108] . Thus, the use of additional PA measures (objective and subjective), despite increased burden on participants, allows for the efficient collection of different types of data, including valid wear time, information about body positions, sedentary behaviors, postural allocation, and the type of activity being performed  [107, [109] [110] [111] ."

      "text": "The primary limitation of this review is that the search for articles was restricted to articles available in the Fitabase library between 2012 and 2018 or on PubMed between 2019 and 2020. Given that the Fitabase library uses the systematic searching procedures of several databases (eg, PubMed, Google Scholar, and Science Direct), searching only PubMed for articles from 2019 to 2020 could have resulted in missed literature. In addition, this review was limited to intervention studies published in English and likely missed formative work that could provide important information regarding the design of Fitbit-based studies. Despite these limitations, this review provides insight into the current state of affairs in Fitbit use in research by focusing on different developmental stages and how the use of the device differs across those stages. Describing both study characteristics and the use of Fitbit devices provides insight into PA study designs across the lifespan and the different ways in which these monitoring devices are used."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "Insufficient PA across the lifespan is associated with an increased risk of numerous chronic diseases and is a major public health issue  [1] . The prominence and relatively low cost of Fitbit devices have increased their use by the public and researchers as PA trackers. Although behavior change techniques and strategies to boost Fitbit wear time were similar across all studies reviewed, our findings indicate significant differences in wear instructions and metrics for reporting adherence rates. Although between-stage differences appear to be based on developmental considerations that aim to maximize device use in each age group, within-group differences appear to result from a lack of uniformity in metrics used to report rates of adherence and minimum wear time criteria. The use of additional PA data collection tools in most studies that were reviewed points to the accuracy issues raised by previous research focusing on Fitbits in PA interventions  [104, 105]  and a reluctance to rely on Fitbits as the primary measurement device or for the assessment of habitual activity. However, additional PA measures are also used to capture PA constructs not measured by Fitbit devices (eg, MVPA, sedentary behaviors, and types of activity). As the use of monitoring devices continues to expand in the field of PA research, the lack of uniformity in study protocols and metrics of reported measures represents a major issue for purposes of comparison  [112] . Given that clinical trial registries serve as a repository for researchers  [113] , there is a need for increased transparency in the prospective registration of PA intervention studies. This paper serves as a call for researchers using Fitbit devices to provide a clear rationale for the use of several PA measures and to specify the metrics that will be reported for each. By providing researchers with a synthesis of information on the use of Fitbit devices in PA intervention studies across the life course, this narrative review serves as a resource that may be used to inform the design of future trials involving Fitbit devices."
