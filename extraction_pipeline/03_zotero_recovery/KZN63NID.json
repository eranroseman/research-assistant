  "abstract": "Our aims were to examine: (1) classes of comorbid disorders in a sample of children and adolescents with Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD), (2) how these classes relate to obsessive-compulsive symptom dimensions, and (3) the extent to which obsessive-compulsive symptom dimensions predict Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT) outcome. Participants (N = 269) were assessed with the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia (K-SADS-PL) and the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS). Latent Class Analysis (LCA) was used to identify comorbidity classes. Regression analyses were used to evaluate symptom dimensions as predictors of treatment outcome and their relation to comorbidity classes. Comorbidity was included in the treatment outcome analyses as it can affect outcome. Comorbidity was best categorized by a three-class model and each class was distinctively correlated with the OCD symptom dimensions. Higher scores on the symmetry/hoarding factor increased the chance of responding to CBT by an odds ratio of 1.56 (p = 0.020) when controlled for age, gender, and comorbidity class. The harm/sexual factor (p = 0.675) and contamination/ cleaning factor (p = 0.122) did not predict CBT outcome. Three clinically relevant comorbidity subgroups in pediatric OCD were identified. Patients who exhibited higher levels of symmetry/hoarding dimension were more prone to respond to CBT. \n Introduction Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a debilitating psychiatric disorder with a prevalence rate between 0.",

      "text": "of patients do not benefit from treatment, or only achieve partial response  (\u00d6st et al., 2016; Pediatric OCD Treatment Study (POTS)    Team, 2004; Rosa-Alc\u00e1zar et al., 2015; Skarphedinsson et al., 2015; Watson and Rees, 2008) .\n\nConsiderable effort has been put into identifying distinct symptom dimensions within OCD. Most of this work has been based on adult samples and factor analysis of the Yale Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS)  (Scahill et al., 1997) . Most often, three to five symptom dimensions have been identified, with a four-dimensional structure consisting of 1) symmetry, repeating, ordering and counting related symptoms 2) forbidden thoughts and checking compulsions, 3) cleaning and contamination related symptoms and 4) hoarding obsessions and compulsions, being the most widely replicated  (Bloch et al., 2008) . A few studies have investigated OCD symptom dimensions as predictors of treatment effect in adults, although with somewhat mixed results. Overall, results tended to show a less favorable outcome for patients with hoarding and sexual/religious obsessions and a more favorable outcome for those with washing and checking compulsions  (Abramowitz et al., 2003; Landeros-Weisenberger et al., 2010; Mataix-Cols et al., 2002; Rufer et al., 2006; Saxena et al., 2002; Williams et al., 2014 Williams et al., , 2013)) . In children and adolescents, research has been more limited and most studies based on the predefined Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS) categories  (Bernstein et al., 2013; Delorme et al., 2006; Mataix-Cols et al., 2008; McKay et al., 2006; Stewart et al., 2007) . However, in a recent study based on individual CY-BOCS items, OCD symptoms were grouped into three dimensions labeled: (a) harm/sexual, (b) symmetry/hoarding, and (c) contamination/cleaning  (H\u00f8jgaard et al., 2017) . No studies have investigated the three item-level based pediatric OCD symptom dimensions' association with treatment outcome. However, we found only one pediatric study that investigated symptom dimensions as predictors of CBT response but in this study five-factor analytically derived symptom dimensions (symmetry \u2044 ordering, contamination \u2044 cleaning, sexual \u2044 religious obsessions, aggressive \u2044 checking, and hoarding) were investigated  (Storch et al., 2008a) . The authors reported no difference in treatment outcome based on OCD symptom type when using the CY-BOCS severity score as the outcome measure. However, aggressive and checking symptoms predicted improved outcome when measured with the Clinical Global Impression -Severity scale.\n\nIn pediatric OCD, comorbid disorders are common  (Alvarenga et al., 2016; Torp et al., 2015b) , with up to 80% of patients having at least one comorbid disorder  (Ivarsson et al., 2008) . One previous study examined whether OCD subgroups with distinguishable patterns of comorbid disorders exist in a mixed sample of adults and children  (Nestadt et al., 2009) . In that study, the authors found comorbid disorders to cluster in three distinct groups predominantly characterized by: (i) Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), (ii) tic disorders, and (iii) Panic Disorder (PD) plus affective syndromes. No study, to our knowledge, has examined the relationship between symptom dimensions and comorbidity patterns derived from class analysis. However, one pediatric study was found that examined the association of OCD symptom dimensions with predefined types of comorbidity  (Ortiz et al., 2016) . The authors reported that neurodevelopmental comorbidity was associated with a high rate of symmetry and ordering symptoms often thought to indicate a tic-related subtype of OCD  (Leckman et al., 2009) . A few studies have investigated the relationship of individual comorbid disorders with OCD symptom dimensions, in children and adolescents  (H\u00f8jgaard et al., 2017; Torres et al., 2016)  as well as in adults  (Hasler et al., 2005) , albeit with mixed results. In children and adolescents, one study found a significant correlation between factor scores on the symmetry/hoarding symptom dimension and comorbid depression and anxiety disorders, as well as between factor scores on the harm/sexual symptom dimension and anxiety disorders. The study also reported a negative correlation of contamination/cleaning symptoms with tic disorder and ADHD  (H\u00f8jgaard et al., 2017) . Another study with a mixed pediatric and adult sample found a more complex relationship between comorbid disorders and OCD symptom factors, although ADHD and tic disorders correlated with hoarding symptoms and no comorbidity was correlated with the symmetry/ordering dimension  (Torres et al., 2016) . To understand the extent to which certain types of OCD symptoms are related to treatment outcome, comorbidity needs to be accounted for as it as it may modify the relations between OCD symptoms and treatment outcome. Studies that investigate OCD symptom dimensions in relation to treatment outcome are lacking and no studies have investigated comorbidity classes in pediatric samples.\n\nTherefore, the aims of the present study were: (1) to examine classes of comorbid disorders in a sample of children and adolescents with OCD, (2) to investigate how these classes relate to obsessive-compulsive symptom dimensions found in a previous study  (H\u00f8jgaard et al., 2017) , and (3) to investigate the extent to which obsessive-compulsive symptom dimensions predict CBT outcome."

      "text": "A total of 269 7 -17 year old children and adolescents from Denmark, Sweden, and Norway were recruited between September 2008 and May 2012 and included in the Nordic Long-Term Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Treatment Study (NordLOTS)  (Thomsen et al., 2013; Torp et al., 2015b) . Patients were included in the study if they had an OCD diagnosis based on the DSM-IV criteria, assessed with the Kiddie Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia instrument (K-SADS-PL), a CY-BOCS total severity score of \u2265 16, and had not been treated with CBT within six months prior to study start. Exclusion criteria were kept to a minimum but included the presence of another psychiatric disorder with a higher treatment priority and a Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD) other than Pervasive Developmental Disorder-Not Otherwise Specified (PDD NOS). PDD-NOS was allowed if OCD was considered to be the primary disorder. Patients with ADHD were allowed if treatment for ADHD had been stabilized at least three months prior to study start. Previous studies on this sample have reported outcome from CBT  (Torp et al., 2015b) , and found that children and adolescents who were older had higher OCD severity, more functional impairment, higher rates of internalizing and externalizing symptoms, and more symptoms of anxiety and depression before treatment had significantly poorer outcomes, with only age remaining a significant predictor in a multivariate model  (Torp et al., 2015a) . Additionally, children and adolescents with OCD and co-morbid tic symptoms were found to differ from those without tic symptoms in several aspects of clinical presentation, although not in their response to CBT  (H\u00f8jgaard et al., 2016) .\n\nWritten informed consent was obtained from all subjects and the trial was approved by the Norwegian, Swedish and Danish Committees for Medical and Health Research Ethics and the Medical Products Agencies."

In the remaining 6 sessions, the child was seen with the parents for the full session.

The CY-BOCS has been shown to be reliable and valid in samples of children with OCD  (Scahill et al., 2014; Storch et al., 2004) . In the NordLOTS, the intra-class correlation coefficients (ICC) of inter-rater agreement were: obsessions ICC = 0.94 (95% CI 0.85-0.97), compulsions ICC = 0.87 (95% CI 0.67-0.93), and total score ICC = 0.92 (95% CI 0.78-0.97) (Torp et al., 2015b) ."

K-SADS-PL diagnoses were entered as dichotomous variables in the LCA model and 1 to 6 class solutions were tested and compared. Estimates of fit were based on a range of indices, and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) and Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) were used to compare models, where smaller values of AIC and BIC were indicative of a better fit  (Akaike, 1974; Schwarz, 1978) . However, since a lower BIC value infers a superior trade-off between the fit and complexity of the model  (Nestadt et al., 2009) , we preferred to use BIC when selecting the best solution. The robust maximum likelihood (MLR) estimator was used to obtain the AIC and BIC. Entropy is an index of the orderliness of the classifications and beneficial in describing the model. An Entropy value approaching 1 indicates clear delineation of the model classes  (Celeux and Soromenho, 1996) .\n\nTo assess the relationship of CY-BOCS factor scores with age, gender, and K-SADS-PL classes, binary logistic regression was used. In these analysis the CY-BOCS factor scores were compared between each K-SADS-PL class against the remaining two K-SADS-PL classes combined. The CY-BOCS factor scores were entered together as predictors. CY-BOCS factor scores for all participants were extracted from a previous study by  H\u00f8jgaard et al. (2016) , which included this sample as a subsample. Factor scores were calculated by use of regression and were standardized for this study to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1.\n\nPredictors of treatment outcome (age, gender, K-SADS-PL classes and CY-BOCS factors) were at first investigated individually with bivariate regression models with OCD severity and responder status as outcome (Table  5 ). Multivariate logistic regression was then used to estimate the effect of OCD symptom dimensions (CY-BOCS factor scores) on CBT outcome when dichotomized as responders and nonresponders. CBT response was defined as a CY-BOCS score \u2264 15 corresponding to mild symptoms of OCD  (Torp et al., 2015b) . Age, gender, and K-SADS-PL classes were controlled for by entering all information into the model in one step and subsequently the CY-BOCS factor scores for all factors in another step.\n\nIn order to assess the effect on the CY-BOCS factor scores on CBT outcome measured as a change in CY-BOCS severity, we used hierarchical multivariate linear regression. The CY-BOCS severity change was calculated by subtracting the CY-BOCS score after CBT from the pre-treatment CY-BOCS score. Predictor variables were entered into the model in two blocks with age, gender, and K-SADS-PL classes entered in block one and the CY-BOCS factors in block two. This was done in order to estimate the effect of the CY-BOCS factors after controlling for the effects of age, gender, and comorbid class. Of the 269 patients included in the study, 26 did not complete the CY-BOCS assessment post-CBT. As previously published data show, missing data were assumed to be missing at random  (Torp et al., 2015a) , and therefore excluded from analysis.\n\nStatistical analyses were performed with SPSS 22 (IBM Corp, 2013), with the exception of the LCA, which was performed in Mplus version 7.4  (Muth\u00e9n and Muth\u00e9n, 2007) ."

As can be seen in Table  1  the three-class model had the lowest/highest BIC value. The three-class model consisted of a class characterized by a predominance of ADHD, CD, ODD, Tourette's Disorder, and Tic Disorder. Another class was characterized by an overweight of Separation Anxiety, Specific Phobia, Social Phobia, and Generalized Anxiety. The third class consisted of patients with no comorbid disorders."

Patients with higher scores on the symmetry/hoarding dimension were more likely to be in comorbidity class 1 or 2, while higher scores on the harm/sexual dimension predicted comorbidities from K-SADS-PL class 2.

Patients with higher scores on the harm/sexual dimension were more likely to have had OCD onset after the age of 12.

Comorbidity classes and gender did not predict CBT response in the multivariate analysis.\n\nThe results of the multivariate linear regression with OCD severity change as dependent indicated that the model explained 6.1% of the variance (R 2 = 0.061, F(6,242) = 2.58, p = 0.020), with the OCD symptom dimensions alone explaining 3.5% of the variance (R 2 = 0.035, F(3,236) = 2.94, p = 0.034). The symmetry/hoarding dimension significantly predicted OCD severity change across CBT (\u03b2 = -1.48, t(242) = -2.38, p = 0.018), when controlling for the effect of gender, age, and comorbidity class. variable. Neither the harm/ sexual dimension (\u03b2 = 0.74, t(242) = -1.28, p = 0.202), nor the contamination/cleaning dimension (\u03b2 = 0.30, t(242) = 0.53, p = 0.598) predicted OCD severity change. Supplementary analyses showed that the symmetry/hoarding dimension did not correlate significantly with pre-treatment severity r(267) = 0.10, p = 0.102, indicating that the OCD severity change was not a result of a higher pre-treatment score thus allowing for a greater change. As in the multivariate logistic regression, age was the only controlled dimension that significantly predicted CBT outcome when measured as a change in OCD severity (\u03b2 = 0.46, t(242) = 2.33, p = 0.021), indicating a slightly reduced benefit from CBT with increasing age. Comorbidity classes also did not predict CBT outcome (\u03b2 = -1.07, t(242) = -1.58, p = 0.116) when measured as change in the CY-BOCS score."

      "text": "Although some effort has been put into investigating the differential effect of OCD symptom dimensions on CBT outcome in adults, such research is limited in pediatric samples and no study has investigated the pattern of comorbid disorders in pediatric OCD using LCA. In this study, we investigated the comorbidity pattern in a group of children and adolescents with OCD and examined if OCD symptom dimensions based on a previously found three-factor model predicted CBT outcome. Our results indicated that the symmetry/hoarding symptom dimension predicts CBT outcome, as patients with higher scores on this dimension benefitted more from CBT, when we corrected for age, comorbidity class and scores on other symptom dimensions. This effect did not seem to be the result of a higher baseline score allowing a greater change. Furthermore, comorbidity was best described with a three-class model with the classes showing a distinct correlation to the symptom dimensions further strengthening the three-class solution.\n\nThe three clinically meaningful comorbidity classes identified included one class of patients with comorbid disorders usually emerging in childhood characterized by neurodevelopmental disorders, such as, ADHD and tic disorders, a second class which contained patients with comorbid anxiety-related disorders, and a third class containing patients without comorbidity. Interestingly, depressive disorders did not seem to be a defining factor in the class analysis as the split between the two comorbidity classes, possibly indicating depression to be secondary to the defining disorders in each class (Table  3 ). Also, since ADHD and tics are not per se externalizing behaviors, but rather the expression of response inhibition dysfunctions we chose not to use the internalizing/ externalizing distinction for the comorbidity classes. These findings are difficult to compare with previous results  (Nestadt et al., 2009) , as the previous study did not include comorbid ADHD in the study sample as ADHD appears to be a strong distinguisher of class one, along with tic disorders in our study. Also, the study by Nestadt et al. reported higher comorbidity rates, possibly because they included probable diagnoses for most disorders while in our sample only definite disorders were included. In the present study, a third class consisting of patients without comorbid disorders was found but this may resemble one of the classes in the Nestadt et al. study consisting of patients with low rates of comorbidity  (Nestadt et al., 2009) .\n\nOur findings indicated that children and adolescents who scored  Class 3, free from comorbid disorders higher on the symmetry/hoarding dimension were generally at higher risk for comorbid disorders as they were more frequently associated with the comorbidity classes 1 (characterized by neurodevelopmental disorders) and 2 (characterized by anxiety disorders). This is in line with previous research, which found hoarding to be associated with higher levels of comorbidity  (Torres et al., 2016) . However, the previous and present results are not directly comparable, as the pediatric OCD symptom dimensions investigated in the present study included symmetry as well as hoarding in one of the dimensions, and therefore the present study did not investigate the specific effect of hoarding symptoms. As previously shown in an adult sample  (Hasler et al., 2005; Prabhu et al., 2013) , we also found a higher risk of comorbidity related to anxiety and depression (class 2) for those with high scores on the harm/sexual dimension. Further, patients who scored high on this dimension were also less likely to have an early age of onset, but this could be an expression of sexual thoughts emerging in adolescence. Interestingly, patients with higher scores on the contamination/ cleaning dimension did show a reduced risk of belonging to any of the comorbidity classes, despite the fact that none of the symptom dimensions were significantly associated with the comorbidity class 3 (no comorbidity). These results are in line with family-genetic studies that have provided some evidence that pediatric-onset OCD is etiologically heterogeneous  (Leckman et al., 2009) . Specifically, our results provide partial support for a tic-related subtype with the symmetry/hoarding symptoms correlating to comorbidity class 1 as seen in many although not all previous studies  (H\u00f8jgaard et al., 2016; Leckman et al., 1997; Storch et al., 2008b) . Identical results were obtained whether we used the binary CBT response definition (responders vs. non-responders) or the continuous OCD severity change measured with the CY-BOCS, when we estimated the possible differences in treatment outcome based on symptom dimensions. Both analyses indicated that patients who scored higher on the symmetry/hoarding dimension had an increased chance of better CBT outcome, that is, a 56% increased chance of responding to treatment. It was important to correct for comorbidity as it might interact with symptom dimensions and affect treatment outcome. This result is somewhat in contrast to previous studies on adults that show increased hoarding symptoms to be predictive of a worse CBT outcome  (Abramowitz et al., 2003; Mataix-Cols et al., 2002; Rufer et al., 2006) . However, studies have generally not found symptoms of symmetry and ordering to predict CBT outcome  (Abramowitz et al., 2003; Mataix-Cols et al., 2002) . Symptoms of hoarding and symmetry are combined in the symmetry/hoarding dimension in our study making comparisons difficult. A possible explanation that we did not find the hoarding dimension to be predictive of a less favorable treatment outcome is that the young sample in this study might have less symptoms and/or disability caused by hoarding compared with older patients, or their hoarding symptoms are less severe. It may be assumed that parents have a significant influence on hoarding behavior of children making assessment of hoarding symptoms difficult in this age group. Further studies of samples with young participants are needed to determine whether specific symptom subgroups within this dimension such as symmetry and ordering are causing the positive association with better CBT response, for example by overriding any negative effect of hoarding symptoms. In concurrence with  Storch et al. 2008 , we did not find other symptom dimensions predictive of CBT outcome measured with the CY-BOCS.\n\nThe present study had several strengths. It was the largest study to date to investigate the effect of OCD symptom dimensions on CBT outcome, and the first to investigate the presence of distinct patterns of comorbidity in children and adolescents with OCD. However, limitations to this study include limited generalizability, since the study was based on a homogenous Scandinavian sample. Also, as OCD symptom dimensions are overlapping rather than mutually exclusive, we were not able to investigate possible between-group differences. However, the inclusion of mutually overlapping symptom dimensions are  considered more ecologically valid (contrary to mutually exclusive symptom categories), as most patients have symptoms belonging to more than one dimension. Finally, we haven't evaluated the inter-rater reliability of our K-SADS-PL administration. A future study will report these results. The results from this study indicate that CBT is effective across OCD symptom dimensions. Future research should be aimed at replicating these finding and to investigate the effect of symptom dimensions on different treatment formats."
