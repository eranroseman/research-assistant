  "title": "Cost-effectiveness of Financial Incentives for Patients and Physicians to Manage Low-Density Lipoprotein Cholesterol Levels",
  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE Financial incentives shared between physicians and patients were shown to significantly reduce low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels in a randomized clinical trial, but it is not known whether these health benefits are worth the added incentive and utilization costs required to achieve them. \n OBJECTIVE To evaluate the long-term cost-effectiveness of financial incentives on LDL-C level control. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS In this economic evaluation, a previously validated microsimulation computer model was parameterized using individual-level data from the randomized clinical trial on financial incentives, National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys for model population inputs, and other published sources. The study was conducted from April 15, 2016, to March 29, 2018. INTERVENTIONS The following interventions were used: (1) usual care, (2) trial control strategy (increased cholesterol level monitoring and use of electronic pill bottles), (3) financial incentives for physicians, (4) financial incentives for patients, and (5) incentives shared between physicians and patients. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Discounted costs (2017 US dollars), lifetime cardiovascular disease risk, quality-adjusted life-years (QALYs), and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). \n RESULTS The model population (n = 1 000 000 [30.7% women]) had similar mean (SD) age (61.5 [11.9] years) and LDL-C level (153.9 mg/dL) as the observed trial population (n = 1503 [42.7% women]; age, 62.0 [8.7] years; and LDL-C level, 160.6 mg/dL). Using base-case assumptions (including a 10-year waning period of LDL-C level reductions), the usual-care strategy was dominated (higher costs and lower QALYs) by all other strategies. Strategies for physician-or patient-only incentives were dominated by the shared-incentives strategy, which had an ICER of $60 000/QALY compared with the trial control strategy. In a sensitivity analysis regarding the duration of LDL-C level reductions, the shared-incentives strategy remained cost-effective (ICERs <$100 000/QALY and <$150 000/QALY) for scenarios with LDL-C level reductions lasting, with linear waning, at least 7 and 5 years, respectively. In the 1-way sensitivity analysis for the time horizon of the analysis, the ICER of the shared-incentives strategy exceeded $100 000/QALY at 11 years and $150 000/QALY at 8 years. In probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the shared-incentives intervention was cost-effective in 69% to 77% of iterations using cost-effectiveness thresholds of $100 000 to $150 000/QALY. Costeffectiveness results were also sensitive to the duration of intervention costs. (continued) Key Points Question Are reductions in cardiovascular disease risk produced by financial incentives placed on patients, physicians, or both to control low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels worth the costs needed to achieve these health benefits? Findings In this model-based economic evaluation, incentives shared between patients and physicians had an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio of $60 000/quality-adjusted life-year. However, this result was sensitive to assumptions around the durations of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level reductions and incentive payments. Meaning Shared incentives between patients and physicians appear to provide reasonable value (<$100 000/ quality-adjusted life-year) for the health gains that they produce, although longer-term demonstrations are needed to show how long these low-density lipoprotein cholesterol level reductions persist.",

      "text": "High cholesterol level is a leading risk factor for mortality and morbidity.  1 Statins are effective and cost-effective medications for improving cholesterol levels and cardiovascular disease outcomes, but many patients for whom statins are indicated do not receive prescriptions for them, and the longterm adherence rate for patients who have received prescriptions is below 50%.  [2] [3] 3] [4] [5]  Reducing population cardiovascular disease risk is within reach, but improving cholesterol levels will require behavior changes from physicians, patients, or both.\n\nFinancial incentives, such as pay-for-performance policies, have shown mixed results in changing physician or patient behaviors and improving health outcomes.  [6] [7] 7] [8]  Asch et al  9  conducted a 4-arm randomized clinical trial and found that financial incentives shared between physicians and patients were superior at reducing low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) levels compared with no financial incentives, and superior to financial incentives delivered to physicians or patients alone.\n\nThe trial made innovative use of principles of behavioral economics and electronic pill bottle technology to enhance the effect of financial incentives,  10  but left unanswered whether the LDL-C level reductions represented good value given the added costs of the financial incentives, electronic pill bottles, and increased use of statins.\n\nHealth care payers should consider long-term health and cost outcomes when evaluating the value of quality improvement interventions. Therefore, our objective was to use a previously developed and validated cardiovascular disease microsimulation model to evaluate the costeffectiveness of financial incentives to physicians, patients, or both on LDL-C level reductions based on the findings from the Asch et al  9  trial. The control group in the trial also received electronic pill bottles and increased monitoring (4 annual lipid level measurements per trial protocol compared with 1 per year per current lipid guidelines) and experienced sustained LDL-C level reductions in the 15-month follow-up period. Because the control group in the trial did not correspond to usual care, we also included a virtual usual-care group in our cost-effectiveness analysis that did not include these elements."

      "text": "We used the previously developed Cardiovascular Disease Policy Model for Risk, Events, Detection, Interventions, Costs, and Trends (CVD PREDICT) Model to simulate long-term discounted health and cost consequences (2017 US dollars) of financial incentives for cholesterol level control based on data from the Asch et al  9  randomized clinical trial and other published sources (Table  1 ).  [11] [12] 2] [13]  We included a lifetime horizon in our base-case analysis and performed our analysis from a health care payer perspective; we varied the time horizon in a 1-way sensitivity analysis, recognizing that some payers could care about shorter time frames. Per cost-effectiveness analysis modeling recommendations, the model time horizon should be long enough to capture all relevant health and cost outcomes.  14 erefore, although we assumed varying durations of LDL-C level reductions given the 12-month intervention in the Asch et al  9  trial (with follow-up to 15 months), all relevant long-term health outcomes were captured using longer-term (including lifetime in the base-case analysis) model time The model simulated cardiovascular disease progression and events for individuals drawn from a subset of the representative National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANESs) population,  13  defined using the eligibility criteria from the Asch et al 9 trial. Each individual was simulated through 5 possible strategies: (1) usual care (ie, a virtual control group), (2) the trial control group (which included use of electronic pill bottles and increased monitoring), (3) patient incentives, (4) physician incentives, and (5) shared incentives to patients and physicians. We evaluated the trade-offs between health gains and increased health care spending among these strategies using cost-effectiveness analysis.\n\nThe Asch et al  9   by strategy-specific levels of LDL-C level reductions, which affected the risk of cardiovascular disease events in the model and were ultimately associated with the differences in the quality-adjusted life expectancies across strategies. Incremental costs across strategies were primarily driven by strategyspecific incentive payments and cost differences from averted cardiovascular disease events."

      "text": "The full description and validation of the CVD PREDICT Model have been published elsewhere.  13 The\n\nPREDICT model is an individual-level state-transition (ie, a microsimulation) model with the following general disease states: disease free, coronary heart disease (divided into myocardial infarction, angina, and cardiac arrest health states), and stroke. Individuals in the model in cardiovascular disease states experience higher mortality risks, lower quality of life, and higher costs relative to those in the disease-free health state. Individuals can experience multiple cardiovascular disease events in the model, which have added acute and chronic health and cost outcomes. The risk of experiencing cardiovascular disease events depends on traditional risk factors (age, sex, smoking status, diabetes history, blood pressure level, cholesterol level, and prior cardiovascular disease history) with further adjustments for treatment status. The model was populated by weighted sampling (with replacement) of individuals from the 2005-2006, 2007-2008, 2009-2010, and 2011-2012 NHANES surveys subset for the Asch et al 9 trial eligibility criteria: history of cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, or stroke) with LDL-C level greater than 120 mg/dL (to convert to millimoles per liter, multiply by 0.0259) (high-risk Figure 1.

Each individual was run through each strategy one at a time.\n\n6. Lifetime discounted health effects (QALYs) and costs accrued under each strategy were compared in incremental cost-effectiveness analyses. The schematic provides an overview of the model population (steps 1 and 2), modeling approach (steps 3-5), and cost-effectiveness analysis (step 6). Individuals started the microsimulation model (step 5) in either the no cardiovascular disease (CVD), chronic coronary heart disease (CHD), or chronic stroke health states depending on their disease participants), history of diabetes with LDL-C level greater than 120 mg/dL (also considered high-risk participants), 10-year coronary heart disease risk greater than 20%, or 10-year coronary heart disease risk greater than 10% with LDL-C level greater than 140 mg/dL (medium-risk participants).\n\nAll individuals with a history of cancer were excluded.  15 e CVD PREDICT Model is an individual-level state transition model (ie, a microsimulation model) programmed in Visual C++ 2005 (Microsoft Corp) that uses yearly model cycles. The model updated cardiovascular risk factors (age, total and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, systolic blood pressure, and diabetes status) using previously developed regressions based on NHANES data.  13 These risk factors were used to estimate the annual risks of cardiovascular disease events (coronary heart disease [cardiac arrest, myocardial infarction, angina] and stroke). These events had acute (ie, 1-year) and postacute (ie, all subsequent years) mortality, morbidity, and health care costs."

Therefore, we included in our analysis a virtual control group in which individuals did not experience additional changes in cardiovascular risk outside of the usual annual risk factor updates that occur in the background of the CVD PREDICT Model (some of these individuals would also be taking statins, based on national averages and adherence). These risk factor updates were included for all strategies evaluated in the cost-effectiveness analysis."

We used the observed 15-month LDL-C level reductions to long-term cardiovascular disease risk reductions in our model, which we assumed to wane over time. Specifically, when varying the duration of LDL-C level reduction, we assumed a linear decline of LDL-C level reduction from the end of the first year of the model to a future year (2-30 years) with corresponding adjustments to relative risks for coronary heart disease and stroke. We used a 10-year waning period in our base-case analysis, based on the 10-year decline of treatment outcome for secondary end points (weight, waist circumference, and glycated hemoglobin levels) from the Look AHEAD trial.  16  tested the association between this assumption and cost-effectiveness results in sensitivity analyses. LDL-C level reductions 15 months from baseline in the Asch et al  9  trial ranged from 25.4 mg/dL for the trial control group to 33.0 mg/dL in the shared-incentives group; these absolute LDL-C level reductions were approximately normally distributed among trial participants. In the model-based analyses, we drew individual-level LDL-C level reductions from these normal distributions and converted them to relative risks for coronary heart disease (0.77 per 38.7-mg/dL reduction) and stroke (0.83 per 38.7-mg/dL reduction) based on a large meta-analysis of statin trials. 2 These relative risks were used to update annual risks of coronary heart disease and stroke in the microsimulation model.

When the duration of LDL-C level benefits was 5 years (eFigure 4 in the Supplement), the shared-incentives and trial control strategies were optimal in 27% and 65% of iterations, respectively, using a costeffectiveness threshold of $100 000/QALY and 52% and 35% of iterations, respectively, using a cost-effectiveness threshold of $150 000/QALY. a Costs (2017 US dollars) were discounted at 3% annual rate.\n\nb The physician-incentives group had a higher ICER than the shared-incentives group, which is more effective; therefore, the physician-incentives group is weakly dominated and the shared-incentives strategy ICER is compared with the trial control group, per the accepted methods of incremental cost-effectiveness analysis. 0 1 2 3 4 5 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 24 23 25 26 27 28 29 30 30 29 28 27 26 25 24 23 22 20 21 19 18 17 16 15 14 13 12 11 10 9 8 7 6 5 4 Years of Treatment Effect Years of Intervention Costs Included 1 2 3 6 7 8 9 10 ICER <$50 000/QALY ICER $50 000 to <$100 000/QALY ICER $100 000-$200 000/QALY ICER >$200 000/QALY ICER implausible The regions show combinations of values by color that resulted in ICERs (2017 US dollars) for the sharedincentives strategy compared with the trial control strategy per quality-adjusted life-year (QALY).

      "text": "The shared-incentives strategy was most likely to be optimal using a willingness-to-pay threshold (2017 US dollars) of $100 000/quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) (69% of probabilistic sensitivity analysis iterations) followed by trial control strategy (18% of probabilistic sensitivity analysis iterations).\n\nIn our model-based incremental cost-effectiveness analysis, we found that financial incentives shared between physicians and patients for LDL-C level control produced intermediate value ($60 000/QALY) as defined by the ACC-AHA value framework (ICER $50 000-150 000/QALY) compared with strategies that included financial incentives to either patients or physicians alone and compared with clinical strategies that did not include financial incentives.  22, 23 These base-case results were cost-effective given current US benchmarks for cost-effectiveness (threshold of $100 000/QALY or $150 000/QALY), but these results were sensitive to the duration of the LDL-C level reduction beyond the intervention.\n\nOur base-case analysis assumed a 10-year LDL-C level reduction with linear waning based largely on the Look AHEAD trial, which was the only related trial (for an incentives or lifestyle intervention) that had long-term follow-up (11.5 years) for a shorter-term intervention (6 months to 4 years).  16 A 2012 review by Jeffery  24  found that sustained weight loss after financial incentive interventions has been poor, although these studies have typically not been as long (12-month intervention) with their follow-up (3 months) as the Asch et al  9  trial. The long-run duration of LDL-C level reductions could affect the cost-effectiveness of the shared-incentives strategy. If LDL-C level reductions persisted, with linear waning, for 7 years, the ICER remained below $100 000/QALY and if they persisted for 5 years, the ICER remained below $150 000/QALY. The Asch et al trial followed up patients an additional 3 months after the 12-month intervention was stopped and found no change in the LDL-C level reductions. If these reductions do not wane over time, the sharedincentives strategy had a low ICER ($5900/QALY).\n\nPrevious model-based studies have found that statin regimen initiation in eligible individuals (with 10-year cardiovascular disease risk >7.5%, which is a lower-risk group than the population evaluated in this study) met conventional cost-effectiveness standards using generic statin prices.  3, 25 or medication adherence remains a challenge, however, driven by patient-, physician-, and system-related factors.  4 Our study shows that shared financial incentives could be a cost-effective intervention to improve cholesterol level control among high-risk patients. The use of more advanced technologies to guide statin initiation (eg, coronary artery calcium level scoring or genetic test information) or treat high cholesterol levels (eg, proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 inhibitors) have been found to exceed conventional cost-effectiveness thresholds (ICERs >$150 000/QALY).  [26] [27] 7] [28]  Because statins are effective, inexpensive at generic prices, and relatively safe, the most cost-effective interventions in cholesterol management will be strategies that improve medication adherence.  29"

      "title": "Limitations and Strengths",
      "text": "Our study has several limitations. First, the model extrapolates the observed findings from the Asch et al 9 trial into future years, in addition to background changes in cardiovascular disease risk factors.\n\nThese assumptions are needed to generate lifetime estimates of QALYs and costs (the recommended time horizon for cost-effectiveness analyses) and are common for model-based cost-effectiveness analyses based on typical clinical trial follow-up (eg, 12 months).  14, 23, 25 We therefore focused our sensitivity analyses on assumptions, such as the duration of LDL-C level reductions, on which projections of trial results are dependent. Second, the findings from the Asch et al trial were from a selected population and might have been more optimistic than results that could be expected in practice owing to observer effects and other deviations from routine care. Those effects, however, likely also apply to the control group in the Asch et al trial and so the net effect is likely to be small and the direction of such bias is hard to estimate. Third, we performed our analysis from a health care payer perspective. From a societal perspective, incentives payments would be viewed as transfer costs (money changing hands without resource use), which would result in more favorable ICERs for the incentive strategies. Because payers will ultimately decide whether to implement pay-for-performance programs, we used a payer perspective in our study. Fourth, the per-person QALY differences were small, but so were the corresponding cost differences, thus requiring a cost-effectiveness analysis to weigh these tradeoffs. On a population level, these differences would translate to important health and cost outcomes given the national prevalence of the targeted population. Fifth, financial incentive policies can lead to gaming and other distortive behaviors. We modeled these effects to the extent that they were captured in the Asch et al  9  trial, but we did not model any additional adjustments given the lack of data in the published literature to quantify these effects.\n\nThis study also has strengths. Our model incorporated original data from a large prospective trial, it was based on credible assumptions about the effects drawn from a larger amount of literature and a comprehensive meta-analysis, it was executed through a validated cardiovascular disease simulation model, and its findings are largely sustained through extensive sensitivity analyses. Given both the promise of the intervention and the importance of duration of LDL-C level reductions on our model-based results, we believe a large-scale demonstration for the shared-incentives strategy with at least 5 years of follow-up is warranted by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services or private health care payers to test this strategy in a real-world setting."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "Our cost-effectiveness analysis answered an important residual question from the Asch et al 9 trial: were the LDL-C level reductions produced by financial incentives shared between physicians and patients worth the added incentive and utilization costs? Our model-based analyses showed that financial incentives shared between patients and physicians for LDL-C level control met conventional standards of cost-effectiveness. However, these results were sensitive to assumptions about the durations of LDL-C level reductions and years of intervention costs included, prompting the need for a larger, longer-term, real-world demonstration to assess the likelihood that a shared-incentives strategy could be adopted and shown to be effective on a widespread basis."
