      "text": "Hospitalization is a common occurrence for older adults; approximately 6.8 million Medicare seniors experience an admission for acute care in any given year  [1] [2] [3] . This is often a sentinel event in the overall health trajectory of older adults that is complicated by functional impairment  [4, 5] , skilled nursing facility placement  [6, 7] , and reduced physical activity after discharge  [8] .\n\nLow physical activity during hospitalization is largely viewed as a temporary inconvenience that should not affect overall functional ability or outcomes such as nursing home placement and that patients should return to their previous activity level soon after they return home without lingering physical activity changes. Recent research, however, suggests disruptions of basic activities of daily life such as physical activity (getting out of bed and walking) may be \"traumatic\"  [9]  or \"toxic\"  [10]  to older adults with long-term post-hospital effects  [11] . An important gap in the literature is precise data on how much reduced physical activity is noxious and how much physical activity after hospital discharge is needed to protect against adverse outcomes.\n\nAdequate physical activity post-hospitalization is a key component of functional recovery and participation in society  [12] . Currently, little evidence exists on best ways to promote physical activity post-hospitalization. Multiple studies demonstrate that walking and the use of step-goals are helpful for increasing physical activity in healthy adults  [13] [14] [15] ; however, the post-hospitalized patient population may benefit from motivation beyond step-goals.\n\nIn previous work, our group has successfully used gamification and principles of behavioral economics to motivate changes such as weight loss and increased physical activity  [16] [17] [18] . Gamification is the use of game design elements, such as points and levels, in non-game environments  [18] [19] [20] [21] . Behavioral economics incorporates principles from psychology to help understand why people make decisions that may deviate from those expected to maximize their well-being. Many persons know physical activity is good for their health but do not do enough of it. Instead, they often deviate from these goals in a predictable manner and from a common set of decision errors  [22, 23] . For example, persons tend to be more motivated by immediate rather than delayed gratification  [24]  and by losses rather than gains  [25] , and they tend to avoid the feeling of regret  [26] . These insights reveal that the design and delivery of an incentive has an important influence on its effectiveness. In fact, members of our team have found that gamification designed to leverage insights from behavioral economics to enhance social support incentives significantly increased physical activity among families in the community  [17] . Social incentives, such as peer support and collaboration, are influences that motivate individuals to adjust their health behaviors based on social ties, and can be leveraged within gamification interventions to provide a low-cost solution to increase engagement in physical activity  [17] .\n\nOur objective in the Mobility and Outcomes for Validated Evidence -Incentive Trial (MOVE IT) study is to examine the impact of a gamification intervention with social support that uses insights from behavioral economics to increase physical activity among general medical and oncology patients in the 13-weeks post-hospital discharge using a wearable device to track physical activity."

Participants are randomly assigned to the control arm or the gamification arm designed to motivate participants to increase physical activity through gamification with social support. Both arms receive physical activity step-goals and use a wrist-worn wearable device (Withings Steel) to track step counts, but the gamification arm also receives the game-based supportive social incentives.

The trial is conducted using Way to Health  [27] , a research technology platform at the University of Pennsylvania that has been used previously by our group for remotely-monitored physical activity interventions  [16, 17, [28] [29] [30] [31] .

      "title": "Participant recruitment",
      "text": "This study uses an electronic health record (EHR) to identify potentially eligible participants admitted to the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania (HUP). Enrollment began in January 2018 and is projected to be completed by the end of 2019. Participants are eligible for the trial if they are over 18 and are admitted to a medicine or oncology floor at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania. All patients on these floors are assessed daily by nurses to document their capacity for physical activity using the validated Assessment of Mobility in Post-Acute Care (AM-PAC)  [32, 33]  assessment tool and then are given an inpatient mobility score ranging from 0 (not able to mobilize well in bed on their own) to 4 (able to walk in the hallways unassisted). Participants are excluded if they: 1) are unable to provide informed consent, 2) do not have daily access to a smartphone compatible with the wearable device, 3) are already enrolled in another study targeting physical activity, 4) have an inpatient mobility score of 0 or 1 indicating that physical activity is not appropriate for the patient, 5) have any other medical conditions or reasons for which they are unable to complete the 13-week physical activity program, 6) are unable to complete the run-in phases (e.g. having unusually long hospital Length of Stay {LOS}; > 60 days LOS from enrolling in the study), 7) are not willing to use the wearable device for the 13-weeks post-discharge intervention.\n\nEach day, the clinical research coordinator identifies potentially eligible participants using an EHR query that generates a list of patients that are currently admitted to the HUP medicine and oncology floors and meet the mobility criteria and age requirements. After identification of patients, the clinical research coordinator approaches the patients and asks them whether they have access to a smartphone that is compatible with the device phone application and if they are currently participating in another physical activity program. Eligible patients are invited to participate in the study."

      "title": "Participant enrollment",
      "text": "The enrollment portion of the study includes mandatory enrollment in another randomized trial, the RETAIN (Randomized Evaluation of Trial Acceptability by INcentive) study  [34] , which evaluates how the magnitude of financial incentives impact patient enrollment. When patients are given information about enrolling in Move It, the participant is automatically enrolled into RETAIN. The RETAIN enrollment process includes completion of several questionnaires, including: Financial security, Attitude on research, Previous experience with research, Riskiness of study, Understanding the study benefits and risks, Understanding of the study, Perception of coercion, and Initial participation decision. As part of the collaboration with RETAIN, the compensation amount told to patients is altered in the informed consent process in order to study the impact of financial incentives on enrollment. Patients are randomized into a specific incentive arm and told they will receive one of three incentive amounts: $0, $100, or $300. Once participants complete a profile for the study and complete the first set of questionnaires, those that enroll in MOVE-IT are informed that everyone will receive $300 ($150 paid immediately and $150 during once their 13-week follow-up for MOVE IT is complete). The IRB allowed for use of a single informed consent for both studies since there no additional risks for participating in RETAIN beyond those associated with the parent study (MOVE IT) and since the goal of RETAIN was to study the process of consent itself. The clinical research coordinator authorizes the device to send data to the Way to Health technology platform. The participants then complete a series of surveys and validated questionnaires using the Way to Health interface. These instruments include: the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index  [35, 36] , Karolinska Scale  [37, 38] , Activity of Daily Living-Instrumental & Activities of Daily Living Survey  [39] [40] [41] , Life Space Activity Survey  [42, 43] , Mini-Nutritional Assessment Survey  [44] [45] [46] , Edmonton Symptom Assessment Survey  [47, 48] , Dementia: Cognitive screen Treatment Burden Questionnaire  [49] , Lubben Social Network Scale  [50] , and Self-Reported Health Survey  [51, 52] . During their hospital stay, participants are sent daily surveys to complete for up to 10 days (see Table  1 ).\n\nUpon hospital discharge, participants enter a one-week baseline period during which time they must have at least four days of 1000 steps to be randomized into the study. If they do not, their baseline period is extended until they have at least four days of 1000 steps, up to 21 days of baseline in total. All participants receive a notification via text message or email when it is time to complete surveys in the Way to Health system (1, 5, 9, and 13 weeks after hospital discharge). Three days after the surveys are sent to participants, a message is sent reminding them to complete the surveys if they have not already done so. Upon completion of the final set of surveys, $150 is processed for participants in both arms. The enrollment process is complete after the participant completes the one-week discharge survey and has at least four days of over 1000 steps."

To prevent potential mismeasurement, daily values < 1000 steps are ignored because evidence indicates these values are unlikely to represent capture of actual activity  [13, 53] . If < 4 days of data is available during the first week of the run-in period, the participant is contacted to inquire about any device issues and the run-in period may be extended up to 21 days until there is at least 4 days of data. After week 1, all participants are sent post-discharge baseline surveys via text or email. Participants are randomized once they complete all surveys and establish a baseline step count. Participants are randomly assigned to a study arm using a computerized random number generator with block sizes of two and stratified on participant baseline step count (< 5000 steps per day; 5001 to 7500 steps per day; > 7500 steps per day) and hospital admission floor."

      "text": "Participants assigned to the control arm are asked to use the wearable device to passively collect data. Participants in the control arm receive study communications when it is time for them to complete surveys in the Way to Health system, but no other interventions as to keep the experience as close as possible to usual care. Participants in the gamification arm have their weekly step goal targets increase from baseline by 10% per week for 12 weeks with a maximum of 10,000 steps. Participants in the gamification arm are entered into a game-based supportive social incentive that is based on prior work  [17]  and uses points and levels as well as insights from behavioral economics. At the beginning of each week the participant receives 70 points (10 for each day of the week). If the participant does not achieve their step goal, they lose 10 points from their balance. This leverages loss aversion, which has demonstrated that loss-framing is more effective at motivating behavior change than gain-framing  [16, 25] . At the end of each week if the participant has at least 40 points, they move up a level (levels are (from lowest to highest): blue, bronze, silver, gold, platinum). If not, a participant drops a level. This design creates achievable goal gradients (the notion that the next highest level was attainable), a sense of social status, and progression through the game. All participants begin at the silver level, so they feel the loss of dropping to bronze if they do not achieve enough points in the first week. Participants get a fresh set of 70 points each week on Monday. This design leverages the \"fresh start effect\" which is the tendency for aspirational behavior around temporal landmarks such as the beginning of the year, month, or week  [24] . Participants receive daily feedback for the step counts, and weekly feedback for their levels. Additionally, participants in the gamification arm are asked to identify a family member or friend to be their support sponsor. A weekly report is sent to the support sponsor with the participant's performance (points and level)."

The ADLs/IADLs survey is a twenty-item scale that combines the Katz scale that assesses activities of daily living (ADL)  [41]  and the Lawton scale that assesses level of instrumental in performing activities of daily living (IADL)  [39] . Both scales assess independence in activities over the past month. The Katz scale used measures independence in performance of bathing, dressing, toileting, transferring, and feeding. The Lawton scale used measures independence in ability to use the phone, shop, prepare food, keep house, do laundry, use transportation, take medications and handle finances. A higher score on the survey indicates a higher level of independence in these domains of activities of daily living. Both the Katz and the Lawton scales have been found to be valid and reliable  [40, 55] .\n\nLife Space Activity (LSA). The University of Alabama at Birmingham Life-Space Assessment (LSA) is a validated tool that measures a person's ability to mobilize in their home and community within the past 4 weeks  [42, 43] . The life-space mobility distance levels range from moving within a person's house to moving in their community. Scores range from 0 to 120, with higher scores representing greater mobility."

We will compare changes from baseline to the intervention period. The primary analysis will fit mixed effects regression models to evaluate changes in daily step count adjusting for each participant's baseline step, time at the observation level using calendar month fixed effects, and participant random effects to adjust for repeated observations of participant step counts.\n\nFor the main analysis, we will use multiple imputation for step values that are either missing or for values < 1000 steps because evidence suggests these are not accurate measures of actual activity  [13, 53] . We will perform five sets of imputations and results will be combined using Rubin's standard rules  [56] . We will perform sensitivity analyses to assess the robustness of the findings using only collected data with and without step values < 1000 steps. This imputation approach has been used in our prior work  [17, 28] .\n\nIn secondary analyses, we will evaluate how differences in step counts are associated with secondary outcome measures. Secondary analyses will fit mixed effects regression models adjusted for other variables of interest such as participant characteristics. All hypothesis tests will be two-sided using a two-sided alpha of 0.05 as our threshold for statistical significance. We will also conduct a qualitative analysis of the survey free text responses to evaluate participant perceptions of the intervention."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "The MOVE IT trial evaluates the effectiveness of a gamification intervention with social support, using insights from behavioral economics, to increase physical activity. These interventions used Way to Health  [27] , a research technology platform, to deploy automated processes and communications to participants from a Philadelphia hospital without using more personnel-intensive approaches. This provides a scalable method that if successful could be deployed more broadly at relatively low-cost. An exploratory evaluation will evaluate whether data on participants can identify predictors of response to interventions.\n\nThis study has several limitations. First, participants are recruited from a single institution in Philadelphia and this may limit generalizability. Second, we are evaluating physical activity using step counts and do not have other measures of physical activity or exercise. Third, the control arm did not receive daily messaging and therefore we cannot disentangle the impact of the gamification interventions with daily messaging. However, the wearable devices do provide daily feedback on step counts and our design provides a more pragmatic evaluation of the effect of the interventions.\n\nThis study also has several strengths. First, while gamification is used widely in insurance programs and smartphone applications for health and fitness  [18, 57] , it has not often incorporated insights from behavioral economics or been tested rigorously in a randomized trial. In addition, by evaluating predictors of success and failure, we will be able to better understand response to the interventions that could help to develop targeted approaches to engaging individuals rather than a onesize-fits-all approach.\n\nThe MOVE IT trial is one of the first post-hospital evaluations of behaviorally designed gamification for physical activity promotion. Since social networks are often longstanding, interventions that enhance social incentives could be more sustainable than other approaches. Our trial has demonstrated that a remotely monitored intervention can be conducted, and the findings of this study will help to understand how these types of approaches could impact hospital readmission rates and physical activity levels among overweight and obese adults in the US."
