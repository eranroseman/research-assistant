  "title": "Behavior Change Techniques in Digital Health Interventions for Midlife Women: Systematic Review",
  "abstract": "Background: Digital health interventions are efficacious in health-promoting behaviors (eg, healthy eating and regular physical activity) that mitigate health risks and menopausal symptoms in midlife. However, integrated evidence-based knowledge about the mechanisms of change in these interventions is unclear. Objective: This systematic review aimed to evaluate studies on behavior change techniques (BCTs) and mechanisms of change in digital health interventions aimed at promoting health-enhancing behaviors in midlife women (aged 40-65 years). Methods: A systematic literature search of the electronic databases PubMed, Web of Science, PsycINFO, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials in the Cochrane Library was conducted. In total, 2 independent reviewers selected the studies for inclusion, extracted data, and completed BCT mapping of eligible studies. The mechanism of action and intervention functions of eligible studies were evaluated using the behavior change wheel framework. Reporting of psychological theory use within these interventions was explored using the Theory Coding Scheme. Mode of delivery, psychological theory, and BCTs were presented as descriptive statistics. Results: In total, 13 interventions (including 1315 women) reviewed used 13 (SD 4.30, range 6-21) BCTs per intervention on average. The \"Shaping knowledge\" and \"Repetition and substitution\" behavior change categories were used most frequently, with 92% (12/13) of the interventions implementing at least one of the BCTs from these 2 categories. Only 13.98% (169/1209) of the 93 available BCTs were used, with \"Instructions on behaviour\" most frequently used (12/13, 92%). The behavior change wheel mapping suggests that half of the intervention content aimed to increase \"Capability\" (49/98, 50% of the intervention strategies), \"Motivation\" (41/98, 42%), and \"Opportunity\" (8/98, 8%). \"Behavioural Regulation\" was the most frequently used mechanism of action (15/98, 15%), followed by increasing \"Knowledge\" (13/98, 13%) and \"Cognitive and Interpersonal skills\" (10/98, 10%). A total of 78% (7/9) of the intervention functions were used in the studies to change behavior, primarily through \"Enablement\" (60/169, 35.5%), whereas no study used \"Restriction\" or \"Modelling\" functions. Although 69% (9/13) of the interventions mentioned a psychological theory or model, most (10/13, 77%) stated or suggested rather than demonstrated the use of a theoretical base, and none reported explicit links between all BCTs within the intervention and the targeted theoretical constructs. Technological components were primarily based on web-based (9/13, 69%) modes of delivery, followed by phone or SMS text message (8/13, 62%) and wearables (7/13, 54%). \n Conclusions: The findings of this review indicate an overall weak use of theory, low levels of treatment fidelity, insignificant outcomes, and insufficient description of several interventions to support the assessment of how specific BCTs were activated. Thus, the identified limitations in the current literature provide an opportunity to improve the design of lifestyle health-enhancing interventions for women in midlife.",

      "text": "Approximately 3.5 million women aged 50 to 65 years are employed in the United Kingdom and experience menopausal symptoms (eg, hot flushes, disturbed sleep, depression, and cognitive dysfunction)  [1]  that can contribute to job dissatisfaction and decreased commitment to work  [2] . The impact can be bidirectional, with symptoms such as poor concentration, poor memory, and sickness absence impairing job performance  [3]  and the workplace exacerbating menopausal symptoms  [4] . Moreover, an individual's health-related quality of life in midlife is influenced by many additional nonmenopausal factors such as lifestyle, physical activity (PA), and social integration  [5] . Evidence suggests that midlife for women represents a critical window for preventing chronic disease and optimizing health and functioning, whereas it is increasingly recognized that a healthy lifestyle may mitigate such health risks  [6] . Improvements in diet, PA, and lifestyle can provide an effective intervention to manage menopause symptoms, improve health-related quality of life  [7] , and reduce menopause-related health risks  [8, 9]  (eg, neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer disease  [1, 10] , and increased cardiovascular disease risk  [11] , low bone-mineral density, fractures, and osteoporosis  [12, 13] ).\n\nBehavior change interventions (BCIs) aimed at promoting population-level participation in key behaviors have been widely applied in the general population  [14]  and, to some degree, also in midlife women  [15, 16] . Women in midlife are willing to make positive health behavior changes but need support (eg, social connectivity  [17] ) for those changes to be effective  [18] . However, changing established behavior patterns can be challenging as it requires addressing a strong psychological, environmental, or social gradient  [19] . BCIs are typically complex and involve many interacting components and, therefore, a theoretical understanding of how the intervention causes behavior change is needed to strengthen the effects of BCI on clinical outcomes  [20] . A recent scoping review  [21]  identified limitations in describing PA interventions in midlife women, with only 59% of the 51 studies specifying an underlying theoretical model. Many studies provided a limited description of how behavior change techniques (BCTs) were activated to achieve desired outcomes and provided limited insight into how the BCTs were received by midlife women  [21] . As a result, interpreting designs and evaluations of complex interventions can be challenging without sufficient description of key intervention content  [22]  and, therefore, characterizing interventions by BCTs can be insightful in understanding the effectiveness of interventions  [23] .\n\nThe use of psychological theory in the development of BCIs (including digital BCIs) is associated with greater intervention effects  [24] [25] [26] . Although there is a wide range of theoretical models of behavior (eg, the theory of planned behavior  [27]  and the Health Belief Model  [28] ), health-promoting interventions that are based on a single theory have generally been shown to be more effective in changing behavioral intentions than actual behavior  [29, 30] . Therefore, integrated theories have been proposed to overcome this limitation by drawing their hypotheses from several different theories with the aim of providing a more comprehensive explanation of behavior  [31] . Theoretical frameworks such as the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF)  [32]  integrate insights of multiple behavioral theories to identify relevant constructs that may be implicated in various health behaviors. Together with the capability, opportunity, and motivation-behavior (COM-B) model  [33]  that aims to identify the sources of target behavior, they form the behavior change wheel (BCW) framework  [19] . The BCW framework provides a systematic and theoretical basis for understanding and changing behavior  [19] . It has been used extensively to develop and evaluate the implementation of interventions in health care settings  [34] [35] [36]  and lifestyle (eg, smoking cessation  [37] , alcohol use prevention  [38] , sedentary behavior  [39] , PA  [40] , and dietary patterns  [41] ) but also in other areas such as personal transportation habits  [42] .\n\nBehavioral interventions to promote PA in midlife women have been traditionally delivered face-to-face or in group settings  [43] . However, the use of digital technology to change health behaviors has increased exponentially in recent decades, primarily after the introduction of smartphones in 2009  [44] . Moreover, digital health technology (ie, apps, wearables, and websites) has the potential to increase scalability through broader user reach  [43]  throughout the day, improve intervention effectiveness  [17] , and achieve greater cost-efficiency  [45, 46] . Indeed, digital health interventions (DHIs) are both feasible  [47, 48]  and acceptable among midlife women  [17, 49, 50] . Digital health technologies (including therapeutic interventions, online support communities, and web-based consultations) can provide important means for midlife women to obtain evidence-based menopause-related health information and recommendations, social and health practitioner support, and symptom tracking  [51] ."

      "text": "The development of the BCT taxonomy  [52, 53]  and methods for assessing the extent to which behavioral interventions are theory-based allows for more sophisticated coding of intervention content and insight into how and why the intervention promoted behavior change. Thus, the primary aim of this systematic review was to (1) assess the frequency and type of BCTs and BCT categories (representing groups of BCTs) used in DHIs with midlife women, (2) understand the mechanism of action proposed to affect changes in the behavioral outcome, and (3) appraise the intervention functions or broad categories of means by which the studies proposed to change behavior using the BCW. In addition, this review identified the theoretical grounding (or the extent of behavior change theory used) in the DHIs using the Theory Coding Scheme (TCS)  [54]  and determined the technological features (mode of delivery) used in these studies."

      "title": "Data Extraction and Collection Process",
      "text": "The studies were screened using titles and abstracts, and those that did not meet the inclusion criteria were excluded. The following information was extracted from each study: author, behavior change theory, intervention type, study design, country, participant ethnicity, intervention length, participant age and health risk, comparison group, and significant between-group differences in main outcomes. Data from each eligible study were populated into a prepared Microsoft Excel template to evaluate their eligibility and observe any missing data. Two reviewers (HS and SD) independently extracted the data, and this was checked for accuracy. Any disagreements were resolved through discussion, and a third reviewer was not required.\n\nThe first template included key information on each study, such as the intervention type and length, behavior change theories used, outcomes, and mean age of the participants. Multiple studies from the same trial were merged, and information was extracted to gain a full picture of the intervention, ensuring that the reported descriptive statistics were not double-counted. The authors of the original reports were contacted to obtain further details if insufficient information was included in the published documents. A reminder was sent if no responses were received after 2 weeks.\n\nThe use of BCTs and clusters of BCTs as defined by the Behavior Change Technique Taxonomy v1 (BCTTv1  [53] ) was synthesized (and coded) for each included study. The number of individual BCTs included in each study was counted (range 0-93), and the mean value and SD were reported. Furthermore, the use of behavior change categories and combinations of techniques and categories or clusters was investigated for each included study. Each study and group of related studies (ie, weight loss, lifestyle, and menopause symptoms) was mapped into this framework. The overarching synthesis bringing the studies together by providing a systematic and theoretical basis for understanding behavior was based on the COM-B model  [33] , TDF  [32] , and BCW  [19] . The BCW links to theory-based frameworks (ie, the TDF and BCTTv1) to understand behavior for specifying intervention content  [56] . Using the TDF or the COM-B model, intervention designers can make a behavioral diagnosis of what needs to change for the desired behavior to occur and, in the evaluation of interventions, the framework can help identify the mechanism of action (ie, how an intervention is working)  [56] . Explicit links between the COM-B model and TDF domains are provided in the BCW guide  [19] .\n\nThe BCW also supports evaluating intervention functions (consisting of education, persuasion, incentivization, coercion, training, restriction, environmental restructuring, modeling, and enablement) by identifying broad categories of means by which interventions can change behavior  [56] . For example, a digital health app designed to promote healthy eating may contain an educational element (eg, providing new information about the benefits of healthy eating) but may also be presented in a way that is intended to be persuasive (eg, generating feelings of worry about the health consequences of eating unhealthy foods)  [56] .\n\nThe use of psychological theory in the studies was examined using the TCS  [54]  to assess the extent to which behavior change theory was used to design the interventions in each study. These data were extracted by HS and reviewed for accuracy by SD. The overall score for each study was assessed as having weak (score 0-7), moderate (score 8-15), or strong (score 16-23) levels of theory use  [57] . Finally, the technological and nontechnological components of each study were extracted and mapped into predefined categories that were created based on the review of the included studies. Frequencies of individual modes of delivery were reported together with the frequencies of related groups of passive and action-based components. The quality assessment was completed using the Physiotherapy Evidence Database scale  [58] , and the Cochrane risk-of-bias tool for randomized trials  [59]  was used to assess the risk of bias in randomized trials (these data are presented in Multimedia Appendix 1  [48, [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] )."

      "title": "Treatment Fidelity Assessment",
      "text": "Treatment fidelity facilitates theory testing, with high levels often associated with alterations in the mechanisms of change (eg, increased PA and healthier eating) hypothesized to affect the outcomes  [74] . According to Borrelli  [74] , high fidelity constitutes 80% to 100% integrity, whereas 50% constitutes low-fidelity scoring. By describing methodological strategies that are applied to monitor and enhance the reliability and validity of health BCIs  [75] , treatment fidelity helps increase scientific confidence that the changes in the outcome of interest (dependent variable) are due to the manipulation of other variables (independent variables) by the researchers  [74] . This is achieved through assessment of the degrees to which the intervention is implemented as intended and the study arms differ along critical dimensions  [74] . In interventions that produce nonsignificant effects, treatment fidelity helps uncover whether these effects are due to the omission or addition of active or inactive components or to an ineffective treatment  [74] . The treatment fidelity of the studies included in this review was assessed using a 29-item checklist  [74]  grouped into 5 domains. These are (1) design of study (6 items), (  2 ) monitoring and improving provider training (7 items), (3) monitoring and improving delivery of treatment (9 items), (  4 ) monitoring and improving receipt of treatment (5 items), and (  5 ) monitoring and improving enactment of treatment skills (2 items)  [75] , termed henceforth study design, training, delivery, receipt, and enactment  [41] ."

A total of 27% (4/15) of the studies focused on improving menopausal symptoms  [70] [71] [72] [73]  such as vasomotor symptoms (eg, hot flushes and night sweats) and bone health  [72] . The characteristics of two interventions (Activity and Technology [ACTIVATE]  [67, 68]  and the Women's Wellness Program [WWP]  [69, 73] ) were each reported in 13% (2/15) of the studies and are described only once (Table  1 ). Of the 13 interventions, 9 (69%) interventions originated in the United States, 3 (23%) in Australia, and 1 (8%) in South Korea. The length of the studies ranged from 8 weeks to 12 months (median 12 weeks). In 69% (9/13) of the interventions, the participants were overweight or obese and, in 31% (4/13), participants were breast cancer survivors. A total of 7% (1/15) of the studies reported having participants with a high risk of hypertension. White individuals participated in 73% (11/15) of the studies, Asian individuals participated in 20% (3/15) of the studies, and 7% (1/15) of the studies had a mix of White and African American participants.\n\nThe average age of the participants was 52.25 (SD 4.79, range 45.7-61.6) years. The inclusion criterion was a minimum of 2 participant groups or arms, with 20% (3/15) of the studies (ie, ACTIVATE  [67, 68] , WWP  [69, 73] , and Striving to be Strong  [72] ) consisting of 3 arms. The comparison groups were either a control group or groups with reduced BCI frequency (eg, diet tracking with no feedback  [48] ), technology (eg, no technology  [69, 73]  or no SMS text messages  [65] ), or PA type (eg, endurance group  [61] ). Where appropriate, an additional review of the studies was provided in three categories (ie, weight loss, lifestyle, and menopausal symptoms) to allow for a more meaningful comparability of the interventions. The outcomes of the studies provided mixed results, with 33% (5/15) reporting statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups in the primary measured outcomes. This represented 33.18% (434/1308) of all the intervention participants combined (Table  1 ).

Nine BCTs (ie, \"instructions on behaviour,\" \"feedback on behavior,\" \"habit formation,\" \"behavioural practice/rehearsal,\" \"action planning,\" \"prompts/cues,\" \"goal setting (behaviour),\" \"self-monitoring of behaviour,\" and \"graded tasks\") were used by more than half (7/13, 54%) of the interventions. In addition, two BCTs (ie, \"instructions on behaviour\" and \"feedback on behaviour\") were used by 92% (12/13) and 85% (11/13) of the interventions, respectively (Multimedia Appendix 2  [48, [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] ). Examples of \"instructions on behaviour\" included providing participants with DVD-guided training instructions, coaching calls that included instructions on meal planning and increasing vegetable intake, or daily video clips about healthy diet and weight maintenance. Examples of \"feedback on behaviour\" included receiving individualized weekly feedback on activity recording and adherence to the dietary program and, upon recording food intake, receiving immediate feedback on how many calories are left until the participant's daily goal is reached. The next two frequently implemented BCTs-\"habit formation\" and \"behavioral practice/rehearsal\"-were each implemented in 77% (10/13) of the interventions. Examples of \"habit formation\" included researchers sending 3 messages per week or reinforcing content through daily messages and videos. \"Behavioural practice/rehearsal\" was implemented by providing weekly activity planning with participants to identify and reflect on their barriers to exercising behavior change through journal activities, reflections, and discussion.

The COM-B model at the core of the BCW showed that 50% (49/98) of the intervention strategies focused on increasing \"capability,\" 42% (41/98) focused on increasing \"motivation,\" and 8% (8/98) focused on providing \"opportunity.\" Furthermore, a breakdown of the \"capability\" component suggests that 42% (41/98) were linked to \"psychological capability\" and 8% (8/98) were linked to \"physical capability.\" The \"opportunity\" components show that 3% (3/98) and 5% (5/98) were related to \"social\" and \"physical opportunity,\" respectively. Finally, expanding the \"motivation\" component suggests that 35% (34/98) and 7% (7/98) were linked to \"reflective\" and \"automatic motivation,\" respectively (Multimedia Appendix 3). The TDF framework components within the COM-B model of the BCW indicate that the mechanism of action for the BCTs used most frequently was \"behavioural regulation\" (15/98, 15%), primarily in the \"goals and planning\" (6/15, 40%; eg, instructions to rotate through 5 different workouts before progression and setting an initial weight loss goal) and \"repetition and substitution\" (6/15, 40%; eg, progression from 60 minutes of exercise in week 1 to 250 minutes of exercise in week 15 and sending 3 SMS text messages per week) behavior change categories. Additional TDF domains used most frequently within the \"repetition and substitution\" behavior change category were increasing \"knowledge,\" \"skills,\" and \"cognitive and interpersonal skills.\" \"Motivation\" was increased primarily through \"beliefs about capabilities\" (eg, providing daily feedback on steps walked to help the participants monitor and adjust goals) and \"professional or social role and identity\" (eg, providing monthly face-to-face group meetings and access to a web-based forum to discuss experiences and receive individual and group coaching support). \"Opportunity\" was increased primarily by \"physical environmental restructuring\" such as providing instructions on modifications to food and exercise environments (eg, stocking the kitchen with healthy foods and packing exercise clothes ahead of time; Multimedia Appendix 3)."

      "text": "This review systematically reviewed 13 interventions that aimed to improve weight loss (3/15, 20%), lifestyle (8/15, 53%), and menopause symptoms (4/15, 27%) through DHIs in midlife women. Six BCTs (ie, \"Feedback on behaviour,\" \"Prompts/cues,\" \"Action planning,\" \"Instructions on behaviour,\" \"Behavioural practice/rehearsal,\" and \"Habit formation\") were used in at least 80% (4/5) from the studies that showed significant between-group differences in main outcomes. This group of studies used an average of 12.6 BCTs (range 7-16, median 13), representing 13.98% (169/1209) of all BCTs available from the BCTTv1 taxonomy. The most frequently used six clusters of BCTs (ie, \"Feedback and monitoring,\" \"Associations,\" \"Repetition and substitution,\" \"Antecedents,\" \"Shaping knowledge,\" and \"Goals and planning\") were used by >80% (4/5) of the studies. Four clusters of BCTs (ie, \"Social support,\" \"Natural consequences,\" \"Comparison of outcomes,\" and \"Reward and threat\") were used by only 20% (1/5) to 40% (2/5) of the studies. Six other clusters (ie, \"Regulation,\" \"Identity,\" \"Self-belief,\" \"Covert learning,\" \"Comparison of behaviour,\" and \"Scheduled consequences\") were not used, which may indicate that the BCTs within these clusters were unexplored or potentially found inappropriate for these interventions. Although the findings indicate which BCTs are used more frequently in health-enhancing DHIs with midlife women, the high level of heterogeneity in the design of the interventions and selection of specific BCTs suggests that the designs of these interventions cannot be generalized across various contexts. DHIs should consider the unique experiences and needs of women in midlife, including marginalized women, to improve their sociodemographic diversity.\n\nIn this review, 78% (7/9) of BCW intervention functions were identified, with a strong emphasis on \"enablement\" (eg, encouragement to set an initial weight loss goal and self-monitoring food intake and PA) by increasing capability beyond education and training. \"Training\" and \"persuasion\" were also commonly used, whereas \"restriction\" and \"modelling\" were not used at all. In a nondigital lifestyle BCI (involving adult men and women), 5 (56%; 5/9) of the intervention functions were used (ie, \"enablement,\" \"training,\" \"persuasion,\" \"restriction,\" and \"education\"), whereas \"incentivization,\" \"coercion,\" and \"modelling\" were not used and were found to be inappropriate in the context of the intervention  [78] . In another nondigital lifestyle behavior change review, education (eg, nutritional label reading and a resistance training booklet for exercise) was the most commonly used intervention function, being present in 81% of the interventions  [79] . \"Enablement\" (eg, self-management techniques to foster self-efficacy and arranging support from friends and family) and \"training\" (eg, home-based exercise training, guided exercise training, and hands-on cooking classes) were also emphasized, whereas \"coercion\" and \"restriction\" were not used in any of the interventions  [79] . Overall, \"education,\" \"enablement,\" and \"training\" were used commonly across digital and nondigital intervention types, whereas \"coercion\" or \"restriction\" were used less commonly.\n\nWhen comparing digital and traditional face-to-face (ie, nondigital) lifestyle health-enhancing interventions, there are apparent commonalities and differences in the BCT clusters typically used within interventions. Previous reviews have highlighted that only a fraction (34%; 32/93) of the BCTs were used across all interventions, with the \"Feedback and monitoring\" and \"Goals and Planning\" BCT clusters used more commonly in traditional lifestyle interventions  [79, 80] , which aligns with what was observed in this review. Contrary to previous reports on traditional lifestyle interventions, this study demonstrated that DHIs in midlife women were more likely to use \"Repetition and substitution\" (ie, habit formation) techniques  [79, 80] . This difference may be due to the just-in-time nature of digital technologies, which allows for the implementation of behaviors that may emerge rapidly, unexpectedly, and ecologically and that are usually less accessible with in-person approaches  [81] .\n\nIn other DHIs, certain BCTs were found to be more frequently applied on particular technological platforms. For example, the most frequently used BCTs in lifestyle interventions using mobile apps were \"feedback on behaviour\" (84%; 26/31), \"self-monitoring of behaviour\" (77%; 24/31), and \"goal setting\" (61%; 19/31)  [82] . Although these BCT features were apparent in the mobile app-based interventions included in this review, they were not universally applied. Equally, digital PA BCIs used primarily a combination of \"goal setting,\" \"self-monitoring,\" and \"motivation,\" whereas digital healthy eating interventions primarily targeted \"self-monitoring,\" \"goal setting,\" and \"feedback on behaviour\"  [82] . Similarly, in this review, \"feedback on behaviour\" (11/13, 85%), \"goal setting\" (8/13, 62%), and \"self-monitoring\" (8/13, 62%) were in the top 10 BCTs used across all technological platforms in all studies. In gamification platforms, for example, the most frequently used BCTs were \"education\" and \"reward\" as these are important features of gamification  [44] . This highlights that almost all the key BCTs can be used on a mobile platform, most likely because of the flexibility and accessibility of this technology  [44] ; therefore, interventions can be easily tailored to the context in which they are being applied. Health interventions for midlife women must be cognizant of the multiple co-occurring stressors that are born from psychosocial and physiological transitions during this period  [83] . Interestingly, DHIs have been suggested to be most effective in facilitating problem-solving, encouraging self-efficacy, and reducing the impact of stress associated with behavior change  [24] . This review highlighted a varied use of theories of behavior and behavior change to design DHIs, with SET and SCT being most commonly used in DHI research to date. Interventions informed by these theories can effectively enhance PA in midlife women  [18, 84] ; however, the application of theory to BCT intervention functions has been poorly reported or used  [54, 57] . In this review, although 69% (9/13) of the interventions mentioned behavioral theory, more than half (8/13, 62%) had weak scores (based on TCS) in applying theory to the intervention. In cases where the intervention was reportedly based on theory (ie, SCT, SET, and the Stages of Change Model), none of the studies in this review explicitly linked all theoretical constructs with BCTs and vice versa. As such, having a theoretical understanding of behavior change is necessary to maximize the potential efficacy of interventions  [85] .\n\nA critical component of intervention delivery is establishing theoretical fidelity and ensuring that a theory is adequately reflected in the intervention's design and implementation  [74] . The overall poor reporting of treatment fidelity in this review (with only 2/15, 13% of the interventions reporting medium treatment fidelity  [63, 72] ) is similar to other reviews that considered fidelity  [41, 74, 86] . Although 69% (9/13) of the interventions in this review mentioned a theory, the treatment design domain achieved only a low mean proportion of treatment fidelity. When intervention effects are not significant, treatment fidelity helps understand whether this is due to the omission or addition of active or inactive components or whether it is due to an ineffective treatment  [74] . However, it is important to highlight that a lack of effect may reflect implementation failure rather than genuine ineffectiveness and, through the evaluation process, implementation problems can be identified  [20] . Although this review combined treatment fidelity for studies that did and did not achieve statistically significant group differences, an accurate estimate of the relationship between theory use and intervention effectiveness can only be obtained from studies that reach high fidelity of delivery  [87] . DHIs incorporating behavior change theory offer a unique opportunity to refine and strengthen the theory. Unfortunately, none of the studies in this review reported refining or developing a theory to strengthen intervention effectiveness. Moller et al  [88]  explored potential improvements for applying behavior change theories in the context of digital health and suggested that digital technologies may potentially provide high fidelity of delivery owing to their ability to measure engagement levels objectively. Furthermore, digital technologies can also access large data sets generated by ecologically valid measures of behavior, emotion, physiology, and thinking in real time and everyday contexts  [88] . Therefore, considering treatment fidelity in DHIs is essential to estimate the confidence with which intervention effects can be attributed to BCTs.\n\nAlthough extending the interpretation of the findings to the effectiveness of certain BCTs was outside the scope of this review, it should be noted that identifying effective BCTs and a combination of BCTs for a given behavior in a given context presents a major challenge  [89] . Research evaluating the effectiveness of BCTs and BCT combinations uses a range of observational and experimental methods, each with strengths and limitations  [89] . For example, van Rhoon et al  [90]  drew conclusions on the effectiveness of specific numbers and types of BCTs in weight loss DHIs based on the BCTs that were present in interventions producing clinically significant weight loss outcomes. However, this method led to the inability to identify the mechanisms by which the BCTs and digital features influenced the target behavior. In addition, this method runs the risk of including BCTs that do not add to effectiveness but happened to be included in the effective interventions  [89] . Furthermore, although other evaluation methods such as meta-analyses can provide generalizable conclusions  [89] , poor quality in intervention description and high heterogeneity in the designs may not allow for statistical analysis of the effectiveness of individual BCTs or a combination of BCTs on the intervention outcomes  [21, 44, 78, 91, 92] . Making confident estimates of the effectiveness of BCTs and BCT combinations for a given behavior delivered in a particular way in a given setting to a given target population requires synthesis of information from diverse sources  [89] . This challenge provides an opportunity for future research to develop a strategy that systematically combines the strengths of the different methods and that links these constructs in an ontology of BCIs  [89] .\n\nThe outcomes of this review suggest that the effects of BCTs on behavior are difficult to determine because of high heterogeneity in the designs of the interventions and low level of treatment fidelity and theoretical grounding. It is also important to note that, although the BCW provides a systematic and theory-guided method for identifying components of interventions and types of interventions that are expected to be effective, it does not provide a detailed blueprint for the design of specific BCIs  [19] . Therefore, the BCW framework should be applied with a level of flexibility, as acknowledged by its authors  [78] . Furthermore, although theory-based intervention design is critical for intervention effectiveness  [20] , the involvement of key stakeholders in the development process of interventions through coproduction increases the likelihood of the intervention meeting user needs and their implementation  [20, 93] . Although most of the participants in the studies in this review were White individuals (9/13, 69% of the interventions), research shows that menopausal symptom experiences vary among women with different sociodemographic characteristics, including ethnicity, income, and education  [94] [95] [96] . The lack of diversity in the sociodemographic characteristics of the studies and the apparent lack of evidence on how to culturally adapt DHIs provide an opportunity to explore these topics in future research. In addition, co-designing theory-and evidence-based interventions with Patient and Public Involvement in all stages of the design process  [92, [97] [98] [99]  would be beneficial to ensure that digital health lifestyle BCIs for midlife women are acceptable, feasible, and more effective. To date, there has been no such study undertaken and, therefore, this represents an opportunity for researchers to advance the field by improving both the quality and replicability of such interventions."

As such, this review contains a possible subjectivity limitation in categorizing, reviewing, and mapping behavior change theories and BCTs. To mitigate this limitation, two researchers (HS and SD) interpreted and coded the BCTs to reduce any bias (also acknowledged in other research  [44] ). Similarly, to reduce bias in interpreting and coding, the TCS items (also acknowledged in other research  [41] ) were completed by 2 researchers. Improving the description of the intervention design and delivery is essential for improving BCT coding to better facilitate scientific evaluation and translational processes in future studies.\n\nFurthermore, the number of health-promoting studies designed specifically for midlife women is limited. This review contains a small number of studies with limited sociodemographic (ie, the participants in 9/13, 69% of the interventions were White individuals) and socioeconomic (ie, all the included studies came from high-income countries) backgrounds and attempts to assess the quality of evidence that may not be generalizable to all digital health BCIs with midlife women. Future research should consider the unique needs of women of diverse sociodemographic and socioeconomic backgrounds in their intervention designs to make their findings applicable to more women."

      "text": "This review identified studies aiming to promote lifestyle improvements in midlife women using digital technology and assessed their designs through the application of the BCW framework. The assessment identified gaps in the process of designing digital health BCIs. The studies obtained weak to moderate scores in their theoretical grounding, and their description of intervention components, intervention functions, and BCTs was also weak. The low level of treatment fidelity suggests that the interventions may not have delivered what the researchers intended to deliver (also acknowledged elsewhere  [41] ) and that the interventions may not be replicable. This suggests, as also highlighted by Michie et al  [89] , that there is a need for better tools and intervention design guidelines to facilitate better selection and use of behavioral theories. Although the findings indicate which BCTs are used more frequently in specific groups of interventions, the high level of heterogeneity in the design of the interventions and selection of specific BCTs suggests that the designs of these interventions cannot be generalized across different contexts. Instead, applying the principles underlying the design of these groups of interventions through systematically co-designing theory-and evidence-based interventions with midlife women may be more efficacious. Further research is needed to validate such intervention designs and their application in feasibility and acceptability studies. A closer collaboration between behavioral science and solution design is needed to bridge this gap and increase the effectiveness of digital health behavior change technologies."
