  "abstract": "Objective: To develop a patient-centered text message-based platform that promotes self-management of symptoms of interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS). Methods: Adult women with IC/BPS interested in initiating a first-or secondline treatments per American Urological Association guidelines (recategorized as \"behavioral/non-pharmacologic treatments\" and \"oral medicines\" in the 2022 version) participated in rapid cycle innovation consisting of iterative cycles of contextual inquiry, prototype design and development. We delivered treatment modules and supportive messages using an algorithm-driven interactive messaging prototype through a HIPAA-compliant texting platform. Patients provided feedback through narrative text messages and an exit interview. Feedback was analyzed qualitatively and used to iteratively revise the platform until engagement \u2265 85% and accuracy \u2265 80% were achieved. The final version consisted of four treatment module categories (patient education and behavioral modification, cognitive behavioral therapy, pelvic floor physical therapy, and guided mindfulness practices) and supportive messages delivered through an automated algorithm over 6 weeks. Results: Thirty IC/BPS patients with moderate symptom bother (median IC Problem Index score 9, range 6-12) participated in five cycles of contextual inquiry. Qualitative analysis identified three overarching concepts that informed the development of the platform: preference for patient centered terms, desire to gain self-efficacy in managing symptoms, and need for provider support. Patients preferred the term \"interstitial cystitis\" to \"bladder pain syndrome\" which carried the stigma of chronic pain. Patients reported greater self-efficacy in managing symptoms through improved access to",

      "title": "1. | INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "Interstitial cystitis/bladder pain syndrome (IC/BPS) is a challenging condition for both patients and providers. Patients report feeling unsupported and dismissed by providers.  1 Providers find it challenging to address multiple symptom domains of IC/BPS including biological (neuropathic pain and pelvic floor dysfunction), psychological (symptom-related fear and anxiety), and social (sense of isolation). These findings suggest a gap in patient-provider communication and that current treatment approaches for IC/BPS are not patient-centered.\n\nRecently, chronic pain management has shifted from biological \"cure\" to improving a patient's self-efficacy that is, extent to which a patient believes they can control their pain and associated symptoms.  2, 3 In prior studies, IC/BPS patients expressed strong interest in selfmanagement and reported using a variety of self-care practices to manage symptoms.  4, 5 Additionally, patients wanted structured treatment programs, improved access to care and support from providers.  1, 4 obile texting platforms have been used to deliver various treatments including education, medication reminders, mind-body treatments, and supportive messages to patients with chronic pain.  6 Rapid Cycle Innovation is a novel paradigm for developing digital healthcare platforms.  7 The process involves \"contextual inquiry\" to understand patients' needs and iterative cycles of design and development, in which developers observe how patients interact with a prototype platform, obtain feedback, and then modify the platform to produce a functional product rapidly and efficiently.\n\nIn this study, we used rapid cycle innovation to develop a patient-centered text message-based platform that (1) promoted self-management of IC/BPS through remotely-delivered, evidence-based treatment modules and (2) provided support and guidance using algorithmic, clinically validated messages. Our primary outcome was patients' level of engagement with the platform and secondary outcome was the accuracy of the platform in generating appropriate responses to patients' texts."

      "text": "This study was approved by the University of Pennsylvania IRB (Protocol 844895) and registered on clinicaltrials. gov (NCT 05260112). Adult women with IC/BPS were recruited from the practices of urogynecology and urology. Inclusion criteria were (1) adult women who meet the American Urological Association (AUA) criteria for IC/BPS of \"an unpleasant sensation (pain, pressure, discomfort) perceived to be related to the urinary bladder, associated with lower urinary tract symptoms of more than six weeks duration, in the absence of infection or other identifiable causes\", (2) pain/pressure/discomfort severity of \u22653 on a visual analog scale, (3) interested in initiating at least one first or second line treatment per AUA guideline (recategorized as \"behavioral/non-pharmacologic treatments\" and \"oral medicines\" in the 2022 version) for IC/BPS including education, behavior modification, pelvic physical therapy, mind-body treatment, or medications, 8 (4) negative urinalysis and culture within two months of enrollment, (5) English-speaking, (6) own a smartphone. Exclusion criteria were women currently using third line or higher treatments, recurrent urinary tract infections, neurological conditions affecting lower urinary tract, recent (<6 months) pelvic surgery/pregnancy, and prior pelvic radiation.\n\nAll eligible patients had one in-person visit with a urogynecologist or urologist to confirm the diagnosis of IC/BPS. Subsequent procedures were conducted remotely. Following informed consent, patients completed the IC Problem Index (ICPI) (score range 0-16) and IC Symptom Index (ICSI) (score range 0-20, higher scores for both instruments represent more severe or bothersome symptoms).  9 They were then enrolled into the Way to Health texting platform, a HIPPA-compliant platform available through the Penn Center for Health Care Innovation, and which is integrated with the patient's electronic medical record. Of note, Way to Health platform is currently only available in English."

      "title": "2.2. | Development of algorithm",
      "text": "We developed a prototype platform in which we used a structured algorithm to deliver the above treatment modules and communicate with patients (Figure  1 ). The algorithm began with a question on severity of bladder discomfort based on question 7 of the validated Lower Urinary Tract Dysfunction Research Network Symptom Index questionnaire (responses on 4-point scale with higher score indicating more severe symptoms).  17 Based on response to this question, the branching algorithm recommended treatment modules, medication reminders, check-in messages, or call from a physician.\n\nPrototype of the dialogue algorithm\n\nNext, we conducted a series of 2-4-week cycles of design and testing during which patients interacted with the platform and provided feedback (Figure  2 ). In the early cycles, a study coordinator delivered the treatment modules and messages to the patient using the structured algorithm which was automated once a final version was developed. Patient feedback included (1) structured responses to the urinary symptom question and (2) narrative text messages regarding the platform. At the end of the cycle, an exit interview was conducted using an interview guide to obtain additional feedback from each patient and transcribed. Text messages and interview transcripts were analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively, and results used to modify the treatment modules and algorithm before the next cycle was launched.\n\nIterative cycles, each consisting of 4-5 patients, were conducted until prespecified metrics described below were achieved. This final algorithm was automated and tested in the last cycle (Figure  3 )."

      "text": "The final platform consisted of four treatment module categories (patient education and behavioral modification, cognitive behavioral therapy techniques, pelvic floor physical therapy, and guided mindfulness practices) and one weekly check-in message (Figure  3 ). The modules were presented in video format each 2.5-4 min long, hosted on YouTube accessible only to study team and participants (Table  1 ). Modules were delivered twice a week for 6 weeks. All patients received the \"core\" modules on patient education and behavior modification over the first 2 weeks. Then patients selected one additional treatment module (from CBT techniques, pelvic PT, mindfulness) which was delivered over the next 4 weeks.\n\nA single check-in message on symptom bother was delivered at the end of the week: \"How bothered have you been by your IC symptoms in this past week?\" Responses were elicited on a 4-point scale (1 = not at all bothered, 2 = somewhat bothered, 3 = very bothered, 4 = extremely bothered). Patients reporting \"no bother\" received a message of support, patients reporting \"somewhat\" or \"very bothered\" were offered a call back from a physician within 24 h, and patients reporting \"extremely bothered\" were offered a call back within 1 h.\n\nThe final platform was delivered via an automated algorithm, which was tested in 10 patients to ensure that accuracy and engagement were maintained. Patients in the final cycle also completed a System Usability Scale to evaluate the ease of use (score 0-100, with higher score indicating greater ease of use)."

Text messages and interview transcripts were analyzed using qualitative content analysis, a systematic process of coding and identifying themes and pattern in codes.  18 All transcripts were reviewed for accuracy and uploaded in NVIVO (QSR International, Doncaster, Victoria, Australia, 2020). Two independent researchers who did not participate in the contextual inquiry generated initial codes based on the interview protocol and through line-by-line review of transcripts of text messages of five patients.

So, bladder pain syndrome doesn't really sit with me.\" \u2022 \"I mostly experience it as urgency, frequency, almost as like a spasm.\" \u2022 \"Discomfort/pressure/ache is what I feel.

Having access to treatments I can do independently without having to scramble for childcare was much appreciated.\" \u2022 \"I was traveling and being a part of this program helped me manage flares on the road. I felt more confident than before that I can manage IC independently.\" Need for support from providers Supportive role of providers in promoting self-management \u2022 \"I know there is no magic cure for IC. What I want from doctors is support and guidance to learn how to live with IC. This platform is giving me the guidance I need.\" \u2022 \"Starting new treatment can be anxiety-provoking.\n\nEncouragement and empathy from the care team made a big difference.\" \u2022 \"The more doctors teach me about IC and guide me towards right treatments, the more I will be able to manage it on my own.\" \u2022 \"I have to admit: I called or messaged my doctor a lot because I didn't get to learn a lot during that first visit. But I still had so many questions about IC and what I should do. The program answered so many of my questions that I did not get to ask on that initial visit.\" \u2022 \"Between the first visit and the next scheduled visit, there was no check-in from the doctor or nurses. I tried some of the selfcare things I learned I don't think I was doing them right.\n\nUltimately the symptoms got so bad I ended up going to the emergency room. I think that a program like this 'fills in the gap' and can help a lot of other people.\" allowed them to use their \"own mind and body to manage\" and \"take charge\" of symptoms. Referring to them as \"holistic\" treatments, they wanted such treatments to be evidence-based and rejected \"herbs and supplements that have no scientific evidence.\" Interest in medications was low with several patients expressing concern about side effects. \"I'd like to avoid medications because they can mask symptoms without getting to the root of things and some of the side effects interfere with my life.\" Given high discontinuation rate of medications (urinary analgesics and amitriptyline), we removed the medication module and reminders from the platform.\n\nAnother important theme that informed self-efficacy was patients' desire to gain greater control over their social environment. The remote platform improved access and reduced interference with work-life obligations. \"When I tried to get PT, I had to jump through hoops to get it scheduled and drive far. The idea of PT videos by a pelvic floor expert delivered to me is genius.\" \u2022 Making treatment decisions together with my doctor made me feel more motivated give those treatments my all.

I didn't feel alone in figuring things out.\" \u2022 \"Even if through automated texts, I felt comforted to know that there are people who care about me and this condition.\" \u2022 \"I know I'm talking to a chatbot, really. But even that was comforting compared to what I was getting before, which is no communication.\" \u2022 \"I felt overwhelmed and isolated when I was diagnosed with IC and being told that this is a lifelong thing\u2026 This program walked me through each step and it gave me the supported that I wished for.\" Desire to avoid frequent contacts \u2022 \"I don't want to contact the doctor's office as much as they don't want to hear from me. I just wish that enough information was relayed during the clinic visit so that I don't have to call between visits.\" \u2022 \"IC patients know that we are bothering [the doctor] and interrupting [their] busy day when we send messages. But please know that this is because [the doctor is] the only person in our lives who we can turn to about IC.\" \u2022 \"I try to write down my questions so that each clinic visit is productive. That way I don't have to contact the office with questions I didn't get answered.\" Remote access also improved adherence for some patients with one patient stating that they could engage with the PT modules \"between and another could practice CBT \"without having to scramble for childcare.\" 3.3 | Need for better support from providers Patients reported that the platform provided \"encouragement and empathy\" in learning self-management skills. \"With my doctor's support, I learned how to manage [symptoms] on my own.\" A particularly important theme was patients' desire to participate in making treatment decisions. \"Making decisions together with my doctor made me feel more motivated to give those treatments my all.\" The platform filled the gap for patients who felt they had too short a visit or inadequate follow up in between visits. \"The program answered so many of my questions that I did not get to ask on that initial visit.\" \"A lot of the time doctors give you things to work on and tell you to come back in a few weeks to months. This program fills the gap between clinic visits.\" Finally, the platform reduced patients' sense of isolation. \"I didn't feel alone in figuring things out,\" and \"Even if through automated text, I felt comforted to know that there are people who care about me and this condition.\" However, patients rejected too frequent contacts. \"I think you can ask me about my symptoms less frequently. My symptoms don't change day by day.\" Five patients reported the platform helped them reduce unscheduled office and emergency room visits."

      "title": "4. | DISCUSSION",
      "text": "Using direct patient input, we developed a text messagebased platform that delivers evidence-based treatments and supportive messages to patients with IC/BPS. Patients reported that the platform provided them with greater insight into their condition, enhanced their selfmanagement skills, improved their access to treatments and providers, and reduced their sense of isolation.\n\nObjective measurements demonstrated the platform was easy to use with high rates of patient engagement and accuracy. These findings suggest that a patient centered text message-based platform that interacts with patients using a structured algorithm may be clinically useful in the management of IC/BPS. Past approaches to developing a new product included focus groups, developing, and then testing the product. This approach is inefficient for digital platforms because consumers may not understand what is possible through innovative technology. Rapid Cycle Innovation allowed us to test critical assumptions regarding a new technology quickly and in context that is, by observing patients using prototype versions. Using this method, we developed a HIPPA-compliant text message-based platform that was integrated with electronic medical records. Unlike \"apps,\" text message-based platforms are easy to access on all smart phones and are low cost to maintain.\n\nOur development process demonstrates the importance of using patient-centered terms when communicating with IC/BPS patients. Most patients preferred the term \"interstitial cystitis\" which implies an inflammatory basis over \"bladder pain syndrome\" which was viewed as carrying the stigma of a chronic pain condition. Patients emphasized the importance of \"symptom bother\" over \"symptom severity\" noting that only the most bothersome symptoms required treatment. Use of these patientcentered terms early in the development process likely contributed to high levels of patient engagement with the platform.\n\nSelf-efficacy emerged as a major concept that informed the development of our platform. Self-efficacy reflects an individual's confidence in their capacity to exert control over their own motivation, behavior and social environment.  2 Prior studies indicate that patients can achieve self-efficacy through the five key tenets self-management including problem solving, resource identification and utilization, decision making, patientprovider partnerships, and taking action.  4 In our study, patients demonstrated problem solving by taking a keen interest in the education module which discussed how negative emotions aggravate symptoms. Resource identification and utilization was reflected through patients taking advantage of improved access to care by engaging with treatment modules during their daily work-life schedule. Shared decision making emerged as a key theme. Although patients wanted to choose treatments in line with their values, they wanted guidance from providers in making evidence-based decisions. Patients had low interest in medications; however, in a prior study, patients with IC/BPS did not have a negative attitude to medications.  4 Their preference for mind-body and behavioral treatments was informed by their desire to avoid side-effects and \"take action\" by gaining control over their own motivations and behaviors.\n\nAn important benefit of the platform was that patients felt better supported by providers.\n\nBy allowing patients to choose treatment options and participate in decision making, the platform strengthened patient-provider relationship. Patients may also have felt better supported because they could access treatments such as pelvic PT with fewer in-person appointments. Finally, even though the final algorithm was automated, the weekly check-in messages made the platform interactive by allowing patients to request a call back from a provider for bothersome symptoms. Interestingly, only two patients took advantage of this option likely because the weekly messages reduced anxiety and sense of isolation which can prompt patients to seek out healthcare encounters.  22, 23 Ultimately, improved provider support encouraged patients to practice selfmanagement skills and enhanced their sense of self-efficacy in managing symptoms.\n\nStrengths of our study included direct patient input in the development of all aspects of the platform and objective criteria to determine accuracy and engagement. Our study also has several limitations. Our sample size was small, majority of our patients were White, English-speaking, college educated with moderate symptoms and these limit the generalizability of our findings. Our qualitative study focused on platform development, and we did not quantitatively measure clinical efficacy. Larger studies are required to determine the clinical efficacy of the platform in diverse group of patients with more severe symptoms and to determine if benefits are sustained after completion of the program."
