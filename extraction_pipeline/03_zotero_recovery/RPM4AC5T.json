  "title": "Effects of Mobile Text Messaging on Glycemic Control in Patients With Coronary Heart Disease and Diabetes Mellitus A Randomized Clinical Trial",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mobile health interventions may support risk factor management and are readily scalable in healthcare systems. We aim to evaluate the efficacy of a text messaging-based intervention to improve glycemic control in patients with coronary heart disease and diabetes mellitus in China. \n METHODS AND RESULTS: The CHAT-DM study (Cardiovascular Health and Texting-Diabetes Mellitus) was a parallel-group, single-blind, randomized clinical trial that included 502 patients with both coronary heart disease and diabetes mellitus from 34 hospitals in China. The intervention group (n=251) received 6 text messages per week for 6 months in addition to usual care. Messages were theory driven and culturally tailored to provide educational and motivational information on glucose monitoring, blood pressure control, medication adherence, physical activity, and lifestyle. The control group (n=251) received usual care and 2 thank you messages per month. The primary outcome was change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA 1C [hemoglobin A 1C ]) from baseline to 6 months. Secondary outcomes were change in proportion of patients achieving HbA 1C <7%, fasting blood glucose, systolic blood pressure, LDL (low-density lipoprotein) cholesterol, body mass index, and physical activity from baseline to 6 months. The end points were assessed using analyses of covariance. The follow-up rate was 99%. When compared with control group at 6 months, the intervention group had a greater reduction in HbA 1C (-0.2% versus 0.1%; P=0.003) and a greater proportion of participants who achieved HbA 1C <7% (69.3% versus 52.6%; P=0.004). Change in fasting blood glucose was larger in the intervention group (between-group difference: -0.6 mmol/L; 95% CI, -1.1 to -0.2; P=0.011), but no other outcome differences were observed. Nearly all participants reported that messages were easy to understand (97.1%) and useful (94.1%). \n CONCLUSIONS: A text message intervention resulted in better glycemic control in patients with diabetes mellitus and coronary heart disease. While the mechanism of this benefit remains to be determined, the results suggest that a simple, culturally sensitive mobile text messaging program may provide an effective and feasible way to improve disease self-management.",

      "text": "he prevalence of diabetes mellitus (DM) is growing rapidly throughout the world, with the fastest increases during the past decade in low-and middle-income countries. By 2040, an estimated 642 million people will be living with DM-an increase of >50% when compared with the present day.  1  China is currently experiencing the world's largest epidemic of DM. The nationwide prevalence of DM is 10.9%, and only one-third of these individuals have adequate glycemic control.  [1] [2] 2] [3]  Among middle-aged patients with DM, the prevalence of coronary heart disease (CHD) is particularly high, ranging from 12% to 31%, and cardiovascular-related care accounts for the largest proportion of DM expenditures.  1, [4] [5] 5] [6]  Glucose control can reduce microvascular complications of DM and may improve clinical outcomes for patients with DM and CHD.  7 M self-management education and support, focused on risk factor control and lifestyle modification, is a cornerstone of secondary prevention in patients with DM and CHD.  8  Traditional education strategies have included face-to-face visits, telephone consultations, and health seminars. However, it is often difficult to generalize and implement such interventions nationally because of the high costs of organization, demanding labor investment, and limited access to health services. 9  Given the high burden of DM in China and the limited resources avail-able for preventive efforts, there is a need to develop simple scalable and cost-effective alternatives to provide patients with self-management support.\n\nMobile phones are pervasive and widely used to schedule alerts and reminders, highlighting the potential for mobile health technology to circumvent the practical barriers of traditional healthcare office visits. Because of the ubiquity and convenience of mobile phones, text messaging is among the most frequently used mobile communication methods worldwide, with \u2248200 000 mobile phone messages sent every second in China. A text messaging-based intervention could, therefore, offer a scalable and powerful means by which to deliver health information and potentially improve care and outcomes. Previous studies focusing on text message interventions showed inconsistent results, and some of them suggested that these interventions may improve clinical risk factor control and lifestyle in patients with cardiovascular diseases or DM.  [10] [11] 1] [12] [13] [14] [15]  Evidence showed that most of these studies were from single centers, and many were underpowered and nonrandomized. In addition, most trials have targeted only 1 condition; however, patients with cardiovascular disease or DM are usually managing multiple conditions that require following several lifestyle and treatment recommendations. Further, few studies have examined the efficacy of such text message interventions among high-risk populations with CHD and DM. More data are needed to address these gaps and scientifically evaluate text message-based disease management interventions among diverse populations in low-and middle-income countries.\n\nIn the CHAT-DM study (Cardiovascular Health and Texting-Diabetes Mellitus), we investigated the effects of a theory-driven, culturally tailored text messaging intervention to improve glycemic control, cardiovascular risk profile, and lifestyle modification among patients with known CHD and DM who were discharged from hospitals across China."

      "text": "The intervention was designed as a text messaging-based secondary prevention program with the regular automatic delivery of text messages according to a prespecified sending algorithm. Participants in the intervention group received 6 messages per week during the 6-month study period in addition to standard treatment. The control group received 2 thank you text messages (without risk factor modification support) per month, as well as standard treatment. All messages were randomly selected by our software system from relevant topic areas and sent at one of 3 random times (9:00 am, 12:00 pm, or 4:00 pm) during weekends and weekdays, excluding Monday to provide participants a break. Patients in the intervention group received one of each of the following message types per week: information about CHD and DM, glucose monitoring and control, blood pressure control, medication adherence, physical activity, and lifestyle recommendations, including diet and foot care. All participants received a welcome message, a birthday greeting, and a follow-up reminder during the study period. Some messages were personalized with the participant's preferred name. We provide examples of the text messages in Table I in the Data Supplement.\n\nA multidisciplinary team of cardiologists, endocrinologists, psychologists, nurses, linguists, and patients developed the text message bank through a systematic and iterative approach.  16 Messages were drafted based on existing evidence-based guidelines and standards of care, and they incorporated behavioral change techniques to provide advice, motivation, and support. A pilot study was conducted to elicit patient feedback on the messages, and the text bank was updated to improve clarity and practical usefulness. Messages were also modified to increase their applicability to the Chinese culture and compatibility with Chinese values. For example, some messages used aphorisms and catchy rhyme schemes to make them more appealing to patients.\n\nOn study enrollment, patients participated in training sessions with research staff to ensure they were capable of receiving, reading, and sending text messages with their mobile phones. Participants were informed that they could withdraw from the study by responding to any of the text messages with a specific character. NCCD researchers monitored the message delivery status, assessing the proportion of messages successfully delivered and reasons for any message failures. When a message went undelivered, a research assistant contacted the patient or his relative/friend to confirm or update the correct phone number. Most of the text messages were unidirectional, with no reply anticipated. Bidirectional text messages requesting blood glucose measurements and reports on medication usage were sent at weekly intervals to assess patient engagement. Central research staff monitored patient responses without any interactive communication. All text messages were sent and managed through a proprietary software platform project (Gener-health Co, Ltd, China). This web-based platform could also be used to monitor project progress, as well as to provide management support for hospitals, staff members, equipment, and sampling collection. To ensure confidentiality of all personal information, the data confidentiality policies of the NCCD on data collection, storage, and analysis were strictly imposed."

Secondary outcomes included change in the proportion of patients achieving HbA 1C <7%, plasma fasting blood glucose (FBG), LDL (lowdensity lipoprotein) cholesterol (LDL-C), systolic blood pressure (SBP), body mass index (BMI), and physical activity at 6 months. Exploratory outcomes included health status at 6 months measured by the Seattle Angina Questionnaire  20  and EuroQol 5-Dimensional Questionnaire.  21 ata were collected at baseline and the 6-month followup visit for all participants. Age, sex, socioeconomic status, current medications, and hospitalizations that occurred during follow-up were collected by self-report questionnaires. Height, weight, and blood pressure were measured by standardized procedures. Blood pressure was measured on the right upper arm using an electronic device (HEM-7111; Omron) and calculated as the average of 2 resting, seated measurements taken at least 5 minutes apart. If the difference between the 2 SBP or diastolic blood pressure readings was >5 mm Hg, a third measurement was performed, and the mean value of the 3 readings was used.  22 Physical activity was measured in metabolic equivalents/(minute\u00d7week) using the short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire.  23 Health status was measured using the short versions of Seattle Angina Questionnaire and EuroQol 5-Dimensional Questionnaire. Blood sample tests, including levels of HbA 1C , FBG, and LDL-C, were analyzed at the central NCCD laboratory in Beijing by trained researchers according to the manufacturer's instructions. For example, HbA 1C was measured using the high-performance liquid chromatography technique with the ADAMS A 1C HA-8180 (ARKRAY, Inc, Japan). The mean intra-and interassay coefficient of variation was <3%.\n\nAt the last follow-up visit, patients in the intervention group were asked a series of questions to evaluate the acceptability and feasibility of the text messaging program. The questions mainly queried the usefulness and ease of understanding the text messages, the total number of messages read, as well as preferred frequency and total length of the program."

We used frequencies with percentages to describe categorical variables and means with SDs to describe continuous variables unless skewed; then we presented as medians and interquartile ranges. The primary analysis used analysis of covariance, and the same methods were used in the analysis of the continuous secondary outcomes. For categorical secondary outcomes, log-binomial regression was used to compare groups and calculate relative risk of outcomes at 6 months (ie, proportions of patients achieving HbA 1C <7.0%). To better understand and explore the intervention effect, we conducted a secondary analysis comparing continuous outcomes at 6 months using analysis of covariance. Additionally, we performed prespecified subgroup analyses of outcomes by age (<60 and \u226560 years), sex (male and female), area (urban and rural), education (\u226412 and >12 years), smoking status (current smoker or not), and tertile of baseline HbA 1C (4.0%-6.2%, 6.3%-7.4%, and 7.5%-13.5%).

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "In this multicenter randomized trial of patients with both CHD and DM in China, a simple, low-cost, automated text messaging program resulted in modest improvements in glycemic control over usual care. The theoretically based and culturally tailored text messages were readily accepted by participants, with the overwhelming majority regarding the intervention as useful, the messages readable, and the approach to contact appropriate. The findings highlight the potential utility of this wide-scale, simple approach to augment existing public health services for patients with CHD and DM. Downloaded from  http://ahajournals.org  by on July 16, 2025\n\nIn our study, there was a 0.3% mean difference between the intervention and control groups for the change in HbA 1C between baseline and 6 months. The magnitude of improvement in HbA 1C observed in this study is consistent with the average reduction reported in previous mobile health studies  13, 25, 26  and with the effect size reported in the recent SMS4BG study.  10 espite failure to meet the prespecified sample size of 500 patients, the SMS4BG study showed a significant 4.23 mmol/mol reduction in HbA 1C level (equivalent to an absolute reduction of 0.4%). These data suggest that mobile text messaging is a promising approach to improve glucose control. The effect in this study was not only statistically significant but also similar to that of low-dose glucose-lowering medications such as glycosidase inhibitors and glinides. More patients achieved the guideline target of HbA 1C <7% in the intervention group as compared with the control group. More importantly, our study also demonstrated that text messages to people with already low baseline HbA 1C were safe and did not result in further reduction, which may be associated with hypoglycemia; instead, HbA 1C levels remained stable and were no different from the control group. For patients with borderline elevated HbA 1C , there was a slight decrease. Promisingly, for those in the highest HbA 1C tertile at baseline, there was a meaningful and significant difference of 0.75% between the intervention and control groups for the reduction in HbA 1C from baseline to 6 months. These findings suggest that text messaging to improve glycemic control may achieve clinical benefit for people with a range of HbA 1C levels at baseline without incurring risk.\n\nThe mechanism of the glycemic reduction is not clear. Lifestyle modifications such as stricter dietary control and emotion management were particularly important modules in our text message program and may have contributed to the glycemic improvements.  27 In addition, the text messages reminded patients to monitor their glucose regularly, which may have improved their self-efficacy and resulted in them paying closer attention to their glucose levels; in turn, they may have been more likely to modify their lifestyle or take additional medications.  8 The results of this study have the potential to be clinically relevant in daily practice, especially among patients with poorly controlled DM, where the benefit was the greatest. The difference reflected the mild lowering in HbA 1C in the intervention group and mild increase in the control group, despite the increase in oral antidiabetic medications and insulin in both arms during the 6-month study period. The hospital effect was tested and found to have minimal effect on the intervention efficacy. Therefore, the observed changes in HbA 1C reinforce the need for a deeper understanding of the mechanisms whereby these changes occur.\n\nWe did not detect differences between the intervention and control groups in BMI, SBP, or LDL-C.

Additionally, fluctuations in SBP may have occurred as a result of other factors such as the white coat effect in clinics.\n\nThe results were consistent with the CHAT trial, which did not result in differences in SBP as the primary end point of that trial. Certainly, further trials of text messaging interventions, as well as a greater understanding of the mechanisms by which interventions achieve success, are warranted.\n\nThe CHAT-DM study contributes to the existing scientific literature in several ways. Although several previous studies have shown the effectiveness of mobile text messaging for improving risk profiles and modifying health behaviors, to the best of our knowledge, this is the first randomized controlled trial exploring the efficacy of a text messaging intervention in a high-risk population with CHD and DM in a low-or middle-income country. In addition, most prior text messaging intervention studies that focused on DM management or health behaviors were conducted at single centers and had small sample sizes ranging from 18 to 366 participants.  10, 28 To date, our study was the largest randomized trial to evaluate the efficacy of text messages targeting multiple risk factors among patients with both CHD and DM. It was also conducted at 34 hospitals across a large and geographically diverse country, making the results more generalizable. Furthermore, the text messages in our study were theory driven and culturally sensitive. The texts were iteratively designed based on evidencebased guidelines and behavioral change techniques, which promoted the efficacy of the intervention,  28, 29  and they were further improved through user testing and a pilot study that gathered patient advice on the potential impact of the content and preferred method for receiving messages. The text messages were specifically tailored to the Chinese patient population. Few prior studies have been grounded in behavioral change techniques and undergone such a comprehensive design process. Additionally, few studies have included objective outcome measures, and there were concerns about potential bias associated with different measurement methods or self-reported outcomes. We assessed blood sample outcomes at a central laboratory, which ensured consistency and accuracy in the evaluation. Finally, unlike previous studies limited to patients with poor DM control,  10, 13, 25  we conducted our intervention among all adults with defined DM, regardless of the current glucose level, thereby supporting the potential use of the text messaging programs in DM postdischarge management in a wider population.\n\nThis study has important public health implications. Patients with CHD and DM are at high risk for mortality and major vascular events, and achievement of secondary prevention goals is paramount. Appropriate glycemic control, including reduction in HbA 1C , is a therapeutic target to reduce the risk of diabetic complications and poor outcomes.  7, 30, 31 Our text messaging program, which was available on any mobile phone, provided a simple and effective means to help improve glycemic control. The cost to provide such a text message intervention was low because implementation did not require ownership of a smart phone or participant familiarity with a particular operating system nor did it require extra personnel contact or investment from healthcare professionals. Moreover, our text messages were highly acceptable to this population. Capitalizing on the exponential growth in mobile phone usage over the past decade, a text messaging program offers a potential solution to increase the reach of DM self-management support and may provide a means to better address the burgeoning healthcare demand-capacity imbalance in the context of the growing burden of chronic conditions. The low cost, simple implementation, and wide scalability of this nonpharmacological intervention could serve as a powerful tool to transform worldwide delivery of health services and improve health.\n\nOur study should be interpreted in the context of several limitations. First, although our text messages provided lifestyle guidance regarding food, recipes, emotions, and other risk management behaviors, there was no specific measurement indicator about the effectiveness of the intervention on lifestyle changes. Additional research is needed to reach conclusions about the mechanism underlying this relationship. Second, our study outcomes mainly focused on risk factor control and health behavior modification instead of clinical outcomes such as mortality and vascular events. However, sustained improvement in risk factors is the primary step in managing chronic disease, and it is expected that it would favorably affect clinical outcomes. Third, owing to time restrictions, we were unable to follow-up participants for a longer duration (ie, \u22651 year). However, the study follow-up time is comparable to many other trials such as TEXT-ME and SMS4BG,  10, 11  and difference at 6 months could be an indication of sustained change in the future. Fourth, we did not collect information about the type of DM. As a result, we are not able to compare treatment effects between type I and type II DM. Fifth, we had a relatively low percentage of women who participated in the study (17.5%), which is consistent with the proportion of women enrolled in a parent studythe China PEACE prospective cohort from which we mainly recruited (20%). We did not specifically enroll patients according to their sex although proportion of women in future studies should be considered. Sixth, the results of the subgroup should be interpreted with caution given that the sample size is not adequate to exclude clinically meaningful differences between subgroups. Finally, physical activity and medication treatment were measured via self-report. Although this may introduce potential recall bias and social desirability bias, we believe such bias would be balanced across the intervention and control groups. Moreover, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire has been validated in different populations and used widely across the world, and participants were required to take their medications to the clinic for study staff to enter their current medications and not to disclose their group allocation at the time of recruitment and follow-up, minimizing the risk of potential bias."
