  "title": "Social Balance Ball: Designing and Evaluating an Exergame That Promotes Social Interaction between Older and Younger Players",
  "abstract": "As the population ages rapidly, there is a strong focus on the healthy aging of older adults. A central part of healthy aging is keeping people connected in later social life. Exergames are recommended as one of the coping strategies to help improve health and quality of life in older adults. In our study, we developed an exergame called Social Balance Ball to engage older and younger people to play together, encouraging social interaction between generations. From May to July 2021, we evaluated this exergame in Shanghai, China, performing a user experiment with 18 unfamiliar young-old pairs under three test conditions (virtual player, mediated human player, and co-located human player). To evaluate the exergame, our main findings demonstrated that participants felt significantly perceived social interaction in mediated play and co-located play than in virtual play. Overall, older participants perceived significantly higher social interaction than younger participants. In this study, we contribute (1) empirical research findings on how the Social Balance Ball exergame enhances social interaction in generations; (2) design implications for informing future design and development of social exergames.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "The global population is aging rapidly; between 2015 and 2050, the proportion of older adults will almost double  (WHO, 2021) . Globally, people aged 60 or older are growing faster than in other age groups  (WHO, 2019) . As the population ages, there is often a greater focus on the healthy aging of older adults. As defined by  WHO (2020) , healthy aging is \"the process of developing and maintaining the functional ability that enables well-being in older age.\" Physical well-being is an important part of healthy aging, and fall is one of the greatest threats to the physical health of older adults  (WHO, 2014) , and fall prevention strategies, such as balance training have been shown to be effective in reducing the rate and risk of fall in older adults  (Gillespie et al., 2012) . Another part of healthy aging involves keeping social connections, which are central to older adults' well-being  (Macdonald et al., 2021) . The power of a social network can \"enhance a senior's longevity, quality of life, protect against functional decline and promote resilience\"  (WHO, 2015) . However, as people age, they become more likely to reduce social interaction and almost unavoidably feel lonely. Emotional and social isolation in older adults can be caused by many factors, such as the loss of family and friends, poor health, and reduced income  (Zhang et al., 2017) . Social trends, such as less intergenerational living and less community cohesion also play a role  (Bernard, 2013) . Additionally, in recent years, due to the ongoing impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, older adults are advised to maintain social distancing and stay at home or in institutions most of the time. They lack physical activities and cannot see friends and family members as usual. Such a situation exacerbates the social loneliness of older adults, adversely affecting their physical and mental health.\n\nTo address these aging-related issues, an exergame [i.e., the combination of exercise and video games  (Bogost, 2007) ] is recommended as a coping strategy to help improve the health of older adults, especially during the COVID-19 quarantine period  (Viana & De Lira, 2020) . As stated by  Loos and Kaufman (2018) , while exergaming is universally loved and has benefits for mental health and physical activity of older adults, it remains unclear whether the outcomes of exergaming interventions have a strong evidence base. The majority of previous studies focused on examining the efficacy of the exergames in improving balance and reducing the risk of falls in older adults  (Clark & Kraemer, 2009; Garcia et al., 2018; Pisan et al., 2013) . For example,  Clark and Kraemer (2009)  investigated the effect of a commercial exergame to address balance dysfunction in older adults in a nursing home who were at risk for falls. Pisan et al. (2013)  developed the Microsoft-Kinect-based step training system to predict the loss of balance for older adults under cognitive load. Garcia et al. (2018)  evaluated a fall prevention game's compliance, fun, and ease of use to determine its suitability for use as an unsupervised home training tool for older adults. However, all of these balance training exergames are designed to be played alone. Older adults like playing with other people in a social context  (Loos & Kaufman, 2018; Loos & Zonneveld, 2016; Villani et al., 2017) . Additionally, a narrative literature review  (Loos, 2017)  found that social interaction is one of the most important factors in older adults playing exergames.\n\nThus, improvements in well-being should not be limited to older adults' physical or cognitive health but must also extend to the social domain  (Rice et al., 2013) . For this research purpose, we conducted an empirical study that focuses uniquely on the social dimension of the exergame (including social interaction, social connectedness, emotional state, etc.). Generally, intergenerational interactions consist of two types: (1) older people interact with younger people in the family, or  (2)  interact with unfamiliar younger people  (Salehzadeh Niksirat et al., 2022) . Unlike most existing research studies regarding social intergenerational family entertainment  (Fuchsberger et al., 2012; Khoo et al., 2009; Salehzadeh Niksirat et al., 2022) , our design purpose is to enhance social interaction among unfamiliar older and younger people. As reported by  Thang (2006) , family interactions reduce due to lifestyle and family structure changes, which fosters new synergies in intergenerational exchanges between non-family age groups. Thus, we focus on evaluating strangers (rather than family members), motivated by an interest in understanding how the exergame can be leveraged in community practice to encourage social interaction.\n\nIn our study, an exergame called Social Balance Ball was implemented to engage older and younger people to play together. We examine the impact of the Social Balance Ball on the mental and social well-being of older and younger participants to understand how this exergame can best promote social interaction between generations. We use three different modes to test the level of social presence of the co-player as a determinant of player experience. Thus, the system was implemented with three conditions: (1) virtual player, (2) mediated human player (i.e., participants played online), and (3) colocated human player (i.e., participants played face-to-face). In the virtual player mode, the counterpart's game avatar appears on the game interface but two remote human players do not play together. In fact, in this mode, two remote players control the game independently, while in the mediated human player mode, two remote players use their own Social Balance Balls to control the game avatar to play together. Virtual player mode is a control condition in which there is no social interaction between two human players. A within-subjects study of 36 participants, including 18 older and 18 younger participants, was conducted in Shanghai, China, from May 2021 to July 2021. We compared three working modes of Social Balance Ball in terms of social presence, social connectedness, and emotional state. Our work can contribute to the HCI research community in two main ways:\n\n1. Empirical evidence suggests that balance training exergames in social settings, whether online or in-person, can have positive effects on intergenerational interactions between unfamiliar younger and old players;\n\n2. Our findings also aid in HCI design and shed light on innovations in intergenerational balance training systems that promote physical, mental, and emotional well-being in older adults.\n\nIn this article, we investigate the primary research question about how the Social Balance Ball exergame affects intergenerational interactions. More specifically, we are interested in which specific factors can influence intergenerational interactions in social balance training games, such as different social modes, different perceptions of older and younger people, or the impact of gender on exergames. All of these have rarely been discussed in previous studies. We, therefore, address the following four sub-research questions:\n\nRQ1: How does the Social Balance Ball impact the social interaction of all players in three conditions? RQ2: Do older and younger players perceive social interaction differently in this exergame? RQ3: Does gender affect the perceived social interaction of players in this exergame? RQ4: How do the findings from this study inform us about designing exergames in a social context? For RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3, we presented three relevant hypotheses in the experimental design: H1: All players perceive significantly different social interactions under the three different modes of the Social Balance Ball.\n\nH2: Older and younger players perceive significantly different social interactions in the Social Balance Ball exergame.\n\nH3: Male and female players perceive significantly different social interactions in the Social Balance Ball exergame.\n\nFor RQ4, we use semi-structured interviews to gather qualitative feedback from all players on their attitudes, perceptions, and design recommendations for the Social Balance Ball."

      "title": "Older adults and balance training exergames",
      "text": "Exergames have the potential to facilitate long-term exercise for older adults. Traditional balance training includes booklets or videos demonstrating training procedures, but it lacks feedback that older adults do not know their performance and the effects of the training. Nowadays new technologies, such as immersive VR/AR experiences have been applied to older adults, showing potential for fall prevention or balance training. Rings et al. (2020)  implemented the VR exergame for fall prevention and found it promising in motivating exercise. Promising results were also found in an experiment involving older adults and therapists using an exergame aimed at stroke rehabilitation  (Donker et al., 2015) . Older adults thought the exergame facilitates their training, while therapists mentioned the effectiveness and ease of use. Nawaz et al. (2014)  assessed older adults' user experience and preference of the exergames, in which older adults indicated the motivational effects of the exergame, and they expected the exergame to provide challenging tasks and present the qualities of their exercise. Some researchers also focused on the long-term usage of the exergame and found that older adults playing the exergame are more likely to reach the exercise requirements and adhere to the training plan compared to those who used the traditional balance training  (Uzor & Baillie, 2014) . One of the reasons is that exergames can provide feedback about training to keep older adults' confidence in the process and appeal to them with visual feedback, such as interesting gaming  (Brickwood et al., 2016) . Additionally, among the many advantages brought by exergames, social interaction of the exergames still needs to be studied. For example,  Pecchioni and Osmanovic (2018)  revealed connections between social interaction and the long duration of gameplay in the generic games. To achieve an improvement in long-term balance training, social interaction should be considered in such an exergame. In particular, older adults showed more exercise intentions while playing exergames with younger people  (Xu et al., 2016) . They may also look forward to social interaction with younger generations because it will make them feel young and energetic, and they consider young people are more aware of the present society and trending  (Fuchsberger et al., 2012; Leung et al., 2012) . Thus, exergames providing proper feedback can make the training more rewarding while social interaction of the game facilitates long-term gameplay."

      "text": "Social exergames have many advantages. Caro et al. (2018)  found that pre-existing positive relationships, such as friendships positively affect physical activity levels of players when playing social action-based games compared to strangers, and this effect increases when more game actions are amplified. However, the level of overall physical activity declined after four weeks. Rooksby et al. (2015)  developed a mobile application called Pass the Ball to enable a turn-taking mechanism. Based on a \"research through design\" approach, they found that taking turns can increase the level of enjoyment, communication, and social interaction between players. In addition, many previous studies have explored how exergames can facilitate social play in computer-mediated environments  (Mueller et al., 2009 (Mueller et al., , 2010)) , and how social elements can be incorporated into exergames to increase game engagement  (Mueller et al., 2017) . Mueller et al. (2009)  discussed how social interaction and exergames complement each other to achieve a win-win situation. They conducted a qualitative case study to show that a social exergame supported by varying intensities of exertion activity can convey meaning to players in a social setting. Mueller et al. (2010)  conducted a qualitative study with a social exergame \"Table Tennis for Three.\" They found a significant theme: anticipation, the idea that the physical actions of other players create anticipation for the development of the game, which is an important part of social exergames. While considering physical interaction,  Mueller et al. (2017)  focused on the dimension of bodily interplay: parallel and interdependent play in the social exergame and its affect on players' experiences. By studying different coupling of bodily interplay dimension, they offered tools and guidance for designing social exergames with better gaming experience. This section discusses the benefits of social exergames, which can provide opportunities for new ways of intergenerational interaction."

      "text": "Intergenerational interaction is a promising way to promote an active lifestyle  (Flora & Faulkner, 2007) , improve moods  (Newman et al., 1995) , self-esteem  (Kessler & Staudinger, 2007) , and life satisfaction in older adults  (Kessler & Staudinger, 2007; Powers et al., 2013) , as well as strengthen family bonds  (Bengtson, 2001) . Intergenerational ties can increase well-being by providing older adults opportunities to feel young, rediscover their abilities, and share joy with younger generations  (Zhang et al., 2017) . As digital devices have become a core part of everyday life  (Bogost, 2007; Sarachan, 2012) , intergenerational games get increased attention in HCI. For example,  Costa and Veloso (2016)  pointed to the potential of digital games to strengthen intergenerational interactions, such as bridging intergenerational gaps, fostering a sense of togetherness, and stimulating intergenerational awareness.\n\nMost studies explored intergenerational games based on family relationships (e.g., father-son, grandmother, and granddaughter) as it is the most common type of intergenerational relationship  (Salehzadeh Niksirat et al., 2022) . Pecchioni and Osmanovic (2018)  investigated the potential of cooperative video gameplay to establish or restore intergenerational family relationships. Findings suggested that intergenerational games as a shared activity positively impacted family relationships by increasing relationship closeness between grandparents and grandchildren. Fuchsberger et al. (2012)  developed a novel online-intergenerational game for geographically separated grandparents and grandchildren to enhance family ties. Furthermore,  Cantwell et al. (2012)  designed and implemented a prototype for intergenerational exergaming. It offers personalized difficulty levels so that old and young can work better together or compete against each other.\n\nA growing number of HCI studies also explored the benefits of playing such games in non-family user groups. Xu et al. (2016)  studied the effects of exergames on older adults' exercise intentions. They conducted a three-week experiment to compare the effects of playing the exergame among young-old and old-old conditions. Findings demonstrated that older adults in the young-old condition felt more motivated to play the exergame than those in the old-old condition. Zhang et al. (2017)  recruited five intergenerational pairs to play two Wii games and record their gameplay and conversations. During game sessions, older participants acted as students, followers, and storytellers, while younger participants acted as teachers, leaders, encouragers, and caregivers. Their conversations were analyzed by the Conversation Analysis (CA) method which is a systematic analysis of social interaction. In this method, social interactions are recorded in the form of video, then researchers construct detailed transcriptions from the recordings containing both verbal and non-verbal conduct. After transcription, patterns of interaction can be found by inductive analysis. Based on the analysis, the researchers identify models to describe these patterns to enhance or replace initial hypotheses. Findings revealed that cooperative gameplay could promote intergenerational interactions and prosocial behaviors of participants. Seaborn et al. (2019)  developed two versions of intergenerational games to test young-old pairs. They found that intergenerational shared activity can promote engagement and empathy between older adults and young people.\n\nThis section highlights the value of playing cooperative exergames between old and young, especially in the nonfamily setting. Studies mentioned above have investigated various video games and exergames in the intergenerational context. However, designing balance training exergames for intergenerational pairs is still missing. Thus, our study focuses on the design and implementation of the balance training exergame and the effects of the exergame on intergenerational interactions."

      "text": "The initial version of the Social Balance Ball was created by a student design team. As suggested by  Morat et al. (2019) , an unstable surface was helpful for balance training and motor skills relevant to preventing falls. Therefore, the prototype in our study used an unstable surface to provide better balance training and other features like visual feedback to appeal to older adults to play for the long term. Detailed descriptions of design concepts and system implementation have been reported in a previous study  (Kaisar et al., 2021) . Here, we briefly introduce the prototype design. The user can control a digital game by using the Social Balance Ball. The prototype consists of one acrylic layer (5 mm thick) on the top for the user to step on, which is laser cut to roundness (A \u00bc 460 mm), with a foot-shaped non-slip mat indicating the right position for standing. The prototype includes an Arduino microcontroller, a blue-tooth device, a gyroscope, and a portable battery. To ensure the safety of older adults, a bracket with two armrests is added to the system. In a revised version, we use a mature accelerometer (WT901BLE5.0C) to increase the accuracy of the interaction for a good user experience. The accelerometer is attached beneath the acrylic board and connects to the computer with a wire. The computer sharing screen with the big TV screen can provide a good gaming experience. Figures  1  and  2  present the structure of the Social Balance Ball and system overview, respectively."

      "title": "User interface design",
      "text": "Game design has three modes consisting of virtual play, mediated play, and co-located play. Despite the difference in modes, the workflows are similar. Firstly, choose a mode and a game avatar. Secondly, think of a name for the team (i.e., in mediated play and co-located play) or the player (i.e., in virtual play), then there is a guide to introduce the game's basic control. Finally, the game begins, and the performance is given. Background music runs throughout the game; whenever a team gains or loses points, there is the corresponding audio feedback.\n\nThe graphic guide (Figure  3 ) at the beginning of the game suggests the simple binding between the avatar and the tangible device. When a player steps on the board and tilts the board direction forward, the game avatar moves vertically upward on the 2D screen, and vice versa. Similarly, when the player tilts to their left or right, the avatar moves correspondingly. In mediated play and co-located play, the team is made up of an older adult and a young person who needs to think of a name for their team, while in virtual play, the player takes a name for themselves. Therefore, in the end, the performance of the exergame is attached to the team or the player. 3.1.2.1. Virtual play. Two participants play the exergame in different places. They know each other's existence because the counterpart's avatar appears in the bottom left corner of the digital game's interface. There is no elastic rope connecting them. In the virtual play, the player controls the avatar to collect the point for themselves.\n\n3.1.2.2. Mediated play and co-located play. Both modes share the same digital user interface: the white elastic rope between two avatars indicates a solid social bonding between two participants during exergaming (Figure  4 ). The mechanism is that two players form an area with the elastic rope which connects their avatars. While players increase the area, the possibility of getting points is similar to losing them. Two participants can use the Social Balance Ball to control the distance between two avatars. Then they will control the game avatars cooperatively to collect as many points as they can in the given time (6 min). Anyone with two avatars or the white elastic rope that touches the big yellow five-pointed star (BYS) will get three points for the team score (total score). Otherwise, the big dark-blue solid circle (BDC) is the opposite of the BYS. In addition, there are a little yellow five-pointed star (LYS) and a little darkblue solid circle (LDC). When the game ends, the result of their performance and rank compared to other teams are given (Figure  5 ). The total score and smiling faces are calculated based on the following rationale:\n\nThis article focuses on the cooperation genre of exergame, and there should be an indicator of cooperation performance  (Sakai et al., 2016) . Therefore, the algorithm of the total score combined with the elastic band is designed such that to reflect the cooperation performance. Two players cannot get too close or too far, and this requires two players to cooperate. Because there is an elastic band between two players, and together they form an area that collects or loses points when encountered with correspondent UI elements (BYS, LYS, BDC, LDC)."

Based on four research questions in Section One, we proposed three hypotheses regarding exergame modes, participant roles, and gender differences. Additionally, we discussed the implications of designing exergaming technology to support intergenerational interaction.\n\nWe mainly formulated the hypotheses regarding how exergame modes (virtual vs. mediated vs. co-located play) would affect participants' social interaction. Specifically, according to RQ1, RQ2, and RQ3, we present three relevant hypotheses for the experiment. RQ4 is answered by qualitative data collected from post-experiment interviews.\n\nH1: All participants perceive significantly different levels of social interactions under the three different modes of the Social Balance Ball exergame.\n\nWe expect participants to perceive higher levels of social interaction and positive feelings in both the mediated human player mode and the co-located human player mode (i.e., the human players interact) than in the virtual player mode (i.e., the human players do not interact). Since participants in the co-located setting can perceive a richer social interaction  (Gajadhar et al., 2008) , including both nonverbal and verbal cues, this mode is expected to have the best performance.\n\nH2: Older and younger participants perceive significantly different social interactions in the Social Balance Ball exergame.\n\nH3: Male and female participants perceive significantly different social interactions in the Social Balance Ball exergame."

According to the level of social presence of the co-player, it has three conditions:\n\n(1) virtual play (i.e., two remote human players not playing together despite the presence of co-player's game avatar); (2) mediated play (i.e., two remote human players playing the exergame online together); (3) co-located play (i.e., two face-to-face human players playing the exergame together). In this experiment, mediated play and co-located play are considered due to the following reasons:\n\n1. Because of the coronavirus disease impact, older adults are limited in social distance and must stay indoors. In such situations, online exergames provide them an opportunity to engage in physical activity and establish social connectedness with younger people at a remote distance. 2. We want to investigate whether playing the face-to-face exergame enhances social interaction between older adults living in the elderly home (or institutions) and younger people working or living around.\n\nThe second independent variable is the role of participants. This variable is treated as a between-subjects factor. It has two conditions: (1) older and (  2 ) younger participants.\n\nThe third independent variable is gender. This variable is treated as a between-subjects factor. We want to know whether gender could influence social interaction. It has two conditions: (1) male and (2) female."

This method was chosen due to our purpose of establishing a set of structured, systematic categories (themes)  (Braun & Clarke, 2006) . We followed six phases of thematic analysis, which included (1) becoming familiar with the data, (2) generating initial code, (3) searching for themes, (4) reviewing themes, (5) defining and naming themes, and (6) making the report  (Braun & Clarke, 2006) . All the interviews were audiorecorded. They were transcribed verbatim through the online speech-to-text software ( www.iflytek.com ) and manually proofread by the first author. Quotes were selected from the interview transcript regarding how participants perceived this exergame and their suggestions for improvements to generate rich empirical knowledge for future design research. Two coders (i.e., the first and second authors) analyzed qualitative data. The coders explained and argued with each other about the initial coding results, and discrepancies were resolved by discussion between the two coders."

With an alpha of 0.05 and a power of 0.80, the estimated sample size required for this effect size is approximately N \u00bc 31 for this withinbetween group interaction comparison. We also considered using a similar sample size from the study testing social interactions between blind and sighted people, consisting of 20 pairs of participants (N \u00bc 40)  (Qiu et al., 2020a (Qiu et al., , 2020b)) . Finally, we recruited a total of 36 participants, consisting of 18 old (M age \u00bc 64.94, SD \u00bc 3.46) and 18 young (M age \u00bc 22.06, SD \u00bc 3.21). The selection of older participants is based on four criteria: (a) their age ranges from 55 to 70; (b) they should at least have a junior high school education and higher to ensure sufficient ability to answer the written questionnaires; (c) they can speak Mandarin Chinese with \"no bad accent,\" to guarantee no oral communication barrier with participants and the experimenters; (d) they do not have any medically diagnosed cognitive, motor and visual impairments. We contacted Ying Chun Neighborhood Committee nearby Shanghai Jiao Tong University to recruit older participants. The neighborhood committee director helped us to post the recruitment information on the WeChat group of older volunteers. The researchers invited older volunteers interested in this study to attend a face-toface appointment in the Neighborhood Committee Office to register their participation information. Younger participants are university students, including freshmen to doctoral students. Typically, their age range is between 17 and 35 years old, which belongs to the age group of young people. The whole experiment process is time-consuming, and university students are generally busy with classes, so participants should ensure that they have enough time to participate in the experiment. We posted the recruitment information on the university website ( www.tongqu.me ) to find qualified student participants at Shanghai Jiao Tong University.\n\nOlder and younger participants were strangers. In the mediated and co-located plays, they were grouped in pairs and not familiar with each other. Each team consisted of an older and a younger participant of the same gender to avoid any possible heterosexual effect influencing their emotional feelings during communication. Compensation for each participant was 100 CNY for one and a half hours.\n\nAside from participants' basic information, we also collected information regarding their situation of doing exercises and receiving social support in their daily lives from pre-test questionnaires (Table  1 ). The Lubben Social Network Scale (LSNS-6)  (Lubben et al., 2006)  was used to test whether there was a significant difference in social support between older and younger participants at baseline. An abbreviated version of LSNS-6 included six items with two subscales (Family and Friendships). Family refers to the family social network, including the people related by birth or marriage. Friendships refer to the friendship social network consisting of all participants' friends (e.g., people who live in the neighborhood). From the data analysis, we observed that older participants (M \u00bc 7.94, SD \u00bc 3.21) had a larger family social network than younger participants (M \u00bc 7.22, SD \u00bc 2.78). This difference was not significant t(34) \u00bc 0.72, p \u00bc .48. Meanwhile, older participants (M \u00bc 9.28, SD \u00bc 2.40) had a larger friendship social network than younger participants (M \u00bc 8.94, SD \u00bc 2.62). This difference was also not significant t(34) \u00bc 0.40, p \u00bc .69. These statistical results are not significant, indicating that there were no significant differences between older and younger participants for their initial social network of family and friendships."

      "title": "Setup",
      "text": "User experiments were conducted in a usability lab inside Neobay, located nearby Shanghai Jiao Tong University. Participants stood on the Social Balance Ball, around 1.6 m away from a 65-inch TV screen. One experimenter stood next to the older participant during exergaming to guarantee his/her safety. Compared with the previous version of the prototype  (Kaisar et al., 2021) , we replaced one large balance ball with four small balance balls to make the base more stable. Also, a bracket with two armrests was added to ensure the safety of participants. Pilot tests were conducted to carefully check the prototype system and all equipment to avoid any safety hazards.\n\nIn the virtual and mediated play, two participants were located separately in the same room by the wooden partition with a height of 1.9 m. In the virtual play, the same game software was installed on two laptops and connected to two TV screens via USB cables. When the game ran, its graphic interface was displayed on the TV screen, and the auditory feedback was delivered through the headphone. The headphones could guarantee two participants in the same room played the game independently without sound interference from each other. The mediated play attempted to simulate a scenario where two participants from a distance played an online game together by controlling their tangible balanced ball. In this mode, they were still separated by the wooden partition and wore the headset to avoid face-to-face social interaction. One laptop with the game software was connected to two TV screens via USB cables. Thus, participants could control avatars that appeared in the same game. In the co-located play, two participants without wearing headphones were in the same experimental area. They could talk and interact with each other during exergaming. The distance between participants was around 2.1 m, to follow the indoor social distancing during the COVID-19 pandemic. To enable co-located play, the wooden partition was moved 1.2 m from the center to the left. The auditory feedback of the game was provided by the speaker of the laptop. Figures  6  and  7  present the experimental setup of three exergame modes."

      "text": "Shanghai Jiao Tong University and Ying Chun Neighborhood Committee approved the study. It is conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. The empirical study was conducted from May to July 2021. In each test, an older and a younger participant of the same gender were grouped in a pair. Participants were required to sign the written consent forms before taking part.\n\nResearchers provided them with an information sheet explaining the purpose of the study and the data being collected. All participants' names presented in this study are pseudonyms. After that, they completed the pre-experimental questionnaire, including demographic information and the Lubben Social Network Scale. Three modes of exergames (i.e., virtual play, mediated play, and co-located play) were performed in a counterbalanced order to avoid carry-over effects.\n\nAt the beginning of the game, the graphic user interface of the game guide was presented on the TV screen. The researchers helped explain how to use the game and go through the game menu for participants. During exergaming, participants could ask for help from the researchers who stood nearby. Each exergame mode lasted 6 min, covering four scenario transitions of spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Each seasonal scenario lasted approximately one and a half minutes. Initially, we set every exergame mode for 8 min. One female and one male student volunteer were invited to attend the pre-test to check the feasibility of the experimental procedure. The female student reported feeling a little tired after completing three times of the 8-min exergame in one test. Additionally, considering the physical strength of older participants, the exergaming duration was shortened to 6 min for each mode. In the experiments, all participants can finish three modes of exergames without difficulty.\n\nBefore starting the first exergame mode, the game interface displayed the user guide. Researchers briefly explained game instructions to participants. After completing each exergaming session, participants took 10-20 min to finish the post-experimental questionnaires. Finally, researchers interviewed two participants separately, and all the interviews were audio-recorded. Figure  8  shows the overall experimental procedure."

      "title": "Measurements",
      "text": "To evaluate Socially Assistive Systems,  Qiu et al. (2021 Qiu et al. ( , 2022) )  summarized some relevant standardized questionnaires. They are previously validated, yielding consistent results from repeated samples and different researchers over time  (Boynton & Greenhalgh, 2004 ). Among them, we selected a set of standardized questionnaires that have been used in past empirical studies  (Davis et al., 2017; Qiu et al., 2020a Qiu et al., , 2020b) )  to evaluate social interaction. Here, we measure participants' perceived social interaction from the dimensions of social presence, social connectedness, and emotional state. The detailed description of each questionnaire can be found in the Appendix.\n\nSocial presence means a \"sense of being with another\"  (Biocca et al., 2003) . \"Another\" refers to either an artificial agent (e.g., a digital avatar) or a person  (Biocca et al., 2003) . We used the \"Networked Minds Social Presence Inventor\" (NMSPI)  (Harms & Biocca, 2004)  to measure the psychological and behavioral involvement of the participant with other social entities, including in-game characters, mediated (e.g., playing online), or co-located  (IJsselsteijn et al., 2008) . Social connectedness is \"the experience of belonging and relatedness between people\"  (van Bel et al., 2009) . We used the \"Inclusion of Other in the Self\" (IOS) Scale  (Aron et al., 1992)  to measure participants' social connectedness in exergames. The emotional state is evaluated by the \"Positive and Negative Affect Schedule\" (PANAS)  (Watson et al., 1988) . It is the most widely and frequently used scale to assess positive and negative feelings  (D \u0131az-Garc \u0131a et al., 2020) . We used PANAS to measure participants' emotional state after each exergame mode. In addition to standardized questionnaires, we collected system logs and did a semi-structured interview to help assess participants' performance and experience during exergaming. System logs are JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) files generated by C# code in the unity game that record users' total scores after completing each exergame mode. The logs enable statistical analysis for comparisons to be made between different modes. Semi-structured interviews are conducted to gain a deeper understanding of participants' gaming experience at the end of each test. The interview data helped interpret the quantitative data collected from standardized questionnaires and system logs. Two researchers independently interviewed older and younger participants (e.g., \"Please share your experience and feel when you play each exergame mode\" and \"Do you have any suggestions for the system improvement\"), allowing sufficient space for participants to freely provide feedback according to their experience. The interview data helped interpret the quantitative data collected from standardized questionnaires and system logs."

From the subjective questionnaires, we found that participants felt significantly higher co-presence, attentional allocation, perceived message understanding, perceived affective understanding, perceived behavioral interdependence, and social connectedness in co-located play than in virtual play (Figure  9 ). Participants also felt significantly higher co-presence, attentional allocation, perceived affective understanding, perceived behavioral interdependence, and social connectedness in mediated play than in virtual play (Figure  9 ). Interestingly, from system logs, we observed that participants obtained significantly higher total scores in virtual play than in mediated play, and co-located play. Participants also obtained significantly higher total scores in mediated play than in co-located play (Figure  10 ). A significant main effect of the participant roles was observed. During three exergame modes, older participants felt significantly higher perceived affective understanding, perceived behavioral interdependence, social connectedness, and positive affect than younger participants (Figure  11 ). We did not find a main effect of gender.\n\nA significant interaction effect was observed between the exergame modes and participant roles (Figures  12  and  13 ). It revealed that in virtual play, older participants perceived significantly higher co-presence and perceived behavioral interdependence than younger participants. However, older participants obtained significantly lower total scores than younger participants in virtual play.

      "text": "One hundred and twenty-two quotes mention participants' positive and negative attitudes toward three exergame modes (Table  6 ). Every participant was assigned a unique ID to indicate the source of the quotes. \"O\" and \"Y\" denote \"older participants\" and \"younger participants,\" respectively. 4.2.1.1. Virtual play. Eighteen quotes show positive attitudes of older participants toward virtual play, while three quotes mention the opposite ideas. The example positive quotes are \"feel excited\" (O5, O9, O29, O35), \"relaxed and feel free\" (O7, O11, O17, O35), \"simple and easy to learn\" (O3, O15), as well as \"interesting and without any pressure\" (O25, O33). O7 explained: \"The exergame in virtual play can follow my heart, controlling (the avatar) moving up and down. It is a cool feeling. However, if two people are playing together, we need to communicate, cooperate and coordinate, a little bit difficult. We must play a few more times to establish such tacit understanding.\" The negative quotes from older participants (O9, O15, O17) are \"feel lonely,\" \"nervous,\" and \"feel less responsive than younger adults.\"\n\nEleven quotes mention younger participants liked the virtual play, while 11 quotes show the opposite ideas. The typical positive quotes are \"feel interesting and happy\" (Y6, Y12, Y22, Y36), \"control the game easily without being influenced by others\" (Y10, Y14, Y28, Y36), as well as \"relaxed and concentrated\" (Y18, Y34). On the other hand, younger participants also identify negative factors of playing the exergame in this mode, such as \"monotonous and nothing special\" (Y2, Y4, Y8, Y24), \"feel bored and no challenge\" (Y2, Y8, Y12), as well as \"unable to interact and feel lonely\" (Y10). 4.2.1.2. Mediated play. Thirteen quotes show positive attitudes of older participants toward this mode, while nine quotes show negative attitudes. The example positive quotes are \"consider others and have team spirit\" (O1, O7, O9, O13, O15), \"feel well\" (O5, O11, O17, O33), as well as \"enhance feelings and tacit understanding during interaction\" (O27). Example negative quotes are \"cannot feel the presence of the younger partner\" (O19, O29), \"not excited\" (O3, O21), and \"be a drag on the younger partner\" (O11).\n\nSeven quotes mention younger participants liked this mode, while 12 quotes report their negative attitudes. The example positive quotes are \"interesting and happy experience\" (Y6, Y8, Y24), \"concentrated and positive thinking\" (Y18), as well as \"a high degree of tacit understanding and a strong sense of interaction\" (Y12). The example negative quotes are \"not able to well communicate and feel anxious\" (Y14, Y22, Y32, Y36), \"influenced by the partner and feel unhappy\" (Y10), \"sense of constraint\" (Y34). 4.2.1.3. Co-located play. Fifteen quotes mention older participants liked this mode. The example quotes are \"happy, excited and easy to communicate\" (O3, O15, O21, O25, O31), \"easy to know the intention of the partner\" (O1, O13), as well as \"relaxed and be more confident\" (O17). Also, two quotes reveal why older participants disliked this mode, i.e., \"more nervous after being blamed\" (O9) and \"not as fun as mediated play\" (O11).\n\nThirteen quotes indicate the positive attitudes of younger participants toward this mode. The example quotes are \"interesting, happy and excited\" (Y6, Y8, Y12, Y16, Y24, Y32), \"increase communication and interaction\" (Y4, Y10, Y12, Y18, Y28), as well as \"cooperate easily and reduce mental stress\" (Y34). Y32: \"I feel like a game at this difficulty level might be easier for me to play than an older adult. I will be happy if she can get more points and be happy too.\" Eight quotes show negative attitudes of younger participants, such as \"limited and difficult communication\" (Y14, Y20, Y26, Y36), \"easily disturbed by the other\" (Y10), and \"the older partner looks embarrassed\" (Y22). Y22 found that her partner looked upset and embarrassed if she tried to guide her through the game. Finally, she gave up getting high scores and followed the older partner."

      "text": "There are 31 quotes relevant to the game mechanism; enhancing richness (13 quotes) and challenges (10 quotes) are quoted relatively more than the other two categories: scoring mechanism (five quotes) and motion mechanism (five quotes). In enhancing richness, quotes are mainly about the richness of elements and various levels because the limited elements are boring.\n\nInterestingly, in the category of challenges, O17, O29, and Y18 suggested the exergame should be more challenging, \"It would be more exciting for me if the exergame was harder\" (O17). This implies that older adults also welcome the challenges and excitement in the game and may not be as vulnerable to challenges. Six participants (O21, O23, O35, Y2, Y22, Y34) mentioned the importance of providing different game challenge options. On the other hand, Y34 said: \"I  want to choose the easy mode while I am not in the mood because I just want to have a good time.\" These quotes suggest that fewer challenges for older adults and more for young people are not always the case.\n\nThere are two prominent opinions on the scoring mechanism; one is a more detailed explanation of different scoring mechanisms between three exergame modes. All participants mentioned the hand motion interaction mechanism in the category of motion mechanism. Y8 reported, \"More cooperation and interaction may be achieved with adding hand motion; for example, I can use my hand motion to stretch the line between two game characters.\" 4.2.2.2. Hardware improvement. Fourteen quotes provide suggestions for hardware improvement, while 12 are concerned with space efficiency, and only two are recommendations for reducing the latency of the hardware. Participants preferred the hardware to be compact, so it does not take up much space and can help players to set up easily before playing.\n\n4.2.2.3. Game interaction design. In total, 12 quotes describe participants' suggestions regarding game interaction design, including interface and sound design (nine quotes) and personalization (three quotes). The example suggestions regarding interface and sound design are summarized below: Provide more visible feedback on how much time is left in the game (Y12). Improve the interaction of the elastic rope between two game avatars (Y20, Y28). Make game music more athletic rather than relaxing (Y26). Minimize the error sound feedback because all players wish to gain a sense of achievement rather than depression (Y30).\n\nThree quotes mentioned the personalization of game interaction design. Also, Y34 suggested that players can set different game modes according to their emotional state in mediated play and co-located play. 4.2.2.4. Social interaction. Ten quotes mention the aspect of social interaction, including user groups and scenarios (four quotes), online voice communication (three quotes), and cooperative mechanisms (three quotes). Four participants suggested playing the exergame at home (O15, O21, Y14) or involving more than three players (Y16). O15 and O21 chose to play this exergame with their family members because the exergame promoted intergenerational communication in families. Y12, Y16, and Y28 suggested adding voice communication to the mediated play.\n\nThree participants proposed cooperative mechanisms for the exergame. Y18 recommended differentiating task difficulty for older and younger players as their cognitive and physical abilities differ. Younger players needed more effort to achieve the same result as older players, for example, using a gust of wind in the game to increase operational resistance for younger players."

      "title": "Discussion and conclusion",
      "text": "In this section, we answer four research questions and acknowledge limitations and future work.\n\n5.1. RQ1: \"How does the social balance ball impact the social interaction of all players in three conditions?\" H1 is supported by both quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative results demonstrated that participants felt significantly perceived social interaction in mediated play and co-located play than in virtual play. According to the experimental results from  Gajadhar et al. (2008) , participants who played digital games in the co-located setting perceived higher positive affect than in the mediated setting (i.e., online). Similar results have been reported by  Mandryk and Inkpen (2004)  regarding collaborative play. Different from their findings, in our study, we did not observe a significant difference in participants' perceived social interaction between mediated play and co-located play. There are two possible reasons. First, their studies used friends or familiar participants in pairs to play collaborative games, while our study involved strangers. The initial familiarity of participants can influence their perceived social interaction and engagement in games  (Ravaja et al., 2006) . Second, the duration of this exergame might not last long enough to identify the significant difference in perceived social interaction between these two exergame modes. As stated by  Rice et al. (2013) , generally, the longer the gameplay progressed, the better young-old pairs improved social interaction. The differences in social interaction between the two modes can become more pronounced as playtime increases. It is worth noting that this finding can provide helpful insights into the context of the COVID-19 pandemic. Due to the impact of the coronavirus disease, people have reduced their in-person social activities and stayed indoors. In our case, the mediated play of the Social Balance Ball can provide indoor people with an approximate social experience as the co-located play.\n\nInterestingly, according to the analysis of the system logs, the total scores of participants in virtual play were significantly higher than those in mediated play and colocated play. The qualitative findings could explain this. Participants mentioned that virtual play was more straightforward. As stated by O7, mediated play, and co-located play required people to communicate, cooperate, and coordinate, a little bit more difficult to get scores than virtual play. 5.2. RQ2: \"Do older and younger players perceive social interaction differently in this exergame?\" H2 is supported by both quantitative and qualitative data. The quantitative results demonstrated that older participants perceived significantly higher social interaction than younger participants. In more detail, older participants felt a significant difference in PAU, PBI, social connectedness, and positive affect during the three modes than younger participants. The qualitative analysis also supported these findings. Regarding participants' attitudes across all three modes, older participants reported more positive quotes (Older: 46 quotes vs. Younger: 31 quotes) and fewer negative quotes (Older: 14 quotes vs. Younger: 41 quotes) than younger participants. We speculate the following possible reasons:\n\n1. Older adults are more likely to be satisfied with social technologies. After retirement, they are usually busy with housework and have fewer opportunities to come into contact with interesting technologies. When scoring questionnaires, they tend to have high scores.\n\nConsistent with the findings of  Kruse et al. (2022) , in VR exergames, older adults rated the games more positively in terms of higher enjoyment and desire to play again compared to younger adults; 2. Young people like games and are often exposed to various games, which are not easy to arouse interest. Compared with older adults, they showed lower satisfaction and more suggestions for improvements; 3. We follow the rules of inclusive design. When designing the game, we put the cognitive needs of older adults first. Therefore, in the eyes of young people, the game design may be relatively simple and lack sufficient challenge, which leads to a decline in their satisfaction. Difficulty adjustments for older and younger players should be considered in game design  (Cantwell et al., 2012; Kruse et al., 2022) . 4. Unlike general stereotypes, such findings demonstrated that games are very attractive to older adults and are an effective way to promote socialization.\n\nRelevant interaction effects also showed that older participants perceived significantly higher co-presence and PBI than younger participants in the virtual play. In comparison, they felt significantly lower co-presence and PEI than younger participants in the co-located play. The likely reason is that compared with the virtual play, older participants perceived pressure from younger players in the co-located play. People become slower (e.g., the processing speed decreases) as they grow older  (Loos & Kaufman, 2018; Salthouse, 1996 Salthouse, , 2004)) . Due to the physical and cognitive decline, it is difficult for older participants to keep up with younger participants while exergaming, such as speed, reaction time, memory, attention, hand-eye coordination, and problem-solving  (Loos & Kaufman, 2018) . Compared with the simplicity of virtual play, co-located play needed a joined effort from both sides. For example, O9 made some mistakes during exergaming and was afraid of being blamed by the younger player. Y22 also mentioned the older participant looked embarrassed if she tried to guide her in the game. Instead of aiming for a high score in the game, she took on a more supportive role in helping the older participant. In line with the quantitative results, most quotes (13/21) from younger participants expressed their positive attitudes toward the co-located play. One typical reason is younger people can feel happy to help older adults (Y32)."

      "title": "RQ3",
      "text": ": \"Does gender affect the perceived social interaction of players in this exergame?\" Our findings do not support H3.  Xu et al. (2016)  reported that there were few significant interaction effects between exergames and gender among older participants. Consistent with their findings, we did not find a significant difference in perceived social interaction between male and female participants across three modes.\n\n5.4. RQ4: \"How do the findings from this study inform us about designing exergames in a social context?\" Differentiating the Difficulty of Game Tasks. Because older and younger people have different physical and cognitive abilities, careful consideration must be given to determine their task difficulty to make more individual contributions to games. Similarly, the concept of \"adaptive difficulty\"  (Cantwell et al., 2012)  was pointed out to deal with the same problem. The prototype with \"adaptive difficulty,\" enables each player to decide their own difficulty level while playing together. Considering \"Family-based\" Intergenerational Settings. This study focused on investigating the exergame in unfamiliar young-old pairs. However, we found that older adults (e.g., O15, O21) preferred playing the exergame with their family members. Playing the Social Balance Ball can provide them a good opportunity to stimulate interaction and have fun together. Narrative Contents. Narrative contents are storylines that players get involved in by controlling their avatars, and lack of narrative content has been seen as a reason for players rating the exergame as boring  (Baranowski et al., 2008) . It also provides a way to enrich the exergame, as the Y8 and Y10 mentioned in the user experiments, with new scenes and elements that can be linked together along the storyline. Various Tasks. Tasks of different challenges enable players to choose the task according to their skills, ages, and even their moods to help produce a flow state  (Csikszentmihalyi & Rathunde, 1992; Rauterberg, 2021) , in which players can have a highly intrinsically motivating experience. In this way, two players do not need to have some skills and abilities to cooperate, which is very important in intergenerational gameplay due to the possibilities of gaps between two generations. More Motion Interaction Mechanism. As for the hardware, although many participants in our experiment mention the hand motion, the whole body should be considered because it would enable players to exercise any parts of their body they want  (Santos et al., 2015) .\n\nWe acknowledge the limitations of this study and the opportunities for future work.\n\nFirst, the older participants' ages range from 59 to 70, and this group is limited in representing other age groups of older adults. According to the classification by  Xu et al. (2016) , in general, older adults below 75 could be categorized as young-old adults, while those over 75 are regarded as old-old adults. Due to the consideration of participants' physical and mental abilities, we involved young-old adults in this study. In our future work, we can try to recruit oldold adults to participate in our research, although it is more challenging.\n\nSecond, we did not use physiological data to measure participants' social interaction in the game. As mentioned by  Qiu et al. (2022) , it is not very common to use physiological data for measuring Socially Assistive Systems since social interaction is a complicated procedure that often involves two or more people exchanging ideas and sharing emotions. Sometimes physiological data cannot reflect participants' mental processes and behaviors. In our study, we cannot simply use physiological data, such as electromyography (EMG) signals, heart rate (HR), and galvanic skin response (GSR) to measure the perceived social interaction of participants during exergames. Because it is difficult to identify whether the fluctuations in physiological data are caused by social interaction and the emotional state of participants or their physical activities. Instead of directly measuring their social interaction, in our future work, we can use gaze data to measure participants' engagement in the game.\n\nThird, in sociology, a dyad (namely two people) is regarded as the smallest social group  (Charon, 1996) . It is ideal for studying social behaviors because observing and developing a social connection between participants is more accessible. Thus, the dyad has been used in this study. Our future work can be extended to explore testing social exergames in a multiplayer scenario.\n\nFinally, a pair of participants took only 6 min for each mode in the controlled lab-based experiments. Each session's short duration may influence participants' perceived social interaction. A long-term intervention in field settings is still needed. For example, we can conduct a long-term field study to observe the gaming behaviors of participants in an elderly home.\n\nOverall, this study has three significant contributions:\n\n1. Empirical evidence is provided that participants perceive higher levels of social interaction and positive feelings in the mediated human player mode and the co-located human player mode (i.e., the human players interact) compared to the virtual player mode (i.e., the human players do not interact); 2. Contrary to the general stereotype, the findings showed that older participants perceived social interaction significantly higher than younger participants in the Social Balance Ball exergame, suggesting that social exergame is highly attractive to older adults, and is an effective way to promote social interaction. 3. We also provide design suggestions, insights, and opportunities for game designers and researchers regarding the design and development of social exergames.\n\nM.R.: writing-review and editing.
