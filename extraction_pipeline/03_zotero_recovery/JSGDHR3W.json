  "title": "An Adaptive, Algorithm-based Text Message Intervention to Promote Health Behavior Adherence in Type 2 Diabetes: Treatment Development and Proof-of-Concept Trial",
  "abstract": "Background: Most individuals with type 2 diabetes (T2D) struggle to adhere to one or more health behaviors. Text message interventions (TMIs) have the potential to improve adherence but have had mixed effects on diet and activity in T2D. We developed an eight-week, adaptive, algorithm-driven TMI to promote physical activity, diet, self-care, and wellbeing. Then, in a single-arm trial, we assessed its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy in 15 individuals with T2D and suboptimal adherence. Methods: Participants received daily text messages and were asked to rate the utility of each message (0=not helpful, 10=very helpful). These ratings were used by an algorithm to select subsequent messages based on each participant's prior ratings. We assessed intervention feasibility by rates of message transmission/response and acceptability through ratings of message utility and burden. Finally, we examined pre-post changes in diabetes self-care, diet, physical activity, and psychological outcomes and calculated effect sizes (Cohen's d). Results: All text messages were delivered, and participants provided ratings for 79% of messages, above our a priori thresholds for feasibility. Participants rated the individual messages and overall TMI as subjectively useful (utility: 8.1 [SD=2.1] and 7.8 [SD=2.0], respectively) and not burdensome (burden: 0.8 [SD=1.8]). The intervention led to significant, medium-to large-sized improvements in self-care (d=0.77), diet (d=0.99), and activity (d=0.61) but minimal change in psychological outcomes. \n Conclusions: The TMI was feasible and well-accepted, and it led to promising improvements in adherence-related outcomes. These findings should be confirmed in a larger randomized controlled trial.",

      "text": "Among the 27 million Americans with type 2 diabetes (T2D),  1  adherence to self-care behaviors, including medications, physical activity, a healthy diet, and blood glucose monitoring, is associated with improved glycemic control and a reduced risk of diabetes complications.  [2] [3] 3] [4] [5] [6] [7]  However, most people with T2D fail to adhere to one or more of these behaviors,  3, 8, 9  most frequently diet or exercise.  8 Although effective multicomponent interventions to reduce risk factors for diabetes and its complications have been developed,  [10] [11] [12]  they are resource intensive, are not universally available, have limited ability to adapt to individual patients,  13  and do not target psychological factors that are associated with adherence and health outcomes.  14 ext message interventions (TMIs) may address many of these limitations. Text messages are inexpensive to deliver, and 96% of Americans have access to a phone that is capable of receiving text messages.  15 They can be delivered at a time of an individual's choosing, which may enhance their impact. Furthermore, TMIs can deliver content to promote psychological well-being, in addition to targeted health behavior content. Well-being constructs, such as positive affect, optimism, and self-efficacy, are associated with health behavior adherence, improved glycemic control, and reduced rates of complications among individuals with T2D.  14, [16] [17] 7] [18] [19] [20]  Finally, using algorithms that choose messages based on individual-specific factors, TMIs can adapt over time to create a tailored experience to meet individuals' changing preferences and needs, which may increase efficacy.  21 on-adaptive TMIs to promote health behavior adherence have been studied in many populations and have modest effects on health behavior adherence (Cohen's d=0. 24-0.33).  21, 22 Among patients with T2D, TMIs have been used to provide education about the importance of self-management, encourage engagement in health behaviors, and enhance motivation for behavior change.  [23] [24] 4] [25]  In this group, TMIs lead to significant reductions in hemoglobin A1c  24  and improvements in self-management behaviors.  23 However, the effects of TMIs on physical activity and dietary modification in T2D are more mixed, with fewer than half of studies demonstrating significant improvements in these outcomes.  23, 25 Although there is little information about the characteristics of effective TMIs in T2D,  23, 25  studies of TMIs in related populations suggest that tailored messages, frequent text message delivery, and longer duration enhance the efficacy of these interventions.  26 A TMI that targets multiple health behaviors, delivers messages to promote psychological wellbeing, and adapts to topics felt to be most useful to participants has the potential to improve adherence, wellbeing, and health outcomes.\n\nAccordingly, we created an adaptive TMI that delivers messages to promote well-being and health behavior adherence in individuals with T2D. This intervention combines messages to promote well-being-based on positive psychology  27  -with health behavior text messages and utilizes an adaptive algorithm that incorporates daily participant feedback to deliver messages that are most likely to be found useful by participants. In this article, we report the results of a proof-of-concept trial (N=15) of the intervention to assess its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy."

The intervention was tailored to individuals with T2D through the inclusion of messages that targeted psychological constructs associated with improved health in T2D, promoted reduction of high-sugar food consumption, highlighted the benefits of health behavior adherence on glycemic control and reduced cardiovascular risk, and discussed the importance of diabetes self-care behaviors (eg, foot care, blood glucose monitoring).

Two participants reported feeling bothered when they were unable to respond to the messages immediately or could not perform the recommended activity (eg, spend time with another person).\n\nRegarding specific message types, participants appreciated a wide range of messages, including those related to well-being (six mentions), physical activity (six mentions), diet (nine mentions), and self-care (two mentions). Three did not like the social messages, as they were unable to engage in those activities due to either living alone or due to COVID guidelines. Text messages often translated into behavior change, with ten participants performing a specific activity in response to a text message. These included performing kind acts, expressing gratitude to others, exercising, tracking food intake, and making healthier food choices. Thirteen felt that receiving messages once a day was optimal for them, while one would have preferred to have weekends off. Finally, eight participants felt that the duration of the intervention was optimal, and five felt it could have been longer."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "In this proof-of-concept trial, the eight-week, adaptive health behavior-targeted TMI was feasible and associated with medium-to large-sized pre-post improvements in physical activity, diet, and other diabetes self-care behaviors. Furthermore, the learning algorithm appeared to be effective at choosing messages preferred by participants. Finally, the intervention was well-accepted by participants. This is consistent with one-and two-way TMIs in T2D,  24  both of which are well-accepted in this population. These findings suggest that an adaptive TMI could be successfully implemented and accepted by participants in future larger trials.\n\nTwo findings related to the utility of specific text message types are worth noting. First, while participants rated all text message types above our threshold for acceptability, messages focusing on diabetes self-care or multiple health behaviors were felt to be more useful by participants than messages focusing solely on enhancing well-being. One potential explanation for this is that the initial description of the study focused primarily on promoting health behavior adherence. As a result, participants may have felt that the messages focused on diet, physical activity, or self-care were more directly relevant to the reason they agreed to participate. In addition, many of the well-being messages recommended activities that required additional time and effort (eg, performing an act of kindness). Future interventions may benefit from a greater introduction to the rationale for sending these messages or to initial phone sessions that help individuals learn how to use well-being-related skills. Indeed, TMIs that involve text messages plus additional delivery components appear to be more effective than text messages only.  22 econd, the study suggests that tailoring messages to participants based on utility ratings may be a useful way to promote acceptability and efficacy of TMIs. Participants rated text messages as progressively more useful over the course of the intervention, as they became more tailored based on reported preference. Furthermore, in exit interviews, participants expressed preferences for different message types, with each message type being preferred by at least one participant. Therefore, a TMI that gathers feedback from participants in an ongoing manner to determine what type of message they will receive next may be a promising method to deliver interventions. Although the evidence of the benefits of tailoring of TMIs for health behavior promotion is mixed,  21, 22  a recent systematic review of tailored TMIs for T2D self-management found that these interventions led to medium-sized (Hedge's g=0.54) reductions in hemoglobin A1c.  25  Our findings that the adaptive TMI led to medium-to large-sized improvements in physical activity, diet, and diabetes self-care behaviors extend those of the literature. Two prior systematic reviews and meta-analyses that focused on TMIs to promote health behavior adherence found that these interventions lead to small-sized (d=0.24-0.33) improvements in health behavior adherence,  21, 22  and a recent meta-analysis found that TMIs lead to similar effects on physical activity (d=0.38).  51 Although larger, randomized trials are needed to confirm these findings, the current evidence of the positive impact on health behavior adherence is promising. The intervention's lack of impact on psychological constructs was surprising, given that formal positive psychology interventions are consistently associated with improvements in well-being and reductions in depression.  52 However, several factors-including a limited focus of the intervention on well-being, lack of introduction to the well-being-focused messages, additional time/effort required to perform the well-being activities, and external stressors (eg, COVID-19, US presidential election)  53  -may have contributed to this. Future interventions may benefit from additional education about the purpose of the well-being messages and problemsolving of ways to complete well-being-related activities.\n\nThis study has several limitations, including its small sample size, lack of a control group, largely female sample with fairly well-controlled diabetes, and self-report outcome measures. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic may have influenced participant preferences for message types, particularly those that involved a social component, and also may have had an effect on psychological constructs.  53 These limitations should be addressed in a larger, randomized, controlled trial with a clinically and demographically diverse sample and objective measures of adherence."
