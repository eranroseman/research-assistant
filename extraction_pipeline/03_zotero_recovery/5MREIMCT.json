      "text": "Many health research studies collect multiple exposure measurements over time, but identifying the key exposure time points directly related to health outcomes can be challenging. Over the last two decades, there has been heightened interest in identifying critical windows of exposure; that is, time points during which exposures have a greater impact on a person's health than those in other time points.  [1] [2] 2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  This research area is particularly relevant for clinical and observational studies, since an understanding of the critical window can inform targeted interventions around exposure time periods.  1  Additionally, this understanding advances the ultimate goal of revealing biological pathways through the use of established developmental processes.  1 For these reasons, epidemiologists construct windows of exposure based on developmental milestones such as pregnancy trimesters or child development stages. In particular, HIV researchers are increasingly interested in evaluating how maternal trimester-specific exposures affect child health outcomes. These exposures during pregnancy include unsuppressed viral load (VL),  9  social determinants of health,  10  substance use,  11  and insurance coverage,  12  which are often included in regression models as binary indicators. Although there is extensive research on evaluating continuous exposures across exposure windows,  [1] [2] [3] [4] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19]  much less is known about the statistical properties of models evaluating binary exposure measures across windows of exposure.\n\nThe primary shortcomings of conventional approaches are interpretability and handling of missing data. Fitting a regression model to each exposure window variable with the same outcome is a common approach to analyzing critical exposure windows.  4 However, this method has several limitations. First, it lacks a global test for comparing the strength of associations across windows.  4, [20] [21] 1] [22] [23]  Because the coefficients are statistically dependent, nonoverlapping confidence intervals cannot be used to demonstrate that associations differ.  4 Second, each model may generate associations based on different subsamples of the data.  [24] [25] 5] [26]  The repeated measuring of individuals over time is a fundamental feature of cohort studies, but may lead to missing data if participants do not attend all scheduled visits.  27 The associations may be biased if the determination of the analytical sample depends on the availability of observed exposure and outcome measures and no correction is made (eg, inverse probability-weighting (IPW)).  4, 28 Lastly, because each model uses the same outcome, the hypotheses evaluated are not independent.  4 By not accounting for the residual error correlations, the precision may be over or underestimated.  4 nother common technique is fitting a saturated model that includes all exposure window variables and their interaction terms.  4, [20] [21] 1] [22] [23]  This approach is appealing if prediction is the goal.  21, 23 However, if the goal is to demonstrate association or causation, this method does not provide a meaningful interpretation of the associations between each window's exposure and the outcome.  [21] [22] [23] 25, 29  Consider an example in which there are two prenatal exposure windows of interest, the first and second trimesters. The exposure-outcome association based on the first trimester exposure window would have to be interpreted conditionally on that for the second trimester. This interpretation is counterproductive for critical window researchers, who are frequently more interested in the marginal relationships between each exposure window and the outcome than in the combined associations.  25 Also, conditioning on other exposure windows is likely to attenuate the association between exposure in the window of interest and the outcome.  4 This approach has several other disadvantages. The model will be restricted to complete cases; for example, individuals with measured outcomes and exposure measurements for all windows. Like other statistical approaches, if the missingness is not completely at random, then the associations may be biased and there could be loss of efficiency.  28, 30 Another disadvantage is that the hypothesis tests about the equality of the associations cannot be nested within the saturated model.  4 Lastly, this method may be susceptible to collinearity problems, such as inflated SEs and unstable regression coefficients.  4 o overcome the shortcomings of conventional approaches, Horton et al  20  and Pepe et al  21  independently developed multiple informant models (MIMs) that enable statistical comparisons of differences in associations between informants. Informants refer to data gathered from various sources, that is, measurements obtained from multiple individuals (eg, a mother and child) or from the same individual at different time intervals (eg, windows).  4 Horton et al and Pepe et al used generalized estimating equations (GEEs) to fit MIMs, enabling the joint estimation of separate regression models.  20, 21 While GEE models are typically used as a robust modeling approach for repeated outcome measures to account for within-subject correlation, the implementation of a MIM using GEEs assumes a single outcome but repeated exposure measures. A MIM GEE provides a global test (eg, score test) based on parameter estimates and their joint variance-covariance matrix to assess whether associations differ across informants (windows) while accounting for multiple comparisons.  20, 21 This strategy is also advantageous since it retains the interpretation of separate regression models, is less computationally intensive than maximum likelihood (ML) methods, requires no assumptions about the joint distribution of the outcome and exposure windows, and can be applied using accessible software (eg, PROC GENMOD in SAS).  20, 21, 23, 29 Also, standard GEE models can be extended to account for the probability of missing exposure measures using inverse probability-weighting (MIM IPW GEE).  31, 32 s interest rises in using MIM GEEs to potentially identify critical exposure windows, the feasibility and appropriateness of their application under settings of correlated exposures and partially missing exposure measurements requires further examination (Table  1 ). This is important because longitudinal studies such as cohort studies generate correlated measurements by design. A common consequence of collecting repeated measures on an individual is the potential for their measurements to be missing. If the missingness is due to random chance, then estimated associations from analysis of this dataset should be equivalent to those drawn from a complete dataset. If the missingness is informative, meaning it is related to some other observed covariate or the outcome, then the estimated associations may be biased.

      "text": "Consider a study with N participants, assumed to be independent, and a single outcome variable, Y i , for the ith participant. The exposure measurement for the ith individual at the jth window (j = 1, \u2026 , J) is denoted by X ij . Let Z i be a vector of time-invariant confounders and potential predictors of the relationship between Y and X for the ith individual. For simplicity, we suppress the i subscript (eg, X ij becomes X j ), and assume a setting with three exposure windows. The primary objective of fitting a MIM is to determine whether marginal associations differ across exposure windows. That is,\n\nwhere g(\u22c5) denotes the link function for a generalized linear model. We focus on the identity link for continuous outcomes. Therefore, we conduct a test of the hypothesis in Equation (1) by fitting the following MIM GEE.\n\nwhere   (1)  0 and   (2)  0 denote the difference in intercepts using the second and third exposure windows, respectively. The   (1)  1 parameter reflects how the association of the outcome with exposure in the second window differs from that of the exposure in the first window. Similarly, the   (2)  1 parameter reflects how the association of the outcome with exposure in the third window differs from that of the exposure in the first window. A (J -1) degrees of freedom (df) chi-squared test provides a global test for comparing the strength of associations across windows.  20, 21 As a result, this model relates to marginal associations.\n\nTo fit the MIM GEE, we structure the data such that each individual's outcome, Y i , is repeated J times, corresponding to the number of exposure windows. The MIM GEE approach treats the repeated responses corresponding to multiple timepoints as an independent cluster, assumes constant variance, and employs a working independence correlation structure.  20, 21 As a result, the MIM GEE simplifies to the ordinary least squares equations"

      "title": "2.2. Multiple informant model with missing exposure measurements",
      "text": "Many longitudinal studies are subject to missingness of exposure measurements with missingness patterns which may be either monotone or non-monotone.  31, 36 Analysts may still fit the MIM GEE in the presence of monotone or non-monotone missingness, but the estimating equation for an informant (window) will only contain data for people who had an exposure measured during that window. A consequence of this is reduced sample size in an estimating equation, resulting in lower power to detect differences in associations across windows. Another consequence depends on whether the missingness is informative. If the exposure data are missing completely at random (MCAR), the MIM GEE produces unbiased, but potentially inefficient, estimated differences in association measures across windows.  21, 28, 37 If the exposure data are missing at random (MAR), the estimated differences in association measures across windows may be biased and there could be a loss of efficiency.  22, 28, 31, 32, 38 ie and Paik developed a GEE strategy to address the issues of bias and efficiency loss when exposure data is MAR.  31 issing data in the estimating equations are replaced by consistent estimates in this approach. Based on prior MIM literature,  22, 24  we defined the missingness indicators M j (for j = 1, 2, 3), which equal 1 if X j is missing and 0 otherwise. We define p j = P(M j |Y , Z) under the MAR assumption and estimate p j by fitting logistic regression models. Then, in the MIM IPW GEE analysis, we employ the inverse of pj as weights. That is, (1\u2215 p1 ) weights the estimating equation for the first exposure window, (1\u2215 p2 ) for the second exposure window, and (1\u2215 p3 ) for the third exposure window. By incorporating a working independence correlation structure, the model reduces to weighted least squares.  22 itting IPW models for each period is equivalent to repeating the Xie and Paik approach for each exposure window, which has been implemented in previous multiple informant model literature.  22, 24 To be consistent with this literature, we fit IPW models for the simulated and example data that were based only on the observed outcome and confounder. Although this is a specific setting of missing data, we also acknowledge the work of Sun and Tchetgen Tchetgen,  36  who developed a method for handling more general cases of nonmonotonic missingness."

      "title": "3. SIMULATION STUDY",
      "text": "Given the almost universal occurrence of correlated exposure measurements and missing exposure data in longitudinal cohort studies, better understanding of the appropriateness and performance of the MIM GEE in these settings is clearly warranted. To address this, we conducted a simulation study to evaluate the operating characteristics of the MIM GEE and the MIM IPW GEE in three scenarios with varying correlation structures, sample sizes, and missing data mechanisms. We were interested in each method's empirical power (rejection rate). We were also interested in the average difference (AD) between the marginal effects and the true conditional effects. We further examined the average squared difference (ASQD) between these two estimates. The first scenario was an examination of the Type 1 error: measurements within all exposure windows were assumed to have the same association with the outcome. The second scenario assessed power, AD, and ASQD when different exposure-outcome associations existed across windows. In the third scenario, we examined these same operating characteristics but changed the effects to reflect a single critical window for which there was an exposure-outcome association. Using a computationally efficient method,  39  binary exposure measurements were generated with specified correlation structures and unequal proportions. The sample sizes considered were 300, 500, 1000, and 1500. The missing data mechanisms investigated were no missing exposures (complete data), exposure measures MCAR, and exposure measures MAR."

This non-standard version of GEE creates challenges when attempting to simultaneously achieve generation and estimation of marginal effects. Most of the methods in the statistical literature have typically been evaluated based on effects that were simulated conditionally. We therefore acknowledge that there is no simple solution to generating marginal effects in the presence of correlated exposures. Litman and colleagues describe in detail the problems encountered while attempting to simulate data for MIM.  24 These problems coupled with the increase use of MIM GEEs in medical applications motivated our investigation of how correlated and missing exposure data impact these methods."

These simulations were based on the scenario where a single critical window had an association with the outcome.

Missing data mechanisms included: no missing exposure data, exposure measures missing completely at random (MCAR), exposures MAR with no correction, and exposures MAR with model correction (IPW) 90.2% power (sim. err. = 0.4%) to detect an overall difference in exposure-outcome associations, compared to only 70.1% (sim. err. = 0.6%) in Scenario 2 for the chosen effect sizes. This finding likely arose because the differences between associations were the same or larger than when exposures in each of the windows had an association with the outcome. This suggests that it may require larger pairwise effect differences to achieve the same power as a setting with only one critical window exposure. This setting also appeared to be less sensitive than Scenario 2 to correlated exposure measurements. Although gradual decreases in power were observed as the correlation increased in this setting, substantial power was still maintained. With 1000 study participants providing complete exposure data, the power at  jk = 0.0 (independent exposures) was 99.6% (sim. err. = 0.08%) and only dropped to 93.6% (sim. err. = 0.3%) at  jk = 0.4. Since the assumed values of   (1)  1 and   (2)  1 were equivalent, the ADs and ASQDs for trimesters 2 and 3 not surprisingly showed similar patterns (Figure  5 ). For these trimesters, as exposure correlations increased, the ADs and ASQDs increased in magnitude. However, these differences were minimal since they were on the SD scale. At  jk = 0.0, the AD was close to 0 for a study with N = 1500 and complete exposure data. Increasing  jk to 0.4, only increased the AD to about -0.15 SD. In contrast to trimesters 2 and 3, the overall AD trajectory for trimester 1 tended to be within 0.025 SDs across all correlations and missing data structures. Additionally, the ASQD remained below 0.1 SDs, indicating good performance."

[40] [41] ] [42]  SMARTT is a prospective cohort study which evaluates the safety of in utero antiretroviral medication exposure and other maternal exposures on adverse child health outcomes, such as poor infant neurodevelopment.  10 To assess neurodevelopment at age 1 in SMARTT infants, licensed psychologists administered a validated assessment called the Bayley scales of infant development, which measures five areas of infant development: cognitive, language, motor, social-emotional, and adaptive behavior.  41 A composite score is calculated for each domain (reference population mean = 100, SD = 15). We evaluated whether binary indicators of unsuppressed HIV viral load (VL) in the mother within each trimester were associated with the infant's cognitive composite score at age 1 in 1723 mother-infant pairs, and used the MIM GEE approach to evaluate whether associations differed by trimester. Unsuppressed VL measures exhibited moderate correlations across trimesters (0.41 between 1st and 2nd trimesters, 0.35 between 2nd and 3rd trimesters, and 0.25 between 1st and 3rd trimesters). The percent of missing VL measures was 38, 32, and 13 for the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd trimesters, respectively. Covariates used to estimate probability weights for missing VL measurements included: mother experienced obstetric complications (yes vs no/unknown), infant was born preterm (yes vs no/unknown), race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic Black vs non-Hispanic White/unknown), mother was perinatally HIV infected (yes vs no/unknown), mother was born in the USA (vs other/unknown), and infant birth weight.\n\nWe applied the MIM GEE to test whether there were different associations of unsuppressed VL with infant cognitive functioning across trimesters of pregnancy controlling for maternal education and preterm birth. This model used all available maternal VL measurements without correcting for missing exposure measures. Second, we fit a logistic regression model to predict the missingness of VL measurements during each trimester of pregnancy, based on the demographic factors, maternal characteristics, and birth outcomes noted above. These estimated probabilities were used to inversely weight the MIM GEE. Lastly, for comparison, we also fit a generalized linear model (GLM) restricted to just the subset of with VL measurements during all three trimesters, and a GLM for each separate trimester."

The global test for differences in associations of unsuppressed VL with cognitive score across trimesters was significant for MIM GEE ( 2 2 = 6.28, p = 0.043) and the MIM IPW GEE ( 2 2 = 6.72, p = 0.035) (Table  2 ). Unsuppressed VL in the first trimester was associated with a small but non-significant decrease in the mean cognitive score (-0.38 and -0.35 in the MIM GEE and MIM IPW GEE models, respectively). Surprisingly, while unsuppressed maternal VL early in pregnancy (trimester 1) was associated with a small decline in cognitive score (as we had hypothesized), unsuppressed maternal VL in trimester 2 was associated with higher cognitive functioning in both models. The MIM GEE estimate was 2.25 (p = 0.007) and the MIM IPW GEE estimate was 2.38 (p = 0.004). This relationship was also observed in the GLM of cognitive scores on trimester 2 measurements only (est. 2.26, p = 0.007) (Table  3 ). The GLM of cognitive scores including all trimester VL measurements simultaneously did not indicate a significant association for trimester 2 (est. 2.29, p = 0.14), which may be a consequence of the reduced sample size since it only included mothers with VL measurements in all three trimesters (N = 568).\n\nTable  3  presents estimates from fitting a co-adjusted GLM (all trimesters in the same model and three stratified models (a separate model for each trimester). It is worth noting that the stratified estimates are relatively similar to the MIM GEE estimates in Table  2 , while some of the co-adjusted estimates (trimesters 1 and 3) are further from the null than either of those estimates in Table  2  or the stratified models. We hypothesize that this may be due to accounting for co-period confounding, collider stratification bias (adjusting for the future), variance inflation, or the restricted sample size.\n\nE 2 Results from fitting multiple informant models using generalized estimating equations (MIM GEE), and inverse probability weighted generalized estimating equations (MIM IPW GEE) MIM GEE MIM IPW GEE Estimate 95% CI P-value Estimate 95% CI P-value Intercept 103.00 (101.47, 104.54) <0.001 103.06 (101.52, 104.60) <0.001 Unsuppressed VL -0.38 (-2.04, 1.28) 0.65 -0.35 (-2.01, 1.32) 0.68 \u2265 HS Grad 0.78 (-0.68, 2.24) 0.29 0.86 (-0.61, 2.33) 0.25 Preterm -5.45 (-7.41, -3.49) <0.001 -5.40 (-7.36, -3.44) <0.001 Trimester 2 -0.89 (-1.92, 0.14) 0.090 -1.06 (-2.10, -0.01) 0.048 Trimester 3 -0.34 (-1.27, 0.60) 0.48 -0.39 (-1.33, 0.56) 0.42 Unsuppressed VL \u00d7 Trimester 2 2.62 (0.57, 4.69) 0.013 2.72 (0.65, 4.79) 0.010 Unsuppressed VL \u00d7 Trimester 3 1.82 (-0.59, 4.23) 0.14 1.99 (-0.44, 4.43) 0.11 Score statistic  2 2 6.28 0.043 6.72 0.035 Period-specific estimates of unsuppressed VL Trimester 1 -0.38 (-2.04, 1.28) 0.65 -0.35 (-2.01, 1.32) 0.68 Trimester 2 2.25 (0.62, 3.88) 0.007 2.38 (0.74, 4.01) 0.004 Trimester 3 1.44 (-0.59, 3.47) 0.17 1.64 (-0.41, 3.70) 0.12 Note: Bold indicates P < 0.05; Italics indicates P < 0.10.

      "title": "5. DISCUSSION",
      "text": "We evaluated the impact of correlation between exposure measurements and missing exposure data on the power, as well as on the difference between true conditional effects and the marginal effects estimated by multiple informant models implemented via GEEs, with and without accounting for informative missingness via IPW approaches. We assessed three scenarios: (1) no difference in exposure-outcome associations across windows (ie, under the null hypothesis), (2) differential exposure-outcome associations across windows, and (3) a single critical window with an exposure-outcome association. Not surprisingly, the absolute magnitude of difference between pairs of exposure-outcome associations has a substantial impact on the operating characteristics of these models. Settings where there was only a single critical exposure window achieved higher power than settings with different exposure-outcome associations across windows. However, this finding may not generalize to all settings with different exposure-outcome associations across periods (eg, larger effect size differences between periods). These results illuminate some of the limitations of this method that researchers should be aware of when employing this approach. We also found that higher correlations among more pronounced negative effect on inference than exposure missing patterns, at least for the scenarios we considered. This finding has implications on the types of data analyzed by a MIM. Recent applications which fit MIMs to studies with multiple measurements from the same individual, likely to be correlated, may have failed to detect differences in associations due to the lower power we observed in these settings. We suggest calculating the correlation between binary exposure measurements prior to model fitting to inform whether this is the appropriate method to use. Overall, the combination of relatively small pairwise effect differences and higher correlations between exposure window measurements pose challenges for these models to generate adequate inferences when there is not only one critical exposure window.\n\nIn addition to the simulation study, we also applied these methods to explore windows of unsuppressed VL measurements during pregnancy of women living with HIV and their infant's neurodevelopment. We observed a significant difference in the associations of unsuppressed VL with infant cognitive functioning across trimesters. Surprisingly, we also found that unsuppressed VL during the second trimester was associated with increased infant cognitive functioning compared to the first trimester. This finding was relatively similar to estimates from conditional and marginal GLMs. Comparing estimates between MIM GEEs, MIM IPW GEEs, conditional GLMs, and marginal GLMs helps researchers better understand how the assumptions of each approach potentially affect target estimates. This is also useful to health scientists who are increasingly applying MIMs to analyze potential critical windows of exposure in cohort studies.  7 Analysts should be aware that the current MIM framework does not account for co-period confounding or time-varying confounding affected by prior exposure. In the presence of these confounding types, alternative approaches would be required. Note that our findings are based on a particular research question in reproductive and perinatal epidemiology and may not be generalizable to other epidemiological settings. However, these findings are useful in research settings where exposure measurements are collected over time, and interest lies in identifying susceptible critical windows. Furthermore, we explored only a portion of all the possible combinations of correlations, missing data mechanisms, number of window measurements, and model specifications. As in all applications of IPW approaches in the context of informatively missing outcomes or exposures, the actual ability to reduce bias relies on being able to accurately predict missingness based on the measured covariates included in the IPW models. In our particular application, the measured covariates did not predict missingness very well. An extension such as that proposed by Sun and Tchetgen Tchetgen 36 might allow us to improve the IPW extension to the MIM GEE approach if missingness of one exposure measure was related to other observed exposures, prompting an area of future research.\n\nThere have been several studies on multiple informant models using GEE or ML theory (Table  1 ),  4, [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] 29, 33, 45  but only a few focused on the impact of missing data or more than two informants.  4, 21, 22, 24, 4, 25  While some simulation studies have been conducted to evaluate the performance of MIMs,  24, 25, 29, 33, 45  none have explored the impact of correlated exposures on the operating characteristics of this approach, especially MIM GEE. One of the seminal MIM studies applied MIM GEE to identify childhood predictors of obesity, analyzing information measured on different family members that were assumed to follow a MCAR structure when data measurements were missing. 21  The authors reported that their inferences were not impacted by missingness. Another study by Horton and colleagues used MIM GEE to assess the predictive ability of psychiatric multiple-source reports (self-and physician-report) on mortality risk. 22  In this applied study with MAR informant data, the authors reported similar inferences between weighted and unweighted estimates. Our simulatio  study results are in alignment with their reports.\n\nAlternative approaches to analyzing critical exposure windows exist in the statistical literature. These approaches, however, possess disadvantages that may potentially outweigh their benefits. A reliability analysis, which is a type of measurement error model, posits that accurate estimates are possible by averaging a collection of repeated measures (with error) for each informant.  46 This analytic approach strongly assumes that the measurement error variance is small, and requires continuous measures.  20, 46 In some cases, it requires the rare disease assumption.  46 Another measurement error technique is the latent class model.  47, 48 Formann and Kohlmann suggest that the key advantage of this model is that it provides a better understanding of misclassification rates.  48 The disadvantages of this model include identifiability, interpretability, convergence, computational issues, and the lack of closed-form analytical solutions.  20 Multilevel random effect and structural equation models are also alternative approaches but address slightly different research questions than MIM.  [49] [50] 0] [51]  The distributed lag model is another approach that accounts for lags between exposure periods but is generally used when there is a large number of exposure periods.  13, 14 For situations with a limited number of exposure periods, there are few strong alternatives to the MIM approach.\n\nBefore concluding, we must address the limitations of our MIM GEE evaluation. As mentioned previously, MIM GEE application that requires a specific data structure. This data structure is composed of a single outcome having individual marginal associations with time-varying measurements. This creates a simulation challenge because the majority of data generating mechanisms in simulation studies are conditional on the joint set of covariates predicting the outcome. Another limitation was that we did not account for the variability in probability weights. A natural extension of our work would be to investigate whether bootstrapping the probability weights positively impacts the operating characteristics of this method. Jointly estimating the IPW model and the MIM GEE is another area for methodological development. We also discovered that the MIM GEE may be sensitive to exposure prevalence. For example, generating exposure window variables with low prevalence yielded highly inflated Type 1 error rates in the presence of missing data. Lastly, we did not incorporate the Sun and Tchetgen Tchetgen 36 approach for nonmonotonic missingness. Their proposed approach requires fitting separate IPW models for each possible missingness pattern based on all included covariates, and then averaging across estimates. This method could potentially provide better inferences, particularly if missingness of exposure measures of interest depends on other observed exposures, but its operating characteristics in the MIM context have yet to be investigated.\n\nOverall, we have provided two novel contributions to the MIM literature. First, this method maintains relatively high power when there is a single critical window of exposure across a variety of correlation structures, sample sizes, and missing data mechanisms. Second, this study makes analysts aware of both the bias and potential decreases in power that may occur with this approach. Regarding study design implications, analysts may need to consider using larger sample sizes or exposures which are not expected to be highly correlated.\n\nFuture research directions include examining the impact of correlation and missing data on other types of outcomes and exposures (eg, continuous exposures and either a binary or a continuous outcome). Although power is typically increased for continuous compared to binary measures, it is also possible that continuous exposures may be more highly correlated, and thus the power and bias implications in this setting require further examination so that the statistical trade-offs are fully understood."

  "abstract": "There has been heightened interest in identifying critical windows of exposure for adverse health outcomes; that is, time points during which exposures have the greatest impact on a person's health. Multiple informant models implemented using generalized estimating equations (MIM GEEs) have been applied to address this research question because they enable statistical comparisons of differences in associations across exposure windows. As interest rises in using MIMs, the feasibility and appropriateness of their application under settings of correlated exposures and partially missing exposure measurements requires further examination. We evaluated the impact of correlation between exposure measurements and missing exposure data on the power and differences in association estimated by the MIM GEE and an inverse probability weighted extension to account for informatively missing exposures. We assessed these operating characteristics under a variety of correlation structures, sample sizes, and missing data mechanisms considering various exposure\u2010outcome scenarios. We showed that applying MIM GEEs maintains higher power when there is a single critical window of exposure and exposure measures are not highly correlated, but may result in low power and bias under other settings. We applied these methods to a study of pregnant women living with HIV to explore differences in association between trimester\u2010specific viral load and infant neurodevelopment.",
