      "text": "Reward-based programs were much more commonly accepted than deposit-based programs, leading to higher rates of sustained abstinence from smoking. Grouporiented incentive programs were no more effective than individual-oriented programs. (Funded by the National Institutes of Health and CVS Caremark; ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT01526265.)\n\nA BS TR AC T Randomized Trial of Four Financial-Incentive Programs for Smoking Cessation F inancial incentives have been shown to promote a variety of health behaviors.  [1] [2] ] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  For example, in a randomized, clinical trial involving 878 General Electric employees, a bundle of incentives worth $750 for smoking cessation nearly tripled quit rates, from 5.0% to 14.7%,  8  and led to a program adapted by General Electric for its U.S. employees.  9 Although incentive programs are increasingly used by governments, employers, and insurers to motivate changes in health behavior,  10, 11  their design is usually based on the traditional economic assumption that the size of the incentive determines its effectiveness. In contrast, behavioral economic theory suggests that incentives of similar size may have very different effects depending on how they are designed.  12 or example, deposit or \"commitment\" contracts, whereby participants put some of their own money at risk and recoup it if they are successful in changing their behavior, have been used in a variety of online and employer-based behavioral-change programs. Because people are typically more motivated to avoid losses than to seek gains,  13  deposit contracts should be more successful than reward programs. However, the need to make deposits may deter people from participating, and the overall effectiveness of deposit and reward programs has not been compared.  14, 15 urthermore, incentives that target groups may be more effective than incentives that target individuals because people are strongly motivated by social comparisons.  [16] [17] 7] [18]  Collaborative incentives, whereby payments to successful group members increase with the overall success of the group, may add dimensions of interpersonal accountability and teamwork.  19 Competitive designs, such as pari-mutuel schemes in which money deposited by group members who do not change their behavior gets distributed to group members who do, may amplify peoples' aversions to loss by highlighting the regret they may feel if others benefit from their failure to change.  20, 21 e therefore evaluated incentive programs for smoking cessation that are based on rewards or deposit contracts and that are delivered at the individual or group level, comparing the interventions on three measures: acceptance, defined as the proportion of people who accept the incentive program when offered; overall effectiveness, assessed as the proportion of people offered each program who stop smoking; and efficacy, assessed as the proportion of people who stop smoking if they accept a given incentive program."

      "title": "Study Population",
      "text": "We used a multifaceted recruitment scheme (Fig.  S1  in the Supplementary Appendix, available at NEJM.org) to enroll CVS Caremark employees or their relatives and friends across the United States. Eligible participants were at least 18 years of age, reported smoking at least 5 cigarettes per day, had Internet access, and indicated an interest in learning about ways to stop smoking. Recruitment occurred from February 2012 through October 2012. Using the Way to Health Web-based research portal created for this and other studies,  22  participants opened an account, electronically signed the informedconsent document, and completed a baseline questionnaire. Participants were told that they would be paid for completing questionnaires and submitting samples to confirm smoking abstinence and that the study tested different ways of providing financial incentives to promote cessation. To dissuade nonsmokers from enrolling, we also informed potential participants that we would randomly screen for baseline smoking.\n\nAfter randomization, participants learned the details of their assigned intervention, were asked to accept or decline their intervention, and chose a target quit date between 1 and 90 days after enrollment. We then selected a random sample of 5% of these enrolled participants to undergo baseline cotinine screening and offered $100 for completing a cotinine assay.\n\nParticipants were randomly assigned on an individual basis to one of five groups (Fig.  1 ). Randomization was stratified according to two dichotomous variables: whether participants had full health care benefits through CVS Caremark and whether their annual household income was at least $60,000 (the CVS Caremark workforce median) or less than $60,000. We developed an adaptive randomization algorithm  [23] [24] [25] [26]  that updated the assignment probabilities to the five groups after every third enrolled participant. Updated probabilities reflected the inverse of the proportion of participants assigned to that group who accepted the intervention, relative to total acceptance across groups.  26 This approach balances recruitment of accepting participants across groups by increasing the odds of randomization to interventions that previous participants declined.\n\nAll the participants were offered usual care, consisting of information about local smokingcessation resources, cessation guides produced by the American Cancer Society, and, for the 41% of the participants receiving health benefits through CVS Caremark, free access to a behavioral-modification program and nicotine-replacement therapy. Participants assigned to the two individual-incentive groups were also eligible to receive $200 if they had biochemically confirmed abstinence at each of three times: 14 days, 30 days, and 6 months after their target quit dates. Participants would get an additional $200 bonus at 6 months, for a total of $800 (Fig.  S2  in the Supplementary Appendix). In the individual-deposit group, this sum included a $150 deposit that would be refunded to participants who quit smoking.\n\nIn the collaborative-reward and competitivedeposit groups, cohorts of six smokers each were formed on a rolling basis, linking participants 2538 Underwent randomization 4629 Persons created Way to Health account 612 Were excluded 10 Were <18 yr of age 84 Smoked <5 cigarettes/day 54 Smoked <6 mo 38 Did not have Internet access 426 Were not CVS Caremark employees or their relatives or friends 4017 Were eligible 1479 Did not complete enrollment 52 Did not provide consent 55 Would not give Social Security number 1372 Did not complete baseline survey 468 Were assigned to usual care 468 Were included in primary analysis 471 Were assigned to competitive deposit 471 Were included in primary analysis 582 Were assigned to individual deposit 582 Were included in primary analysis 519 Were assigned to collaborative reward 519 Were included in primary analysis 498 Were assigned to individual reward 498 Were included in primary analysis The New England Journal of Medicine is produced by NEJM Group, a division of the Massachusetts Medical Society.

In the collaborative-reward group, payments to successful group members at each time point increased with increasing group success rates, from $100 per time point if one participant quit to $600 per time point per participant if all six quit. We sought to foster collaboration among participants with the use of a Web-based chat room through which they could communicate throughout the study.\n\nIn the competitive-deposit group, $150 deposits from each of six group members, plus a $450 matching reward per member ($3,600 total), was redistributed among members who quit at each time point. For example, if only two participants in a group quit at 14 days but returned to smoking by 30 days, those two participants would receive $600 each at 14 days, and there would be no further payouts to the members of that group. Members of competitive cohorts received accurate but anonymous descriptions of their competitors to make vivid the possibility that others might benefit from their own lack of change  21  without enabling participants to undermine a competitor's efforts.\n\nParticipants in the group-incentive groups were also given a $200 bonus if they sustained abstinence through 6 months. Thus, the four interventions differed in how incentives would accrue and be disbursed (Fig.  S2  in the Supplementary Appendix), but the payment schedule and bonus were identical, and on the basis of anticipated success rates, we estimated that each intervention carried an expected value of $800."

      "title": "Outcomes",
      "text": "The primary outcome was sustained abstinence from smoking for 6 months after the target quit date.  27 Achievement of sustained abstinence required that submitted saliva samples had a cotinine concentration of less than 10 ng per milliliter 28 at 14 days, 30 days, and 6 months. For users of nicotine-replacement therapy, a urinary sample with an anabasine concentration of less than 3 ng per milliliter was considered to show sustained abstinence.  29 Participants who did not submit samples were coded as actively smoking. Secondary outcomes included the initial quit rate at 14 days, sustained abstinence for 30 days, and sustained abstinence through 12 months (i.e., 6 months after the final incentive disbursement).\n\nIncentive acceptance rates reflected the proportion of participants assigned to that incentive who agreed to the contract. In the two groups requiring deposits, we considered participants to have accepted the intervention if they made $150 deposits by credit or debit card within 60 days after enrollment or before their selected quit date, whichever came first. Consenting participants who declined their assigned program remained in their assigned group for intentionto-treat analyses and were treated identically to those in the usual-care group."

      "text": "We specified three analyses corresponding to the aims of the study. First, we used logistic regression to compare acceptance of the interventions, adjusting for the two variables according to which the randomization was stratified.  30 Second, we conducted intention-to-treat analyses using logistic regression to compare the effectiveness of incentive programs among all randomly assigned participants. Third, we compared the efficacy of the interventions. We first conducted traditional per-protocol analyses, comparing groups of participants who accepted different interventions. However, because such analyses are subject to selection biases,  31  our primary approach to measure efficacy modeled the randomization group as an instrumental variable  32, 33  in analyses of the complier average treatment effect.  [34] [35] 5] [36]  These analyses, described in detail in the Supplementary Appendix, used data on all randomly assigned participants to estimate treatment effects for participants who would have accepted each intervention.\n\nWe estimated that a sample of 2185 participants would provide 80% power to detect absolute differences of at least 7.5 percentage points in the rate of sustained abstinence between any one of the three novel incentive programs and the individual-reward program. Details of this calculation are provided in the Supplementary Appendix."

      "text": "More than 50 years after the release of the first Surgeon General's report on the harmful effects of smoking, national policies, behavioral programs, and pharmacologic approaches have helped reduce smoking rates in the United States.  37 owever, the need for new approaches is clear because smoking remains the leading cause of preventable illness and death.  38, 39 n this large randomized trial across the United States, we found that four different incentive programs with expected values of $800 were each effective in promoting sustained abstinence from smoking. Perhaps the most important finding is that incentive programs that required people to deposit $150 of their own money were less effective overall than rewardbased programs of similar value because few people accepted such deposit programs. This was true despite the $650 reward offered to depositarm participants in addition to the return of their original $150 deposits. However, analyses that account for the different acceptance rates of the interventions showed that deposit-based incentives were substantially more efficacious than reward-based incentives among people who would have accepted either. The robustness of this result to reasonably large potential selection effects suggests that incentives that build on participants' loss aversion  13  may meaningfully change behavior.\n\nSecond, we found that group-oriented reward programs were not significantly more effective than individual-oriented programs. The results of this large trial are therefore consistent with those of small randomized, controlled trials of incentives for weight loss in which group-oriented Acceptance rates were adjusted for two stratifying variables  30  : whether participants received their health insurance through CVS Caremark and whether their annual household income was at least $60,000 or less than $60,000.

Because employing a smoker is estimated to cost $5,816 more each year than employing a nonsmoker,  40  even an $800 payment borne entirely by employers and paid only to those who quit would be highly cost-saving.\n\nThis study has limitations. First, the low rate of acceptance of the deposit programs required protocol modifications to restrict the proportions of participants who would be randomly assigned to those groups. Implementing these limitations preserved balance in participant characteristics across groups and preserved power for all effectiveness analyses but limited the precision of analyses comparing the efficacy of reward and deposit groups. Second, only 41% of the participants had access to free pharmacologic and behavioral cessation aids through their employee benefits. However, smoking-cessation rates were not higher among those with access to such aids, a finding that suggests that the superiority of incentives would hold in populations with universal access. Third, in all trial groups, nearly half the smokers who quit at the end of the intervention at 6 months did not document sustained abstinence through 12 months. This suggests similar durability of financial incentives to nicotine-replacement therapy and bupropion, for which relapse after completion of treatment has also occurred in roughly 50% of the participants.  41, 42 Secondary analyses suggest that the true relapse rates in our trial may have been lower, given the reduction in submission of any samples at 12 months across groups (Table  S3  in the Supplementary Appendix).\n\nThis study also has several strengths. In addition to comparing financial incentives for smoking cessation in a large number of partici-pants, the trial measured the specific contributions of acceptance and efficacy of the interventions to their overall effectiveness. This trial also compared multiple incentive programs with design features based on behavioral economic theory, including repeated payments to reinforce target behaviors,  43  bonus payments at the end of the intervention to offset smokers' tendencies to discount the importance of future events,  44, 45  and the provision of ongoing feedback regarding participants' accrued gains and losses contingent on their self-reported smoking status to maximize the effect of regret aversion.  20, 21 Finally, this trial randomly selected participants for screening cotinine tests to prevent nonsmokers from enrolling. The robustness of our findings in analyses accounting for potential participation of nonsmokers provides strong evidence regarding the effectiveness of incentives.

In addition, the efficacy of depositbased contracts among those who use them and the cost-effectiveness of such contracts for employers suggest that future innovations in em-ployee benefit design should seek to establish the effectiveness of smoking-cessation programs requiring deposits smaller than the $150 used in this trial.\n\nSupported by a grant from the National Cancer Institute (R01 CA159932, to Dr. Halpern), a grant from the National Institute on Aging (RC2 AG036592, to Drs.

      "text": "* A detailed explanation of this analysis is provided in the Supplementary Appendix. In brief, this method uses the randomization group as an instrumental variable, thereby providing estimates of the efficacy of interventions among people who accept them. Unlike traditional per-protocol analyses, this approach uses data on all randomly assigned participants and adjusts estimates of efficacy for the selection biases that may arise if participants' decisions to accept or decline their assigned interventions are related to their underlying odds of smoking cessation.  [34] [35] 5] [36]  This analysis assumes that participants who would accept deposits would have also accepted rewards if rewards had instead been offered.\n\nEstimates are on the additive scale; thus, absolute risk differences are shown with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). \u2020 The efficacy of deposit contracts is statistically superior to the efficacy of rewards as long as the underlying odds of quitting among participants who accept deposits are no more than 12.5 times greater than the odds of quitting among participants who would only accept rewards."
