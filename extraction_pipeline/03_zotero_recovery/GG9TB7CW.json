  "title": "ECOLOGICAL MOMENTARY ASSESSMENT (EMA) IN BEHAVIORAL MEDICINE",
  "abstract": "Behavioral medicine researchers are often interested in phenomena that occur in subjects' natural environments: when people experience pain, when they take medication, what causes their blood pressure to rise, etc. However, it has typically been difficult to study these events directly in real-world settings. Instead, investigators have either tried to model them in laboratory settings or have assessed them indirectly by asking subjects to reflect back upon their real-world experiences. Each of these approaches has significant disadvantages. Laboratory studies, while affording a good deal ofcontrol, may not faithfully capture real-world phenomena and thus may not generalize to real-world settings. Retrospective self-report data are easy to collect, but their validity is often weak. They are subject to a number of biases, discussed below, and they are limited to phenomena of which the subject is aware. The aim of this article and this mini-series is to introduce to behavioral medicine researchers recently-developed approaches for assessing behavioral and cognitive processes in their natural settings. Ecological Momentary Assessment (EMA) uses monitoring or sampling strategies to assess phenomena at the moment they occur in natural settings, thus maximizing ecological validity while avoiding retrospective recall. EMA methods grow out of traditions of naturalistic observation (1) and are direct descendants ofseminal work using the Experience Sampling Method (2-5), which emphasizes naturalistic description of phenomenological experience. Our task here is to define the cardinal elements of these approaches and to describe their application to behavioral medicine problems. This article is organized into the following sections: the definition ofEMA and the rationale underlying the definition; a description ofthe methodology, including examples of its usage; and commentary on the papers making up this mini-series. \n WHAT ARE ECOLOGICAL MOMENTARY ASSESSMENTS?

      "text": "retrospective self-reports. It is well-acknowledged that humans do not have infinite recall capacity and that events may fade from memory over time. This simple memory decay process mayor may not prove deleterious for a given investigation depending upon the degree offorgetting that occurs and the goal of the study. The degree of forgetting depends on the period of recall and the type of information being recalled, which can range from trivial, minor events to major, emotionally powerful catastrophes. Clearly, long recall periods with minor events will yield unreliable estimates ofthe actual occurrence ofevents, but may not be troublesome for a study if all of the subjects are forgetting in a similar way.\n\nUnfortunately, recall ofautobiographical information is affected by processes more complex than simple forgetting. There are several cognitive processes involved in recall that introduce significant bias into the recalled information. Basic to the psychology of recall is that it involves processes of memory search and reconstruction that rely on heuristic strategies, each ofwhich can introduce unintentional bias. Effort after meaning pertains to the reconstruction of events in a way that is consistent with the reporter's view of his or her own behavior or of human behavior in general  (6, 7) . Retroactive reconstruction, a variant of effort after meaning, refers to biasing of reports of recalled events based on knowledge of event(s) that occurred after the target event. For example, knowing the outcome (favorable or not) of coping with a stressor may affect the recall of the initial stressor. A more general bias might be labeled reconstruction bias and is based on the strategies that people use to facilitate recall. Such strategies are heavily influenced by cognitive availability or ease ofaccess ofinformation  (8, 9) . For example, when asked to recall mood over a day, people may overly weight particular experiences based on their saliency or recency. Finally, the current state of a person at the time of a report may bias the recall of previous events; for example, recall of mood is substantially affected by mood at the time of recall  (10, 11) .\n\nThese processes, built into the operation of autobiographical memory, can significantly bias recall ofspecific events. They become even more powerful when subjects are asked to summarize events; for example, to characterize a whole day or to characterize their behavior in general. In such instances, subjects must not only recall multiple events, but also summarize them into a presumed \"average state,\" introducing additional opportunities for bias  (8) . Thus, a variety of cognitive processes can seriously affect the validity of retrospective self-report data.\n\nTo reduce potential recall bias, EMA relies on assessing phenomena on a momentary basis. This is a far cry from most current methods of measuring psychological and medical concepts; they typically rely on subjects' recall over long periods of time. Thus, ifaffect were the construct being examined, then an EMA assessment would ask about affect at the moment and not for a summary of how the individual was feeling over the last hour, day, week, or generally. Behaviors or symptoms are assessed with reference to a particular current instance or moment, rather than at some abstract, average level."

      "title": "EMA Is Dependent upon Careful Timing of Assessments",
      "text": "Given that one is trying to assess particular moments, the timing of assessment becomes critical. Whereas assessment of global properties can be scheduled for the convenience of subjects or researchers, the scheduling of EMA recordings must be carefully planned. Careful scheduling is demanded by the need to capture the relevant moments; for example, assessing alcohol drinking during the day would miss most drinking episodes, which occur in the evening  (12) . Importantly, EMA studies typically rely on a sampling strategy to capture and characterize a class of events. Thus, the timing of assessments must be carefully considered to ensure that an adequate and unbiased sample is obtained. So, for example, assessments obtained on weekdays might not adequately represent subjects' weekend experience  (12, 13) .\n\nAs part ofthe emphasis on sampling, EMA strategies avoid allowing subjects to choose when they will provide data; subjects would presumably select times that are unrepresentative (e.g. when they are more relaxed or not under other demands). Instead, the EMA investigator typically chooses when subjects will complete assessments, either by careful instruction or by providing an investigator-controlled cue (e.g. a \"beep\") to signal when an assessment is to be completed. The EMA investigator must choose from several sampling strategies the one most suitable to the problem at hand."

      "title": "EMA Methods Usually, but Not Always, Involve a Substantial Number of Repeated Observations",
      "text": "A typical EMA design might assess a subject anywhere from ten to hundreds of times. There are two reasons for this: (a) Larger numbers of assessments produce more reliable samples of the relevant state or behavior; and (b) The EMA investigator is usually interested in how the target behavior (e.g. cortisol secretion) (13) covaries with situational antecedents (e.g. stress or environmental demand), and therefore must provide an opportunity for variation in both. The multiple momentary measures may later be aggregated into trait-like measures, but with an important difference: the degree to which the measurements vary over situations is known, and some of the variability can be explained by reference to other variables. So, for example, blood pressure will vary from assessment to assessment as subjects' posture and activity varies, making any single reading a poor estimate ofthe true average  (14) . This rationale, so obvious for blood pressure, applies at least as strongly to psychological constructs which show considerable situational variability.\n\nWhile EMA studies will usually involve a substantial number of repeated observations, this need not necessarily be the case. Multiple observations are required ifan investigator wishes to understand within-subject variation, such as the blood pressure variability just mentioned. However, it is possible that a single EMA sample could provide workable data. For example, if an investigator wanted to explore situational determinants of momentary cortisol secretion, then a randomly drawn blood sample from a large number of individuals could be used to determine situational influences on the hormone. This would not be a particularly efficient way to answer the question, but the point is that EMA does not require many observations for each subject. Even if the sample is small, however, attention to the sampling is critical: selection of the moment at which the sample is drawn is even more important when the number of observations per person is small."

      "title": "EMA Measurements Are Made in the Environments That Subjects Typically Inhabit",
      "text": "In contrast to other assessment strategies that remove subjects from their usual environment for the purpose of administering a test or for collecting physiological data, EMA emphasizes the ecological validity of assessments  (15)  over the control afforded by artificial environments. This follows in part from the idea ofassessments as samples ofthe relevant behavior. An example of the problems that arise when this dictum is not followed is what has been termed \"white-coat hypertension\" (WCH)  (16) . Although the mechanism underlying WCH is not known, it is clear that some people have higher blood pressure readings when the readings are done in a quasi-medical setting compared to those taken in the natural environment. Thus, the sample taken in the laboratory is systematically unrepresentative of their true average blood pressure. Laboratory environments also exercise significant control over key variables such as mood (e.g. subjects are often anxious, but seldom elated in the laboratory). By assessing subjects in their natural environments, EMA aims to observe the natural range and variation of their responses to naturally-occurring variability in internal and situational factors. Generalization to the real world is built in."

      "title": "APPLICATIONS AND METHODS",
      "text": "In this section, we describe some of the uses of EMA and touch upon several issues that need to be considered in applying the method. Because this is a short paper, we will not be exhaustive in our description, but provide the reader with several examples that should afford a general sense of the method.\n\nMany phenomena of interest to behavioral medicine researchers are amendable to EMA. Rapidly fluctuating processes come to mind first. Affect, pain perceptions, coping efforts, symptom reports, blood pressure, heart rate, respiration, activity levels, hormones, smoking, eating, drinking, drug use, and some immune functions jump out as natural candidates for EMA. Perhaps less obvious are the controlling independent variables that may influence these variables. Subjects' location, activity, mood, social setting, etc. may be important insofar as they influence the dependent variable, and may also be of interest in themselves.\n\nThere are a multitude of decisions facing an investigator planning to use EMA. In many ways these are similar to decisions a daily event researcher faces  (18) . Many issues, though, are unique to EMA. One of these is the choice of a sampling scheme that will optimally capture the phenomenon to be studied. Wheeler and Reis  (19)  have discussed three scheduling formats: event-contingent, time-contingent, and signal-contingent.\n\nEvent-contingent schedules require action on the part ofthe subject (completing a questionnaire, taking a blood pressure reading, etc.) when a particular event occurs. For example, Shiffman et al.  (12)  had subjects complete a questionnaire prior to smoking a cigarette. Event-contingent schemes are especially useful for low-frequency events, but require good subject compliance and clear definition ofthe target event. Time-contingent schemes require action according to a regular time schedule. For example, the ambulatory blood pressure device used by Schwartz et al. (  14 ) inflated every 15 minutes. Signal-contingent schedules involve a signalling device that a subject carries; the subject takes some action when the device signals them. Preprogrammed watches, such as those used by van Eck and Nicolson  (13) , and computers, such as those used by Shiffman et al.  (12)  and Stone et al.  (17) , signal subjects to record information and/or obtain physiological samples.\n\nOnce a scheduling format has been chosen, the next decision is the sampling scheme for that schedule. This concerns the manner in which possible opportunities to assess the subject are sampled. For example, with an event-contingent schedule, the researcher may decide that subject burden would be excessive if every event were to be assessed. An alternative scheme is one where every fifth event is sampled or every tenth. More complex schemes, such as randomly sampling from recording opportunities to collect a target number of assessments, are possible (e.g. 12) and may have desirable qualities. The same sort of decisions apply to signal-contingent schedules: subjects could be signalled at a regular interval (every 60 minutes) or randomly. Regular intervals carry the risk that the assessment schedule may become entrained to a natural rhythm in subjects' lives (e.g. sampling a psychotherapist hourly may always catch him or her ending a session) or that subjects' awareness of the upcoming assessment interferes with their natural activities. A detailed discussion of sampling schemes and an evaluation of their qualities is found in Delespaul  (20) .\n\nOnce scheduling and sampling decisions have been made, the investigator is faced with hardware instrumentation issues. As the reader has certainly gathered by now, EMA is technologically intensive and there are many different ways to implement the sampling schemes. This is exemplified by the options for signal-contingent recording. Electronic pagers, with \"beeps\" processed through a paging company service; specialized digital watches; pocket electronic schedulers; and palmtop computers, with varying degrees of programmability and connectivity to desktop computers, have been used to signal subjects. The signals may also be issued by a physiological monitoring device. While the technology may require some learning for investigators, the reader should not underestimate the preparation that subjects require to become accustomed to using these devices. Considerable investment in individualized subject training (often lasting one or more hours) is required for a successful study.\n\nThe EMA investigator must also deal with measurement issues. Some are the same as those that arise in any behavioral study: reliable and valid measures, appropriate matching of instruments with the target construct and the subject population, etc. Beyond these standards, the EMA investigator must deal with additional issues arising from the fact that assessments will typically be completed dozens or even hundreds of times. For example, measures must be kept very brief: In EMA studies, unlike most one-time assessments, an investment in subject training on the assessment (e.g. explaining item content, practicing the assessment, etc.) will payoff handsomely.\n\nTechnology is also broadening the scope of EMA assessments beyond self-report. The increasing availability ofportable monitors to assess a broad spectrum ofphysiological parameters (e.g. blood pressure, activity level, blood glucose) opens up a broad array of possibilities for EMA assessment.\n\nThe application of EMA methods also opens up opportunities-and challenges-for new forms ofdata analysis. The fact that subjects in EMA studies typically complete many assessments, and that the number of assessments varies across subjects, generally precludes the application oftraditional statistical approaches. There is no accepted wisdom in this area: several recent papers address-but do not resolve-the data-analytic issues that arise in processing EMA data  (17, 21, 22) . Indeed, Schwartz et al.'s  (14)  paper in this series is, in part, a methodological treatise on these issues. Several more traditional approaches to data analysis are represented within the papers in the mini-series: aggregation across occasions (averaging observations within conditions)  (13) ; pooled within-subject regression (analyzing observations while removing between-subject variance)  (12, 17) ; and what might be called the meta-analytic approach (using the statistical results of individual within-subject analyses as input to between-subject analyses)  (12) ."

      "title": "THE PAPERS IN THIS MINI-SERIES",
      "text": "The papers we invited for this series exemplify the diverse areas within behavioral medicine where EMA may be applied. Smoking, drinking, mood, fatigue, blood pressure, activities, body position, social setting, and hormones have all been assessed using EMA methods in these four papers. The papers vary in their approaches to EMA issues, and we comment briefly on them.\n\nThe Shiffman et al.  (12)  paper examines the covariation between two appetitive behaviors-smoking and drinking-in a clinical sample. From a design perspective, it combines both event-and signal-contingent schedules in a single study. It is the high degree of programmability-implemented on a palmtop computer with sophisticated programming-that enables such a complex strategy to be realized. It is notable that the computer records response latencies, allows for periods of \"downtime,\" allows for branching of questioning depending upon answers to previous questions, and enables convenient transfer of data. These are all desirable qualities for EMA protocols. On the other hand, the initial development costs and equipment expenses are high. The paper also exemplifies the use of data about situational context-in this case, as a control for confounding variables that may cause smoking and drinking to only appear related.\n\nThe Schwartz et al.  (14)  paper documents the use of EMA methods for exploring mood and blood pressure associations. Formerly, research to examine this question would have been conducted in a laboratory setting, but with the advent of ambulatory monitors, measurement in the field was possible. The study used the ambulatory blood pressure monitor's own internal clock to signal the subject every 15 minutes. This is a very high frequency of recording and rather demanding for participants. However, unlike the other studies where subjects participated for several days, the entire monitoring period in this study was 24 hours. The analytic methods and discussion of previous techniques for analyzing momentary data in this paper are also noteworthy because, by treating subjects as a randomeffects factor, they may allow the results to be generalized to other samples of subjects. This study also exemplifies the use of situational data to control for confounds that may obscure the relationship between mood and cardiovascular activity.\n\nThe van Eck and Nicolson paper (13) addresses a classic relationship in the stress literature with EMA techniques: the association between perceived stress and a hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal hormone, cortisol. Previous studies have examined this relationship in field settings (e.g. parachute jumping)"

The aggregation of data in this study precludes detailed analysis ofmoment-to-moment variations in stress, but provides for very reliable assessment of betweensubject and day-of-week effects. Finally, the paper by Stone et al.  (17)  examines a puzzling illness, chronic fatigue syndrome, and tracks the core symptom of the illness, fatigue, with EMA methods. This paper demonstrates how EMA methods can be used to study diurnal cycles of psychological constructs, how the activities that subjects are engaged in during prompts can affect the data, and how psychological constructs covary on a momentary basis. The paper also shows how such data may be used to explore symptoms of a clinical syndrome and relate them to situational and diurnal cycles."

While laboratory studies afford a degree of control not available in field studies, field methods such as EMA afford a degree of ecological validity not attainable in artificial environments. Especially given behavioral medicine researchers' interest in transient phenomena-be it episodes of pain or other symptoms, instances ofhealth-injurious or health-protective behaviors, or responses to environmental stressors-Ecological Momentary Assessment may allow us to take new steps toward understanding the relation between the environment, behavior, and health."
