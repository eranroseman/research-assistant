  "title": "Understanding health care workers' mental health needs: insights from a qualitative study on digital interventions",
  "abstract": "Importance Health care workers (HCWs) face significant mental health challenges when delivering care and over the span of their careers. Despite growing recognition of these issues, barriers such as stigma, structural limitations, and individual obstacles continue to impede progress in supporting HCWs mental health needs. Digital mental health platforms continue to expand in health systems as they offer novel approaches to address these gaps, but more evidence is needed to understand their reception among HCWs. Objective To examine the perceptions of HCWs regarding their mental health, explore barriers and facilitators to accessing mental health care, and assess their experiences with digital mental health interventions within the context of the pandemic. Design A qualitative study using semi-structured interviews with HCWs who participated in a prior randomized controlled trial (RCT) assessing the impact of a digital mental health platform on anxiety and depression. Setting A large, urban, academic health system. Participants A purposive sample of 64 HCWs, including physicians, nurses, technicians, administrative staff, and social workers, was recruited. Participants were selected from the upper and lower quartiles of anxiety and depression scores from the parent RCT to capture a range of mental health symptomatology. \n Outcomes and measures The study aimed to identify HCWs' attitudes toward mental health care, barriers to utilizing professional resources, and their experiences with the digital mental health platform at the local institution. A thematic content analysis was used to analyze the interview data. \n Results Five major themes were identified: (1) the evolving mental health challenges during and after the pandemic, (2) individual barriers to accessing care, such as personal coping strategies and familial responsibilities, (3) structural barriers like workload and limited access to mental health clinicians, (4) experiences with digital mental health",

      "text": "Health care workers (HCW) face dynamic emotional challenges when providing patient care and over the span of their careers  [1] [2] [3] . These challenges include, but are not limited to, mortality and morbidity of patients, moral injury when capacity is strained or resources are scarce, personal and psychological safety among rising workplace violence, and health care associated burnout. The pandemic exacerbated the mental health strain and symptomatology facing the many roles across the health care workforce beyond physicians and nurses, and also heightened public awareness of it, including calls from the US surgeon general  [4]  and national medical societies to address this unmet need  [5] [6] [7] . A 2023 metaanalysis of anxiety and depression during the pandemic noted pooled prevalence of HCW anxiety at 41% and depression at 34%  [8] . Despite this, research has shown that few, an estimated 20% of HCWs seek mental health care for themselves  [9] . The implications of these strains and stressors are profound as burnout and mental health strain lead to a depleted workforce, worse patient care and outcomes, and increasing costs.\n\nIn an ever-expanding digital landscape, health systems have launched mobile apps, chatbots, and digital mental health platforms to support HCWs and connect them to mental health care  [10] [11] [12] [13] . These efforts continue to grow and yet uptake of these services or approaches are hindered by stigma  [14, 15]  associated with acknowledging a need for mental health support and care, as well as ultimately seeking and connecting with care. Furthermore, barriers to connecting with mental health care are more pronounced for women, racial and ethnic minorities (e.g., Black and Hispanic) members of the health care workforce. Developing system-wide solutions which account for the diversity across individuals and across roles remains difficult. An additional challenge remains in developing proactive approaches which help HCWs identify mental health challenges to address them before they worsen to disorders or contribute to burnout.\n\nAs digital methods grow, the voice and perspective of HCWs and their reactions to these programs remains understudied. Critical to improving, and sustaining, the mental health of the health care workforce is designing programs that are accessible and actionable by the HCWs themselves. Understanding the experiences and context of mental health in HCWs requires methods that provide time, space, and exploration of this contextual information. Using qualitative methods to explore these areas, we sought to understand HCWs' perspectives on mental health across the workforce, acknowledging and accessing mental health services, and the existing digital mental health solutions available to them in their local environment. We aimed to identify the key themes identified by a range of individuals working in the health care workforce and evaluate their perspectives of a proactive remote strategy for supporting HCW mental health and well-being in a digital world."

      "text": "We conducted semi-structured qualitative interviews of HCWs who enrolled and participated in a separately reported randomized controlled trial (RCT) testing the effect of proactive digital mental health strategy upon anxiety and depression  [12] . The RCT intervention sent enrolled HCW participants monthly mental health assessments and linkage to an existing mental health and well-being platform via text messaging. The RCT demonstrated reductions in anxiety and depression among those HCWs randomized to the intervention as compared to usual care which was self-initiated use of the mental health platform.\n\nThis qualitative study took place within a large, urban, academic health system located in the northeastern United States. Eligible HCWs for this study included adults (age 18 years or older), employed by the health system and working in roles such as physicians, nurses, technicians, social workers, pharmacists, registration staff or other roles where patient facing interaction regularly. The interviews were informed by existing society frameworks on clinician well-being including the National Academy of Medicine  [16] [17] [18]  and designed to explore HCWs' attitudes and decision-making involved in mental health care, perceptions of accessing mental health care, and experiences with digital mental health platforms. This study followed the Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research (COREQ)  [19] . The study protocol was approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board (#848844).\n\nThe parent RCT assessed anxiety and depression over nine-months. For the interviews, a purposive deviance sampling approach  [20]  was used to identify HCWs from the upper and lower quartiles of anxiety and depression. This deviance selection process was used to increase the potential to identify themes unique to high or low levels of mental health strain. Participants were invited via email to participate in the study following the RCT intervention period and interviews were completed within 3 months of a participant's completion of the RCT."

      "text": "Participants were recruited using email and text message invitations over a five-week period. Participants completed informed consent, and interviews were conducted between March 2023 and May 2023 using a HIPAA-compliant video conferencing platform. Participants were compensated $50.\n\nInterviews lasted 20-35 min and averaged 30 min. Interviews were recorded and transcribed using videoconferencing captions and verified by the research team. Two non-HCW research team members completed all interviews (RG, MS). The two interviewers self-identified as female, one as South Asian, and one as Hispanic. A coding structure was developed based on concepts from the interview guide as well as emergent themes. Thematic content analysis and a general inductive approach was used to code all of the transcripts using NVivo 14.0 software (QSR International)  [21, 22] . Two coders read five transcripts and drafted the outline of a codebook. Each coder then independently coded five more shared transcripts to adjust the codebook and conduct an interrater agreement assessment. Following adjudication of any areas of discrepancy, the coders shared an additional three transcripts to review coding for inter-rater reliability, measured by Cohen's kappa which was > 0.8, and overall comprehensiveness was achieved. Following adjudication of any areas of discrepancy, coders independently coded the remaining transcripts. Strategies used to ensure reliability and validity in the qualitative data included a comprehensive audit trail, checks between coders, and team debriefings. Interviews were audiorecorded only, and no participants ended the interview early."

The patient overload during those 2 years [and] the unknown of what's going on, how can we deal with this and how can we treat it? It was pretty, overwhelming in many ways, body and mind, I mean. We were non-stop for months, and when I say non-stop, it was 7 days a week, 18 hours, we slept in the hospital. \" (Participant 10, Physician)\n\n\"We had so many pass away. It was really hard to deal with, and then also our study decided that we need to ask 50 questions about how sad everybody in the pandemic was, and how they couldn't access healthcare. [For example], if they could get their medications or not. They gave us a month to do this for 400 people and said it would take 15 minutes to 2 hours, so I was pulling 16 hour days, completely alone. I would call their relatives and they'd either be dead, or they would be able to get their medication. They, all their friends and family, were dying. It was the worst experience of my life. \" (Participant 19, Other) Communication and uncertainty:\n\n\"It was very tense. There were so many changes daily, and it was challenging as a leader to translate those changes in real time. They were pretty heavy, strong changes and changes that we haven't ever seen or dealt with before. Managing staff's reactions to these changes was hard\u2026 Anger was shared among the staff, and then I had to manage all of their feelings all at one time. That was very challenging. \" (Participant 47, Nurse) \"It was incredibly stressful. There was so much information coming down the pike. But  no real map at all as to what to do. [It felt like a] random inventing of the wheel in terms of how to provide care and how to support therapist. Partnering that [feeling] with the fear of actual Covid, and not knowing what was safe or unsafe, at work or in your personal life. It was stressful, confusing, and scary. \" (Participant 21, Social Worker) Internal and personal barriers to care Stigma \"I think with mental health, it is more personal, and you may not have any experience. I think, especially in different communities, it' s you stigmatized or not talked about, and so you may not know where to go or who to talk to. \" (Pt 9, Physician) \"I think that again that there' s a stigma attached to it. Not as [much] maybe\u2026 I think we've gotten better\u2026 think there' s definitely you know more work to be done\u2026 to really just lay it out there and say, 'Hey, it' s okay if you're not okay. That' s all right. And we can help you. We have resources to help you' . Because it may be that something that simple\u2026 people just don't know. \" (Pt 57, Nurse) Perceived Need\n\n\"I know that I have access to mental health services but it's something that I've personally struggled to get into\u2026 I think that's like more of a personal obstacle that has been created rather than like an actual like physical obstacle that exists. \" (Participant 41, Research Coordinator) \"I felt like they were there, but I wasn't sure how they were going be helpful. \" (Participant 21, Social Worker) \"I don't believe that it was something on the top of my mind. I don't think it had anything to do with access. I just think that it wasn't something that was just at the forefront of my mind. I think we were just so much on. [It was like], 'go, go! Let's get it done let's get it done. ' (Participant 6, Receptionist/Patient Intake) Individual coping in place of professional help \"I sewed and crocheted, I kept myself busy. I read a lot. I kept the TV off; I didn't watch the news and didn't listen to the news. I didn't follow new stories and things like that. I [would] call my family and relatives to make sure that they were doing okay. I was mindful of my own situation and manage  [d]  to get through my stress. \" (Participant 44, Other) \"I've always been a runner. Running is huge for me. [I liked] being outside and working in my flower beds. I have a huge support. I did personal meetings with some of my church members. \" (Participant 27, Nurse) \"My co-workers, we're going through the same thing, both because we're able to talk with each other and vent to each other. \" (Participant 41, Research Coordinator) \"We have a pharmacy group [chat] where we just share memes with each other about our troubles and our mental health issues. That's how we called that power therapy. \" (Participant 12, Pharmacy Technician) Familial Responsibilities \"I did try to talk to my family, but none of them really understood, because and no one of my family is in the medical field. They were happy to be home, doing work from home, so they didn't really fully understand. I mean they felt bad for me but they only knew what I told them and what they saw on the news. \" (Participant 38, Nurse) \"I had to make sure my kids were okay. I had to make sure they weren't scared. My well-being was on the back burner the entire time. \" (Participant 42, Radiology Technician) \"My husband is also an essential employee. So there was the fear of who's going to take care of my kids? Am I exposing our parents to this. That was very. That was probably the most stressful thing. \" (Participant 49, Nurse) \"My schedule was completely thrown up in the air, and when could I get hours to continue to make money to support our family? I had a lot of stress. I feel like it took a negative effect on my marriage a bit because we just didn't really connect during that whole shutdown time because I was work trying to work shifts to get the income that we needed. \" (Participant 64, Physical Therapist)\n\nTable 2 Qualitative themes, subthemes, and select quotes"

I had a situation outside of work that happened, and I also needed to find therapy. I literally had a list of therapists, and I was going down the list, calling each and every one of these doctors and no one was accepting new appointments\" (Participant 42, Radiology Technician) \"I do hear some people say that a lot of the therapists now are booked, so it's hard for them to schedule an appointment. I think I was like one of the lucky ones that kind of gotten right when the pandemic started. \" (Participant 40, CNA) \"If you're in an underrepresented community, I think it's harder to find someone that you made feel comfortable talking to. I still don't feel like that was necessarily there for me. \" (Participant 9, Physician) \"Everything is so far out like when you call from access to mental health services. It's very hard to get an appointment with anyone. It seems to be so far out. \" (Participant 6, Receptionist/Patient Intake) \"I didn't feel like there was anything really available. Everyone was stretched so thin. I can't say that even if I knew something was available, I would have had been able to take advantage of it because of the way our schedule worked with our kids and my husband  ' s job. \" (Participant 64, Physical Therapist) Workload \"There's no normal regular hours. There's no 40 hour [work week], and we get that. It comes with the territory. But when you work 7 days a week and you sleep there, and you wake up to the same atmosphere, the same environment over and over again. \" (Participant 10, Other) \"My patient flow is so demanding right now. I was just talking to my coworker about yesterday. \" (Participant 13, Patient Care Coordinator) \"I was living here [at the hospital] and got less sleep. You're going from the minute you walk in. There's stuff to do but like your normal stuff. Everything is an emergency, and in that fight or flight [mode]. (Participant 25, Administrative) Work Culture \"I think they should definitely be a lot more conscious of it, especially in [health] care providers. There's been a huge amount of burnout in healthcare workers, and eventually it got to the point where no amount of money is really going to help them. It is more deep-seated. So whether it is offering resources or just offering better work environments, it's something that [leaders] should consider heavily. \" (Participant 14, Researcher) \"I feel like they've they always send out like the emails, with different resources in it. But there's nothing in our day that makes space for those resources, or to do any of that. \" (Participant 64, Physical Therapist) \"You have to find the time to do it. Everything is not accessible during the week. We work during the week. Like I said, it's good on paper. They can send you everything in your email, but you can't access that all week. \" (Participant 13, Patient Care Coordinator) Mental health and a digital health RCT Outlet for Reflection \"I enjoy those surveys because I remember honestly, it was me and 2 other people that were doing the surveys, and we were at our own computers. But after we finished the surveys, we discussed it, and it was almost like, Wow! The question that they were asking was almost like some of the question, like with people working through. And you almost feel like someone cares, or they. They are trying. They see a change in something, and they want to fix it. \" (Participant 40, CNA) \"I like the surveys because I feel like they're trying to get to the root of what the issues may be, no matter what they are. It shows that they care, you know. That's why I said. The resources are there. You gotta use them because we can't find a whole bunch of people that actually care. \" (Participant 45, EVS) \"It felt good to have an outlet. Finally, somebody's asking the questions that matter, somebody actually cares. But it is also depressing in a sense, because now I have to admit these realities to myself. \" (Participant 42, Radiology Technician) \"Some of [the survey] definitely made me pause and really think about like and assess how I've been feeling in the past couple of months. I feel like it was panic time. Taking this survey helped me be able to slow down. And be like, 'okay, I actually have been dealing with this amount in anxiety and I actually have been, you know, feeling burned out in some situations. So definitely a time for introspection. \" (Participant 41, Research Coordinator) Resources \"I think it's really good to stay on people's minds, so that they remember that this is a resource. \" (Participant 21, Social Worker) \"I thought it was a good reminder, a good check in. I honestly didn't utilize them, but I didn't feel bothered by them. \" (Participant 22, Nurse Practioner) \"They were informative, especially, if I wanted to look into it and peruse what the resource was. \" (Participant 23, Program Manager) \"I think there was some tips on when you're feeling down what you can do. What of the things was to get out, move around, do some like if you have a small space, you can do this, and this as far as exercise goes. And I still do that. That was very, very helpful. \" (Participant 25, Adminstrative) \"I think it was a helpful reminder to kind of check and see what might have been new. It wasn't a resource I looked at every day, obviously so it was nice to have like an update, whether it was like the podcast or other sessions that might have been coming up. I think that's how I initially found the group sessions. I would recommend keeping those up. \" (Participant 30, Research Management) \"I already have a therapist I work with, so I didn't feel like I needed them. But if someone did not have regular access to a therapist, and maybe could have used someone to check in with. I thought it was nice to have that offer presented to them. It can take a lot of mental energy just to kind of go through the process of 'like okay, where do I go to find these sessions. ' It involves a lot of clicking and navigating, and you're kind of over it if you can't find it right away. So it was nice that it was fed to you. \" (Participant 14, Researcher)\n\nTable 2 (continued) their mental health. Several noted that the pandemic made their work and home lives more isolating. \"My clinic was one of the initial COVID units, so coming into that as a new nurse was overwhelming and isolating. [It was] physically uncomfortable and hard to connect with patients and peers due to the physical lack of ability. \" (Pt 26, Nurse) Communication and uncertainty The constant changes led to confusion, chaos, and general \"unknowingness.\" \"It felt like doomsday\u2026 It was just a complete state of panic and not knowing anything.\" (Pt 42, Technician) Confusion was amplified by inconsistent and changing communication, \"I had to translate or communicate changes on a daily basis which was exhausting. It was just non-stop.\" (Pt 46, Receptionist) Throughout the interviews, participants noted a wide variety of stressinducing emotions describing, \"it was a lot, I think I still have some trauma from it\u2026 It interfered with everything\"\n\n(Pt 40, CNA). Many reflected on their choice to be a HCW and the associated \"new reality\" created between HCWs and their employers; one participant noted, \"My anxiety was that I personally would die and although I have peace with this, my anxiety now is a lack of trust in the health care system. \" (Pt 17, Nurse)."

Stigma was summarized as a feeling of admitting weakness to others or among others who remain stoic in the face of emotional distress. One physician noted.\n\n\"I think with mental health, it is more personal, and you may not have any experience. I think, especially in different communities, it's stigmatized or not talked about, and so you may not know where to go or who to talk to. \" (Pt 9, Physician) Furthermore, for those who acknowledged their own need, seeking out and accessing mental health care was also taboo to talk about in the workplace or with coworkers, adding an additional barrier to care.

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "This study provides a HCW perspective on the challenges they face and on rapidly expanding digital health solutions in the shadow of the pandemic and also a future path for health systems deploying digital mental health strategies. The National Academy of Medicine's conceptual framework for clinician well-being outlines a need for individual, system, and structural levels of opportunities to support workforce well-being  [18] . Digital health solutions aim to address some of these levels by providing a dynamic and scalable solution for busy HCWs who may work eccentric hours or have little time to connect to care. Despite having a digital mental health solution available for these participants, a key finding from this study is that the stigma associated with acknowledging the need for and connecting with mental health care or resources remains a stubbornly persistent barrier at the individual and systemic levels to acknowledging and accessing mental health care among health care workers  [14, 25, 26] .\n\nThe culture of medicine has reinforced a perversely normalized culture and mentality whereby individuals place the needs of their patients and their careers over their own mental health. Indeed, in this study, participants reflected on lack of time to care for basic needs (e.g., eating or going to the bathroom) as a stark contrast to the perceived \"luxuries\" of connecting to mental health care. While many studies have highlighted stigma (e.g., embarrassment, perceived weakness, or ability to treat one's self ) related to seeking mental health care among physicians and nurses, this study includes a broader range of voices from varying roles including technicians, assistants, aides, and more. Despite the heightened attention the pandemic brought to the mental health of HCWs, the workforce remains persistently strained which has led to an exodus with many citing mental health as a primary reason for leaving  [27] . Findings from the study support that challenging the expectations associated with stoicism or a culture of heroism and thus hopefully lowering the stigma surrounding mental health care should remain a top priority for health system leaders. While individualized methods continue to grow, future research will need to develop strategies that personalize care for individuals and secure or prioritize time for HCWs to care for themselves, both at work and at home.\n\nWe highlight the dearth of mental health expertise, in the form of one-to-one therapy, available to HCWs. The Association of American Medical Colleges recently reported on existing and worsening gaps in mental health care  [28] . Despite factors which may improve access to mental health care (e.g., higher education, employment)  [29] , HCWs in this study noted that once they overcame the barriers to entry, they became frustrated as they attempted to navigate a complex system and struggled to connect with an actual mental health expert. Our participants note frustration when attempting to schedule care, challenges with insurance, and timely appointments that fit their schedules. As health systems expand employee assistance programs, study findings suggest that ensuring adequate and timely access to group or individual counseling is important and providing structural mechanisms to allow HCWs to connect with care while not worrying about their clinical obligations. Potential options could include telehealth-based appointments and peerto-peer support as complementary adjuncts to care  [30, 31] . Within the work environment and emphasized by the CDC as an \"actionable step for employers\", creating reserved time and space for HCWs to decompress during work could help individuals process, cope, and recharge as they care for patients.\n\nIn the parent RCT, participants were either left to usual care or were sent mobile assessments with linkage to mental health care and resources. Interestingly, the resources available did not change, but they brought participants closer to care via individual messaging. In this qualitative study the participants provided rich insight on receiving these mobile assessments and messages reported a feeling of support and a sense of being cared for using this remote methodology. Participants described the text messages as useful reminders to check in on themselves and their mental health, and appreciated the connection to the mental health platform. At scale, the strategy may provide one approach to overcoming stigma and setting up structural methods for health systems to be responsive to the mental health needs of the workforce. As our participants have highlighted a one-size-fits-all approach cannot work, this digital strategy helps bring assessments to the individual in a confidential way and in their words, \"helped them feel cared for it by their employer. \" Broadly, this study adds to the literature as it provides the user centered insights needed in an evolving landscape of clinical medicine where mental health strain persists far beyond the pandemic."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "This study has limitations. It was conducted at a single large academic institution and thus may not represent a generalizable population. This study was conducted among HCWs at a health system located in the northeastern United States and cultural or societal norms reflected in these interviews and the responses from the participants may not be generalizable to other countries with differing norms related, but not limited, to careers, work, and healthcare more broadly. While the interviewers are trained and experts in qualitative research, their own identities may have unintentionally shaped the interview. Additionally, the interviews were transcribed and coded, but in this study the transcription drafts were not shared with participants for verification, a process known as member checking, and without member checking there may be portions of the interview that are open to misinterpretation  [32] . This study was also a follow-up evaluation from a prior RCT, whereby participants were provided differing methods of accessing a mental health and well-being platform named Cobalt and not all institutions have a digital mental health platform for their employees at this time. Participants completed the interview after the RCT ended, recall bias is possible. 93 HCWs completed informed consent while 64 completed the interview. We were unable to schedule an interview with 29 participants. The study sample was predominantly female; although this mirrored the parent RCT, males face additional stigma in acknowledging and accessing mental health services. (e.g., societal norms related to masculinity, self-reliance, shame as a few examples)  [33] . Finally, to preserve confidentiality among this group, we did not link or stratify qualitative responses with anxiety or depression scores."

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "This study highlights the persistent mental health challenges HCWs face in connecting to care. As health systems attempt to create structural change in addressing stigma and improving the culture (e.g., expectations of HCWs, psychological safety, and value of mental health) within medicine, they must also build systems for individuals to connect to care. Our study builds upon previous findings and highlights a personalized digital strategy which may address these concerns. Participants noted simple text messaging assessments kept mental health top of mind and signaled that the health system cared about their mental health. The digital solution represents one potential strategy to ensure confidentiality, privacy, and to lower the barriers to connecting with evidencebased mental health care."
