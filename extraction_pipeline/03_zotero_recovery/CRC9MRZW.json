  "title": "Preference-Based Assessments Putting a Dollar Value on Informal Care Time Provided to People Living With Dementia: A Discrete Choice Experiment",
  "abstract": "Objectives: Informal care represents a significant cost driver in dementia but monetizing informal care hours to inform cost-of-illness or economic evaluation studies remains a challenge. This study aimed to use a discrete choice experiment to estimate the value of informal care time provided to people with dementia in Australia accounting for positive and negative impacts of caregiving. Methods: Attributes and levels were derived from a literature review, interviews with carers, and advice received from an advisory group. Attributes included 4 positive and negative caregiving experiences, in addition to \"hours of care provided\" and the \"monetary compensation from the government.\" A D-efficient design was constructed with 2 generic alternatives that represented hypothetical informal caregiving situations. The discrete choice experiment survey was administered online to a representative sample of the Australian general population and a group of informal carers of people with dementia. The willingness to accept estimates were calculated for the 2 samples separately using the mixed logit model in the willingness to pay space. Results: Based on 700 respondents included in the analysis (n = 488 general public, n = 212 informal carers), the mean willingness to accept for an additional hour of informal care, corrected for the positive and negative impacts of informal care, was $21 (95% CI 18-23) for the general public and $20 (95% CI 16-25) for the informal carers sample. \n Conclusion: The estimates generated in this study can be used to inform future cost-of-illness studies and economic evaluations, ensuring that informal care time is considered in future policy and funding decisions.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "Globally, an estimated 55 million people live with dementia, costing the economies worldwide 1.3 trillion US dollars in 2019.  1  More than 50% of these costs are attributable to care provided by informal carers.  1  Informal carers are usually family members or friends who provide unpaid care and support for different activities,  2, 3  with estimates showing that on average 5 hours of care and supervision is provided per day.  1  Without carers, people with dementia would have a poorer quality of life (QOL) and would need institutional care more quickly.  4 Although informal caregiving may seem an attractive alternative to formal care because it reduces the pressure on formal care budgets, it can come at a cost of carer distress and poorer carer QOL.  5, 6 Although some carers may find caring fulfilling,  [7] [8] [9]  often informal carers are often called invisible second patients, given that caregiving can be physically, mentally, emotionally, and financially demanding.  10 Carers of people with dementia are at increased risk of stress, depression, social isolation, and other health complications.  4 Informal care also has an economic impact, including the time given to provide care, travel costs, out-of-pocket costs, inability to continue working, or early retirement of both the carer and the person with dementia.  11 ith rising numbers of people living with dementia, the high economic and health burden associated with informal care requires further policy action to support carers. A recent review recommended that future research should enhance methodological approaches targeting carers of people with dementia, including the valuation of informal care.  12 Nevertheless, the costs and effects experienced by carers providing informal care are often neglected in health policy, including funding decisions.  13 ne reason for the lack of inclusion of informal care in economic evaluation is that robust and standardized methods to place a monetary value on informal care are absent.  14 Traditionally, informal care hours have been valued using the opportunity cost method (ie, values informal care by forgone wages) or the proxy good method (ie, values informal care at the price of the market substitute, also known as the replacement cost method).  15 he latter is most often used to value informal care time within the context of dementia.  16 However, both methods are insensitive"

The proxy good method assumes that informal care and professional care are perfect substitutes, which may not be the case, given that professional care is not the same as the care provided in the context of an ongoing relationship.\n\nMore recently, stated preference methods, such as discrete choice experiments (DCEs), have been proposed as an alternative method for valuing informal care.  [18] [19] 9] [20]  Typically, respondents are asked to choose among different hypothetical scenarios described in terms of distinct attributes of the commodity under valuation. By including a price or cost attribute, it is possible to derive the willingness to pay (WTP) (or accept) for changes in the levels of these attributes. It has been argued that DCEs are superior to the opportunity cost and proxy good methods, given that DCEs elicit people's preferences for different informal caregiving situations and, hence, are able to capture the heterogeneity of informal care. DCEs are also preferred over contingent valuation (based on WTP/ willingness to accept [WTA]), given that respondents are not directly asked to express an amount of money for a certain scenario; more information about the respondent's preference is collected; the focus of the task is less on money; and the heterogeneity of a commodity is captured better.  20 Previous studies that valued informal care time tended to include care tasks (eg, personal care or household tasks) in the choice tasks describing different components of informal care, but not the effects on informal carers' health or QOL.  [18] [19] 9] [20] [21]  However, using such estimates within the context of economic evaluation poses a risk of double counting, where the valuation would, in theory, include all impacts of providing informal care on the carer, including health and QOL impacts. This means that QOL impacts would be captured on both the cost side and the effect side of an economic evaluation.\n\nA previous study proposed a novel approach for valuing informal care time, which accounts for QOL impacts rather than care tasks, thereby estimating the \"pure time cost\" of informal care.  22 However, that study valued informal care in general (ie, not specific to a certain disease or condition) and reflected the monetary value of informal care time from the perspective of the Dutch general population.  22 It remains unclear whether informal care time is valued differently for people living with dementia and whether the derived monetary values differ between the general public and informal carers. Therefore, this study aimed to determine the value of informal care provided explicitly to people living with dementia, reflecting the preferences of both the general public and informal carers of people living with dementia."

      "title": "Identification and Development of DCE Attributes and Levels",
      "text": "A literature review of qualitative studies was undertaken exploring carers' positive and negative experiences.  23 Based on 59 articles, 5 main themes were identified: coping (emotional coping and problem coping), relationship with the person with dementia (sense of loss and change in relationship), interference with life (control over caregiving situation, and freedom and independence), support (formal support and informal support), and health (physical health, emotional and mental health, and social health). In addition, qualitative interviews were conducted with 16 carers of people with dementia that were structured in 2 parts. In part 1, informal carers were first instructed to reflect on their personal experience of providing informal care to check whether any new themes arise that were not identified in the literature review. Findings from the first part of the interview have been published separately,  24  which broadly confirmed the themes identified from the literature review. In the second part of the interview, participants were presented with statements pertaining to the themes identified in the literature review and asked to discuss their understanding of the wording and their preferred statements. Thereby, the study team developed for each theme a list of 10 statements that described the respective theme based on language derived from the literature review but differed in wording (eg, \"I feel emotionally drained\" or \"I have problems with my mental health\"). At the same time, participants were also presented with a sheet that outlined various response categories: (1) frequency scales, (2) severity scales, (3) level of problems, and (4) level of difficulties on a 3-point or 5-point Likert scale. Participants were asked which response category would fit best with their preferred statements of the themes. Finally, 2 advisory group meetings were held with 5 carers, 1 carer support worker (Carers Victoria), 1 policy advisor (Carers Victoria), and 5 academics/team members. The aim of the advisory group meetings was to reach consensus on the final attributes and attribute levels to be included in the DCE.\n\nThe final list of DCE attributes is presented in Table  1 . These describe 4 positive and negative carers' experiences using a 3point frequency Likert scale, which was preferred most by study participants and the advisory group. In addition, 2 attributes were added that described \"hours of care provided\" and \"monetary compensation from the government.\" The hours attribute was specified as the number of hours of caregiving provided per week with 6 levels (5, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50) based on estimates reported by informal carers of people with dementia.  25 The money attribute was described as the weekly compensation from the government for providing informal care, which also included 6 levels in Australian dollars ($0, $100, $350, $500, $750, $1000). These levels were reflective of existing government support payments for carers (ie, carer allowance, carer payment, carer supplement), the national weekly minimum wage, and the weekly wage rate of a personal care worker in Australia."

      "title": "Experimental Design",
      "text": "A D-efficient fractional factorial design, which minimizes the standard errors of the predicted parameter estimates, was developed using the software Ngene v1.3.0 (ChoiceMetrics, Sydney, Australia).  26 The survey design had 90 rows (ie, choice tasks) blocked into 9 blocks, with respondents randomly assigned a block with 10 choice tasks. Attribute level balance was maintained within each block. The utility function of the design included the 6 attributes and an interaction term between \"hours of care\" and \"monetary compensation,\" given that it was assumed that preferences for these attributes vary with the levels of the other attribute. The 4 attributes describing the positive and negative experiences were dummy coded, whereas the hours of care and monetary compensation attributes were assumed to be continuous. The Ngene syntax is presented in Appendix File 1 in Supplemental Materials found at  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2  024.05.021 . No priors were used to inform the design due to the absence of information from previous studies. Respondents were forced to choose one of the 2 alternatives presented (ie, no opt-out option), given that this study explored preferences for different caregiving situations and therefore no opt-out was relevant. The DCE survey started with 2 warm-up DCE choice tasks, one including only the 4 positive and negative experiences attributes, with a second one including the \"hours of care\" and \"monetary compensation\" attributes. Both warm-up DCE choice tasks were excluded from the analysis. To check for internal consistency, one dominant choice set was included in each block after the 2 practice DCE choice tasks and before the 10 designed tasks, which was also excluded from the modeling. The DCE choice tasks were piloted for completion time, language, and understanding among a convenience sample of university staff and the advisory group. Before the full launch of the DCE survey, pilot data from 110 respondents were obtained to assess whether coefficients were ordered logically, evaluate debriefing questions, and analyze qualitative comments from respondents regarding their understanding of the DCE task."

Two identical surveys were created to facilitate 2 different recruitment avenues via separate links. First, members of the adult general population were recruited via Pureprofile using quota sampling by sex and age to achieve a representation of the general population in Australia. Pureprofile also specifically recruited carers of people living with dementia. Second, the research team recruited informal carers of people living with dementia via social media postings (ie, Twitter and Facebook) and advertisements on websites and newsletters, where possible, by Dementia Australia, Carers Victoria, New South Wales, Queensland, Umbrella Dementia Caf\u00e9s, and Step Up for Dementia. All participants provided implied consent by completing the online survey. Informal carers who provided an email address received a $10 gift voucher as an acknowledgment for their contribution. Pureprofile panel members were reimbursed based on their specific panel agreements.\n\nThe study received ethics approval by the Deakin University Human Research Ethics Committee (2019-067)."

      "text": "The survey questionnaire (provided in Appendix File 2 in Supplemental Materials found at  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2  024.05.021 ) was designed in such a way that it could be completed by both samples. The survey flow is illustrated in Figure  1 . At the start of the survey, participants were provided with the definition of informal care, what it involves (care tasks), who is considered an informal carer, and some information about the duration of caring and the possible carer payments from the government. Participants further received information about dementia and the symptoms usually observed for mild, moderate, and severe dementia. Those who identified themselves as a carer for a person with dementia were asked additional questions about their caring situation, including duration and frequency of care, carer payments, relationship to the person, and their perception about the severity of dementia (mild, moderate, severe).\n\nTo familiarize respondents with the DCE attributes and levels, carers of people with dementia were asked to rate their own current experiences of caregiving in 4 questions that described the 4 positive and negative experience attributes using the corresponding 3 levels. The general public was asked to indicate the extent to which they felt each statement was likely to be reflective of the situation of informal carers of people living with dementia. After the 2 practice DCE choice tasks and the dominant choice task, participants then completed the first 5 choice tasks. To reduce respondents' fatigue and increase engagement with the survey, participants then completed a set of demographic questions followed by the final set of 5 choice tasks. When introducing participants to the DCE choice tasks, participants were informed that the caregiving situations were hypothetical and, irrespective of their own situation, they should imagine the described caregiving situation. They were also informed that the hypothetical informal care situations represent possible scenarios of informal care provided to people living with dementia of different stages (mild, moderate, or severe) and that they should keep the same person with dementia in mind when completing the choice tasks. Participants could obtain further information about each attribute by placing their cursor on the attribute, which then provided examples as outlined in Table  1 . The order of attributes was not randomized and all respondents were presented with alternatives that included \"hours of care\" at the top and \"monetary compensation\" at the bottom, with the attributes describing positive and negative impacts appearing in between, which aligned with the presentation of a previous similar study.  22 An example of a choice task is presented in Figure  2 . At the end of the survey, participants were asked some debriefing questions; ranked the 6 attributes based on their importance; indicated which attributes they perceived as less important, about the same, or more important as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic; and answered some questions about their health and wellbeing, including the EQ-5D-5L.  27"

      "title": "Data Analysis",
      "text": "The analysis of the DCE data was based on the random utility theory.  28 First, we estimated a conditional logit model on the 2 subgroups separately (ie, informal carers and general public). This model assumes homogenous preferences and homoskedasticity within each subgroup. The Swait-Louviere test was applied to test whether the 2 subgroups could be pooled based on testing the statistical significance of differences in preferences or in scale in the estimates generated from the 2 subgroups.  29 Given that the results from the Swait-Louviere test indicated that the 2 samples cannot be pooled based on preference heterogeneity, all models were estimated for the 2 subgroups separately. In addition, given that informal carers were recruited from 2 different sources, we undertook further subgroup analyses on these 2 carer groups separately. The models included an alternative-specific constant indicating the left-right position of the alternative in the choice set, a variable describing the block randomization, the 4 dummycoded attributes describing positive and negative impacts, and the \"hours of care\" and \"monetary compensation\" attributes, which were assumed to be continuous.\n\nGiven the limitations of the conditional logit model (ie, assumption of independence of irrelevant alternatives, failure to incorporate preference heterogeneity in the utility parameters, and failure to account for the panel nature of the data), we also conducted a mixed logit model, which takes preference heterogeneity into account, both in the preference space and the WTP space. For the mixed logit in the preference space, all coefficients were specified as random following a normal distribution, except for the \"monetary compensation\" attribute that was assumed to be fixed. The marginal rate of substitution was used to generate WTA estimates after estimation for the conditional logit and preference space mixed logit, where the WTA for 1 additional hour of informal care is expressed as a ratio of the \"hour of care\" attribute coefficient to the \"monetary compensation\" attribute coefficient. Therefore, the WTA expresses the minimum monetary value that would be required to compensate for a change in the level of a certain attribute. Although it is common to specify the monetary coefficient to be fixed in the preference space mixed logit model to avoid problems dividing distributions on DCE indicates discrete choice experiment; WTA, willingness to accept.\n\ndistributions that can lead to heavily skewed WTA distributions, it is unreasonable to assume that all individuals have the same preference for the monetary compensation.  30 To overcome this problem, we also estimated the mixed logit model in WTP space, which was our preferred model. This model directly estimates the ratio of the non-cost to cost coefficients, generating direct WTP estimates (or WTA estimates in our study) and allowing for unobserved preference heterogeneity.  31 All coefficients in the mixed logit model in WTP space were assumed to be random, following a normal distribution for the noncost coefficients and a lognormal distribution for the cost coefficient. The simulation for all mixed logit models was based on 1000 Halton draws. All analyses were conducted in Stata version 17 (StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX) using the clogit, mixlogit, and mixlogitwtp commands.  32, 33"

      "text": "In total, 973 participants completed the online survey, of whom 273 were excluded because they failed the dominance test (n = 187), completed the survey in ,5 minutes (n = 20), or were identified as suspicious or fraudulent based on inconsistent responses regarding their location of residence and free-text entries unrelated to the survey (n = 66). The final sample comprised 700 respondents of whom 212 were identified as informal carers of people with dementia and 488 members of the general public. A comparison of participants included and excluded from the analyses is presented in Appendix File 3 in Supplemental Materials found at  https://doi.  org/10.1016/j.jval.2024.05.021 , showing that the excluded participants were statistically significantly younger and more engaged in full-time or part-time employment. The characteristics of the sample included are presented in Table  2 , highlighting similarities between the general population and informal carers samples in terms of age, education, being born in Australia, employment, and income. The informal carer sample comprised more female respondents than the general public and a greater proportion of respondents who reported to be married. Appendix File 4 in Supplemental Materials found at  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2  024.05.021  further shows a comparison between our 2 samples to the Australian general population 34 and informal carers (primary and nonprimary carers),  35  indicating similarities in terms of gender and age, with the only differences noted in terms of education and employment (our sample had higher levels of education but fewer engaged in formal employment). Additional informal care characteristics of those providing informal care to a person with dementia are presented in Table  3 . Most informal carers had provided care for .2 years (44%) and ,10 hours per week (30%) and did not receive any income support for their caring role (64%). Although 37% provided informal carer for their parent, 22% cared for their partner. The dementia severity was rated as mild by 46%, moderate by 42%, and severe by 13% of informal carers.\n\nThe median completion time was 16 minutes (interquartile range 11-26). Participants' responses to the 4 questions that described the 4 positive and negative experience attributes using the corresponding 3 levels are presented in Appendix File 5 in Supplemental Materials found at  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2  024.05.021 . Results show similar proportions of responses reflecting informal carers' personal experiences and what the general public felt informal carers generally experience in their caregiving situation. The exception was the attribute \"difficulties getting support,\" where the general public had a more pessimistic view in terms of getting support than the informal carers experienced. Generally, the informal carer sample reported slightly more difficulties (23% selected \"quite a bit\" or \"very much\") in completing the choice tasks than the general public (15%) although the difference was not significant. Both samples found it particularly difficult to consider all aspects when choosing between the informal caregiving situations (see Appendix File 6 in Supplemental Materials found at  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2  024.05.021  for responses to the debriefing questions).\n\nResults from the mixed logit models in the WTP space are presented in Table  4 , where the coefficients can be interpreted directly as marginal WTA estimates. Given that our primary focus was to estimate the WTA for an additional hour of informal care, this information can be directly obtained from the coefficient associated with the \"hours of care\" attribute. This coefficient represents the average WTA for an additional hour of informal care, accounting for both positive and negative effects associated with informal care, which was $20.57 per hour (95% CI 18.33-22.82) for the general public and $20.39 per hour (95% CI 15.72-25.07) for the informal carers sample. The results further indicate that, across both samples, the highest monetary compensation was needed to compensate for relational problems with the care recipient, followed by attributes relating to emotional and physical health. The compensation required was lowest for worse social and practical support and missing out on enjoyable activities, but these were only statistically significantly different from the base level for the most severe attribute levels in the general public sample. The significant alternative-specific constant further indicates a potential left-to-right bias (ie, respondents were more likely to select the first [left] alternative they read when answering the choice sets).\n\nWhen comparing the WTA estimates from the mixed logit WTP space with estimates generated using the other models, results were consistent in terms of the attribute levels that required the greatest monetary compensation (see Appendix File 7 in Supplemental Materials found at  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2024.  05.021 ). However, the mean WTA for an additional hour of informal care was slightly higher for the general public sample when using the simple multinomial logit (MNL) model (mean 22.91; 95% CI 20.16-25.66) and the mixed logit preference space (mean 22.92; 95% CI 20.23-25.66) but lower for the informal carer sample based on the MNL model (mean 19.97; 95% CI 14.95-24.98) and the mixed logit preference space (mean 20.05; 95% CI 15.08-25.02).\n\nResults from the subgroup analysis, where the informal carer sample was explored by method of recruitment (ie, Pureprofile, n = 115, vs carers organizations, n = 97), are presented in the Appendix File 8 in Supplemental Materials found at  https://doi.org/10.1016/j.  jval.2024.05.021 . The mean WTA for an additional hour of informal care was slightly higher for the carer sample recruited via Pureprofile (mean 21.37; 95% CI 16.70-26.03) than carers recruited via carers organizations (mean 19.28; 95% CI 11.47-27.08)."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "This study aimed to estimate the monetary value of informal care time provided to people living with dementia in Australia, accounting for the positive and negative impacts of informal care to derive a \"pure time cost\" of informal care. Although preferences for QOL attributes differed between the general public and informal carers, the value of an hour of informal care was very similar between the 2 groups, estimated at $21. This estimate can facilitate the inclusion of informal care time cost at the cost side of an economic evaluation without the risk of double-counting spillover effects.\n\nOur estimate of $21 is broadly reflective of the minimum hourly wage in Australia ($20.33 in 2021) but lower than the average hourly wage ($34.34 in 2021) and the hourly wage of a personal care assistant in Australia ($29.10 in 2021).  36 Previous studies that aimed to value informal care time in dementia using other valuation techniques estimated unit costs of $28.01 (US$18.37) using the replacement cost method, $23.36.97 (US$15.32) using the opportunity cost method, and $21.36 (US$14.10) derived from direct contingent valuation technique.  16 Our estimate of $21 is similar to estimates derived from the contingent valuation method but slightly lower than the opportunity cost and replacement cost methods. This is likely because both the contingent valuation and DCEs are stated preference-based methods, which, unlike revealed preference methods, rely on individuals' self-reported responses to hypothetical situations.\n\nCompared with previous studies that aimed to value informal care using DCE in other clinical settings, our results are similar to the estimate reported by Arora et al  18 (2019)  showing that a representative sample of 198 carers accepted a minimum of $20.61 to provide 1 hour of informal care to children with intellectual disability in Australia. By contrast, our estimate is smaller than de Jong et al,  21  estimate where members of the general public in Germany were willing to accept V14.54 ($26.86) for 1 hour of informal care provided to older adults. It is important to note that these 2 previous DCEs did not include attributes describing the positive and negative experiences of informal carers but rather care tasks or informal care situations in general. The closest DCE that reflects our methodology is the Dutch DCE by Hoefman et al,  22  which estimated a WTA of V14.57 ($26.29). The lower estimate reported in our study could be due to differences in the samples (our study included members of the general public and informal carers), the decision context (our study explicitly focused on informal care provided to people with dementia), and differences in the modeling techniques applied (we used the mixed logit model in WTP space rather than preference space).\n\nAlthough similar WTA estimates were found in our study between the general public and informal carers in our main analysis using the mixed logit model in WTP space, when using the MNL model or the mixed logit model in preference space, we found that the estimates were slightly higher for the general public sample than the informal carer sample. Furthermore, results from our subgroup analysis, where the carers sample was explored by method of recruitment, showed that, compared with carers recruited via carers organizations, the WTA estimate was higher for carers recruited via Pureprofile, with an estimated hourly WTA rate of $21.36, which is similar to the estimate of the general public ($20.57). Although the exact reasons for the lower WTA estimate observed among informal carers recruited via carers organization are unclear, results should be interpreted carefully due to the relatively low sample (n = 95) and wide CI (11.47-27.08)."

Second, we did not randomize the levels of the warm-up choice tasks, which could have introduced starting point bias, with respondents anchoring on the first attribute values they have seen.  37 We also did not randomize the order of the attributes to align the presentation of our DCE with a previous similar study.  22 Although a previous study suggests that the order does not affect results significantly,  38  others have found significant attribute ordering effect  39  and it is, therefore, unknown to what extent this may have influenced our results. Although the alternative-specific constant was significant in our study, indicating a potential left-to-right bias, it is important to note that the constant is also capturing the variation in choices that is not explained by the attributes, which could also include other factors besides the left-to-right bias. Reflecting on the debriefing questions, approximately 37% of our sample found it difficult to consider all aspects when choosing between situations A and B, which could indicate potential attribute nonattendance, which would violate the assumption of fully compensatory decision making.  40 Unfortunately, our survey did not explicitly ask for attribute nonattendance and the reasons for why our sample found it difficult to consider all aspects are unclear. It could be due to the number of attributes or the difficulty of trading off attributes that describe QOL impacts on carers, which is not uncommon in the QOL literature, where a previous study showed that 60% of respondents ignored certain domains of QOL because they regarded only selective domains of QOL as important.  41 Furthermore, a relatively high proportion of respondents had to be excluded from the analysis. Although the random utility theory underpinning DCEs is able to cope with \"irrational\" responses,  42  respondents in our study were excluded for data quality reasons. Interestingly, more of the excluded respondents (58%) were recruited via Pureprofile, highlighting the continuous challenge between obtaining timely and sufficient samples via market research companies and the quality of the data. Generally, there remains a challenge in securing online surveys that are prone to bots or fraud, especially when advertised via social media.\n\nAnother limitation is that we adopted a forced-choice design where respondents had to choose between the 2 alternatives despite the fact that respondents may have preferred to opt out and not provide informal care at all. This means that our study did not value the provision of informal care per se, but rather estimated the monetary WTA to do 1 more hour of caregiving. We were also unable to explore whether WTA estimates differ across informal care tasks, with a previous study showing that estimates differ for personal care, supervision, and household tasks.  19 Of note, we did not explore preference heterogeneity by personal characteristics. Future studies could examine whether WTA estimates differ among carers depending on their relationship to the care recipient, the duration of informal care, whether they are sole carers, and their personal circumstances such as employment status and multiple caring responsibilities. It would be also interesting to explore to what extent respondents think that the payment they preferred should be implemented by the government. A recent study conducted in Ireland suggests that members of the general public show empathy and understanding toward family carers of people with dementia through their willingness to contribute to funding additional services and supports, especially in making 2 days of day care available to family carers.  43 A similar study is warranted for the Australian context."

      "text": "This study estimated the monetary value of informal care time provided to people with dementia, showing that members of the general public and informal carers in Australia were willing to accept a minimum of $21 to provide 1 hour of informal care to a person with dementia. This estimate can be used to inform future cost-of-illness and economic evaluation studies."
