  "title": "Experiences of hospitalization for suicide ideation and suicide attempt in gender diverse adults",
  "abstract": "Introduction: This study sought to investigate general perceptions of suiciderelated hospital-based care that Transgender/Gender Diverse (TGD) adults have experienced as well as correlates of their perceived usefulness of this care. Methods: Data were collected via a cross-sectional online survey of N = 3718 self-identified TGD individuals. Single-item self-report measures of all constructs of interest were used. Results: A total of n = 1056 participants indicated hospitalization for either a past suicide attempt (SA) or suicidal ideation (SI). Irrespective of being hospitalized for SI or SA, perceived usefulness of hospital-based care was low with 50% or more of participants rating their care as some degree of unhelpful. Older age, general trust in mental healthcare providers, and voluntary admission were related to higher perceived helpfulness of care for both SI and SA admissions. Higher pride in TGD identity was positively related to perceived helpfulness of care but only for admissions related to SAs. \n Conclusion: Improving perceived usefulness of hospital-based care may be important for improving subsequent suicide-related help-seeking. Increasing training and provision of care that improves trust with mental healthcare providers and potentially reduces need for involuntary admission may help improve hospital-based, suicide-related care in TGD adults.",

      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "High rates of suicidal ideation (SI) and suicide attempt (SA) are reported among Transgender/Gender Diverse (TGD) individuals in the United States (U.S.). Approximately, 45%-54% of TGD adults report lifetime SI  (Grossman & D'augelli, 2007; Nuttbrock et al., 2010)  and 28%-41% report one or more lifetime SAs  (Haas et al., 2014; Nuttbrock et al., 2010) . This is in comparison with the lifetime prevalence of SI and SA in the general population (9.2% and 2.7%, respectively  (Nock et al., 2008) . As many people experiencing suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs) seek hospitalization or are involuntarily hospitalized, understanding patient experiences with care is important. Research in predominantly cisgender samples indicates varying levels of satisfaction or perceived helpfulness of this care  (Ward-Ciesielski & Rizvi, 2021) , but research has yet to examine these experiences in TGD adults.\n\nIn understanding perceptions of hospital-based care for STBs, the consideration of certain demographic characteristics is needed. Older adults in the general population tend to have more positive experiences with general hospital-based care than younger adults  (Crow et al., 2002; Danielsen et al., 2007) . Similarly, cisgender women  (Teunissen et al., 2016)  and people of color (POC;  Mead & Roland, 2009)  are generally less satisfied with their care than cisgender men and White individuals, respectively. Given these findings, the intersection of gender identity and other demographic factors may relate to perceptions of hospitalization experiences for STBs in TGD adults; however, these hypotheses remain untested.\n\nIn addition to demographic factors noted above, care experiences must be considered. As noted by previous research (e.g.,  Priebe et al., 2011) , one such factor is voluntary vs. involuntary admission for STBs. Two meta-analyses, one including a sample comprised of mostly involuntarily admitted patients, found that a significant number of individuals believed their admission was neither justified nor beneficial and that they were generally dissatisfied with their treatment  (Kallert et al., 2008; Katsakou & Priebe, 2006) . This is concerning as research demonstrates that negative experiences with hospital-based STB care are related to lower perceived likelihood of future help-seeking for STBs in young adults  (Jones et al., 2021) . TGD adults have demonstrated fairly high avoidance of health care broadly, in part due to poor previous healthcare experiences  (James et al., 2016) . It may be that, like in cisgender adults, involuntary hospitalization is related to lower positive experience with this care which could result in less suicide-related help-seeking in the future.\n\nMinority stress theory  (Meyer, 2003)  provides a framework for understanding how previous negative experiences with healthcare systems experienced by TGD individuals may relate to perceptions of STB hospitalbased care. This theory states that distal stressors (i.e., objective stigmatizing events), such as being misgendered or harassed, are related to poorer mental health outcomes in part as a result of proximal stressors (i.e., the internalization of these experiences) such as fear of one's gender identity being discovered. Thus, negative objective experiences with previous healthcare systems and providers may result in negative perceptions of hospital-based care for STBs.\n\nBroadly, those who perceive their psychiatric providers as trustworthy also perceive them to deliver better care  (R\u00f8rtveit et al., 2015) , and individuals in inpatient psychiatric care that do not trust endorse feeling as though they were \"wasting their time\" in treatment  (Molin et al., 2016) . Within the TGD community, research supports that individuals view providers who were educated about TGD issues as more trustworthy  (McCullough et al., 2017) . It may be that distal minority stressors experienced in health care, such as needing to educate providers, relate to negative experiences with STB-related care through feelings of reduced trustworthiness of providers and institutions. For example, as mentioned above, avoidance of health care is not uncommon among TGD individuals, as in a survey of over 20,000 TGD adults, 23% of participants reported general avoidance of health care due to fear of being mistreated based on their gender identity  (James et al., 2016) . In line with minority stress theory, this avoidance may be a result of the internalization of previous experiences, creating a fear of one's gender identity being revealed as well as potential subsequent negative consequences.\n\nOn the other hand, minority stress theory also posits specific factors may reduce the impact of negative healthcare experiences. Pride in TGD identity relates to lower rates of mental health concerns (e.g., depression, anxiety) and may offset the impact of minority stressors experienced  (Meyer, 2003; Testa et al., 2017) . Pride in one's TGD identity may render negative healthcare experiences related to one's gender as less detrimental to perceptions of care and should be considered when studying how TGD individuals hospitalized for STBs experienced their care."

      "text": "The current study has two main aims, (1) to understand general perceived helpfulness of hospital-based care for STBs in TGD adults and (2) to explore correlates of these perceptions. As demographics, previous healthcare experiences, and gender-related minority stressors either relate to perceived satisfaction of healthcare experiences or theoretically relate to how a TGD individual may perceive their care, correlates in these three categories were explored. Given research in the general population  (Crow et al., 2002; Danielsen et al., 2007; Mead & Roland, 2009; Teunissen et al., 2016) , it was hypothesized that those younger in age, those assigned female at birth, and POC would perceive their hospitalization experience to be less helpful than their counterparts. Due to lack of prior research, no hypotheses were made based on gender identity, binary status, sexual orientation, or veteran status. Conversely, it was hypothesized that pride in one's TGD identity and trust in providers would be positively related to perceived helpfulness of hospitalization experiences  (Meyer, 2003; Testa et al., 2017) . Finally, having to educate providers about TGD issues  (Molin et al., 2016; R\u00f8rtveit et al., 2015)  and involuntary hospitalization  (Kallert et al., 2008; Katsakou & Priebe, 2006)  was hypothesized to be related to the perception of less helpful hospitalization experiences. Due to a lack of research, no hypotheses were made for historical avoidance of mental health care or coming out to a provider due to fear of discrimination or mistreatment."

Participants were recruited through listservs, PRIDE events, and social media groups related to TGD adults. Eligibility included being 18 years of age or older, self-identifying as TGD, and living in the United States.\n\nThe final analyzed sample consisted of N = 3718 participants. The majority of the sample self-identified as assigned female sex at birth (n = 2025, 54.6%), White (n = 2898, 77.9%), sexually diverse (n = 3437, 92.8%), and viewed their gender as outside the gender binary (n = 2207, 59.7%).

      "text": "Data from individuals who discontinued the study prematurely were excluded. Data from active military individuals were removed to protect anonymity due to ever-evolving changes to military service rights. Data from those missing hospitalization experience data were excluded via listwise deletion. If respondents indicated hospitalization for both SI and SA, only their SA data were analyzed to eliminate possible conflation of these experiences. For example, someone hospitalized for a SA would also be hospitalized for SI in that same hospital experience and thus reference this event when answering questions about both hospitalizations. Ratings of hospitalization experience were transformed to have three categories: unhelpful category (ratings between \"somewhat unhelpful\" to \"very unhelpful\"), a neutral category (ratings of \"neutral\"), and a general helpful category (ratings between \"somewhat helpful to very helpful\"). This decision was made as very few respondents reported very helpful experiences for SI and for SA.\n\nTo determine correlates of hospitalization experiences for SI and SA, ordinal logistic regressions were run for each of the potential correlates. Model fit was represented by \u03c7 2 and associated p-value. Both Cox & Snell R 2 and Nagelkerke R 2 values were presented as some scholars argue that the former statistic is a too conservative estimate of predicted variance while the latter is too liberal  (Smith & McKenna, 2013) . To determine the influence of the different levels of the independent variables and the outcome of hospitalization helpfulness, Exp(B), and the 95% confidence interval (CI) were reported. Finally, two ordinal logistic regression models were run to further investigate correlates of perceived helpfulness of hospitalization when all significant univariate correlates were entered in the same model to determine relative importance. One model was conducted with SI hospitalization experience as the outcome and the other used SA hospitalization experience as the outcome."

      "text": "The current study is the first to investigate the perceived helpfulness of STB-related hospitalization experiences in TGD adults. Over 50% of respondents reported that their hospitalization was \"very unhelpful\" to \"somewhat unhelpful\" for both SI and SA. These figures correspond to a growing body of research in adults that demonstrates a significant amount of dissatisfaction with STB-related hospital-based care  (Kallert et al., 2008; Katsakou & Priebe, 2006) . Dissatisfaction with this care is concerning as it may relate to less formal help-seeking for STBs in the future  (Jones et al., 2021)  and broader healthcare avoidance, an already common experience for TGD adults  (James et al., 2016) .\n\nAlthough correlates of perceived helpfulness of care were seen in the current study, few were related to participant demographics. For both SI and SA univariate models, age was the only significant demographic correlate, with more positive experiences being related to older age as hypothesized  (Danielsen et al., 2007) . Other demographic factors seem to have only a minor contribution to a TGD individual's experience of hospitalization for both SI and SA, suggesting that historical healthcare experiences and gender-related minority stress factors may be more salient in understanding perceptions of care.

It appears that ensuring involuntary hospitalization is absolutely necessary is one way both trust in mental healthcare providers and satisfaction with STB-related hospital-based care could be increased. This speaks to the need for providers to be trained in and have the resources to provide brief interventions that increase outpatient safety  (Nuij et al., 2021) .\n\nResults regarding the relation between participant pride in TGD identity and perceptions of STB-related hospitalbased care were mixed: higher pride in TGD identity was related to increased satisfaction of care in both the univariate and multivariate analyses related to SA admission but not in either set of analyses for SI care. One explanation is that evidence supports a distinction between individuals who think about suicide and those who attempt suicide. For example, PTSD and other anxiety disorders are more common in those with a SA history compared to those with a history of SI but no suicidal behavior  (May & Klonsky, 2016) . As this data did not control for the diagnoses of the two groups, whether this discrepancy is an artifact of any unconsidered confounding variable these differences may produce cannot be ascertained. Additionally, these data assume TGD pride was at a similar level during the hospitalization experience and at the time the survey was taken which likely is a faulty assumption as TGD identity\n\nT A B L E 5 Multivariate ordinal regression predicting SI hospitalization helpfulness ratings Level Estimate SE Wald df p Exp(B) 95% CI Age 0.007 0.011 0.379 1 .538 1.007 0.985, 1.029 Trust in providers 0.533 1.57 11.615 1 .001 1.705 1.254, 2.317 Avoid institutions Yes -0.543 0.334 2.638 1 .104 .581 0.302, 1.119 No 0 a Voluntary status Mostly voluntary 1.552 0.407 14.528 1 .000 4.720 2.125, 10.483 Voluntary, but coerced 0.403 1 1.496 Mostly involuntary 0 a 0.459 0.776 .378 0.610, 3.670 a This parameter is set to zero because it is redundant.

T A B L E 6 Multivariate ordinal regression predicting SA hospitalization helpfulness ratings\n\nis not a stable or linear process  (Bockting, 2014) . Minority stress theory  (Meyer, 2003)  posits that pride in TGD identity may offset the impact distal minority stressors, such as poor healthcare experiences due to gender identity, have on mental health outcomes. The current study cannot directly test this hypothesis, but pride's relation with SA hospitalization care points to the importance of continuing this line of inquiry. This future work would benefit from directly testing gender-related minority stressors experienced during hospital-based care, a pursuit that would benefit from considering existing, validated measures of gender-related minority stress  (Testa et al., 2015) ."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "The current study has sample limitations that should be considered. This study only investigated hospital-based STB care in adults and thus results may not generalize to youth. Although the sample was relatively racially diverse, racial groups needed to be condensed to POC and White categories to investigate differences in helpfulness of care, precluding a nuanced investigation of racial and ethnic identity in terms of hospitalization experiences.\n\nAdditionally, this study cannot ascertain if perceived helpfulness of hospital-based care for STBs meaningfully differs between cisgender and gender diverse adults as a cisgender control group was not recruited. Methodological limitations should also be considered. Most notably, the majority of healthcare experience and minority stress correlates investigated in the current study were not specific to STB admission. Constructs such as trust in mental healthcare providers, need to educate providers about TGD-related issues, and avoidance of mental healthcare institutions was measured broadly and not specific to STB-based care or a previous STB-related admission. Future research would benefit from considering the use of existing qualitative measures of STB-related hospital-based care to not only determine specific experiences related to perceptions of care but potentially the ramifications (both positive and negative) of these experiences  (Jones et al., 2021) . How STB-related hospitalization was measured was not ideal either. Information about individuals who have historically experienced SI/SA without hospitalization is missing as no question linking the existence of SI/SA and subsequent hospitalization was available in the data set. Additionally, a single, dichotomous, measure was used to assess lifetime hospitalization for SI and SA. This prevents knowledge about where the hospitalization occurred or for how long (e.g., a four-hour assessment and discharge in an emergency room, a two weeks of care on a medical floor following a SA). Although voluntary vs. involuntary status was assessed, it is unknown whether hospitalization was based on medical necessity (e.g., a near-lethal SA) or was the result of help-seeking following STBs. Future research would benefit by connecting these data to medical records to depict characteristics of hospitalization that could influence perceived effectiveness (e.g., number of group/individual therapy sessions, medications prescribed). Further, the single item response for helpfulness precluded assessment of what was inherently helpful or not helpful about the hospitalization or whether this care reduced eventual STBs.\n\nFinally, although the results were significant, the multivariate models explained less than 25% of the variance in perceived hospitalization experience. This suggests that there are many more factors that were not assessed in the study that relate to hospitalization experience. Treatment modalities received certainly would likely be related to satisfaction and perceived helpfulness of care which should be assessed in the future investigations. Additionally, the study lacks data on characteristics of the providers during the hospitalization, for example was the treatment team affirming of the patient's gender identity. As one survey of TGD individuals demonstrated that 90% of respondents reported that they believed that there are not enough medical providers who are properly trained to care for them  (Lambda Legal, 2010)  future research should assess the relationship between providers' attitudes toward the TGD population and how helpful TGD individuals viewed their hospitalization experience."

      "title": "CONCLUSION",
      "text": "The current study demonstrates that the majority of TGD adults who have received hospital-based care for STBs found their care to be generally unhelpful. These perceptions of care were generally related to younger age, involuntary vs. voluntary admission, and general perceived trustworthiness of mental healthcare providers. This research supports a continuing body of research indicating the need for increased focus on improving the quality of care provided to SA survivors and folks admitted for suicidal thinking  (Ward-Ciesielski & Rizvi, 2021) . Efforts in this area broadly will likely benefit the experience of TGD adults, but the provision of trans-affirmative services specifically may increase perceived provider trustworthiness  (McCullough et al., 2017) . Educational resources to improve systematic hospital-based care for STBs exist and should be considered by healthcare systems  (Brodsky et al., 2018; Turner et al., 2021)  as well as training programs that individual providers can take to improve quality of trans-affirmative care such as VHA's Specialty Care Access Network-Extension of Community Healthcare Outcomes (SCAN-ECHO) program  (Shipherd et al., 2016) . Although involuntary care may be legally necessary at times, helping to maintain patient sense of autonomy, informed consent related to the treatment process, letting patients help choose their treatment modality, and providing meaningful rationale for the importance of treatment may reduce negative experiences  (Borecky et al., 2019; Britton et al., 2008) ."
