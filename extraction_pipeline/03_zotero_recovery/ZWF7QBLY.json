  "title": "Standardized evaluation of the quality and persuasiveness of mobile health applications for diabetes management",
  "abstract": "This study evaluates diabetes self-management mobile health applications available from European app stores with respect to quality, concordance with recommended self-management tasks and implementation of persuasive system design principles. The European Play Store and Apple App Store were systematically searched and relevant apps were tested. Two raters independently assessed app quality using the Mobile Application Rating Scale and conducted a content analysis of provided persuasive system design principles and self-management tasks. A total of 2,269 mobile health applications were identified and 120 could be included in the evaluation. The overall quality was rated as moderate M = 3.20 (SD = 0.39, min = 2.31, max = 4.62), with shortcomings in the subcategories of engagement (M = 2.80, SD = 0.67) and information quality (M = 2.26, SD = 0.48). Scientific evidence is available for 8% of the apps. The reviewed apps implemented a median of three persuasive system design principles (range 0-15) and targeted a median of 4.5 (range 1-8) self-management tasks, however, with a lack of information about psychosocial coping strategies. Most available diabetes self-management apps lack a scientific evidence base. Persuasive system design features are underrepresented and may form a promising tool to improve app quality. Furthermore, the interaction of physical and behavioral health should be improved in existing diabetes self-management mobile health applications. In Europe, about 60 million people are diagnosed with diabetes, and the prevalence and incidence rates are rising 1,2 . Diabetes care requires the performance of multiple essential self-management tasks by affected individuals. A best possible performance of diabetes self-management task, as recommended by the American Association of Diabetes Educators 3 , is decisive for the course of diabetes including lower risks of acute and long-term complications, significantly lower morbidity and mortality and higher mental well-being and quality of life 4 . Accordingly, diabetes self-management education and support are key elements for the successful self-management of the condition 5 . However, self-management education and support may be underutilized in diabetes care 3 , thus applications supporting people to better self-manage their diabetes may be useful. Mobile health applications (MHA) have been found to be a promising technological approach to help people perform better self-managements  3, [6] [7] [8] [9] [10]  . Studies support that MHA might have positive impacts on quality of life, diabetes outcomes and patient-provider communication  6, 11  . In addition, MHA offer a low-threshold, cost-effective and flexible support opportunity in the everyday lives of users 12 . Due to the often unregulated and rapidly growing nature of app stores, numerous commercial diabetes MHA are available. Since user ratings do not constitute a reliable or valid indicator of app quality 13 , it is important to systematically evaluate the quality of the available MHA in order to support health care providers, educators and users in their search for appropriate and secure apps  13, 14  . For this purpose, several studies have been conducted in recent years 13,15,16 .",

      "text": "Search strategy. The search was limited until December 2020, we searched the European Google Play Store and the Apple App Store using diabetes-related terms via a web-crawler of the Mobile Health App Database (MHAD) project  27  . This approach has been evaluated in several previous studies [e.g.  [28] [29] 9] [30]  ]. MHA were screened and downloaded if they (1) addressed people with diabetes or parents of children with diabetes; (2) contained educational or supporting information on diabetes self-management; (3) were available in English or German language. MHA were eligible for inclusion if they were accessible and enabled assessment. In the case of MHA which required further information for access (e.g., login data provided by physician), MHA developers were contacted and asked for access. Dead links were retrieved three times during a period of two weeks before final exclusion.\n\nQuality rating. Two independent raters assessed MHA quality using the German version of the Mobile App Rating Scale (MARS-G;  18, 31  ). All reviewers were graduates of clinical and health psychology supervised by a licensed psychotherapist with extensive psycho-somatic expertise. Before the reviewing process, reviewers underwent an online training for using the MARS. To capture interrater reliability between reviewers, initially five MHA were rated by all four reviewers, and the ratings were compared. Interrater reliability in both reviewer teams was excellent (Team 1: 2-way mixed ICC = 0.94, 95% CI 0.94 to 0.95; Team 2: 2-way mixed ICC = 0.88, 95% CI 0.81 to 0.92). Through the MARS, MHA quality can be evaluated using four subscales: 1) engagement (five items: fun, interest, individual adaptability, interactivity, target group); 2) functionality (four items: performance, usability, navigation, gestural design); 3) aesthetics (three items: layout, graphics, visual appeal); and 4) information quality (seven items: accuracy of app description, goals, quality of information, quantity of information, quality of visual information, credibility, evidence base). Each item can be rated on a 5-point scale. The MARS sum score is determined from the four subscales  18  .\n\nThe MARS sum score showed excellent psychometric properties (ICC [Intra Class Correlation] = 0.82, 95% CI: 0.81 to 0.82; internal consistency: \u03c9 = 0.93)  32  . The four subcategories demonstrated acceptable to excellent internal consistencies (\u03c9 = 0.79 to 0.90)  32  . In accordance with the MARS, three further categories were assessed: (5) therapeutic gain (four items: gain for patients, gain for therapists, risks and side effects, ease of implementation into routine healthcare); (6) subjective quality (four items: recommendation, frequency of use, willingness to pay, overall star rating); and (7) perceived impact (six items: awareness, knowledge, attitudes, intention to change, help seeking, behavioral change).\n\nUser rating. Ratings of user satisfaction with the MHA (from 1 to 5 \"stars\", higher score = higher satisfaction), which were available in the app stores, were extracted for comparison with the quality ratings according to the MARS."

Irrespective of whether relevant studies were referenced in the MHA app store descriptions, we searched the app developers' websites and Google Scholar to identify available studies for each MHA.\n\nPersuasive system design features. We assessed the included MHA for 24 of the 28 PSD features as recommended by Oinas-Kukkonen and Harjumaa  21  . The features are divided into four subcategories: (1) primary task support; (2) dialogue support; (3) social support; and (4) system credibility. We focused on design features provided through the technical system itself. Therefore, we excluded the principle of liking (subcategory dialogue support), surface credibility, expertise, trustworthiness of content (subcategory trustworthiness). Principles were defined according to Oinas-Kukkonen and Harjumaa  21  and Kelders et al.  19  . Examples for each principle are incorporated in Table  3 .\n\nConcordance with recommended self-management tasks. The American Association of Diabetes Educators recommends eight tasks as important for successful diabetes self-management and education 3 :\n\n(1) diabetes pathophysiology and treatment options; (2) healthy nutrition; (3) physical activity; (4) medication usage; (5) monitoring; (6) preventing, detecting and treating acute and chronic complications; (7) healthy coping with psychosocial issues and concerns; and (8) problem solving. We conducted a content analysis and systematically rated which of these tasks were addressed in each MHA's educational content. Educational content could be delivered as text, video/audio, games, or forums. We calculated the median number of self-management tasks addressed by each MHA's content."

      "text": "In this systematic evaluation of 120 commercially available diabetes self-management MHA, we observed an average overall quality (MARS rating) of the MHA (M = 3.20, SD = 0.39) with a median of three implemented PSD principles per MHA. Notably, implemented PSD principles predict MHA quality ratings and the potential of PSD is not exploited yet.\n\nPrevious studies on quality using MARS of US-American (M = 2.99, SD = 0.64)  17  and Chinese diabetes MHA (M = 3.42, SD = 0.66)  16  yielded similar results to our study. Notably, in this study the MARS sum score as well as the subscale functionality were correlated significantly with the user ratings. This is in contradiction to previous Table  1 . MARS ratings for the ten highest ranking apps per app store in descending order (MARS ratings for all 120 apps in Supplementary Table  S1 ). *MHA rated in both systems; numbers represent mean score. evaluations reporting that MARS ratings were not correlated with user ratings  [28] [29] [30] 39, 40  . Given that users commonly rely on user ratings when choosing a MHA for download  41  , it is an encouraging finding that there are correlations between user ratings and MARS quality ratings in the context of diabetes self-management MHA.\n\nIn line with previous studies, the reviewed MHA had higher scores in the functionality and aesthetics subcategories, but lower scores in the engagement and information quality domains  16, 17  . A potential solution to improve engagement is to implement PSD features. The concept of PSD was taken into account in the development of the MARS  18  and our results support that the PSD principles of dialogue support and social support, in particular, predict MHA quality ratings and may strengthen the perceived quality of the MHA.\n\nAccording to the present findings, the least commonly implemented PSD features are social support features. Peer support has been shown to be highly relevant for reducing diabetes distress, diabetes self-care and clinical outcomes, such as mortality  [42] [43] [44]  . Although online discussion forums are the most frequently implemented Table  3 . Number of apps incorporating a particular PSD principle. System credibility, dialogue support, primary task support and social support are the four categories of persuasive system design. Each category consists of seven principles."

      "text": "Real-world feel 98. social support feature in the MHA examined in the present study, this type of support is often associated with ethical concerns. For instance, there may be counterproductive exchanges between individuals or the anonymity of individuals may not be guaranteed  45  . Research on the effectiveness of alternative social support principles, which could avoid some of these issues, is still limited and new approaches of social support in MHA should be evaluated  46  . A further strategy could be to implement multimodal support. For example, the use of MHA could be complemented by telehealth support by peers or clinical staff members  47  . Notably, the highest rating MHA in this study allows interaction with clinical staff members, suggesting different possibilities of personal interaction.\n\nRegarding the PSD principle dialogue support, we found reminders and suggestions to be the most commonly used principles. Reminders, in particular, seem to be a key app component for supporting successful diabetes management  48  . An overarching aim of dialogue support features is enhancing the users' impression that the system is a real person. This can be maintained through the use of avatars which guide the user through the MHA  49  . Recent studies demonstrated that a virtual avatar providing diabetes treatment information could improve the users' diabetes self-management  50, 51  .\n\nPrinciples of system credibility features are widely implemented in the reviewed MHA by providing contact information of MHA developers. In this respect, other principles could be exploited to a greater extent. For instance, incorporating authority figures or offering opportunities for verification (e.g., literature links) could encourage users to perceive the information as more credible and could therefore increase their engagement  52  .\n\nFinally, in terms of primary task support principles, self-monitoring was found to be most commonly addressed (e.g., apps requesting regular entries of measured glucose values). However, manual entries can be demanding for people with diabetes. Especially for people living with type 1 diabetes, the compactness and ease of use of glucose monitoring could be improved by implementation of an automated MHA-to-sensor connection. Yet, only 10% of evaluated MHA offered this option. Based on the technological possibilities, improvements should be made to facilitate glucose monitoring options  53  . Another crucial principle of primary task support is tailoring the content to people with diabetes' needs  54  . MHA content regulation by diabetes care providers could be an innovative and effective approach to this. For instance, some MHA can be directly used for physician-patient interaction and treatment adjustment wherein the treating physician can set and change the treated person's goals based on the monitored data (e.g., \"myDiabetes\"). Tailoring may also be particularly important with regard to age appropriateness (e.g., MHA appealing to younger people). With only three MHA targeting the needs of children and adolescents, the present study findings suggest major shortcomings in this area. Children are only able to understand and comply with self-management recommendations if the provided information is appropriate to their level of cognitive development  55  . Furthermore, children and adolescents are confronted with age-specific disease-related concerns (e.g., peer-group and diabetes, alcohol and diabetes), for which appropriate content need to be established  56, 57  . Devising age-appropriate MHA could thus help improve diabetes-related outcomes particularly in children and adolescents  58, 59  .\n\nAside from the technical support by MHA through PSD, this review also focused on the incorporated selfmanagement tasks. The median of 4.5 targeted self-management tasks per MHA suggests significant improvements in the content of diabetes self-management MHA since the findings of Hood et al.  13  , who reported that MHA contained too little educational information. However, the self-management tasks of problem solving and coping with psychosocial issues are only addressed in one third of the MHA. Given the great importance of mental health in people with diabetes and the lack of time in routine clinical care for discussing mental health problems with concerned persons  [60] [61] [62]  , eHealth apps could serve as an important low-threshold entry point to these topics  63, 64  .\n\nLimitations. Some limitations must be considered when interpreting the findings of this study. First, we only searched MHA available in European app stores in English or German language. Therefore, the findings cannot be generalized to apps available in other countries or languages. Second, due to the fast-paced nature of MHA development, it is conceivable that the content of some MHA may change or be no longer available on short to medium term  13  . Third, we used the MARS because it is a standard tool for systematic evaluation of MHA quality. Future studies could use different evaluating instruments which have other specific emphases, such as the APA app evaluation framework  65  or the ENLIGHT tool  66  . Fourth, we only assessed privacy and security on a descriptive level. An assessment of privacy and security practice in smoking cessation and depression MHA with a more elaborated procedure showed that present privacy policies often lack adequate and sufficient information  67  . Future studies regarding MHA for diabetes could build on this procedure and assess whether data protection is still guaranteed under attack."

      "text": "At present, the potential of PSD principles implementation in diabetes self-management MHA may not be exploited optimally. PSD principles predict quality ratings of MHA and may play a crucial role in improving the engagement with MHA. Therefore, improvements in the implementation of PSD features in MHA should be achieved. Future studies should evaluate the engagement of real users with specific PSD principles to determine which features and functions work best in real life and thus contribute to the targeted improvement of diabetes self-management MHA. Finally, this study demonstrates an on average moderate quality of MHA with educational content targeting diabetes self-management available in European app stores, with deficits in information quality and engagement. As the more important it seems to establish databases such as mhad.science, psyberguide.org or mindapps.org in order to inform patients and healthcare providers about quality proven MHA in the vast quantity of available but most often not recommendable MHA for diabetes and beyond."
