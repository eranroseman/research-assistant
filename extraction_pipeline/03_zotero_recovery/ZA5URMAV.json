  "title": "Rethinking Risk: Prospect Theory Application in Health Message Framing Research",
  "abstract": "Although prospect theory conceptualizes risk as uncertainty, health message framing research based on the theory typically conceptualizes risk as severity. This study reports the results of two experiments designed to explore these alternative conceptualizations of risk and their effect on health decision making. Participants (N 1 = 768, N 2 = 532) were randomly assigned to one of four conditions that presented a hypothetical scenario of a sexually transmitted disease (STD) outbreak. The conditions were defined by message prompt (deadly vs. easily curable STD) and response option frame (gain vs. loss). Participants selected which of two programs (certain outcome vs. uncertain outcome) they would prefer to combat the outbreak. Across both experiments, participants expressed strong preferences for certain (low risk) outcomes in the gain-framed conditions and no preferences in the loss-framed conditions. These differences held regardless of the consequence severity of the scenario. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of these results and offer directions for future research.",

      "text": "Research in persuasive message design suggests that the way a message is framed, highlighting the benefits or costs of engaging or not engaging in a particular behavior, will influence its persuasiveness. This finding is important for persuasive health messages because most health behaviors can be framed in a way that either highlights the benefits of engaging in the behavior (gain frame) or highlights the costs of not engaging in the behavior (loss frame;  Rothman & Salovey, 1997) . A frequent assumption in message framing research is that gain-framed messages are more effective for encouraging prevention behaviors, such as sunscreen use and exercise, and loss-framed messages are more effective for promoting detection behaviors, such as breast self-examinations and colonoscopy  (Rothman & Salovey, 1997; Salovey, Schneider, & Apanovitch, 2002) .\n\nThis distinction is grounded in the tenets of prospect theory  (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979; Tversky & Kahneman, 1981) , which considers how the probabilities (certain vs. uncertain) of outcomes (framed as desirable vs. undesirable) influence decisions and proposes that people will be risk averse when outcomes are presented in terms of gains and risk seeking when outcomes are presented in terms of losses. Given the complexities of applying prospect theory to health behavior decisions, the focus on risk as uncertainty usually has been translated to risk as severity in framing research  (Rothman & Salovey, 1997) . Consequently, prevention behaviors are considered \"low risk\" because their consequences (i.e., avoiding illness) are arguably more desirable than the consequences of detection behaviors (i.e., confirming illness), which are considered \"high risk.\" Another shift in focus was in the type of message frame explored: from risky choice frame to goal frame  (Levin, Schneider, & Gaeth, 1998) . We will explore both of these shifts in this article, although our empirical emphasis will be on risk as uncertainty versus severity.\n\nAlthough these shifts make considerable sense in the health behavior domain, they also blur the original prospect theory conceptualization of risk  (O'Keefe, 2011; O'Keefe & Jensen, 2006) , something O'Keefe (2012) has called a \"misstep.\" Our goal in this study, then, is to step back and explore the conceptualizations of risk as outcome uncertainty versus risk as a consequence of severity within prospect theory's risky choice framework. To do so, we will consider the effects of message framing on preference for uncertainty in decision making in two contexts: a disease outbreak with a severe consequence and a disease outbreak whose consequence is less severe. We begin with a review of prospect theory and its application in health communication, move to a consideration the complexities inherent in this area of research, and then present the results of two experiments designed to tease out the effects of risk as uncertainty and risk as severity."

      "title": "Prospect Theory",
      "text": "Prospect theory was developed to explain decision making under conditions of risk, or uncertainty  (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979) . The term \"risk\" as used in prospect theory refers to the uncertainty of outcomes, or the extent to which outcomes are more or less probable. According to prospect theory, when faced with decisions involving potential gains, people tend to avoid risky (uncertain) outcomes, and when faced with decisions involving potential losses, they are more likely to seek risky (uncertain) outcomes. Tversky and Kahneman (1981)  tested this prediction in a series of studies in which participants faced choices between certain (i.e., a 100% probability) and uncertain (e.g., a 25% probability) outcomes, and they found consistent support for their hypothesis.\n\nIn the study most related to health decisions, Tversky and  Kahneman (1981)  asked participants to decide between two programs developed to fight a hypothetical outbreak of an unusual disease expected to kill 600 people. In the condition that emphasized gains, participants were asked to choose between two programs on the basis of how many people would be saved: If Program A were adopted, 200 people would be saved; if Program B were adopted, there was a 1/3 probability that 600 people would be saved and 2/3 probability that nobody would be saved. In contrast, participants in the condition that emphasized losses were asked to choose between two programs on the basis of how many people would die: If Program A were adopted, 400 people would die; if Program B were adopted, there was a 1/3 probability that nobody would die and a 2/3 probability that 600 people would die. Crucially, the programs offered the same ultimate outcomes; however, the low-risk program presented a certain outcome and the high-risk program presented an uncertain outcome, and the outcome was framed either as gain (e.g., 200 live) or loss (e.g., 400 die).\n\nThe results of the study showed that in the gain-frame condition, 72% of participants chose the low-risk program (the certain outcome), illustrating people's aversion to risk when presented with potential gains; in the loss-frame condition, 78% of the participants chose the high-risk program (the uncertain outcome), illustrating people's willingness to accept risk when faced with potential losses  (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981) . This tendency to be risk averse or risk seeking on the basis of potential gains or losses offers guidance to persuasive health message design precisely because messages can be designed to emphasize potential gains or losses of particular behaviors  (Rothman & Salovey, 1997) ."

      "title": "Health Behavior Change and Persuasive Message Design",
      "text": "Health behavior change research tends to focus on two primary types of behaviors: prevention and detection  (Rothman & Salovey, 1997) . Prevention behaviors reduce the risk of developing poor health conditions. Applying sunscreen to prevent skin cancer and exercising to prevent heart disease are two examples. These behaviors allow a person to preserve good health, and as such, they can be considered \"low risk.\" Detection behaviors test for the presence of a health condition. Having a mammogram to detect breast cancer and an A1c test to detect diabetes fall into this realm. These behaviors may confirm potential disease, and, therefore, they can be considered \"high risk.\" In this context, risk is conceptualized as the severity or undesirability of the consequences of the behavior, not as the uncertainty of outcomes of the behavior.\n\nIn designing messages to promote both prevention and detection behaviors, researchers use gain or loss frames to focus on the benefits and costs associated with particular behaviors and whether behaviors are likely to lead to attaining or not attaining either desirable or undesirable outcomes  (Rothman & Salovey, 1997; Salovey et al., 2002) . Gain-framed messages emphasize attaining the desirable or avoiding the undesirable. For example, if a woman starts running for exercise, she is more likely to increase her heart health and less likely to suffer a heart attack. Loss-framed messages are the opposite and emphasize not attaining the desirable or attaining the undesirable. For example, if that same woman does not start running for exercise, she is less likely to increase her heart health and more likely to suffer a heart attack.\n\nThe health communication literature is replete with studies of message framing and its impact on attitude, behavioral intention, and behavior (e.g.,  Rothman, Bartels, Wlaschin, & Salovey, 2006) , as well as studies of how individual differences may moderate response to framed messages (e.g.,  Covey, 2014) . The types of behaviors investigated run the gamut: from eating fruits and vegetables  (Churchill & Pavey, 2013)  and exercising  (Gray & Harrington, 2011)  to screening for hip dysplasia in children  (Witting, Boere-Boonekamp, Fleuren, Sakkers, & IJzerman, 2012) . O'Keefe (2011) has noted that of the multitude of message characteristics that have been studied (e.g., message sidedness, conclusion explicitness), message framing has stimulated the most research by far, with more than 200 studies focused on framing. He also has observed that researcher consensus across this literature is that gain framing is more effective when promoting prevention behaviors and loss framing is more effective when promoting detection behaviors (see also  Rothman et al., 2006) . But is this consensus correct?\n\nIn applying prospect theory to health behavior change messages, researchers encountered conceptual and operational challenges that led to a reconceptualization of some of the propositions of the theory. In particular, they shifted from asking a person to choose between two program options affecting population-level health to asking a person to indicate the likelihood of engaging in a single behavior affecting individual-level health. They also shifted from a focus on risk as uncertainty of outcomes to risk as severity of behavioral consequences  (Rothman & Salovey, 1997) . Although these shifts are arguably reasonable in light of the nature of health behavior, by making them, researchers may have risked limiting the predictive power of prospect theory and the gain-prevention/ loss-detection relationship. Indeed, this is precisely the conclusion of a series of meta-analyses by O'Keefe and his colleagues, who have considered hundreds of message framing studies to investigate to what extent (if at all) the prevention-detection distinction is sound. Across these meta-analyses (O'  Keefe, 2011; O'Keefe & Jensen, 2006 , 2007 , 2009; O'Keefe & Nan, 2012; O'Keefe & Wu, 2012) , the researchers have either not found support for the claim that gain-framed messages are more persuasive for prevention behaviors and loss-framed messages are more persuasive for detection behaviors or they have found only small effects.\n\nThe prevention-detection distinction aside, there are two findings in this set of meta-analyses that highlight the relevance of perceptions of uncertainty, the greater or lesser probability of outcomes, in making health decisions. Specifically, in their meta-analysis of 93 studies that considered disease prevention behaviors, O'  Keefe and Jensen (2007)  found that gain-framed messages were more persuasive than loss-framed messages for dental hygiene (r = .154) but not for other prevention behaviors (e.g., diet/nutrition, safer sex). Likewise, in their meta-analysis of 43 studies that considered obesity-related behaviors, O'Keefe and Jensen (2011) found that gain-framed messages were more persuasive than lossframed messages for physical activity (r = .171) but not for other behaviors (e.g., healthy eating). In their 2007 article, the authors offer an extended discussion of this effect and suggest that the relationship between brushing/flossing and good dental health is probably a more certain one than the relationship between other health promotion behaviors and their outcomes; therefore, people's tendency to be risk averse in conditions of gain could, according to prospect theory, explain the result for dental hygiene. In the 2011 article, the authors do not offer a prospect theory-based explanation for the effect for physical activity; however, it could be argued that physical activity is a more certain path to weight loss than \"healthy eating,\" a behavior that O'Keefe and Jensen (2011) state is not necessarily linked to weight loss."

      "title": "Distinctions in Framing",
      "text": "To bring clarity to the inconsistent findings in the framing literature,  Levin et al. (1998)  developed a typology of three kinds of frames: risky choice, goal, and attribute. The authors distinguish these frame types according to how the frame is instantiated, what the frame affects, and how participants respond to the framing. Risky choice framing presents participants with two options that differ in the level of risk (uncertainty), the framing affects preference for risk, and participants must choose between the two options. Goal framing presents participants with the consequences of a behavioral option, the framing affects message persuasiveness, and participants indicate how likely they would be to engage in the recommended behavior. Attribute framing highlights different characteristics of a particular option, the framing affects the evaluation of the option, and participants provide their evaluation of the option. Figure  1  presents examples of these different approaches to framing.\n\nAs mentioned,  Tversky and Kahneman's (1981)  research used risky choice framing, whereas almost all health behavior research uses goal framing. Furthermore, also as mentioned, health behavior research shifted to a focus on risk as consequence severity instead of risk as outcome uncertainty. These differences are substantial enough that one might wonder how prospect theory could have much to say about persuasive health message impact, yet prospect theory has been invoked as the theoretical foundation. Our goal, therefore, is to begin to address these shifts to assess their impact, starting with the conceptualization of risk. Specifically, within the risky choice framework, we explore whether consequence severity might influence preference for outcome uncertainty, a central concept that has been almost entirely neglected in message framing research."

      "title": "Uncertainty in (Goal) Framing",
      "text": "We say almost entirely neglected because there have been a few examples of message framing studies that manipulate uncertainty in message design. We take a brief look at those studies here to see how they can inform the discussion. Block and Keller (1995)  used the context of sexually transmitted disease (STD) prevalence on a college campus to study the effect of perceived efficacy on cognitive processing and persuasion. In Study 1, they manipulated probability by creating high efficacy (reduce risk of HPV by 80%) and low efficacy (reduce risk of HPV by 20%) messages. In this case, high efficacy equates with low risk and low efficacy equates with high risk in terms of outcome uncertainty. The results showed that in the low efficacy condition, participants were more persuaded by loss-framed messages, whereas in the high efficacy condition, both gain-and loss-framed messages were equally persuasive. In Study 2, the authors also explored efficacy but did not involve uncertainty. Instead, they created a high efficacy scenario with skin cancer prevention behaviors and a low efficacy scenario with detection behaviors, suggesting that prevention behaviors are \"low risk\" and detection behaviors are \"high risk.\" Studies 1 and 2 had similar results, so the authors suggested that these results confirm that the prevention/detection distinction \"can be used to manipulate perceived efficacy in the same way as numerical values of chance\" (p. 200). Bartels, Kelly, and Rothman (2010)  conducted two experiments to test what they referred to as the \"risk implications\" of a behavior on gain-and loss-framed messages. In Experiment 1, they manipulated the effectiveness of the West Nile virus vaccine (90% effective vs. 60% effective). In the low risk (90% effective) condition, participants were more persuaded by a gain-framed message. In the high-risk (60% effective) condition, although the pattern of means on the persuasion measure was reversed, the difference between gain-and loss-framed messages was not significant. In Experiment 2, Bartels et al. did not explore outcome uncertainty. Instead, they focused on framing and explored which message frame was more effective in increasing participants' willingness to schedule a hypothetical enzyme screening depending on whether the enzyme's function was framed as protecting their health or possibly revealing a problem. Ferguson and Gallagher (2007)  manipulated outcome uncertainty in their messages comparing attribute framing (\"The flu jab is effective in preventing the development of the flu virus in 70-90% of cases\" [gain]/\"the flu jab is not effective in preventing the development of the flu virus in 10-30% of cases\" [loss]) and goal framing (\"You reduce the risk of developing the flu by 70-90%\" [gain]/\"You fail to take advantage of a 70-90% increased chance of preventing the development of the flu\" [loss]) approaches (see p. 671). The results showed that there were no significant differences in perceived effectiveness of the vaccine between gain-and lossgoal framing or gain-attribute framing; the loss-attribute frame was perceived as being significantly less effective than any of the other three conditions.\n\nMost recently, Van't Riet et al. (  2014 ) suggested that there is little support for the prospect theory risk-framing hypothesis.\n\nThey conducted a series of six studies to explore several variations of risk: temporary side effects (Study 1); short-term procedural pain (Studies 2, 3, and 4); long-term vaccine dangers (Study 2); flu vaccination (Studies 5 and 6); and side effect severity (Study 6). However, only two studies manipulated risk according to prospect theory. In both Study 5 and Study 6, the researchers created conditions using a high-risk vaccine (60% effective) and a lowrisk vaccine (90% effective) to explore intentions to vaccinate. In neither study was the predicted risk by framing interaction found. Instead, low perceived risk was associated with greater behavioral intentions to vaccinate regardless of message frame.\n\nThe articles reviewed here consider the role of uncertainty in framing effects; however, they do so almost exclusively within the goal framing context. Only  Ferguson and Gallagher (2007)  considered a different frame, and that was attribute framing, not risky choice framing. Furthermore, only two studies found support for predicted risk by framing interactions, and it was only partial support at that:  Bartels et al. (2010)  found an effect for gain framing in the low-risk condition;  Block and Keller (1995)  found an effect for loss framing in the high-risk condition. On the basis of this analysis, the role of risk as uncertainty within the goal framing paradigm appears to be unreliable. Moreover, these studies do not clearly address the role of outcome severity. Van't Riet et al. (2014)  did manipulate severity in Study 6 by including \"potential downsides\" of flu vaccination, but they manipulated downsides within uncertainty (few side effects in the low-risk condition; severe side effects in the high-risk condition), so exploring potential interactions between severity and uncertainty was not possible. Ultimately, the articles reviewed here provide evidence for the inconsistent results for gain/loss goal framing and outcome uncertainty in the extant literature. It seems clear that nobody has done what we do in this study-step back and revisit prospect theory directly to try to tease apart the effects of uncertainty and severity in risky choice framed messages."

If you do not get mammograms, there is a 12.5% chance that you will develop undetected breast cancer. c Attribute If you get a mammogram, there is a 99.5% chance that you will be found to have healthy breasts. If you get a mammogram, there is a 0.5% chance that you will be found to have cancer. Figure 1. Examples of risky choice, goal, and attribute framing. a The mortality rate for breast cancer is approximately 22 out of 100,000 (National Cancer Institute, n.d.) b\n\nMammography reduces the risk of dying from breast cancer by 20%  (Nelson et al., 2009) . c Approximately 12.5% of women in the United States will develop breast cancer at some point in their lives  (National Cancer Institute, 2012)  versus uncertain outcomes in the context of a \"deadly disease outbreak\" (i.e., a severe consequence), and then we extended that test by asking participants to choose between programs with certain versus uncertain outcomes in the context of an \"easily curable disease outbreak\" (i.e., a less severe consequence). This resulted in four experimental conditions: Condition 1: Deadly/Gain-frame, Condition 2: Deadly/Lossframe, Condition 3: Easily Curable/Gain-frame, and Condition 4: Easily Curable/Loss-frame. Our goal was to determine whether participants' risk preferences (i.e., being risk seeking or risk averse, as predicted by prospect theory) would be influenced by severity of the consequences of those choices (as explored by framing research).\n\nOn the basis of what Tversky and  Kahneman (1981)  found in regard to people's tendency to be risk averse when outcomes are presented in terms of gains and risk seeking when outcomes are presented in terms of losses, we proposed the following hypotheses: H1: In the deadly/gain-frame condition, the program with a certain outcome will be preferred over the program with an uncertain outcome.\n\nH2: In the deadly/loss-frame condition, the program with an uncertain outcome will be preferred over the program with a certain outcome.\n\nWe anticipated support for these hypotheses on the basis of the extensive body of prospect theory research showing that people tend to be risk averse in conditions of gain and risk seeking in conditions of loss.\n\nTo explore whether the tenets of prospect theory apply when risk is manipulated as consequence severity, we posed the following research questions: RQ1: In the easily curable/gain-frame condition, will there be a difference in preference between programs with certain versus uncertain outcomes?\n\nRQ2: In the easily curable/loss-frame condition, will there be a difference in preference between programs with certain versus uncertain outcomes?\n\nTversky and  Kahneman (1981)  explored the effect of message framing on risk preference in the context of a scenario with one quite severe consequence: death. The study, therefore, could not comment on the impact of framing on risk preference in a context with a less severe consequence. It could be that people's tendency to be risk averse in conditions of gain but risk seeking in the face of loss is robust and holds true regardless of the severity of the consequence associated with a choice. In that case, we would expect to find results in the \"easily curable\" scenario that mirror the  Tversky and Kahneman (1981)  study. If framing effects emerge only under conditions in which the consequence is severe, however, there may be few if any differences in program preference in the \"easily curable\" disease context regardless of frame. Prospect theory would seem to support the former expectation, while health behavior theories that emphasize illness severity (e.g., the health belief model;  Janz & Becker, 1984)  would seem to support the latter.\n\nTo further explore the effect of consequence severity on decision making, we posed a third research question: RQ3: Do gain and loss framing effects on risk preference vary between the deadly and easily curable conditions?\n\nThe proportions of research participants choosing the certain versus uncertain option within the gain-framed and loss-framed conditions can be compared statistically. If perceptions of severity do matter in decision making, as is advanced through the prevention/detection distinction, we would expect to see greater proportions of participants choosing the certain outcome in the deadly/gain-frame condition than the easily curable/gain-frame condition. For example, we may expect that participants' preference for Program A (certain) versus Program B (uncertain) in the deadly/gain-frame condition would be quite pronounced, perhaps 80/20, whereas in the easily curable/gain-frame condition, the preference would not be so skewed and may, in fact, be closer to 50/50 (because when consequences are not severe, people's tendency to be risk averse might be muted). Likewise, if perceptions of severity do matter, we would expect to see greater proportions of participants choosing the uncertain outcome in the deadly/loss-frame condition than the easily curable/ loss-frame condition. For example, we may expect that participants' preference for Program A (certain) versus Program B (uncertain) in the deadly/loss-frame condition would be 20/80, whereas in the easily curable/loss-frame condition, the preference would may be closer 50/50 (again, because when consequences are not severe, people's tendency to be risk seeking might be muted). The two-proportion z-test determines whether such differences in proportions across conditions are statistically significant."

For the gainframed conditions (1 and 3), the comparison of the proportions of participants who chose certain versus uncertain outcomes across the deadly (122 certain to 70 uncertain) and easily curable (132 certain to 61 uncertain) scenarios revealed no statistically significant difference, z = 1.00, p = .32.

Thus, in answer to RQ3, it appears that differences in consequence severity are not associated with differential preferences for outcome certainty or uncertainty within gain or loss frames.\n\nThe results of Experiment 1 led us to decide to replicate the study for two reasons. The first reason was the near replication of  Tversky and Kahneman (1981)  study (conditions 1 and 2). Participants expressed clear preference for the certain outcome in the gain-framed condition, but the hypothesized preference for the uncertain outcome in the loss-frame condition did not reach statistical significance by conventional standards. This inconsistency with prospect theory's predicted results warranted further exploration. The second reason was the strong preference for a certain outcome in the easily curable/gain-frame scenario (condition 3) but a complete lack of preference for an uncertain outcome in the easily curable/loss-frame scenario (condition 4). This mixed result, providing clear support for neither outcome uncertainty nor consequence severity, called for additional investigation."

      "text": "Message framing is one of the most prolific areas in persuasive health message design research for good reason. Highlighting benefits/gains and costs/losses associated with behaviors is readily achievable and intuitively sound. Furthermore, mapping gain or loss frames onto disease prevention or detection behaviors also is readily achievable, and conceptualizing prevention as \"low risk\" and detection as \"high risk\" also makes exceptional sense-if risk is conceptualized as the severity of consequences associated with a behavior. The catch comes when one remembers that risk is conceptualized in prospect theory  (Kahneman & Tversky, 1979)  as the uncertainty associated with particular outcomes.\n\nAlthough a consensus has emerged in the message framing literature that gain-framed messages are effective for prevention behaviors and loss-framed messages are effective for detection behaviors  (Salovey et al., 2002) , that consensus does not withstand scrutiny. There are sometimes effects for gain-framed prevention messages, but they are small, and more often than not, there are no distinguishable effects for the gain-frame prevention/loss-frame detection paradigm  (O'Keefe, 2011) . However, two important exceptions revealed in two meta-analyses  (O'Keefe & Jensen, 2007 , 2011)  suggest that outcome uncertainty (i.e., the probability that a behavior will lead to an outcome) does play a role in decision making. Therefore, we designed an experiment based on the original  Tversky and Kahneman (1981)  study to tease out the impact of message framing and consequence severity on preference for risk in health behavior decision making.\n\nAcross two experiments, we found that participants had clear preferences for certain outcomes in gain-framed conditions regardless of whether the disease context posed severe behavioral choice consequences or not. This finding is in line with the meta-analyses showing effects for gain framing on dental hygiene and oral health  (O'Keefe & Jensen, 2007)  and physical activity and obesity  (O'Keefe & Jensen, 2011) . It also is in line with findings from  Van't Riet et al. (2014)  Studies 5 and 6. It seems that participants prefer certainty when there are gains to be had regardless of behavioral consequence severity. We did not, however, find participant preference for uncertain outcomes in loss-framed conditions. Although the effect for loss framing in the deadly disease context trended toward statistical significance in the first experiment, that effect disappeared upon replication. Similarly, there was no indication whatsoever that participants preferred an uncertain or certain outcome when presented with loss-framed responses in a less severe context in either experiment. This is an interesting result because, according to prospect theory's prediction of people's tendency to be risk averse under conditions of loss, we would have expected preferences for the uncertain outcome in the loss-framed conditions regardless of consequence severity. This finding certainly warrants future investigation.\n\nFinally, we found that within gain-and loss-framed conditions, the proportions of participants preferring certain versus uncertain outcomes did not differ according to the severity of consequences associated with the disease context. When outcomes were presented as gains, participants preferred certainty regardless of consequence severity. When outcomes were presented as losses, participants had no clear preferences regardless of consequence severity. These results suggest that consequence severity does not play much of a role in decision making within the risky choice framework."

      "title": "Practical Application",
      "text": "Now the question becomes what to do with this information. In the current study, we replicated and extended the original prospect theory experiment to determine whether variations in the severity of the consequences of behavioral decisions made a difference in patterns of risk preference within gain and loss frames. We consider this one small step for clarifying the literature that is said to be grounded prospect theory but conceptualizes risk as consequence severity, not outcome uncertainty. We hope that our results will help stimulate discussion and further systematic research to untangle what should be distinct theoretical constructs. However, the challenge of mapping prospect theory's risky choice logic onto health decision making still remains. Even if we integrate outcome probabilities into framed messages, the nature of most health decisions is not \"choose Program A or B\" but \"choose to do something or not\"  (Rothman & Salovey, 1997) . O'Keefe (2012)  acknowledges this distinction and warns that it is the source of another \"misstep\" in the application of prospect theory to health behavior. Furthermore, he points out yet another subtle distinction in the risky choice paradigm: Not only is the choice between two program options but the program options also result in the same long-term outcomes-something unlikely when considering the longterm outcomes of engaging versus not engaging in a behavior. Again, this underscores the challenge of using the risky choice framing approach in goal framing scenarios.\n\nAt this point, one might conclude that it would be best to abandon prospect theory as a guide to message design altogether. We believe this is premature. If people fully appreciated the long-term equivalence of the two program options in the original prospect theory study, there should not have been such pronounced preferences related to gain and loss frames. Furthermore, the 1981 article actually reports several framing studies (albeit related to money instead of health) that do not present long-term equivalent outcomes yet show consistent gain/risk-averse and loss/risk-seeking effects. So, we believe there is reason to continue to explore this line of inquiry. The question then becomes how to integrate probability information associated with the decision to do or not do something into persuasive messages.\n\nO'  Keefe and Jensen (2007)  provide the following analysis based on prospect theory: (a) gain framing should be more persuasive when performing a behavior has relatively certain outcomes and not performing it has relatively uncertain outcomes; (b) loss framing should be more persuasive when performing a behavior has relatively uncertain outcomes and not performing it has relatively certain outcomes; and (c) neither frame is necessarily more persuasive when the outcomes of performing a behavior are equally certain or uncertain. This analysis means that before we can apply the tenets of prospect theory to goal framing messages, we need information about the probability of outcomes associated with health behaviors. Although  Rothman and Salovey (1997)  noted that \"the risk associated with a behavioral alternative usually cannot be defined in terms of the actual likelihood of a particular outcome\" (p. 5), with the advent of \"big data,\" such as the data registry of the National Cancer Institute-funded Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium ( http://breastscreening.cancer.gov/data/ ), providing information on the likelihood of a particular outcome becomes much more possible.\n\nTake the case of screening mammography, for example. Of women screened for breast cancer, approximately 10% have an abnormal result requiring further testing; of those women, 4.8% are diagnosed with breast cancer  (Rosenberg et al., 2006) . Such information could be integrated into risky choice, goal, or attribute messages encouraging mammography, and the messages still could be framed as gain or loss (see Figure  1 ). In this case, and on the basis of O'Keefe and Jensen's (2007) observations, we would expect an effect for the gain-framed message. Of course, this expectation goes against many studies that have found effects for loss-framed messages on breast cancer screening (see  Salovey et al., 2002) .\n\nHowever, hardly any of those studies included messages with outcome probability information (for exceptions, see  Cox & Cox, 2001; and Williams, Clarke, & Borland, 2001 )-a crucial omission from the perspective of prospect theory.\n\nThis kind of \"risk as probability\" information is used successfully in decision-making tools more and more. A recent Cochrane review found that decision aids increase knowledge more than usual care, and decision aids that include expressed probabilities increase accurate risk perception  (Stacey et al., 2014) . Such decision aids can be developed for a variety of conditions. For example, research through the Mayo Clinic is developing decision aids in the areas of diabetes, osteoporosis, depression, heart attack, and statin drugs  (Mayo Clinic, n.d.) . In the case of reducing the risk of heart disease, patients can be presented with a risk profile showing the current and future probability of having a heart attack, varied by whether or not they take a statin drug  (National Public Radio, 2014) . Providing such comprehensive information is in keeping with patient-centered medicine and shared decision making, issues quite relevant in today's medical environment."

      "title": "Limitations and Future Directions",
      "text": "One limitation of this study is that our sample consisted of college students. Tversky and Kahneman (1981)  involved students in their study, however, so having a similar sample for comparison purposes was not unreasonable. In trying to maintain parallels with the 1981 study, we merely extended the design of the study to include a condition with less severe consequences and asked participants to make a public health level decision within the risky choice framework. We did not manipulate consequence severity in goal framed messages. That obviously is an area for future research. We also focused on a prevention behavior. Replicating our study in the context of a detection behavior, comparing two different screening programs with certain versus uncertain outcomes and more or less severe behavioral consequences, would enhance generalizability.\n\nAs research moves forward in this area, it will be important not to lose sight of important distinctions in the nature of the health behaviors themselves. Indeed, the nature of the recommended behavior is something that needs to be addressed more comprehensively and systematically  (Rimal, Lapinski, Turner, & Smith, 2011) . For example, is a behavior done in public or private? Is it something that should be encouraged or discouraged? Is it relatively pleasant or onerous? In revisiting risk as uncertainty, studies should manipulate the uncertainty of outcomes under gainand loss-framed conditions and measure effects on attitude and behavioral intention while simultaneously considering these aspects of the behavior. Similarly, future research should strive to separate risky choice and goal framing approaches to understand better the inherent differences between the two and for what behaviors each is most effective. In conducting these studies, researchers should remember that any given behavior will have multiple characteristics, although perhaps only a subset is important (and possible) to highlight in a persuasive message.\n\nAnother concern is which outcome uncertainty is highlighted and how it is tied to the behavior in question. For example, a screening mammography will return either a normal or abnormal result, but we have not found a message framing study that presents the probability of test results. Instead, messages present the probability of getting cancer  (Williams et al., 2001)  or dying from cancer  (Cox & Cox, 2001) . These are very different outcomes, obviously. Therefore, examining the impact of proximal versus distal outcomes is important. Perhaps a comprehensive design strategy that offered a complete portrayal of the probabilities of outcomes along a trajectory would be informative. In the mammography example presented earlier, if a woman would read only a message telling her she had a 99.5% chance of test results revealing she is cancer free, she may decide that there is no reason to get screened. But if the message included lifetime probability of breast cancer diagnosis and probability of survival with early diagnosis, as presented in the goal frame example in Figure  1 , the decision may be different and certainly would be more informed."

      "text": "Our replication and extension of the original test of prospect theory  (Tversky & Kahneman, 1981)  partially confirmed the theory's tenets, supporting the role of risk as uncertainty in health decision making. Whether the behavioral consequence was severe or not, participants in the gain-framed conditions preferred certain (low risk) outcomes. Alternatively, participants in the loss-framed conditions showed no preference for uncertain (high risk) or certain (low risk) outcomes. Moreover, preferences for certain or uncertain outcomes did not differ within gain-and loss-framed conditions when we manipulated consequence severity, suggesting that the severity-based prevention/detection distinction may not be as useful as hoped. We believe this study offers some conceptual clarity for interpreting research that has defined \"risk\" in terms of consequence severity while almost entirely ignoring the central concept of outcome uncertainty. These results underscore the need for message design researchers to consider the uncertainty and associated probability of outcomes, rather than just their severity, when designing framed health behavior change messages. By returning to the original application of prospect theory and considering decisions under conditions of (un)certainty, we can potentially enhance the utility of the theory and the effectiveness of our messages."
