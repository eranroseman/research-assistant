  "title": "Electronic Pill Bottles or Bidirectional Text Messaging to Improve Hypertension Medication Adherence (Way 2 Text): a Randomized Clinical Trial",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Poor medication adherence contributes to inadequate control of hypertension. However, the value of adherence monitoring is unknown. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of monitoring adherence with electronic pill bottles or bidirectional text messaging on improving hypertension control. DESIGN: Three-arm pragmatic randomized controlled trial. PATIENTS: One hundred forty-nine primary care patients aged 18-75 with hypertension and text messaging capabilities who were seen at least twice in the prior 12 months with at least two out-of-range blood pressure (BP) measurements, including the most recent visit. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomized in a 1:2:2 ratio to receive (1) usual care, (2) electronic pill bottles for medication adherence monitoring (pill bottle), and (3) bidirectional text messaging for medication adherence monitoring (bidirectional text). MAIN MEASURES: Change in systolic BP during the final 4-month visit compared with baseline. KEY RESULTS: At the 4-month follow-up visit, mean (SD) change values in systolic blood pressure were -4.7 (23.4) mmHg in usual care, -4.3 (21.5) mmHg in the pill bottle arm, and -4.6 (19.8) mmHg in the text arm. There was no significant change in systolic blood pressure between control and the pill bottle arm (p = 0.94) or the text messaging arm (p = 1.00), and the two intervention arms did not differ from each other (p = 0.93). CONCLUSIONS: Despite good measured adherence, neither feedback with electronic pill bottles nor bidirectional text messaging about medication adherence improved blood pressure control. Adherence to prescribed medications was not improved enough to affect BP control or it was not the primary driver of poor control.",

      "text": "Hypertension affects about 30% of US adults and is a leading contributor to the global burden of disease.  [1] [2] 2] [3]  Despite substantial evidence that low-cost and readily available medications can improve clinical outcomes,  4  only about half of patients have adequately controlled blood pressure (BP).  5 any studies show that adherence to hypertension medications is low  6  and that poor adherence is associated with poor outcomes.  [7] [8] ] [9] [10]  Like many other chronic conditions, successful management of hypertension requires patient engagement on a daily basis, outside of clinical visits.  11 ecent years have seen the introduction of technologies to measure and monitor medication adherence, such as electronic pill bottles.  [12] [13] 3] [14] [15]  These pill bottles can connect wirelessly to software platforms to automate engagement with patients. There is some evidence that patients who use these devices and receive feedback have improved medication adherence in chronic conditions such as HIV and cardiovascular disease.  16- 21 However, these devices are costly to implement and challenging for some patients, as they may require patients to decant medications from their original packaging into the devices and may require complicated processes to establish and maintain connectivity to wireless networks.\n\nText messaging holds promise for engagement of patients about medication adherence. Text messaging is now a leading communication channel and because of its ease and low technical threshold, its use spans demographic and economic barriers.  22 Bidirectional text messaging offers the opportunity to monitor adherence by daily questioning of patients about whether they took their medications.  23 These structured data responses might replace electronic pill bottle opening data, but they might also be less reliable than observed pill bottle openings. Patients can of course open pill bottles and not take the medication, but that kind of intentional non-adherence is a different clinical problem. Patients' text responses might more easily misrepresent actual pill taking.\n\nSome studies have shown that both bidirectional and unidirectional text messaging can improve medication adherence in hypertension, but these studies have relied mainly on selfreport of adherence and do not consistently show improvement in clinical outcomes.  [24] [25] 5] [26] [27] [28]  There are a few studies showing that remote monitoring of BP in hypertension can improve clinical outcomes, but these rely on nurses or pharmacists to monitor the data, which can be costly for routine primary care practices to sustain.  [29] [30] 0] [31]  Additionally, for many clinicians, remote monitoring of BP creates an unwelcome sense of responsibility to respond to readings out of range.\n\nMonitoring of medication adherence has the potential to improve hypertension management without creating the same unwelcome sense of responsibility, but rigorous evidence is needed about its effectiveness. In this study, we compare the effectiveness of electronic pill bottles and bidirectional text messaging at improving medication adherence and BP control among patients with poorly controlled hypertension."

Initial blood pressure measurements were obtained from the electronic health record during office visits as recorded by routine clinical practice.

Participants in the pill bottle arm were mailed a wireless electronic pill bottle (AdhereTech) to be used for one hypertension medication. The pill bottles electronically monitor openings and transmit them to WTH. Participants received one of two daily feedback messages, depending on their adherence the day prior: \"Congratulations for taking your medication yesterday! Remember to take your medication today\" or, \"It looks like you did not take your medication yesterday. Remember to take your medication today.\"\n\nParticipants in the bidirectional texting arm received text messages via the WTH platform, prompting the participant to reply via text with his/her adherence for that day. Since adherence for this arm is patient reported, participants received the following initial message the day of enrollment, \"Did you take your medication today? Text back Yes if you have.\" Mirroring the pill bottle arm, the subsequent days the feedback either stated, \"Congratulations for taking your medication yesterday! Did you take your medication today? Text back Yes if you have.\" Or, \"Our records indicated that you did not take all of your medications yesterday. Did you take your medication today? Text back Yes if you have.\"\n\nPatients in the pill bottle and text messaging arms were monitored for 4 months.

Strict adherence for pill bottles started immediately at the enrollment date. A more relaxed adherence measure started after the first bottle opening. Strict adherence for text messaging only included valid \"yes\" responses.

      "title": "CONCLUSION",
      "text": "In this trial, patients with uncontrolled hypertension were provided with electronic pill bottles or bidirectional text messaging to monitor medication adherence and provide daily automated feedback for encouragement. Despite high measured medication adherence in both intervention arms, the reduction in systolic blood pressure or blood pressure control was not significantly different than in the control group. We also did not find any correlation of medication adherence measurement with blood pressure control.\n\nThere are a few reasons why the interventions in the trial did not show any improvement in blood pressure control in this population. First, adherence to prescribed medications may not be the primary factor leading to poor blood pressure control. Patients need to take the medications, but they also need to have their doses escalated or additional medications prescribed if their blood pressures are persistently elevated. There is evidence from multiple studies demonstrating the frequent inadequacy of medication intensification, which can be attributed to uncertainty about patient adherence, provider inertia, and the visit-based primary care system in which providers have competing demands.  [33] [34] 4] [35]  Future interventions could encourage dose escalation among providers by incorporating adherence data with targeted messaging to providers in the EHR.  36 Practices could also assign specialized clinicians to focus on the management of hypertension and reduce the cognitive load on primary care providers.\n\nSecond, medication adherence may not have improved enough to have an effect on blood pressure control. While the measured adherence was high in both intervention arms, patients may have needed to have even higher adherence to demonstrate improved blood pressure control as compared with the usual care group. The primary form of motivation was provided through frequent feedback and alerts, which has been shown to increase participation in other studies, although the primary outcomes were measures of medication adherence and not clinical outcomes.  17, 37   owever, there is an opportunity to leverage additional insights from behavioral science such as social influence, financial incentives, and manipulations of choice architecture.  18, [38] [39] ] [40] [41]  For example, friends or family members could be engaged to encourage adherence or medications could be provided to patients automatically as the default. Medication adherence also may not have been an accurate reflection of true medication adherence as patients may have simply been opening the bottles or responding \"yes\" to the text messages to avoid negative feedback. There are studies showing that electronic pill bottles are an accurate measure of adherence,  12, 14, 15  but there is limited evidence for bidirectional text messaging. Table 3 Correlation Between Medication Adherence and Change in Systolic Blood Pressure Change systolic blood pressure (SBP) Pearson's correlation p value Pill bottle (strict) -0.14 .32 Pill bottle (relaxed) -0.11 .43 Bidirectional text (strict) 0.21 .15 Bidirectional text (relaxed) 0.13 .37\n\nThird, our patient population may have blood pressure that is particularly difficult to treat. It was mostly African American, who may have blood pressure that is more challenging to treat and control.  [42] [43] 3] [44] [45] [46]  Additionally, the patient population at this urban academic primary care practice may have had social and economic issues impeding their ability to take their medications. The participating clinics had also initiated different pilot programs such as provider feedback and dedicated hypertension management programs, which may have selected the participants in the study to be particularly difficult to control. Thus, there may be a ceiling effect in this population making remote monitoring less effective, while it may have worked in other patient populations with fewer barriers to control or fewer existing efforts.\n\nFinally, the control group also showed an improvement in blood pressure control, which may have explained the lack of relative benefit in the intervention groups. Those changes might reflect regression to the mean. In addition, control group participants consented to the study, received a financial incentive to participate, and also attended the follow-up blood pressure visit. Each of these elements may have encouraged the patients to take medications and improve their blood pressure. There was also just one follow-up reading of blood pressure, so patients could have simply taken their medications immediately before the last visit and shown improved control.\n\nThere are some important limitations to the trial. The patients in this urban academic primary care practice may not be representative of other populations of hypertension patients. We relied on a single blood pressure reading for the primary outcome,  47  and the initial blood pressure readings were obtained through routine clinical office visits. Our estimate for the standard deviation of systolic blood pressure was lower than what we found during the trial, which limited power to detect the changes in blood pressure. Revised power calculations assuming a standard deviation of 20 mmHg indicate that power would have been approximately 80% to detect changes in SBP of about 12 mmHg between intervention arms and 16 mmHg between intervention and control arms. Over half of the patients that we attempted to contact were either unreachable or declined to participate, so the enrolled participants may not reflect the characteristics and motivation of the target population. We did not provide feedback to providers about patient medication adherence in this study, and provider feedback might have promoted medication intensification.\n\nThis study also has strengths, including the patient-level randomization and the pragmatic nature of the intervention, which was embedded in routine primary care operations. This intervention focused on a particularly vulnerable urban population that included a high proportion of African Americans, a group that is known to have disparities in access and outcomes.  48 It focused on an important clinical outcome of blood pressure control, measured reliably in a clinic visit. It also addressed an important need, which is to evaluate low-cost and sustainable interventions to improve blood pressure control and increase patient engagement outside of office visits.\n\nNevertheless, this study suggests that providing electronic pill bottles or bidirectional text messaging with feedback to patients is not sufficient to improve blood pressure control. Future efforts could provide feedback to providers to escalate prescribing of antihypertensive medications, incorporate remote monitoring of blood pressure readings with ongoing feedback to patients, or leverage additional insight from behavioral science to encourage greater engagement and iterative improvement.\n\nCorresponding Author: Shivan J.
