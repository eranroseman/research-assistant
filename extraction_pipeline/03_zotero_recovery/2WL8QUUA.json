  "title": "Effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a 12-month automated text message intervention for weight management in postpartum women with overweight or obesity: protocol for the Supporting MumS (SMS) multisite, parallel-group, randomised controlled trial",
  "abstract": "Introduction The reproductive years can increase women's weight-related risk. Evidence for effective postpartum weight management interventions is lacking and engaging women during this life stage is challenging. Following a promising pilot evaluation of the Supporting MumS intervention, we assess if theory-based and bidirectional text messages to support diet and physical activity behaviour change for weight loss and weight loss maintenance, are effective and cost-effective for weight change in postpartum women with overweight or obesity, compared with an active control arm receiving text messages on child health and development. Methods and analysis Two-arm, parallel-group, assessorblind randomised controlled trial with cost-effectiveness and process evaluations. Women (n=888) with body mass index (BMI) \u226525 kg/m 2 and within 24 months of giving birth were recruited via community and National Health Service pathways through five UK sites targeting areas of ethnic and socioeconomic diversity. Women were 1:1 randomised to the intervention or active control groups, each receiving automated text messages for 12 months. Data are collected at 0, 6, 12 and 24 months. The primary outcome is weight change at 12 months from baseline, compared between groups. Secondary outcomes include weight change (24 months) and waist circumference (cm), proportional weight gain (>5 kg), BMI (kg/m 2 ), dietary intake, physical activity, infant feeding and mental health (6, 12 and 24 months, respectively). Economic evaluation examines health service usage and personal expenditure, health-related quality of life and capability wellbeing to assess cost-effectiveness over the trial and modelled lifetime. Cost-utility analysis examines cost per qualityadjusted life-years gained over 24 months. Mixed-method process evaluation explores participants' experiences and contextual factors impacting outcomes and implementation. Stakeholder interviews examine scale-up and implementation.",

      "text": "\u21d2 Trial measures will examine effectiveness outcomes of the intervention, along with cost-effectiveness and process evaluation. \u21d2 Including five trial sites across the four UK countries and using a variety of recruitment pathways are designed to target and recruit a socioeconomically and ethnically diverse population of postpartum women. \u21d2 Home visits by the research team are offered to participants for data collection to facilitate participation in research assessments, helping to overcome barriers to taking part and address issues in participant retention seen in other postpartum trials. \u21d2 Researchers conducting participant recruitment and outcome data collection are blind to group allocation, however, due to the nature of the intervention it is not possible to blind participants to randomisation. \u21d2 The trial design includes an active control comparator to minimise disappointment bias and attrition related to randomisation experienced in previous weight loss intervention trials.\n\nProtected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.\n\nOpen access mass index (BMI) increases many health risks for these mothers and their babies, including gestational diabetes, hypertensive disorders, caesarean section and birth complications, compared with recommended weight women.  [1] [2] 2] [3] [4]  Excessive gestational weight gain and postpartum weight retention are common  5 6  and many women are at risk of further weight gain across the extended postpartum period.  7 By 18 months post partum, about one in five women have moved into a higher BMI category,  6  which increases the risk of complications in subsequent pregnancies and contributes to long-term overweight and obesity.  7 ffective and appropriate weight management interventions in women during the postpartum period, which account for the well-recognised barriers for new mums such as time constraints and childcare, are lacking.  [7] [8] ] [9] [10] [11] [12]  Previous intervention studies are characterised by poor recruitment and high rates of attrition  [13] [14] [15] [16] [17]  and have not adequately considered the difficulties in reaching this population and specific barriers to healthrelated behaviour change that come with having a baby.  [18] [19] 9] [20] [21] [22]  In-person and structured weight management approaches, such as those delivered in community and group settings, are unlikely to be successful with this population due to the commitment required, and such approaches may exacerbate health inequalities.  [23] [24] 4] [25] [26]  More appropriate ways of recruiting and engaging with postpartum women to achieve sustained behaviour change are required  7 13  and a need to evidence cost-effectiveness to inform implementation.  10 ecent evidence, mostly from feasibility or pilot studies, indicates that technology usage shows promise in postpartum weight management, perhaps because this form of delivery fits more seamlessly with women's lives at this stage.  16 27-29 Mobile technologies can offer a more flexible and individualised 'any time, any place' approach to behavioural weight management interventions.  7 Text message interventions have high reach potential and allow for flexible scheduling and interactivity,  30  potentially making them convenient for mums with limited time and helpful for overcoming health inequalities. Systematic reviews support the use of text messaging in behavioural weight management interventions but indicate further evaluation is required.  [31] [32] 2] [33] [34] [35]  They are costeffective and readily scalable for changing other health behaviours.  36 37 he Supporting MumS (SMS) intervention, consisting of a library of text messages, was developed with personal and public involvement (PPI) to support weight management in the postpartum period.  27 Messages focus on diet and physical activity with embedded behaviour change techniques (BCTs) informed by behaviour change theory and evidence. In a previous pilot evaluation, 100 women with overweight or obesity from Northern Ireland (NI) who had a baby within the previous 24 months, were recruited and randomised to receive text messages about weight loss (intervention group) or child health and development (active control) for 12 months. The study demonstrated the feasibility and acceptability of the intervention and an independent trial steering committee (TSC) judged that the prespecified progression criteria to proceed to a full randomised controlled trial (RCT) (ie, successful recruitment, high retention and no differential attrition between groups, high acceptability of the intervention and active control and evidence of positive indicative effects of the intervention) were met.  27"

      "title": "Rationale",
      "text": "This RCT addresses the following research question: Is an automated 12-month text message intervention, designed to support weight loss and weight loss maintenance for postpartum women with overweight or obesity, effective and cost-effective for weight loss at 12 months, compared with an active control group receiving text messages on child health and development?\n\nSMS is a parallel, two-arm multisite RCT using automated and bidirectional text messages to support weight management over a 12-month period in postpartum women with overweight or obesity who have had a baby in the last 24 months, comparing weight change at 12 months from baseline between the intervention and active control groups. This RCT protocol is based on the pilot RCT methodology, but changes were to remove (1)  the use of a sealed pedometer to assess physical activity as this was not acceptable to women and (2) a discussion forum intervention component as it was not used by pilot RCT participants. We added considerations for data collection in the event of COVID-19 restrictions. In moving from a single site pilot study to a multisite RCT recruiting an ethnically and socioeconomically representative sample, we conducted a six month period of intervention and recruitment method adaptation, with PPI, to ensure the broad acceptability and cultural relevance of the messages and to enhance the generalisability of the findings to different groups of women across the UK, thus informing implementation.\n\nThe increased prevalence of obesity, its associated complications and weight management services, is costly to the National Health Service (NHS). NHS costs associated with caring for a pregnant woman with a BMI of \u226525 kg/m 2 are up to 37% higher than caring for a woman with a healthy BMI.  38 Both National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidance  11  and an associated review of the cost-effectiveness of weight management interventions following childbirth,  39  outline the potential of postpartum interventions to be a cost-effective way of reducing the long-term risks of obesity, heart disease, cancer and diabetes, and recommend health professionals should advise women within 2 years of having a baby to eat a nutritious diet and keep active to encourage postpartum weight reduction.  11 40 ostpartum weight management interventions combining dietary and activity behaviour change have moderate positive influence on maternal weight  10 14  and those including self-regulatory BCTs are likely to be more successful.  8 10 The postpartum period could be an Open access ideal time to intervene to shape new health behaviours as women may be motivated and receptive to health information.  41 However, women highlight a need for additional weight management support during the postpartum period as little is currently provided.  42 he present trial allows women to take part up to 24 months post partum. Qualitative evidence suggests that every woman's postpartum journey is different  [19] [20] [21] [22] [23]  and the optimal time to engage women in postpartum weight management is currently unknown.  9 11 Allowing this extended inclusion window accommodates different maternal weight trajectories across this time.  43 44 Furthermore, women may prepare for another pregnancy during this period so there is potential to support better health for subsequent pregnancies.  7 obile phone usage and ownership are widespread (95% of UK households) among all sectors of society, irrespective of socioeconomic status (SES).  31 Text messaging is a simple communication mode that does not require smartphone or tablet technology, unlike web-based interventions or apps. This supports health equity through high reach potential at a low cost, making it conducive with scale-up and implementation, unlike some weight loss interventions which can be resource intensive and expensive  45  and can exacerbate health inequalities.  46 47  text messaging intervention can be delivered flexibly and on a sustained basis, can be reactive and proactive, and does not necessarily rely on participant initiation.  30 48 sing the real-time advantages offered by mobile technologies to deliver behavioural weight management support to postpartum women has the potential to encourage behaviours that may improve maternal health in both the short and long term.  49 Trial results are relevant for other population groups given the possible advantages of this weight management approach. The NHS aims to embrace the potential of digital strategies for improving UK health  50  and text message interventions could complement any weight management support currently delivered across the NHS, to help ease the current burden on an overstretched service.\n\nThe SMS trial adopts a fully automated approach to intervention delivery while still offering feedback to participants. The trial makes a novel and important contribution to the field of behavioural text message interventions in a number of ways: there are currently few such interventions that are fully automated, where text messaging is the main mode of delivery and two-way messaging is used to encourage engagement and delivery of specific BCTs; there are also few which consider both weight loss and weight loss maintenance, last 12 months or more and use an active control to minimise disappointment bias.  27 he National Institute of Health and Care Research (NIHR) awarded further funding to explore postnatal mental health outcomes and need, to inform application of the priorities in the NHS Long Term Plan via existing studies. We added data collection methods related to mental health (postnatal depression, depression and anxiety, mother and child relationships, service and treatment experiences) in February 2022, allowing an opportunity to examine poor postnatal mental health prevalence rates, trajectories, predictors, inequalities and service needs, in an ethnically and socioeconomically diverse sample from all four UK countries. The trial also allows further validity and reliability testing of the Me and My Baby/Me and My Child screening tool  51  which was coproduced by health visitors and the community to assess the mother and child relationship. Funding for this workstream was contracted in March 2022."

We advertise the purpose of the trial as testing two new text message services to minimise women's preference for one group over another.

[55] [56] ] [57] [58]  The intervention focuses on dietary intake and physical activity to address energy balance-related behaviour, with embedded evidence-based BCTs specifically linked to the relevant phases and psychological processes of behaviour change alongside consideration of barriers for this population.  27 he messages adopt a friendly tone including humour to foster engagement and provide information, practical tips and advice including quotes from other mothers. They signpost to external resources and provide encouragement and motivation, discourage guilt and promote self-reflection. A core library of text messages (n=353) to be delivered by the automated system was created. These include a weekly text message asking women to self-weigh and report their weight (n=50) and bidirectional messages to encourage engagement, self-monitoring, relapse prevention and to provide feedback, as follows: (1) 'yes/no' questions (n=36) which trigger an automated response to the participant based on their reply, (2) trigger words ('slip-up', 'crave', 'bad day' or 'tired') which can be texted by women at any time to prompt a reply designed to address these barriers and prevent relapses and (3) during months 7-12 when the focus shifts to maintenance strategies, the weekly text message asking women to report their weight asks them to add the word 'up' or 'down' or 'same' in relation to how their weight compares with the week prior. These keywords trigger an automated response. Responses for bidirectional messages are sent from preloaded message banks and are not individually scripted or tailored.\n\nWomen can also opt-in to receive messages related to weight management when breastfeeding (n=10) or stopping smoking (n=15). These messages are intended to alleviate participant concerns in relation to weight management while breast feeding and to address vulnerabilities around weight gain during smoking cessation."

Participants can choose to block an additional period of the day that they want to be kept message-free, for example, 10:00-17:00 hours.

To have 119 participants completing per site and accounting for a loss to follow-up rate of 15% and higher anticipated pregnancy exclusion rates in areas with greater ethnic diversity, the following site-specific sample sizes were calculated: (1) Belfast, Stirling and Cardiff; 15% pregnancy rate +15% loss to follow-up=170 women, (2) Bradford and London; 22% pregnancy rate +15% loss to follow-up=189 women.

The economic evaluation is conducted from a UK NHS and personal social services perspective with the addition of a societal perspective applied to capture broader impacts, consistent with the UK's NICE guidance for public health economic evaluations.  67 Direct costs to the healthcare system include the intervention implementation costs and any follow-up service use costs. These health and personal perspectives will be assessed to investigate a broader impact of the intervention, including direct cost to participants and indirect costs. Both costs and health outcomes will be discounted at the same annual rate of 1.5% for the reference case, as recommended by the NICE public health methods guidelines.  67 The economic analysis uses a 'multipronged' approach. The total and mean per participant costs for the intervention and control groups will be calculated. A sensitivity analysis will incorporate development costs. Regression analysis, controlling for baseline differences, will be used to estimate the average cost per participant and the average quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) achieved, by group. A costutility analysis will report cost per QALY gained over the 24-month period using the area under the curve approach.  68 esults will be presented on the cost-effectiveness plan and 95% confidence intervals for the incremental costeffectiveness ratio will be determined.  69 Joint uncertainty in costs and outcomes will be represented using a costeffectiveness acceptability curve to present the probability of the SMS intervention being cost-effective for prevailing UK ceiling thresholds for costs per QALY gained.  70 The costeffectiveness analysis will align with the primary outcome, by examining differences in weight and BMI and total costs between treatment groups, the incremental cost per weight gain averted will be calculated. The mean costs and effects for each trial arm will be calculated and presented along with the incremental costs and effects between arms (including 95% confidence intervals).\n\nThe within-trial economic analysis will be carried out for the 24 months follow-up and will form the primary analysis. However, this short time horizon may be insufficient to capture the total costs and benefits related to the intervention. If differences in quality of life or capability well-being are identified, the results will be extrapolated to a lifetime horizon using modelling methods."

We monitor any emerging safety issues or unintended consequences and any participants experiencing such issues will be referred to their GP for appropriate treatment. This includes the onward reporting of EPDS scores of 9 or above (table  1 ). The EPDS is a screening questionnaire used to detect postnatal depressive symptoms and the scale guidance indicates that women with scores meeting this threshold would benefit from further clinical assessment. We calculate scores within 1 week of receiving the completed EPDS at each follow-up time point and letters are sent to the GP and the participant to inform of scores \u22659, as per PIS and consent processes.\n\nPersonal and public involvement* ( * In NI, PPI means personal and public involvement due to integrated health and social care systems. The rest of the UK use 'patient and public involvement' also known as 'patient and public involvement and engagement').\n\nPPI was integral to the pilot study with guidance received on the development of the text message libraries and all trial methods and materials, as previously reported.  27 The design of the present trial mirrors the methods used in the pilot trial. We recruited PPI representatives from Scotland, London and Bradford to conduct a period of trial adaptation (figure  1 ) whereby the library of intervention text messages and trial recruitment materials underwent further PPI to ensure content was acceptable and culturally relevant for women from a range of backgrounds and ethnicities across the UK.\n\nWe have PPI representatives on our PMT and independent TSC to contribute to decision-making throughout the trial and we seek their advice on an ad hoc basis, as matters arise. PPI representatives will help shape the dissemination plan for trial results and will review dissemination materials to ensure communication of findings in an appropriate manner.\n\nPPI work is led by the trial team and conducted and reimbursed according to NIHR guidance for involving the public in research.  71"
