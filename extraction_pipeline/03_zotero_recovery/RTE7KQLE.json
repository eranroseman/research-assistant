  "title": "Engaging Users in the Behavior Change Process With Digitalized Motivational Interviewing and Gamification: Development and Feasibility Testing of the Precious App",
  "abstract": "Background: Most adults do not engage in sufficient physical activity to maintain good health. Smartphone apps are increasingly used to support physical activity but typically focus on tracking behaviors with no support for the complex process of behavior change. Tracking features do not engage all users, and apps could better reach their targets by engaging users in reflecting their reasons, capabilities, and opportunities to change. Motivational interviewing supports this active engagement in self-reflection and self-regulation by fostering psychological needs proposed by the self-determination theory (ie, autonomy, competence, and relatedness). However, it is unknown whether digitalized motivational interviewing in a smartphone app engages users in this process. Objective: This study aimed to describe the theory-and evidence-based development of the Precious app and to examine how digitalized motivational interviewing using a smartphone app engages users in the behavior change process. Specifically, we aimed to determine if use of the Precious app elicits change talk in participants and how they perceive autonomy support in the app. Methods: A multidisciplinary team built the Precious app to support engagement in the behavior change process. The Precious app targets reflective processes with motivational interviewing and spontaneous processes with gamified tools, and builds on the principles of self-determination theory and control theory by using 7 relational techniques and 12 behavior change techniques.",

      "text": "Lifestyle-related diseases, such as cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and cancers, lead to a decrease in quality of life and are the leading causes for years of life lost worldwide  [1] . Stretched health care resources struggle with the complications that could, in many cases, be avoided with a physically active lifestyle  [2, 3] . There is a need for interventions that can effectively support people to achieve the amount of physical activity that is necessary for their health and well-being.\n\nAs a consequence, hundreds of thousands of smartphone health apps have emerged for tracking physical activity. With their interactive features, onboard sensors, and associated wearables, smartphones are a natural tool for tracking and self-monitoring activity  [4, 5] . Individuals tend to carry phones with them and keep them switched on continuously  [6] , use apps repeatedly for brief moments between other activities  [6] , and value this possibility for ubiquitous support  [7] .\n\nTracking physical activity is indeed a key element of many successful physical activity interventions. Self-regulatory behavior change techniques (BCTs)  [8]  related to control theory  [9] , such as self-monitoring, goal setting, action planning, feedback on behavior, and problem solving, have been consistently linked with positive changes in physical activity  [10] . The more actively individuals enact these techniques, the more effective interventions are  [11] [12] [13] [14] .\n\nSmartphone apps have shown promise in reducing sedentary behaviors  [15, 16] , but the evidence for increasing physical activity is modest  [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] . One factor that explains this may be the importance of face-to-face contact for physical activity motivation  [21] . For smartphone apps to achieve the same effectiveness as interventions delivered in person, apps should be engaging enough for users to keep returning to receive the necessary support. However, user commitment to smartphone apps is low: 22% of downloaded apps are opened only once  [22] , and users may spend less time with smartphone apps than computer-delivered interventions  [6, 23] . To engage users and build sustained motivation and commitment in the process of behavior change, apps need to offer more support than just tracking behaviors."

      "title": "Engaging Users in the Behavior Change Process With an App",
      "text": "Engagement in digital interventions is conceptualized in different ways in different research traditions. Within behavioral literature, engagement often refers to the frequency or duration of time spent using a digital service  [24] [25] [26] . This summative engagement, the quantitative metrics of usage time and frequency, is not enough for understanding neither the user experience in the moment-to-moment interaction with the app nor how apps support active involvement in the behavior change process and the intervention goals  [27] [28] [29] . Some studies have found low frequency of usage being as effective as higher frequency  [30] , and increased usage time can even be a symptom of low usability instead of engaging content  [30] .\n\nWithin the usability and gaming literature, engagement is typically conceptualized as the subjective user experience with the service, including affect, interest, attention, and flow  [26] .\n\nStudying user experience can provide information on how immersive an app is but does not typically explain cognitive engagement in the process of behavior change-a health app may be entertaining and have good usability but does not necessarily engage the user to reflect their behavior or make them take steps to approach their goals.\n\nIn this study, we have defined engagement as active involvement with the behavior change process that the app is aiming for. This includes all the steps the user takes toward behavior change, for instance, by reflecting reasons for change or engaging in planning and monitoring of the behavior in question. This concept of engagement with the behavior change process is close to effective engagement, which refers to the level of active involvement that is necessary for the intervention to achieve intended outcomes  [27, 31] .\n\nIt is recognized that the effectiveness of a digital service depends on the target behaviors (one-time action or lifestyle change), the BCTs used, and individuals using the service and their subjective user experience  [26, 31] . We have proposed that the effectiveness of a digital service also depends on the extent to which the individuals get cognitively involved in the process of behavior change: whether interaction with an app encourages users to think about their reasons, capabilities, and opportunities to change and whether the interaction increases their motivation and self-efficacy to change. To examine this concept of active cognitive engagement in the behavior change process, we used the approach widely used in face-to-face behavior change counseling (ie, motivational interviewing)."

      "title": "Motivational Interviewing",
      "text": "Motivational interviewing is a person-centered counseling method that provides practical techniques for improving intervention engagement and commitment to the behavior change process  [32] . In addition to content-focused BCTs, practical tools for self-regulation, motivational interviewing offers tools for the interaction quality between the counselor and the client, suggesting several relational techniques and methods for fostering the alliance and engaging the client in the process  [33, 34] . Core elements of motivational interviewing include resolving ambivalence toward behavior change, eliciting reflection and change talk, individuals' self-expressed language in favor of change, and supporting client autonomy  [32] . Motivational interviewing uses collaborative and nonauthoritarian interaction to work toward clients' goals  [32] .\n\nFace-to-face motivational interviewing and telephone-delivered motivational interviewing have increased exercising and strength training and reduced sedentary time  [35, 36] . A systematic review of technology-delivered adaptations of motivational interviewing showed promise for a variety of health-related behaviors  [37] . However, only two of the computer-based interventions targeted physical activity, and none of the interventions tested smartphone delivery  [37] ."

      "title": "Motivational Interviewing Increases Intervention Engagement",
      "text": "Motivational interviewing can lead to improved health outcomes through enhancing participant adherence and intervention engagement. It has improved engagement with various behavior change intervention components, including attendance to behavioral weight loss programs  [38] , and self-monitoring of food intake and blood glucose  [35] . For instance, improved program attendance has led to more comprehensive self-monitoring diaries, which again have enhanced weight loss outcomes  [39] .\n\nDespite the evidence for improving intervention engagement in face-to-face interventions, motivational interviewing-type motivational support is rarely present in health apps for smartphones. For instance, Pagoto et al  [40]  screened the hundred most popular apps for weight loss and found that none of them provided BCTs for low adherence and motivation.\n\nOne reason for the limited use of motivational interviewing may be its lack of having a coherent theoretical framework, which creates challenges for testing the specific mechanisms of action and linking studies to theoretical discussions in the field  [41] . Thus, the self-determination theory has been suggested as the theoretical basis for the method, as it shares core principles with motivational interviewing  [41] ."

      "title": "Self-Determination Theory",
      "text": "Motivation research leaning on the self-determination theory  [42]  has established that the quality of motivation predicts individuals' physical activity levels  [43, 44] . Individuals with high autonomous motivation are more likely to engage in regular physical activity than those with externally controlled motivations, such as guilt and shame for not being active or pressure from others. Autonomous motivation consists of the following two elements: (1) motivational regulation that is based on the pleasure of the activity itself (ie, intrinsic motivation) and (  2 ) motivational regulation that is guided by goals that are separate from the behavior but in line with the person's values and identity (ie, identified or integrated regulation). Promoting these different forms of autonomous motivation may require different intervention strategies. Individuals are also more likely to engage in active self-regulation when their motivation for physical activity is autonomous  [45] [46] [47] . Self-determination theory-based interventions address autonomous motivation by aiming to satisfy the psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness  [48] .\n\nAutonomy refers to the freedom to organize one's own experiences and behavior in accordance with one's integrated sense of self  [42] . It can be supported by, for instance, offering choice and a meaningful rationale of the relevance of the behavior, by respecting and acknowledging individuals' viewpoints, and by avoiding controlling or guilt-inducing acts and language.\n\nExperiences of competence can be offered through clear instructions and expectations, collaborative goal setting, and optimally challenging tasks, providing tailored strategies and feedback as well as guidance and skills training. Competence is closely related to Bandura's concept of self-efficacy  [49] , which describes an individual's perceptions of their own capabilities to perform a behavior.\n\nRelatedness includes processes that create a meaningful connection, convey understanding, and engage participants with the process  [48] . In addition to actual persons participating or supporting the behavior change, the connection can be experienced with individuals who would benefit from the change (eg, getting fitter to be a better team member or focusing on one's health to have more energy to spend with family). A digital intervention may also provide a sense of relatedness with the service, for instance, through experiencing the good intentions of the people providing the service. Relatedness to the intervention provider may be supported by taking the user's perspective with empathy, displaying appreciation or concern, involving the person, gathering knowledge about the person and paying careful attention to them, dedicating time and energy, and being available when needed  [50] .\n\nSmartphones provide many opportunities for supporting these needs, for instance, by offering accurate and usage-based or sensor-based feedback or by adding fun and motivating challenges with gamified elements  [51] [52] [53] ."

    {
      "title": "Gamification",
      "text": "An increasingly used approach for engaging users in the behavior change process is gamification, which refers to using elements from games, such as points, badges, visualizations, challenges, and surprises, in nongame contexts  [54, 55] . While motivational interviewing provides tools for motivational self-reflection and thus supports the active and conscious fulfillment of psychological needs, gamification can provide experiences of autonomy, competence, and relatedness by adding fun and excitement in the activities  [52] .\n\nEvidence on gamification of behavior change interventions is sporadic because of varying multidisciplinary terminology and a lack of randomized controlled trials  [56] . Some studies show promise in increasing user engagement  [57, 58] , motivation  [58, 59] , and physical activity  [51, 60, 61] . Game mechanisms might also support the use of BCTs: apps with game elements have been found to use more BCTs than health apps in general  [56] . Despite the promise, gamification is still used relatively rarely  [56] .\n\nGame elements do not necessarily require users to reflect on their reasons for behavior, but they typically use intrinsic motivators, such as challenges and surprises, that may provide a spontaneous route to behavior change. For instance, users may engage in goal setting and self-monitoring of physical activity because of visualized goals and achievements instead of health targets. A successful example of this is an augmented reality game, Pok\u00e9mon GO, which did not explicitly target physical activity but increased users' daily steps with the game mechanisms  [51] ."

      "title": "Theoretical Framework for Engaging App Users in the Behavior Change Process",
      "text": "To draw together the range of theories, approaches, and evidence surrounding engagement with apps for behavior change, we propose the framework depicted in Figure  1 . Gamification provides intrinsic pleasure with challenges and surprises. Together, these satisfy the self-determination theory's psychological needs and support autonomous motivation. This increased awareness of the pleasure and benefits of exercise engages users in self-regulation, such as goal setting, planning, and self-monitoring, leading to increased physical activity. The dotted line (Figure  1 ) shows the feasibility testing presented in this study.\n\nWe suggest that apps that support behavior change will be more effective if they engage users in the behavior change process. We characterize the behavior change process with the following three steps: (1) users are autonomously motivated to be physically active either by expecting intrinsic pleasure from the activity or by remembering that the activity supports their values, identity, or personally relevant goals  [48] ; (2) users enact self-regulation techniques, such as goal setting, planning, and self-monitoring  [62] ; and (3) users change their behavior (eg, walk to the supermarket instead of driving).\n\nWe suggest that users are more likely to actively engage in the behavior change process if the app addresses their basic psychological needs: supports their autonomy, creates a sense of relatedness, and provides them with experiences of competence and self-efficacy  [42] . If these needs are met, users will have more motivation and other psychological resources to set challenging goals, make plans, and track their progress  [45] .\n\nThe psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness can be satisfied in two ways. The reflective route encourages users to actively consider their capabilities, opportunities, and the benefits of the behavior (eg, think what kind of physical activity they might enjoy or what they could achieve by being active)  [63] . This self-reflection requires active cognitive engagement with the reflection tasks. Motivational interviewing is suggested as a method for engaging users in this motivational self-reflection because of its focus on building a successful working alliance and supporting engagement in behavior change  [32] . Another pathway to engagement is through gamification. The spontaneous route does not require active self-reflection, as the game mechanisms can satisfy the psychological needs and engage the user in behavior change through intrinsic motivation  [52] . This framework relying on reflective and spontaneous pathways draws from the studies by Hagger and Chatzisarantis and Strack and Deutsch  [64, 65] . A proposed method for engaging users in the behavior change process. Digitalized motivational interviewing techniques help users engage in motivational self-reflection; identify reasons, capabilities, and opportunities for physical activity; and produce change talk. Gamification provides intrinsic pleasure with challenges and surprises. Together, these satisfy the self-determination theory's psychological needs and support autonomous motivation. This increased awareness of the pleasure and benefits of exercise engages users in self-regulation, such as goal setting, planning, and self-monitoring, leading to increased physical activity. The dotted line shows the feasibility testing presented in this study."

We studied user engagement with the motivational interviewing components focusing on two research questions (RQ): RQ1: How did the users discuss autonomy support in the Precious app? This question aimed to understand how users approach autonomy support in smartphone apps and if interacting with the Precious app fulfills the psychological need for autonomy.\n\nRQ2: What kind of change talk did the Precious app elicit in the users, if any? This question aimed to identify whether the motivational interviewing components met their target of engaging users in the behavior change process."

The final design of the Precious app was created through collaborative writing of project deliverables and weekly design meetings with social and behavioral scientists, computer scientists, and usability and graphic designers. The consortium reviewed relevant theory and evidence on behavioral sciences, gamification  [67] , socioeconomic factors, and business models as requested by the European Community's Seventh Framework funding scheme  [68]  and created a system architecture for the overall service  [69] . Each project partner identified the ethical and privacy principles related to their field of responsibility  [70] . Full details on the project, including project publications, are reported  [71] .\n\nThe design of the physical activity arm of the Precious app started by drafting the theoretical framework (Figure  1 ), selecting the key service elements, and inventing ways to address the motivational and self-regulatory variables on a digital platform, through an iterative process of individual and collaborative design  [72] . The systematic development of a motivational interviewing-based computer intervention by Friederichs et al  [73, 74]  served as an inspiration for the motivational tools in the Precious app. The text content and algorithm of the user-specific tailored suggestions were written collaboratively by JN and KK and implemented by TG  [75] ."

The aim of the Precious app is to increase users' daily physical activity by supporting their commitment to the behavior change process: increasing their motivation, self-reflection, self-regulation, and physical activity (Figure  1 ). We used several techniques to reach this aim.\n\nThe Precious app addresses the following two aspects of behavior change: (1) motivating individuals who may not yet see the need for health-enhancing physical activity and (2) providing self-regulation techniques to help translate motivation into physical activity  [45] . The Precious app's tools for motivational self-reflection aim to increase autonomous motivation (eg, awareness of the personally meaningful outcomes of increasing daily physical activity). The self-reflection evoked by motivational interviewing and the personally relevant information on the effects of exercise from the biofeedback sensors aim to support active cognitive engagement with the behavior change process.\n\nIncreased motivation, such as joy of achieving challenges and salience of personally relevant outcomes, can help users to commit to the use of self-regulatory BCTs  [45] . Goal setting, action planning, and self-monitoring will help users to initiate and sustain their activity. Altogether, the Precious app aims to remind users how their psychological needs can be met with physical activity. The functionalities of the Precious app are presented in detail in the following sections."

      "text": "All texts in the Precious app aim to evoke relatedness with the app, drawing from the relational techniques of motivational interviewing and aiming to build an alliance with the user (Table  1 , numbered with the taxonomy  [33] ). The motivational tools aim to create an encouraging environment open for exploration of options. They have been worded with the aim of acknowledging users' efforts and self-worth (T1.2) and emphasizing their autonomy (T3. 16 ). The messages aim to normalize possible motivation deficits and failures in reaching behavioral targets (T3.22). The tools paraphrase users' selections and provide reflective feedback of the selections they had made previously (T1.3). All options are presented as acceptable and as a natural part of the behavior change process (T4.2). The app aims to transmit trust by assuming that users themselves know the options that are best for themselves (T4.5). All app content was written in empathetic and encouraging language, aiming to avoid any directive orders or judgmental feedback that could create guilt, shame, or feelings of being controlled, elements known to predict disengagement with activity  [32, 42] . These relational tools and self-reflection are hypothesized to satisfy the basic psychological needs of the self-determination theory and increase autonomous motivation  [41] . Examples of the self-reflection tasks in each app are presented below.\n\nTable  1  presents the ways motivational interviewing features target relational aspects and service engagement. Open-ended questions aim to guide the user to think of reasons to increase physical activity and the positive changes that it may cause. Guiding users to imagine also supports their autonomy to choose the activities they enjoy \"Imagine yourself being active and enjoying it.

To address the need for autonomy, the basic structure of the app was chosen to consist of freely available tiles (Figure  2 ). Each tile hides a specific app feature or BCT. On the basis of user selections, the service recommends certain tiles on the top of the screen, but all tiles remain available for the user to explore. Users are offered freedom to choose the values that guide them and the ways to achieve their outcome goals and to adjust their behavioral goal each day. The tiled structure also adds flexibility for further use of the platform, as software developers can add new tiles with new features without modifying the original content.\n\nTo offer experiences of competence and self-efficacy, the app notifies the user when approaching the daily step goal and celebrates achievements and service engagement with a notification. The self-regulation features in the Precious app are designed to increase competence by supporting individually tailored goals and comparing users' results with their previous results only (weekly average), not with other users' results. Instead of receiving a standard step goal, users are encouraged to set daily step goals that slightly exceed their current step average. Finally, users are encouraged to think about the good experiences they have had and might have with physical activity, hoping to remind them of times they have felt competent  [75] .\n\nCompetence is also addressed by aiming for an intuitive usability of the app functions, which has been associated with continued service use and higher experience of competence  [76] .\n\nIn addition to the relational techniques (Table  1 ), the need for relatedness is addressed with personalization. The main screen greets users with their name, and the motivational tools specify that recommendations the app provides will be based on their selections. To increase the relevance of the recommendations, algorithms of the Precious app suggest motivational elements to those who do not express interest in tracking or physical activity and self-regulation techniques to those ready to act.\n\nUsers proceed through the motivational tools by swiping the screen as if turning a page in a book. The rules engine of the Precious app was designed to approach the user after recognizing a period of inactivity and to ask whether the user's previous choices still seem relevant or if they would want to reconsider their goals. This way the app is not imposing external requirements to the user but, with their permission, reminding them of their personally valued goals and activities  [77] ."

The planning tool was created for creating detailed activity plans (BCT 1.4) and logging of activities that were performed while not wearing an activity bracelet (BCT 2.3).

These include the graphical presentation of the accumulated steps (mountain) and visual rewards for goal achievement (illustrations of mountain life) that appear randomly after successful goal achievement (by the time of the feasibility testing, only a flag on top of the mountain and a changing color were implemented). Mountain was considered a representation of daily achievement that would be easily understandable for every user and that would add symbolic meaning to the accumulating steps. Goal setting was done by scrolling a digital button on the screen and choosing a certain step goal for the day. The goal setting tool was set to display the mean of the past 7 days' steps when opening the Mountain climber. This was designed to educate users of their typical step amount to encourage reflection of how much activity could be embedded in the day ahead. Late afternoon, users receive feedback in a message providing the percentage of the daily step goal they have achieved to adapt their evening activities and accumulate the missing steps. Consecutive usage days create a panoramic view of user's physical activity, showing possible increases or decreases over time and reminding them of their achievements. (Green tags on Screen A were not visible to users and are included here to indicate the destination screen after a tap action.) Screen B shows the step goal setting function. Screen C shows the action planning function. Action planning and logging are done by choosing an activity from a dropdown menu and setting the start and end time. The user can also adjust the intensity of the activity to either low, medium, or high, the default being medium. For ease of use, action planning is done in the same way as activity logging, with only the time being set in the future. The visual symbol of the planned activity appears in dim grey color, and the steps contribute to the daily total only after the user touches the button \"I did it!\".

Steps per day were chosen as the common metric for presenting physical activity data, as it is readily interpretable and allows for direct comparisons from day to day within an individual. To address the socioeconomic challenges related to the use of digital services  [82] , the Precious app was built as a stand-alone smartphone app, signifying that anyone with an affordable smartphone could use the service without accessories  [83] . For increased physical activity data accuracy, the app can also be connected to external monitoring devices through Bluetooth. For pilot testing of the Precious app, the primary source of physical activity data was a wrist-worn activity bracelet (Xiaomi Mi Band 1S Pulse Bluetooth 4.0 IP67 Waterproof Smart Bracelet)  [84] .\n\nStep counts from the activity bracelet were passed to the app via low-energy Bluetooth at regular 10-min intervals when a connection with the app could be established.\n\nAs users of the Precious app may not always wear their activity bracelet, and as some activities (eg, cycling and weightlifting) are not accurately recorded by wrist-worn accelerometers, users can also manually log their activities. The Mountain climber tool allows users to select a physical activity from a list and to specify the time and intensity of this activity. Knowing a user's height and weight, the Precious app converts the activity to steps using metabolic equivalent (MET) values and the following equation  [85, 86] :\n\nSteps/minute for activity = (MET value of activity \u00d7112.5)/3.5\n\nAs a final source of physical activity data, the Precious app used data collected from the phone's onboard accelerometer and the Google Play Services Fitness application programming interface (API). This allowed for identification of steps taken as well as minutes spent walking, running, cycling, traveling in a vehicle or being sedentary. This source of physical activity data was used in periods where the app was unable to communicate with the activity bracelet, and no physical activities had been manually entered.\n\nWhen amalgamating data from various sources, users' manually entered activities were given the highest priority. Any step counts received from the Mi Band or onboard accelerometer that had timestamps that overlapped with the timestamps of manually entered activities were not added to an individual's total. Steps obtained from the Mi Band were given the second highest priority. Steps obtained from Google Play Services Fitness API were given the lowest priority and were only added to an individual's total in periods in which the Mi Band had not recorded any new step count activity. The aggregation of these three data sources was presented to users in real time, which offers users a comprehensive and realistic picture of how their steps accumulate during the day, how different activities contribute to the whole activity, and how their activity varies daily."

Participants were also requested to ask any questions that came to mind as they explored the app (eg, where they should tap or what does a certain button do), as such questions could help us better understand user experiences  [89] . Participants could freely interact with the Precious app until all content had been explored (usually around 30 min, including the dietary features not presented in this study), and during this time, if a participant stopped thinking aloud or passed several features without commenting on them, the interviewer prompted them by asking what they were thinking.

The method allows for the essential content of the interviews to be captured in themes that describe the data patterns in a summarized form  [91] . First, we analyzed data from each participant individually to remain sensitive to their experience and to detect possible differing themes between participants. Second, themes were synthesized from each participant into a general set of themes. Discussions between three researchers (JN, KK, and AH) led to agreement on the primary themes.\n\nThe theory-driven RQs on change talk (motivational interviewing) and autonomy support (self-determination theory) were analyzed with a deductive approach, aiming to identify any passages that fit these theoretically defined constructs  [91] . Change talk and sustain talk (counter-change talk) were coded following the guidelines of the CLEAR (Client Language EAsy Rating) coding system  [94] . Following the CLEAR guidelines, any factual information of existing behavior was not coded as change talk (eg, \"I walk to work every day\"), and choices made at the ruler tasks were coded as change talk only if there were confirmatory comments  [95] . The excerpts on change talk and autonomy support were analyzed with their semantic meaning, assuming a unidirectional relationship between meaning and experience and language  [91] . After identifying all the change talk-related passages, these excerpts were then coded as specific subtypes of change talk (ie, theory-driven themes)  [91] . Finally, to optimize the usefulness of the results for the reader, all data excerpts on change talk, marked with the theme they represented, were organized and summarized under the respective app functions. Presenting change talk under specific app functions allows the reader to evaluate the tools and techniques that can be reproduced elsewhere, as suggested by O'Halloran et al  [36] ."

In this section, we will discuss the theoretical framework behind the Precious app and the results of the feasibility study on user engagement in behavior change."

      "text": "We developed the Precious app using a theoretical framework (Figure  1 ), which hypothesized that digitalized elements from motivational interviewing  [32]  and gamified elements  [54]  would help to satisfy the basic psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, as suggested by the self-determination theory  [41, 52] . This novel method of combining reflective and spontaneous approaches with motivation and self-regulation has several strengths. This app addresses users with qualitatively different motivation for physical activity and offers support for both reflection of autonomously motivating goals and intrinsically motivating, spontaneous activities. Tailored suggestions provided to users are based on goals, activities, and motivational stages that users have indicated, offering different content to different individuals.\n\nDigitalized motivational interviewing for physical activity has not been previously implemented for smartphones  [37] , although the need for motivational elements in health apps is recognized  [40] . As acknowledged by participants, the Precious app differs from most available health apps, as it does not prescribe goals or behaviors. The choice of exercise as a behavioral strategy (instead of healthy diet, stress management, or sleep hygiene) is made only after a user has decided to aim for an outcome goal that can be achieved through physical activity (Figure  3 ). The relational features such as empathy, normalization, and affirmations may build a safe environment for change that would not be experienced with standard tracking features alone.\n\nThe Precious app's digitalized motivational interviewing features were implemented as seven question-based tools using seven relational techniques. These relational and motivational features were hypothesized to increase users' engagement in the behavior change process by increasing relatedness to the app and facilitating self-reflection and the use of self-regulatory BCTs  [9] , which could help individuals increase health-enhancing physical activity.\n\nHigh intrinsic motivation is the best predictor of sustained physical activity  [44] , but not everyone finds physical activity enjoyable as such. Game-based elements can add intrinsically Control theory-related self-regulatory BCTs were implemented as a Mountain climber tool that uses gamification principles to increase intrinsic motivation for BCT use. The self-regulatory BCTs included daily physical activity goal setting, reviewing behavioral goals, making action plans, self-monitoring, receiving feedback on behavior, perceiving the discrepancy between the current behavior and goal, and prompts to complete the daily step goal. These self-regulatory BCTs have been found to increase both physical activity  [10]  and motivation for physical activity  [21] , and the gamified visualizations may also appeal to users who would not find self-regulation techniques interesting as such."

      "title": "Research Question 1: How did participants discuss autonomy support?",
      "text": "In line with the self-determination theory, participants valued the autonomy supportive features, such as the tailoring of goals, behaviors, and activities, instead of an externally set behavioral target, as seen in previous Web-based interventions  [92, 96] . The amount of choice was generally perceived positively, although a couple of participants questioned the high number of options. Some also expressed concerns that their selections might limit their future options. To answer these concerns, we added tutorials emphasizing that all the app functionalities will stay available despite the personalized suggestions and that the suggestions are based on their selections only, which can be changed at any time.\n\nAs the Precious app was designed around a list of preselected answer options, it could not offer a complete freedom of choice to the users. A digital service needs to find a balance of the freedom given to the user and the amount of content that can be tailored to users' wishes. The more determined the answer options are, the more tailored suggestions can be offered to those specific choices. The more freedom the user has in indicating their preferences, the higher is the risk that the app content will not meet those wishes. It is also not known how accurately users want their ideas to be mirrored. Simply rephrasing users' preferences may not be optimally engaging: One study found an app more engaging when it included recommendations for people resembling the user, instead of recommendations based on personal history only  [97] . One option would be an open platform that the users could use to create content for their own needs, creating their own goals, self-regulation techniques, and feedback systems. This type of tool would focus on offering information on possibilities and rationales of using specific techniques, as is done in the What's next? tool of the Precious app."

    {
      "title": "Research Question 2: What kind of change talk did the Precious app elicit in the users?",
      "text": "Participants engaged actively with the app during the think-aloud interviews, making selections and reflecting their choices in relation to their values and current life situation. They expressed a wide range of change talk: mainly desire, reason, and need, when using the motivational interviewing features, and commitment and taking steps toward change, when using the Mountain climber tool. Considering participants' varying levels of motivation and activity, it is promising that change talk was identified across the full sample. There were very few occasions of sustain talk and ambivalence. This may be a positive indicator about the ability of the Precious app to evoke positive cognitions about physical activity. The Precious app, however, has limited means for exploring possible negative elements related to increased physical activity or positive aspects of maintaining inactivity, which are often identified in face-to-face counseling  [32] . One option for addressing sustain talk would be offering a problem-solving tool with strategies to overcome hurdles, as done by Friederichs et al  [73, 74] . Surprisingly, the Time machine tool for using mental rehearsal of past and future behavior did not elicit change talk during use. As the tool was tested by only two users, it is too early to conclude that this tool would not support other participants. On the basis of a fast pace with which participants advanced through all the Precious app features, more structured guidance (selecting options, typing answers, or listening to instructions) may work better on a smartphone platform than a list of open questions and imagination tasks.\n\nAnalyses of the think-aloud walk-throughs underlined how making selections while using the app is part of the discourse on change or a form of implicit change talk. The CLEAR coding system, used for recognizing change talk  [94] , suggests that when participants select numbers with tools such as the Importance and Confidence rulers, change talk should only be coded if the participant provides a verbal qualifier for the number. At the first stages of analysis, we aimed to extend this principle to all the interactions with the Precious app, analyzing only clear oral statements. Soon, we discovered that participants' selections were so embedded in the discourse that including interactions with the service was indispensable to get an accurate picture of the participants' thought processes.\n\nThe implicit change talk (ie, making selections that indicate exercise intentions) may differ from change talk that is elicited verbally in interactions with a coach or counselor. Miller and Rollnick  [32]  point out the difference of reactions when just thinking about questions silently, writing down the answers, or saying them to someone else. Although interacting with an app might not fully correspond to a face-to-face counseling, our results indicate that users can be encouraged to actively reflect options with a digital service. However, it should be noted that the think-aloud walkthrough procedures were undertaken in the presence of a researcher, which might have affected participants' reactions.\n\nOffering a service with relational elements and tailored feedback may exceed the impact of simply writing down an answer, but it is possible that the relatedness experienced with the service moderates this effect so that the more strongly the user feels an app is an active, responsive body in the interaction, the stronger the impact of the intervention is. The more autonomous and interactive digital services become, the more users may feel responsible for and committed to the actions negotiated with them. Getting users to select answers on their personal choices, values, and achievements may also increase their engagement with the app via activating users' representations of their identity and self-image. In gaming research, players have experienced digital games to be most intrinsically motivating when their gaming experiences have been congruent with their ideal selves  [98] ."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "The think-aloud interviews only assessed a brief (30-60 min) use of the Precious app features. Participants did not have the chance to see how their physical activity accumulates over time or how the app's feedback messages depend on their goal progress. Thus, the interview only provided information on participants' initial reactions to the app's motivational and self-regulatory features. For this reason, despite studying perceived autonomy support, the interviews did not address the two other basic needs of the self-determination theory (ie, competence and relatedness), as we hypothesized these to increase through regular use of the app, with the rules engine providing encouragement and feedback on behavior. Similarly, the gamified elements can only be studied after extended use in the natural environment.\n\nThe features of the Precious app were still being developed through the feasibility interview phase, meaning that some features were available for the last interviewees only. What's next?, Time machine, and Confidence ruler were tested by only two participants because of late implementation. As is typical for pilot studies  [27] , the sample size is a potential limitation for generalizing the results to a wider population. Future studies could use larger samples of individuals of a certain age, activity level, or technology literacy to provide a broader representation of different types of users."

      "text": "Interaction with technology needs further focus on the behavioral sciences. Despite the relational nature of motivational interviewing, studies offering digital motivational interviewing features rarely discuss how accurately it can be delivered with technology and how complexities related to digitalization of motivational interviewing might be addressed  [37] . Current definitions of BCTs primarily relate to interactions between humans  [8] . In future work, we need to define if digital services can be considered active participants in interactions. For instance, considering the technique Review behavior goal(s) jointly with the person  [8] , is the reviewing done jointly if it is suggested by a digital tool or a chatbot and is a digital service with relational elements able to provide Social rewards? [8] . These questions need addressing when artificial intelligence becomes increasingly widespread: at what point does an interactive, chatbot-type service start to be a companion in decision making?\n\nThe current implementation of the app is mostly text based. Several elements of gamification could be taken further, for instance, the Time machine tool offers a rich platform for visual elements that would enhance the user experience  [80] . However, adding complex graphics does not automatically increase user engagement, and text-based elements have been found as effective in increasing physical activity as a digital avatar  [99] .\n\nIn addition, the level of service customization is currently tied to the user's time and patience to fill in self-evaluations. Evolving technologies offer increasing opportunities to automatically detect and tailor to user emotions [100], depression [101], stress [102], and even sarcasm  [103] . Within the Precious app project, the use of social media posts for mood detection was examined but was not included in the current version  [104] . These techniques offer promise, but more evidence is needed, whether gamified or chatbot-type interactive content engages users more in the behavior change process than text-based solutions."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "This paper described the development and feasibility testing of the Precious app. We suggested that an app can support engagement in the behavior change process through two pathways: encouraging active reflection of users' motivations, capabilities, and opportunities for physical activity and providing gamified elements with challenges and fun. Both pathways can satisfy users' psychological needs of autonomy, competence, and relatedness, increase their autonomous motivation, and support their self-regulation.\n\nThe novelty of the Precious app is in providing relational support and addressing both reflective and spontaneous ways of motivating users. The Precious app aims to support an active cognitive engagement with the behavior change process using reflection tasks. The app builds relatedness with relational techniques from motivational interviewing and by supporting basic psychological needs described in the self-determination theory. Gamification elements include the self-regulation tool, which helps users to set goals, make plans, and monitor their progress with a mountain visualization. To collect and present physical activity data accurately, the app aggregates data from several sources: activity bracelets, smartphone sensors, and self-reports. The app consists of independent tools that can be switched on and off, enabling tailoring of personalized suggestions and testing specific intervention elements in a controlled way.\n\nThe feasibility interviews of the digitalized motivational interviewing features revealed that participants value personalization options, but the app also needs to clearly communicate how the information collected from users will be used for recommendations and tailoring and which choices users are able to change later. During the think-aloud interviews, motivational app features elicited change talk on needs, reasons, and desires to change, whereas self-regulatory features elicited commitment and taking steps toward change types of change talk. This active engagement in self-reflection can be perceived as a proxy for engagement in the first steps of the behavior change process. The fast pace with which users typically advanced through the app suggests that smartphone-based Apps supporting behavior change need to engage users in the behavior change process. Feasibility tests with the Precious app suggest that this can be done by addressing users' psychological needs and by supporting active self-reflection. The impact of specific intervention elements on individuals' self-regulation and daily physical activity over time will be tested in a series of N-of-1 field studies [105]."
