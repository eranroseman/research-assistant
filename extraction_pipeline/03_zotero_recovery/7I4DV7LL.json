  "title": "Common Dyadic Coping Mediates the Associations Between We-Disease Appraisal and Relationship Satisfaction and Quality of Life in HIV Serodiscordant Couples: The Common Fate Mediation Model",
  "abstract": "Background Since HIV has evolved into a lifelong but manageable condition, improving the quality of life (QoL) of persons living with HIV (PLWHs) has become increasingly important. Living with HIV is life-altering and poses substantial challenges for both PLWHs and their partners, so identifying how HIV serodiscordant couples cope with HIV together is crucial. Here, Bodenmann's Systemic Transaction Model highlights common dyadic coping (CDC), which refers to both partners working together to alleviate the negative effects of stress. Purpose We examined the mediating role of CDC in linking we-disease appraisal with relationship satisfaction and QoL. \n Methods We recruited a convenience sample of 231 HIV serodiscordant couples via local grassroots organizations between June and October 2022. Participants completed measures of we-disease appraisal, CDC, relationship satisfaction, and QoL. We examined the mediation effect of CDC on the association between we-disease appraisal and outcomes using the common fate mediation model. \n Results The mean age of PLWHs was 32.18 years (standard deviation = 8.61 years), and that of their partners was 32.55 years (standard deviation = 9.24 years). The average time since HIV diagnosis was 4.18 years. Most couples were same-sex male couples. We found that CDC mediated the effect of we-disease appraisal on relationship satisfaction. Moreover, CDC significantly mediated the effect of we-disease appraisal on the QoL of PLWHs and their partners. \n Conclusions Our findings highlight the importance of CDC in dyadic illness management among Chinese HIV serodiscordant couples. \n Lay summary Numerous studies have shown that HIV serodiscordant couples may face HIV-related stress as a unit. Yet, it is not clear how the appraisal of HIV as a shared illness (i.e., we-disease appraisal) may influence relationship satisfaction and both partners' quality of life (QoL) via common dyadic coping (CDC) behaviors (e.g., collaboration). In this study, we collected data from 231 HIV serodiscordant couples. Participants completed reports of how they appraise HIV as a we-disease, their CDC behaviors, and their relationship satisfaction and QoL. We found that we-disease appraisal was positively associated with CDC, which in turn was positively associated with relationship satisfaction and both partners' QoL. Future couple-based interventions should incorporate psycho-educational components to raise awareness about we-disease appraisal, as well as skill-building components to encourage the use of CDC in clinical settings.",

      "text": "HIV continues to have devastating health effects worldwide, with 1.5 million people newly infected with HIV and around 38.4 million people living with HIV (PLWH) in 2021  [1] . However, after starting antiretroviral therapy, PLWHs have a similar life expectancy as the general community  [2] . Since HIV is no longer a fatal illness but has evolved into a lifelong but manageable condition  [3] , improving and ensuring the quality of life (QoL) of PLWHs have become increasingly important in recent years. Scholars have even advocated the \"fourth 90\" treatment target to be the QoL target for PLWHs, extending the continuum-of-services paradigm beyond the current treatment endpoint of immune reconstitution and viral suppression  [4] .\n\nLiving with HIV is a life-altering experience, posing substantial challenges for not only PLWHs but also their partners  [5] . For example, cross-partner HIV transmission, the negotiation of sexual relationships, couple-level stigma, and the disclosure of HIV serodiscordancy to others are particular challenges for HIV serodiscordant couples  [6] [7] [8] . Since HIVrelated experience can be regarded as both indirect stress (e.g., stress contagion from the PLWH to their HIV-partner)  [9]  and direct dyadic stress (e.g., couple-level stigma)  [10] , treating HIV serodiscordant couples as a unit during illness management may be more effective for maintaining their relationship and the QoL of both partners  [11, 12] .\n\nThe concept of dyadic coping is useful in comprehending the challenges that couples dealing with chronic illnesses such as HIV face. This construct encapsulates a systemic approach to coping, which involves explicit or implicit stress communication from partner A, a coping response from partner B, and how partner A perceives the responsiveness of partner B  [13] . According to the Systemic Transaction Model  [13] , dyadic coping is not a simple combination of partners A and B's individual coping but a transaction process wherein both partners adopt coping strategies, aiming not only to help the stressed person but also to maintain relationship functioning  [13, 14] . Regarding relationship satisfaction as an outcome, a recent meta-analysis revealed that dyadic coping is positively associated with marital satisfaction among couples living with medical conditions (r = .35) [15] . However, the literature on individual outcomes (e.g., QoL) has shown contradictory findings, with some studies suggesting the beneficial roles of dyadic coping, wherein patients report a higher QoL, and other studies failing to find these benefits  [16] .\n\nThe existing literature has limitations. First, dyadic coping is a multidimensional construct that comprises three positive dyadic coping strategies and two negative dyadic coping strategies  [17] , with varying effect sizes between each dimension and the outcome  [15, 18] . Therefore, calculating an average or total score may cause the heterogeneity of each dimension to be ignored. Among the dyadic coping strategies, common dyadic coping (CDC) denotes the collaborative efforts of two partners to mitigate the detrimental effects of stressful events and incorporates emotional-based strategies (e.g., showing affection to each other, helping each other to relax) and problem-based strategies (e.g., helping one another to put the problem in perspective and see it differently, searching for solutions together). CDC is distinct from other dyadic coping strategies (i.e., unidirectional coping) since it reflects a collaborative effort to cope with shared stress  [13] , which might be more adaptive in clinical settings (e.g., cancer). For example, a systemic review and meta-analysis found that CDC is positively associated with relationship quality (r = .42) and emotional functioning (r = .13) in couples coping with cancer, whereas the effect sizes were smaller (r = .17-.14) for the associations between other dyadic coping strategies and relationship quality  [18] . However, the findings from this meta-analysis were inconclusive due to the limited number of eligible studies included (N = 2-4). The researcher also did not report the aggregated effect sizes between other dyadic coping strategies and emotional functioning due to the same issue. However, in a large longitudinal study (N = 538), CDC outperformed all other dyadic coping strategies in predicting marital quality and mental health among couples living with breast cancer  [19] . Since HIV may be transmitted from a PLWH to their partner  [20] , and they may both face HIVrelated stigma as a unit  [21] , it is crucial to explore whether these dyadic stressors mobilize the use of couple resources (e.g., CDC) to better adjust to the illness.\n\nSecond, very few empirical studies have examined the antecedents of dyadic coping, which may have impeded the in-depth understanding of dyadic coping. Recent studies have identified some individual-level psychological constructs that may serve as antecedents for dyadic coping in clinical settings (e.g., self-efficacy  [22] , fear of illness progression  [22] , perceived stress  [23] , and resilience  [24] ). However, these studies were limited to individual-level antecedents. The term \"we-disease\" refers to the appraisal of an illness as a shared stressor and the consequent joint efforts that both partners make to manage the illness  [25] [26] [27] . A qualitative study found that some couples coping with breast cancer viewed their stress as \"ours\" (i.e., a shared experience), discussing how breast cancer had changed their lives as a couple and how they transitioned from using individualistic coping strategies to mutual coping strategies  [25] . A few studies have directly examined how couples' appraisals of illness ownership (i.e., we-disease appraisal) influence their illness adjustment  [28, 29] . For example, a recent study conducted with couples coping with diabetes found that we-disease appraisal and collaboration are independently linked to support interactions and better mood  [28] . However, it remains uncertain whether CDC can mediate the link between we-disease appraisal and relationship satisfaction and QoL. Furthermore, unlike cancer or diabetes, HIV can be transmitted between partners. As a result, HIV is likely to be appraised as a \"we-disease,\" and coping effectively with the illness (e.g., achieving viral suppression) can benefit both partners, which can result in improved health outcomes for both individuals and the potential enhancement of their sexual experiences, ultimately leading to greater relationship satisfaction. Therefore, HIV provides an ideal context for assessing the mediating mechanism of CDC, which links we-disease appraisal with adjustment outcomes.\n\nThird, most empirical studies have adopted the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM) to investigate the association between dyadic coping and adjustment outcomes in couples living with chronic illness. However, not all variables are theoretically appropriate to test at the individual level. Although family and relationship scholars have often posed dyadic-level research questions, they have tended to conduct statistical analyses at the individual level  [30] . The Common Fate Model (CFM) offers an alternative to the APIM since it assumes that two partners can be affected by a common relational latent variable  [31] . That is, there are two types of common drives that affect both partners: common shared external forces (e.g., quality of housing) and common relational factors (e.g., we-disease appraisal, CDC, and relationship satisfaction in this study)  [31, 32] . On the other hand, the APIM assumes that the interdependence among couples is driven by the direct effect of a person's predictor on the partner's outcomes (i.e., the partner effect), controlling for the effect on their own outcomes (i.e., the actor effect)  [31] . In practice, the choice of statistical models (CFM vs. APIM) depends on how we measure the construct and the research questions. One major consideration is the wording of the scale items. If the variable measures a relationship as an object (e.g., We both tell each other how we feel), and two partners report on the same variable, the variable is best modeled as common fate  [31] . However, if the reports of a construct are self-referential and evaluate one's own status (e.g., QoL), it may not be appropriate to model the variable as common fate. Hence, while data may be available for both members' levels of QoL, and their reports are likely to be correlated, the variable is not at the dyadic level of measurement and may be better suited for the APIM  [30] . Therefore, in the current investigation, we conceptualized we-disease appraisal, CDC, and relationship satisfaction as common fate variables, as they assessed the relationship as an object, with both partners reporting on the same construct. Contrastingly, QoL was operationalized as a manifested and observable variable. Furthermore, due to the growing interest in dyadic-level mediation, scholars have started employing the common fate mediation model (CFMeM)  [33] , an extension of the CFM. One noteworthy example of this is the work of \u0130nce and I\u015f\u0131k  [34] , who adopted the CFMeM to explore the effect of differentiation of the self on relationship satisfaction through the mediating role of love language.\n\nBased on the aforementioned dyadic coping models and limitations of previous empirical evidence, we assumed that CDC may act as a mediator in linking we-disease appraisal with both relationship satisfaction and QoL. To this end, we proposed the following theoretical framework using the CFMeM, with CDC serving as the potential mediator. More specifically, we hypothesized that: (i) CDC mediates the association between we-disease appraisal and relationship satisfaction at the dyadic level (H1); (ii) CDC mediates the association between we-disease appraisal and the QoL of PLWHs (H2a) and the association between we-disease appraisal and the QoL of partner (H2b)."

      "text": "This study comprised 231 couples, wherein one partner was living with HIV while the other was HIV-. The sample consisted of 178 male-male (i.e., HIV+ male and HIV-male) couples, 15 female-male (i.e., HIV+ female and HIV-male) couples, and 38 male-female couples (i.e., HIV+ male and HIV-female) couples. We recruited our convenience sample via local grassroots organizations from eight major cities (i.e., Beijing, Changsha, Chengdu, Chongqing, Guangzhou, Shenyang, Shenzhen, and Urumqi) with a high prevalence of HIV in China between June and October 2022. Some of the grassroots organizations were in close collaboration with local hospitals that specialized in infectious diseases (e.g., HIV), while others collaborated with local disease control centers. The recruitment methods included online posting, peer referrals, flyers, and snowball sampling. Eligibility criteria for participation as a PLWH included the following: being (i) clinically diagnosed with HIV, (ii) aged over 18 years, (iii) in a committed relationship with one's current partner for at least 6 months, (iv) able to understand Chinese, and (v) willing to join the survey with their partner. Eligibility criteria for participation as partners included the following: being (i) self-reported HIV-, (ii) aged over 18 years, (iii) in a committed relationship with a PLWH for at least 6 months, (iv) able to understand Chinese, and (v) willing to join the survey with their PLWH. Site staff screened all participants for eligibility, and participants provided informed consent to the site staff. Out of the 263 couples that the site staff reached, 16 (6.3%) declined to participate because one partner was unwilling to, 13 (6.1%)\n\nwere not eligible because both partners were self-reported seropositive or seronegative, and three (1.1%) were not eligible because their relationship duration was shorter than 6 months. Participants completed the survey via an online platform (i.e., Wenjuanxing), and it took around 20 min to complete. We trained staff from local grassroots organizations to oversee the entire process of the study. Once couples were recruited, the local staff sent one dyadic member a unique participant ID and QR code and checked the quality after this member completed the questionnaire. The same process was then repeated with the other dyadic member of the couple. Finally, the local staff cross-checked the two questionnaires to ensure that they had not been completed using the same cellphone and that the response patterns were different. We could minimize the likelihood of the nonindependent completion of the questionnaires by taking these measures. Furthermore, each couple received an incentive of 100 yuan (15 US dollars) for completing the survey. The Institutional Review Board of City University of Hong Kong approved this study."

Notably, educational level was categorized as below college versus college or above, ethnicity as Han versus non-Han, current CD4+ T cell counts based on the most recent physical examination results as greater than or equal to 500 cells/mL versus fewer than 500 cells/mL, current HIV viral suppression status based on the most recent physical examination results as detectable versus undetectable, the type of couple as same-sex male couples versus female (PLWH)-male (partner) couples versus male (PLWH)-female (partner) couples.

      "text": "We used SPSS 20 for the descriptive analyses and bivariate associations of the study variables. First, we performed mixed design analyses of variance using the type of relationship (male+/male-vs. female+/male-vs. male+/female-) as a between-couple factor and their role (PLWH vs. partner) as a within-couple factor for the measures of we-disease appraisal, CDC, relationship satisfaction, and QoL. Then, we examined the mediation role of CDC using the CFMeM. The CFMeM offered a conceptual and statistical framework to account for shared latent variables inherent to dyadic concepts. The theoretical assumptions of the CFMeM were that (i) two partners are influenced by a common latent variable, (ii) mediation occurs and should be modeled at the dyadic level, and (iii) the measurements from both partners are reliable indicators of common fate  [31, 33] . Figure  1  shows the conceptual framework of the CFMeM for this study. We used we-disease appraisal as an independent variable, CDC as a mediator, and relationship satisfaction and QoL as outcomes. We then regressed the PLWH's dependent variable and mediator on their own covariates and couple-level covariates (i.e., type of couple) while regressing HIV-partners' dependent variable and mediator on their own covariates and couplelevel covariates (i.e., type of couple). Moreover, we modeled we-disease appraisal, CDC, and relationship satisfaction as common fate (latent) variables and QoL as a manifest variable for each member of the couple. For mediation analysis, we examined the paths using the joint-significance test. If both component paths of the mediation effect were significant, then we concluded that there existed a significant mediation effect  [43] . Next, we examined the magnitude and 95% confidence interval (CI) of the mediation effect using a 1,000 times bias-corrected bootstrap  [43] . We adopted four indices, including the comparative fit index (CFI >0.95), Tucker-Lewis index (TLI >0.95), root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA <0.06), and standardized root mean square residual (SRMR <0.08), to assess the model fit  [44] . We adopted the R package Lavaan to run two CFMeM analyses  [45] ."

      "text": "To our knowledge, this was the first study to examine the effect of we-disease appraisal on dyadic adjustment (i.e., relationship satisfaction) and individual adjustment (i.e., QoL) via CDC in the context of HIV. Using an innovative statistical model, the CFMeM, we examined the mediating role of CDC in linking we-disease appraisal with relationship satisfaction, as well as linking we-disease appraisal with QoL. This study found that CDC significantly mediated the association between we-disease appraisal and relationship satisfaction at the dyadic level. Moreover, CDC significantly mediated the associations between we-disease appraisal and the QoL of PLWHs and we-disease appraisal and the QoL of partners. Confirming H1, our findings show that we-disease appraisal is significantly associated with a higher level of CDC, which, in turn, is significantly associated with a higher level of relationship satisfaction at the dyadic level. First, our findings supported the theoretical assumption that we-disease appraisal is the key driver of the initiation of CDC  [42, 46] . Second, previous studies have found robust evidence showing that CDC is associated with relationship satisfaction for partners in both clinical settings and the community  [15, 18] . CDC fosters the less-threatening appraisal of an illness and encourages the use of more coping resources, thus enhancing relationship satisfaction  [13, 42] . Third, relationship satisfaction may play a dual role in intimate relationships by serving as both a predictor and an outcome of CDC  [47] . Future longitudinal cohort studies should assess the temporal and bidirectional associations between these constructs in intimate relationships. Fourth, both the direct effect of we-disease appraisal and the mediation effect were significant. Additionally, we found that the proportion of the total effect mediated by CDC was 45.2%. This implies that CDC partially mediates the relationship between we-disease appraisal and relationship satisfaction. Aside from CDC, other relational factors such as mutual trust and openness may mediate this dyadic-to-dyadic-level association. Future studies should, therefore, explore other relational factors as mediators and use parallel mediation models to compare their relative weights.\n\nConfirming H2a and H2b, our findings show that we-disease appraisal is significantly associated with a higher level of CDC, which, in turn, is significantly associated with a higher level of QoL for PLWHs and partners. QoL is a multidimensional construct, encapsulating psychological, physical, social, and environmental subdomains  [41] . Our findings support the idea that CDC may have multifold beneficial effects among PLWHs and their partners. However, we should be cautious about the generalizability of our findings. Since the PLWHs in our sample were relatively healthy (i.e., not hospital patients), and the care burden for their partners was low, our findings may not be generalizable to PLWHs at severe illness stages and partners with a high care burden. Furthermore, CDC may not always be adaptive and relieving; it may instead be a stressor for partners when focusing exclusively on patients' needs  [48]  or when resources are scarce due to the severity of the disease  [49] . However, these counter-intuitive findings were mainly drawn from couples coping with cancer and couples with general stress  [48] [49] [50] [51] . Nevertheless, future studies should also recruit PLWHs at more severe illness stages (e.g., WHO stage four) to assess the potential moderation effect of illness severity on these associations using the CFMeM (e.g.,  [52] ). Furthermore, neither the direct effect of we-disease on the QoL of PLWHs nor the direct effect on the QoL of partners was significant, whereas both mediation effects were significant. Moreover, the proportion of the total effect mediated by CDC was 86.1% for the QoL of PLWHs and 45.2% for the QoL of partners. According to the guideline that Kenny et al. proposed (i.e., \"if one wants to claim complete mediation, ab/c should be at least 0.80\")  [53] , CDC completely mediated the association between we-disease appraisal and the QoL of PLWHs, with an effect size larger than 80%. Contrastingly, CDC only partially mediated the association between we-disease appraisal and the QoL of partners. Therefore, while CDC appears to be a dominant dyadic-level mechanism for we-disease appraisal and the QoL of PLWHs, other partner-specific mechanisms such as caregiving responsibilities and experience may play a role in the QoL of partners  [54] . Overall, these results suggest that CDC can act as a promising bridge between dyadic-level associations and individual-level outcomes.\n\nSeveral limitations of the present study should be addressed. First, our results were obtained in a cross-sectional study, which precludes drawing conclusions about temporality and directionality. A longitudinal study using multiple waves of measurement is warranted to specify the dynamics of the dyadic coping process.\n\nSecond, our sample was dominated by younger, Han, malemale couples with a short relationship and diagnosis duration, making the results ungeneralizable beyond the current sample. Moreover, our findings may not be generalizable to other illnesses (e.g., cancer). HIV primarily affects marginalized communities such as sexual minorities or drug users, while other chronic illnesses are more likely to affect the majority  [55] . Given this, HIV serodiscordant couples may have limited access to social or institutional resources compared with couples coping with other illnesses  [56] . Moreover, compared with other illnesses, HIV is a couple-level issue, characterized by potential transmission, couple-level stigma, sexual relationship negotiation, and HIV disclosure in HIV serodiscordant couples  [57] . HIV serodiscordant couples may rely more on dyadic resources, such as we-disease appraisal and CDC, while couples coping with other illnesses may have more diverse resources available  [58] . Therefore, we assumed that the use of we-disease appraisal and CDC may be higher in HIV serodiscordant couples than in couples living with other chronic illnesses. Furthermore, these dyadic resources can be especially important for illness adjustment in HIV serodiscordant couples. In the future, it would be helpful to extend this study and examine these assumptions in couples with diverse demographics, clinical stages, or other illnesses.\n\nMoreover, since our sample was dominated by malemale couples, our findings may have been biased. The small group sizes of female+/male-and female-/male+ disallowed group comparisons. Previous studies have found that gay couples utilize higher levels of dyadic coping compared with opposite-sex relationship couples  [57] , and gay couples may benefit more from dyadic coping behaviors than heterosexual couples  [59] . Therefore, future studies are needed to replicate this study and discover any group differences. Moreover, the descriptive data suggest that the average relationship duration was slightly longer than the average diagnosis duration. Future studies may explore whether we-disease appraisals are more likely to occur in relationships that begin before or after HIV diagnosis.\n\nFourth, since race and gender are two interconnected social identities, future dyadic studies should be designed within the theoretical framework of intersectionality  [60] . It is important for researchers to acknowledge the complexity of social identities and how they intersect, particularly in the context of HIV management. By using an intersectional approach, researchers will be better able to understand the unique experiences of individuals with multiple identities and how these experiences may differ from those with only one identity. This can lead to more targeted interventions and policies that are better tailored to the needs of diverse populations.\n\nFifth, since our sample was collected during the COVID-19 pandemic, our findings may have been confounded by COVID-19 contextual variables. For example, uncertainty about COVID-19 is associated with increased levels of stress and anxiety among young PLWHs and directly affects their mental well-being  [61] . Future studies should consider how the \"big era\" (e.g., the pandemic era) affected individuals' and couples' lives.\n\nOur study provides a compelling example of how illness management occurs within the context of HIV serodiscordant couples. Our findings offer empirical support for Bodenmann's Systemic Transaction Model  [27] , which was originally designed for nonclinical couples navigating everyday stressors, and extends the model to clinical populations. We also provide empirical support for the notion that we-disease appraisal is a key agent in navigating dyadic resources in HIV serodiscordant couples  [25, 26] . Understanding how dyadic and individual mechanisms (e.g., dyadic and individual coping styles) interact in predicting the QoL of both partners is a fascinating area for further investigation.\n\nIn summary, this research provides new knowledge about the dyadic illness management of couples living with HIV due to its collection of dyadic data and application of theoretically appropriate dyadic approaches (i.e., the CFMeM). Moreover, the present study considered both dyadic and individual outcomes to capture important psychosocial indicators. Our findings illustrate a robust mediational process between we-disease appraisal and adjustment outcomes via CDC, suggesting that couple-based interventions should incorporate psycho-educational components to raise awareness about we-disease appraisal, as well as skill-building components to encourage the use of CDC in clinical settings."
