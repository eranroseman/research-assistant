  "title": "Patent and Bibliometric Analysis of the Scientific Landscape of the Use of Pulse Oximeters and Their Prospects in the Field of Digital Medicine",
  "abstract": "This study conducted a comprehensive patent and bibliometric analysis to elucidate the evolving scientific landscape surrounding the development and application of pulse oximeters, including in the field of digital medicine. Utilizing data from the Lens database for the period of 2000-2023, we identified the United States, China, the Republic of Korea, Japan, Canada, Australia, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom as the predominant countries in patent issuance for pulse oximeter technology. Our bibliometric analysis revealed a consistent temporal trend in both the volume of publications and citations, underscoring the growing importance of pulse oximeters in digitally-enabled medical practice. Using the VOSviewer software(version 1.6.18), we discerned six primary research clusters: (1) measurement accuracy; (2) integration with the Internet of Things; (3) applicability across diverse pathologies; (4) telemedicine and mobile applications; (5) artificial intelligence and deep learning; and (6) utilization in anesthesiology, resuscitation, and intensive care departments. The findings of this study indicate the prospects for leveraging digital technologies in the use of pulse oximetry in various fields of medicine, with implications for advancing the understanding, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of cardio-respiratory pathologies. The conducted patent and bibliometric analysis allowed the identification of technical solutions to reduce the risks associated with pulse oximetry: improving precision and validity, technically improved clinical diagnostic use, and the use of machine learning.",

Masimo is an American company founded in 1989 that manufactures devices for non-invasive patient monitoring, including pulse oximeters. Based on earnings growth, revenue growth, and return on equity, As shown by the patent analysis of innovative solutions for creating pulse oximeters, Masimo is one of the leading development companies. Masimo is an American company founded in 1989 that manufactures devices for non-invasive patient monitoring, including pulse oximeters. Based on earnings growth, revenue growth, and return on equity, Forbes included Masimo in its list of the 20 biggest billion-dollar public corporations in 2011. Joe Kiani, founder of the company, was honored with the Ernst and Young National Entrepreneur of the Year Award and the Life Sciences Award in 2012. In the development and marketing of non-invasive patient-monitoring devices, Kiani was recognized for \"revolutionizing the healthcare business\"  [32] . Masimo received patents for pulse oximeters for different end consumers.\n\nUsing the example of a number of leading developers, we will consider the directions for creating technical solutions in the field of pulse oximeters.\n\nThe analysis revealed multiple classifications of pulse oximeters. Transmission and reflectance pulse oximeters are currently used in clinical practice. Their work is based on the ability of blood hemoglobin to absorb light emitted from the LED of various wavelengths, which is scattered, reflected by tissues and blood, and reaches the photodetector.\n\nDepending on the end-user, there are a number of pulse oximeters (stationary, portable, for home use, pediatric pulse oximeters, etc.), each of which has its own purpose and features of use.\n\nIn a stationary version, pulse oximeters are often integrated into more complex devices (patient monitors, ventilators). Devices of this class are complex systems with extensive functionality. Most of the patient's monitors are equipped with a large graphic screen, which displays current information about the patient's condition: blood pressure, a cardiogram in real time, saturation value, and a photopletismogram of blood flow in the body site to which the sensor is attached. Stationary pulse oximeters are used exclusively in medical institutions and work from the electrical grid. These are the largest of all pulse oximeters, but they typically provide the highest accuracy. They are used during operations, in intensive care, and during critical procedures.\n\nFor example, Masimo has developed and implemented the Root with O3 Regional Oxymetry Stationary Device for use in adults, children, infants, and newborns for cerebral and somatic monitoring. The patent protection of the device is comprehensive, including protection of the following inventions: \"Dual-mode pulse oximeter\" (US6770028  [33] ); \"Low power pulse oximeter\" (US7295866  [34] ), \"Pulse oximeter probe-off detector\" (US7471969  [35] ), \"System and method for monitoring the life of a physiological sensor\" (US7880626  [36] ), \"Robust alarm system\" (US7962188  [37] ), \"Virtual display\" (US7990382  [38] ), \"Plethysmograph pulse recognition processor\" (US7988637  [39] ), \"Pulse oximetry data confidence indicator\" (US8046040  [40] ), and others  [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] . The Root with O3 Regional Oximetry device can help doctors monitor brain oxygenation.\n\nPortable pulse oximeters are used to evaluate oxygen saturation in the treatment of cardiovascular problems both in the hospital and at home. A portable pulse oximeter is placed on the finger, and the sensor is attached to a monitor mounted on the belt. With such a device, it is possible to obtain accurate measurement results during the day, continuously monitoring the patient's state. Continuous monitoring of saturation can be a key component in preparing for surgery or selecting the right treatment.\n\nAn example of a portable pulse oximeter is the iSpO2, developed by Masimo. When measured with an iSpO2 pulse oximeter, the accuracy of monitoring oxygen saturation and the pulse rate is guaranteed even during movement. It works with either iOS or Android devices. The Masimo Personal Health app, combined with the iSpO2 pulse oximeter, allows patients to monitor and change oxygen saturation, pulse rate, and perfusion index. The iSpO2 pulse oximeter is also protected by several patents  [34, [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] .\n\nA separate niche can be identified for pulse oximeters, focused on a quick assessment of the patient's condition rather than long-term monitoring. These devices have several features: their miniature size, limited functionality, and ease of use. Such pulse oximeters can be made with a sensor in the form of a clip, which is usually fixed on the index finger or earlobe of the patient. This type is well-suited for adults and adolescents when the patient is observed for a short time. It is inconvenient to wear a clip if one needs a long measurement (several hours or more), as it can shift during movements, distorting the results of the study. For use, it is necessary to be at rest and not move, which makes it impossible to use this type to obtain an average oxygen saturation value for some time.\n\nAs a leading development company, Masimo also developed the MightySat finger pulse oximeter to quickly assess a patient's condition, measuring five key vital signs: oxygen saturation, pulse rate, respiratory rate, perfusion index, and plethistic variability index. These settings are displayed on compatible smart devices with Bluetooth LE models. Measurements can also be integrated into the Apple Health app. This development is protected by several patents (  [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] , etc.).\n\nPulse oximeters for rapid state assessment are also presented in the form of a wristwatch with a remote sensor that is attached to the finger, as in previous types. Such devices are more often used by athletes and people involved in climbing mountains.\n\nNoteworthy is the development of the Masimo W1 (Advanced Health Tracking Watch). Numerous physiological measurements are provided by Masimo W1, including the hydration index, oxygen saturation, heart rate, respiration rate, pleth variability index, and perfusion index. The product is made for people who wish to track their health data on their own or with friends and family, make better fitness decisions, or follow their health information with more knowledge. The watch is protected by a few patents  [62] [63] [64] [65] .\n\nThe company's products utilize Masimo SET technology, which should be highlighted. With the use of cutting-edge signal processing methods, SET sets Masimo apart from existing pulse oximetry systems by separating the arterial signal from noise sources. Masimo SET, when used in conjunction with clinical controls, has been shown in numerous studies to assist doctors in lowering the risk of blindness and eye damage (retinopathy of prematurity) in newborns  [66] , improving newborn critical congenital heart disease screening  [67] , and lowering the number of patient transfers to intensive care units and the activation of a rapid response team on the general hospital floor  [68] .\n\nIn a patient's physical data file, health care providers often record numerical parameter values together with other crucial data, such as time, other observational data, or remarks, and the identity of a health care professional. The file is frequently kept close by the patient, perhaps on a tablet. In this instance, the file is accessible to individuals who want to view the data. It should be mentioned that computer pulse oximetry is used in relation to this, where data processing from the device occurs through a microprocessor embedded into the device. This design is seen in many contemporary pulse oximeters.\n\nMasimo is actively working towards the introduction of digital pulse oximetry technologies. A remote monitoring and notification system for doctors (Masimo Patient Safe-tyNet) has been developed, which displays information in almost real-time from any connected Masimo device or a third-party device at the central station. The system allows for the sending of alarms and alerts from bedside devices directly to doctors. The development is protected by a number of patents, including \"Intelligent medical escalation process\" (US10833983  [69] ), \"Physiological measurement logic engine\" (US11399774  [70] ), \"Medical communication protocol translator\" (US11145408  [71] ), \"Medical monitoring system\" (US11133105  [72] ), and \"Alarm notification system\" (US11488711  [73] ).\n\nMoreover, Masimo's Iris Gateway system bridges the gap between device data generated at the patient's bedside and documentation in patient data-management systems such as electronic EMR medical records. Masimo Iris contributes to simplifying interaction throughout the health care delivery process. The development is presented in a number of patents, including \"Physiological measurement communications adapter\" (US7844315  [74] ), \"Systems and methods for storing, analyzing, and retrieving medical data\" (US8274360  [75] ), \"System for displaying medical monitoring data\" (US9943269  [76] ), etc.\n\nFurthermore, Masimo has presented an original, innovative solution that uses pulse oximetry that is noteworthy and of great practical importance. This is an opioid overdose prevention and warning system disclosed in patent US10939878  [77] . Using a pulse oximeter at the tip of the finger attached to an intelligent mobile device, the physiological monitoring system tracks breathing based on oxygen saturation measurements and communicates opioid-monitoring data from an intelligent mobile device to an opioid overdose monitoring service.\n\nMasimo also develops pulse oximeters for sports events. An application (US 2022/0218244 A1) has been made for the invention, which relates to methods and systems for combining physiological data from a pulse oximeter connected to a player playing a tennis match with match data corresponding to a tennis match  [78] . The system can generate a visual alert for one or more spectators of a tennis match based on a trigger event corresponding to the received physiological data and match data.\n\nIt should be noted that the identified areas of development in the field of pulse oximeters for different groups of end consumers are also presented among the intellectual property portfolios of other leading companies.\n\nThe founders of the creation of pulse oximeters include Nellcor, created in 1981. In 1983, Nellcor introduced its first pulse oximeter. As a result of mergers and acquisitions involving Nellcor, the following companies were represented in the market: Puritan-Bennett, Nellcor Puritan Bennett, and Covidien. In 2015, Medtronic acquired Covidien and continues to promote the Nellcor brand  [79] . As a result, the intellectual property market is widely represented by the above applicants.\n\nThe Nellcor pulse oximeter that has proven itself positively on the market is the Oxi Max N 560. It is designed to continuously and non-invasively monitor the degree of functional oxygen saturation of the arterial hemoglobin and the pulse rate. The device N-560 is intended for newborns, children, and adults both in and out of motion, as well as for patients in well-lit or poorly-lit rooms, such as hospitals, health facilities, in-hospital transport, and home settings. The Oxi Max N 560 is protected by a number of patents, including \"Sensor with signature of data relating to sensor\" (US6708049  [80] ), \"Method and circuit for storing and providing historical physiological data\" (US6463310  [81] ), \"Method and circuit for indicating quality and accuracy of physiological measurements\" (US6675031  [82] ), \"Pulse oximeter sensor with piece-wise function\" (US6801797  [83] ), \"Oximeter sensor with digital memory recording sensor data\" (US6591123  [84] ), etc.\n\nOf particular interest is the development of Covidien Lp, protected by the patent \"Oxygen Saturation Monitoring Using Artificial Intelligence\" (US11517226)  [85] . The developed oxygen saturation-monitoring device determines that the oxygen saturation level of the patient has decreased before reaching the desaturation threshold and can predict whether the oxygen saturation level of the patient will rise again above the desaturation threshold within a predetermined period.\n\nIn the field of pediatrics, Covidien Lp has received a patent for a device for determining the risk of retinopathy of prematurity (US8374666)  [86] . The processing unit is configured to determine the oxygen saturation level and trigger an alarm to receive timely information about the emerging risk.\n\nCovidien Lp also applied for WO 2022/204668, \"Autoregulation Monitoring Using Deep Learning\"  [87] . In anesthesia, that is particularly interesting in patients that are positioned with their heads elevated during surgery. The system is configured to determine, using a neural network algorithm, a model of cerebral autoregulation. A patient's cerebral autoregulation state is based at least in part on the patient's blood pressure and regional cerebral oxygen saturation in the patient for a certain period of time.\n\nThe leaders among the developers of pulse oximeters include Nihon Kohden. In 1972, the Japanese engineer Takuo Aoyagi developed a method for recording fluctuations in the absorption of light during the pulsation of the arteries. In 2015, he was awarded by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers with the \"Healthcare Technology Innovation Medal,\" being the first Japanese to receive such an award. The first pulse oximeter was released in 1975 (model OLV-5100) by Nihon Kohden Corporation  [88] . Nihon Kohden currently has a large portfolio of pulse oximeter patents, including \"Pulse oximeter\" (US 7206621  [89] ), \"Method and Apparatus for Measuring Pulse Rate and Oxygen Saturation Achieved During Exercise\" (US 8649837  [90] ), \"Patient Monitor\" (US 11291414  [91] ), etc."

      "text": "Over-the-counter pulse oximeters. They do not pass FDA review and are more often intended for general wellness, sports, or aviation purposes.\n\nAnalysis of the results of patent studies revealed that modern innovative solutions for the creation and implementation of transmission and refractory pulse oximeters for different end-users (stationary, portable, for home use, for pediatrics, etc.) are often integrated into more complex devices. At the same time, the tendency to accompany them with digital technologies is clearly traced. Manufacturers emphasize the development of automated, wireless, and remote pulse oximeters, thereby reducing the number of hospitalizations and doctor's visits and improving diagnosis and treatment.\n\nIn order to analyze and systematize the available data on the experience of introducing pulse oximeters using digital technologies, bibliometric studies were carried out.\n\nOngoing studies reveal new beneficial effects of pulse oximetry in clinical practice. The bibliometric analysis of pulse oximetry revealed six areas of research, as well as technical solutions to reduce the risks associated with pulse oximetry.\n\nThe first cluster (marked in red) is associated with the accuracy of the measurement results obtained by pulse oximeters. The predominant terms include accuracy, age, blood flow, hemodynamics, circulation, hemoglobin, hypotension, hypoxemia, hypoxia, nearinfrared spectroscopy, perfusion, reflectance, skin, temperature, etc.\n\nCabanas et al. systematized factors that may influence the accuracy and interpretation of pulse oximeter readings. Conditions of low perfusion, such as hypotension, hypothermia and vasoconstriction, anemia, hypoxemia, the use of dyes, nail polish, nerve-blocking medications, high altitude, or hypoxia training, can lead to SpO2 underestimation  [97] .\n\nAlthough some older studies have not found any abnormalities associated with dark skin pigmentation  [98, 99] , recent studies have shown that pulse oximeter devices have some limitations for dark-skinned subjects, especially in low-saturation or hypoxemia settings. Cabanas et al. note that factors that can lead to overestimation are darker skin pigmentation, hot skin temperature, hemoglobinopathy, high carbon monoxide levels, hyperbilirubinemia, and heavy smokers  [23, 97] .\n\nAdditionally, the pulse oximeter's signal processing can be hampered by motion artifacts, HR >150 beats per minute, excessive ambient light, incorrect or loose placement of the probe on the finger or earlobe, electromagnetic interference, or irregular heart rhythms, all of which can lead to readings that are not accurate  [97, 100] .\n\nThe FDA notes that some of the factors that may affect the accuracy of pulse oximeters include skin pigmentation, dyshemoglobinemia, severe anemia, low perfusion, dyes, nail polish, ambient light, motion artifacts, etc.  [26] .\n\nIn publications containing the above keywords, problems with the measurement accuracy of pulse oximeters and the usefulness of digital support are discussed. For example, Gokhale et al. have developed a non-invasive technology for measuring hemoglobin and oxygen saturation to eliminate racial bias  [101] . The inventors use a special melaninaccounting algorithm and software. Non-invasive device scores were comparable to the invasive method.\n\nThe work of Matos et al. was also devoted to the study of the accuracy of pulse oximeters in a population with a darker skin tone  [102] . The results of their single-center study suggest that SpO2 correction can be achieved with machine learning.\n\nOther authors report that in neonatal intensive care units, 87.5% of monitoring system alarms are false and caused by neonatal movements. To reduce the level of false alarms, it is proposed to use machine-learning algorithms to analyze the data from standard physiological monitoring in combination with cerebral oximetry data  [103] .\n\nThe proposed digital technologies using machine learning might help solve the problems of the influence of pigmentation and motion artifacts on measurement accuracy.\n\nThere are other developments in pulse oximeters that use more wavelengths, which increase their accuracy. In the future, machine learning methods can be applied to these data. Thus, Rea et al. noted that the inclusion of various specific wavelengths allows the reliable use of noninvasive sensors by people of any race and/or skin type  [104] .\n\nThe second cluster (green) focuses on the capabilities of the Internet of Medical Things, including pulse oximeters. Biomedical monitoring, exercise, heart rate, Internet of Things, monitoring, motion, respiratory rate, sensor, SpO2, vital signs, wearable devices, and wearable sensors are the terms that are presented in this cluster.\n\nBiosensors, as a general category of devices, collect information about different parameters and vital health signs by reading or measuring them and transmitting them using electrical signals to be interpreted. Pulse oximeters are of interest for the prevention and control of diseases, including those in elderly patients. They provide monitoring outside the hospital. At the same time, the indicators are more objective than those reported by patients during their visits to the doctor and can provide specialists with a real picture of the course of the disease in each specific case. The ability to connect sensors to mobile devices allows one to improve health management. It should also be noted that fitness trackers and smartwatches often include pulse oximetry indicators.\n\nIt is of interest to use sensors with digital technologies to detect early signs of drug overdose and respond in a timely manner. A review by Oteo et al. focused on technologies that can alert physicians to cases of drug overdose  [105] . These technologies use sensors that monitor oxygen saturation levels, breathing rate, or movement in combination with smartphone applications.\n\nScientific evidence suggests that one in five Americans wears a fitness tracker [106]. The publications of this cluster are also devoted to the development and testing of smartwatches, including readings of pulse oximeters.\n\nThe main users of smart watches are professional athletes and sports fans, military personnel, and users monitoring health. Thus, Garmin Ltd. produces smartwatches for sports and the military sphere [107].\n\nMitro et al. developed and tested a smart bracelet with machine learning support for use in emergencies during the evacuation of large passenger ships  [108] . The device allows one to monitor the pulse rate and oxygen saturation level in real-time and detect stress. An external review established an accuracy score of 76%.\n\nStudies on the accuracy of oxygen saturation measurements using the Apple Watch (Apple Inc., Cupertino, CA, USA) were summarized  [109] . A total of 973 patients had a 95% agreement of \u00b12.7 to 5.9% SpO2 when using the Apple Watch Series 6. The limitations of the studies were heterogeneous measurement and reporting processes in comparison with non-invasive measurements at rest. The authors noted the need to study the effect of skin color on measurement accuracy. In the clinical setting, a 12-lead ECG is currently needed to diagnose a myocardial infarction (MI). Li et al. summarized data from a number of studies using the Apple Watch to record multiple leads to meet this requirement for a clinical diagnosis of MI. The researchers noted that there are still many limitations to achieving the goal of early detection of MI, and more clinical data are needed  [110] .\n\nIt is worth noting that the Apple Watch and other wrist devices are not class IIb medical devices. While class IIb devices are generally medium-to high-risk, this class is more complex due to stricter clinical data requirements  [111, 112] .\n\nThe determination of oxygen saturation by these wrist devices is only punctual and not continuous, and the patient/user must remain still.\n\nWhen using smart watches for medical purposes, scientists distinguish between the positive aspects of the high-tech functions of smart watches, which allow users to independently monitor their health, and the risks associated with the error of medical indicators recorded by smart watches. There is no doubt that the potential of smart devices will increase, and their data will be comparable to the results of stationary examinations.\n\nThe third cluster (blue) is associated with the study of the use of pulse oximeters with digital technologies in various pathologies. This cluster has the following terms: obstructive sleep apnea, diabetes, diagnosis, digital signal processing, machine learning, neural networks, polysomnoraphy, predictiob, screening, stroke, support vector machine, etc. In recent years, pulse oximetry using digital technologies has become actively used as a diagnostic tool in clinical practice and in functional diagnostics.\n\nPulse oximetry using digital technologies can be used as a screening method to determine sleep apnea. A systematic search by Bazoukis et al. revealed that machinelearning models performed well in the diagnosis of sleep apnea using electrocardiogram measures and pulse oximetry  [113] .\n\nWang et al. developed an apnea diagnostic system using a photopletismography sensor to synchronously collect human pulse wave signals and oxygenate the blood. Machine learning was used to process data  [114] . The high accuracy of the system was revealed-more than 85%.\n\nPulse oximetry using digital technologies in combination with other indicators is a fast and simple, but to the same extent informative, method of studying the function of the cardiovascular system. Its use is possible both in emergency cases (operating room, ambulance) and in the diagnosis of chronic diseases. In the initial stages of the disease, in some cases, only hypoxemia may indicate a developing pathology.\n\nChu et al. proposed a transformer-based deep-learning architecture that uses photopletysmogram signals to conduct personalized blood pressure assessments and oxygen saturation  [115] . The model meets clinical standards and can improve the accuracy of blood pressure and oxygen saturation measurements (n = 1732).\n\nHuang et al. presented a machine-learning model predicting 28-day all-cause mortality in hypertensive ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke patients  [116] . Indicators included age, ethnicity, white blood cells, hyperlipidemia, mean corpuscular volume, glucose level, oxygen saturation, serum calcium, red blood cell distribution width, blood urea nitrogen, and bicarbonate (n = 4274). Kerexeta et al.  proposed an artificial intelligence model predicting the risk of cardiac decompensation events  [117] . The prognostic indicators selected were weight gain, oxygen saturation in the last few days, and heart rate.\n\nPulse oximetry using digital technologies has found application for detecting hemodynamically significant disease of peripheral arteries of the lower extremities in patients aged 50 years and older with type 2 diabetes  [118] .\n\nThe use of pulse oximetry with digital technologies in various areas of medical practice improves the work of identifying episodes of reduced oxygenation and thereby significantly increases the timeliness and quality of diagnosis of threatened conditions and the quality of medical care. Machine learning methods are increasingly being used to mine data characterizing the clinical status of patients.\n\nThe central topics of the fourth cluster (yellow-green color) are telemedicine and mobile applications to ensure the safety of patients in the provision of medical care, including using pulse oximeters. In this cluster, the keywords are asthma, COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), digital heath, management, Mhealth, mobile health, patient monitoring, physical activity, prevention, reliability, remote monitoring, safety, telehealth, telemedicine, therapy, validation, and wearable.\n\nTelemedicine and remote monitoring contribute to improving the quality and safety of the medical care provided, taking into account continuous modifications and improvements in diagnostic and therapeutic tools, including the growing number of chronic patients. This cluster presents publications related to the above topic.\n\nAshfaq et al. developed a prototype for the remote monitoring of cardiovascular patients using machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques  [119] . The device allows the monitoring of vital human functions, including oxygen saturation, heart rate, and body temperature.\n\nIt was reported that the remote monitoring of vital parameters and symptoms (blood pressure, respiratory rate, heart rate, temperature, dyspnea, and peripheral saturation) is safe and allows patients hospitalized for COVID-19 to be discharged from the hospital ahead of schedule  [120] .\n\nThe use of monitoring patients for asthma was analyzed  [121] . Electrocardiogram and photoplethysmogram signals are widely used in smartwatches and breast bracelets, making it easy to integrate a more extensive body sensor system to predict asthma exacerbations. Blood oxygen saturation, temperature, blood pressure, verbal sounds, and pain responses are other vital indicators that are utilized to monitor asthma patients.\n\nDigital pulse oximetry indicators are essential for determining the treatment tactics and prognosis for patients with respiratory pathology, particularly those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  [122] .\n\nTelemedicine and mobile applications reduce the burden on medical staff and increase the safety of patients.\n\nThe fifth cluster (lilac color) is closely related to the third and focuses on the possibilities of applying artificial intelligence and deep learning to analysis and prediction in COVID-19 and neonatology, including using pulse oximeters. Key terms include: artificial intelligence, complications, coronavirus, COVID-19, deep learning, disease, deep learning, outcomes, pain, pneumonia, prediction model, preterm infants, retinopathy of premature, severity, and SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has contributed to a significant increase in interest in the use of digital technologies in general and artificial intelligence in particular in the context of healthcare  [123] [124] [125] . The use of pulse oximetry using digital technologies is due to the fact that arterial hypoxemia is one of the main syndromes that develops in patients with pneumonia caused by COVID-19.\n\nUsing various machine learning approaches, the prognostic value for survival of COVID-19 patients based on known in-hospital mortality risk factors and chest radiographs was assessed. It was found that the indicators should include age, oxygen saturation, blood pressure, and some concomitant diseases, as well as image features related to the intensity and variability of the pixel distribution  [126] .\n\nIn connection with the COVID-19 pandemic, patients had to manually enter their daily oxygen saturation and pulse rate values into a health monitoring system. In order to optimize this process, a new PACMAN (pandemic-accelerated human-machine collaboration) structure with low-resource computer vision based on deep learning has been proposed and investigated. The structure is integrated into the patient monitoring system  [127] .\n\nConsidering that patients with COVID-19 may have significantly low SpO2 before obvious symptoms appear, Mathew et al. proposed neural network-based monitoring methods using smartphone cameras  [128] . The device analyzes the participant's hand video for physiological indicators.\n\nDue to the similarity of the symptoms of COVID-19 and other respiratory infections, the diagnosis of these diseases may be difficult. To solve this problem, a web application was developed that uses a chatbot and artificial intelligence to detect COVID-19, colds, and allergic rhinitis. The app also includes an electronic device that connects to the app and measures vital signs such as heart rate, blood oxygen saturation, and body temperature  [129] .\n\nPulse oximetry occupies a special place in neonatology. A prognostic algorithm has been created to detect late-onset sepsis in preterm infants  [130] . The machine-learning model takes into account oxygen saturation and heart rate data with a per-minute sampling rate.\n\nIn order to reduce the development of retinopathy, the importance of using improved saturation monitors in the management of newborns in critical conditions is noted. The introduction of automated systems is promising, helping to regulate the oxygen blender based on digital oxymetry data in real-time  [131] .\n\nThus, pulse oximetry with digital technologies is highly specific for detecting critical conditions in COVID-19 and neonatology.\n\nThe sixth cluster (light blue) concerns the experience of using pulse oximeters with digital technologies in the departments of anesthesiology, resuscitation, and intensive care. Among the keywords, the following concepts can be distinguished: anesthesia, calibration, children, critical care, failure, in-hospital mortality, newborn, risk, sepsis, shock, support, surgery, and trauma.\n\nTo optimize the processes of diagnosis and treatment in intensive care, machine learning, accompanied by various devices, including pulse oximeters, can also be successfully used. In order to reduce the duration of intraoperative hypoxemia in pediatric patients, a machine-learning model has been developed and tested that could predict the events of intraoperative hypoxemia 1 min ahead in children undergoing general anesthesia  [132] .\n\nA machine-learning model has been developed and tested that predicts short-term ICU mortality using trends in four easily collected vital signs  [133] . Heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and peripheral capillary oxygen saturation datasets measured every hour for 10 h were used.\n\nHypoxemia often occurs in outpatients undergoing esophagogastroduodenoscopy under anesthesia. To predict the risk of hypoxemia, Fang et al. developed and evaluated four machine-learning models based on preoperative and intraoperative data. The models showed satisfactory prognostic characteristics  [134] .\n\nA model for predicting mortality in critically-ill patients with cardiogenic shock (n = 8815) was developed using a machine learning method. The final risk assessment includes the following values during the first 24 h of intensive care unit stay: maximum blood urea nitrogen \u2265 25 mg/dL, minimum oxygen saturation <88%, minimum systolic blood pressure < 80 mmHg, use of mechanical ventilation, age \u2265 60 years, and maximum anion difference \u226514 mmol/L [135].\n\nOne of the problems in the departments of anesthesiology, resuscitation, and intensive care is sepsis, since its development not only worsens the course of the patient's underlying disease but also has a high overall mortality (approx. 30%). The development of machine learning technology and the use of big data in the departments of anesthesiology, resuscitation, and intensive care have prospects for solving this problem.\n\nThus, in the work of Strickler et al., statistically significant data on the prognosis of the development of sepsis were obtained  [136] . A mechanism for interpreting machinelearning models using 17 features was proposed. The authors noted that age, chloride ion concentration, pH, and oxygen saturation should be further investigated for associations with the development of sepsis.\n\nMachine-learning algorithms that analyze data, including pulse oximeters, in real-time are a means of predicting the development of adverse incidents in intensive care in advance, creating the possibility of adequate correction of the patient's condition in order to avoid further deterioration.\n\nThe VOSviewer program also allows researchers to display the time when the mostcommon terms in research appear. The closer to blue, the \"older\" the research (earlier publications); the closer to yellow, the more modern (recent publications). The data obtained are presented in Figure  8 .\n\nIt should be noted that the time range was automatically reduced by the program due to fewer publications for 2000-2013. This analysis showed that the growth of publishing activity related to machine learning and telemedicine with the use of pulse oximeters actively began in 2020.\n\nThe conducted patent and bibliometric analysis allowed the identification of technical solutions to reduce the risks associated with pulse oximetry: improving precision and validity, technically improved clinical diagnostic use, and the use of machine learning. Generalized approaches to risk reduction when using pulse oximetry on the example of a number of patents and scientific articles are shown in Figure  9 .

Generalized approaches to risk reduction when using pulse oximetry on the example of a number of patents and scientific articles are shown in Figure  9 .\n\nThus, the rational choice of strategy to reduce the risks associated with the use of pulse oximetry will allow developers and doctors to support and expand the quality and effectiveness of diagnostic, preventive, and therapeutic practices.\n\nOur patent and bibliometric analysis of the scientific and intellectual property landscape of the use of pulse oximeters indicates their active development and implementation in medical practice. Currently, the large array of pulse oximeters can be classified according their application-from diagnostic to preventive (e.g., for a healthy lifestyle, a smart watch), and a trend in rehabilitation devices, such as monitoring of opioid overdoses.\n\nThe integration of digital technologies into pulse oximetry significantly enhances healthcare delivery by streamlining the flow of patient data, improving patient safety, enabling timely medical care, and augmenting the objectivity of clinical results and the accuracy of clinical outcomes, while reducing both the time and use of material resources.

      "text": "(1) Patent analysis based on the Lens database for the period of 2000-2023 indicates the presence of a stable linear growth of patent activity in the field of pulse oximetry, with a sharp increase in the number of published patents in 2021, which may be due to the widespread use of pulse oximeters during the COVID-19 pandemic for early detection of hypoxia.\n\nIt was revealed that the United States, China, the Republic of Korea, Japan, Canada, Australia, Taiwan, and the United Kingdom are the predominant countries in patent issuance for pulse oximeter technology.

(Newark, NJ, USA), Nellcor Puritan Bennett (Carlsbad, CA, USA), Nihon Kohden Corporation (Tokio, Japan), Medtronic Inc. (Dublin, Ireland), etc. A number of their developments have received FDA approval.\n\nIt has been revealed that modern innovative solutions for creating and introducing pulse oximeters for various end-users (stationary, portable, for home use, pediatrics, etc.) are currently being integrated into more complex devices with a clearly traceable trend of accompanying them with digital technologies, which makes it possible to reduce the number of hospitalizations and visits to a doctor, as well as improve diagnosis and treatment.\n\n(2) Bibliometric analysis in the Web of Science database for the period of 2000-2023 revealed a consistent temporal trend in the volume of both publications and citations, underscoring the growing importance of pulse oximeters in digitally-enabled medical practice.\n\nThe University of California system, Harvard University, the University of Oxford, the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Massachusetts General Hospital were the most productive affiliations. The USA, China, England, India, Germany, Japan, Canada, Australia, Spain, and Italy were the most productive countries. Three countries (the USA, China, and England) produced almost half of the total number of publications (50.8%). The journal \"Sensors\" was the most productive journal. The most cited literature focuses on measurement accuracy and machine learning.\n\nUsing the VOSviewer software, we discerned six primary research clusters: (1) measurement accuracy; (2) integration with the Internet of Things; (3) applicability across diverse pathologies; (4) telemedicine and mobile applications; (5) artificial intelligence and deep learning; and (6) utilization in anesthesiology, resuscitation, and intensive care departments. The findings of this study indicate the prospects for leveraging digital technologies in the use of pulse oximetry in various fields of medicine, with implications for advancing understanding, diagnosis, prevention, and treatment, including intensive therapy. It enables clinicians to proactively identify high-risk patients, including premature infants, who may require more focused diagnostic and therapeutic interventions.\n\n(3) The conducted patent and bibliometric analysis allowed the identification of technical solutions to reduce the risks associated with pulse oximetry: improving precision and validity, technically improved clinical diagnostic use, and the use of machine learning.\n\nIn summary, the future of digitally-augmented pulse oximeters is promising. These advances not only have great development prospects, but also contribute to enhancing patient safety and the overall quality of medical care."
