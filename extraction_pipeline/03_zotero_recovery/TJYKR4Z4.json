  "title": "Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group. Reduction in the incidence of type 2 diabetes with lifestyle intervention or metformin",
  "abstract": "OBJECTIVE Across the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) follow-up, cumulative diabetes incidence remained lower in the lifestyle compared with the placebo and metformin randomized groups and could not be explained by weight. Collection of self-reported physical activity (PA) (yearly) with cross-sectional objective PA (in follow-up) allowed for examination of PA and its long-term impact on diabetes prevention. \n RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS Yearly self-reported PA and diabetes assessment and oral glucose tolerance test results (fasting glucose semiannually) were collected for 3,232 participants with one accelerometry assessment 11-13 years after randomization (n 5 1,793). Mixed models determined PA differences across treatment groups. The association between PA and diabetes incidence was examined using Cox proportional hazards models. \n RESULTS There was a 6% decrease (Cox proportional hazard ratio 0.94 [95% CI 0.92, 0.96]; P < 0.001) in diabetes incidence per 6 MET-h/week increase in time-dependent PA for the entire cohort over an average of 12 years (controlled for age, sex, baseline PA, and weight). The effect of PA was greater (12% decrease) among participants less active at baseline (<7.5 MET-h/week) (n 5 1,338) (0.88 [0.83, 0.93]; P < 0.0001), with stronger findings for lifestyle participants. Lifestyle had higher cumulative PA compared with metformin or placebo (P < 0.0001) and higher accelerometry total minutes per day measured during follow-up (P 5 0.001 and 0.047). All associations remained significant with the addition of weight in the models. \n CONCLUSIONS PA was inversely related to incident diabetes in the entire cohort across the study, with cross-sectional accelerometry results supporting these findings. This highlights the importance of PA within lifestyle intervention efforts designed to prevent diabetes and urges health care providers to consider both PA and weight when counseling high-risk patients.",

      "text": "The fact that lifestyle intervention can prevent or delay the development of type 2 diabetes in high-risk adults was successfully demonstrated in a very rigorous randomized clinical trial. The strength of this trial, the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), was the diversity of its participants with regard to age, ethnicity, race, and geographic location  (1) . Because of its success, a groupdelivered version of the lifestyle intervention that had been provided to the lifestyle participants was offered to participants from the other two randomized arms (metformin and placebo) at DPP end. All participants were then invited to continue as part of the DPP follow-up or Outcomes Study (DPPOS). During an average 10 years of follow-up since DPP randomization, the between-group differences in cumulative diabetes incidence persisted, although to a lesser degree than at DPP end  (2) .\n\nThe contributions of the two lifestyle goals of weight loss and physical activity (PA) were examined in lifestyle participants at the end of the DPP trial period (3.2 years average follow-up). Participants not meeting the year 1 weight goal but meeting the self-reported PA goal had a 46% lower diabetes incidence at DPP end compared with those meeting neither goal  (3) . However, change in selfreported leisure PA from baseline was not associated with diabetes incidence when adjusted for weight. The impact of change in PA levels beyond the end of the DPP trial period has not yet been reported in long-term follow-up.\n\nThe yearly collection of PA data through a validated questionnaire coupled with a one-time objective assessment of activity in DPPOS using accelerometry provided the opportunity to examine the overall impact of PA in the DPP and its follow-up phase. Specifically, this current investigation describes self-reported PA levels in the DPP over an average of 12 years in this diverse sample of adults and includes a highly accepted objective activity measure at follow-up in the DPPOS. Whether higher activity levels were maintained in lifestyle participants into follow-up and could explain, in part, their lower cumulative diabetes incidence (compared with the other randomized groups) was examined. Whether PA levels, examined as a continuous variable over the entire study period in the whole DPP cohort, were related to the development of diabetes after controlling for weight will also be investigated and is the primary focus of this investigation."

The incidence of diabetes was reduced in the lifestyle intervention and metformin arms compared with placebo by 58% and 31%, respectively, after a mean of 2.8 years of follow-up during the masked treatment phase. DPP results and methods have been described elsewhere  (1, 2, 4) .\n\nSurviving participants of the original DPP were invited to participate in the long-term follow-up (DPPOS). All three DPP treatment groups were offered group-implemented lifestyle intervention. Metformin was continued in the metformin group, and the lifestyle intervention group was offered additional lifestyle support. Participants were unmasked to assignment  (2) . The accelerometry ancillary study involved a single, week-long collection of accelerometry data in all participants around the time of their DPPOS clinic visit (Supplementary Fig.  1 )."

The MAQ assesses past year, moderate/vigorous-intensity leisure PAs common to the population in question  (7, 8) . Although light-intensity activity comprises the largest percentage of the average adults' day, the MAQ was not designed to measure activities that comprise that level of intensity because of concerns regarding the accuracy of recall of light-intensity activity. Only objective measures, such as the accelerometer, can validly measure activities of light intensity  (9, 10) . Results from the MAQ are coded as MET-h/week.\n\nOn the other hand, accelerometers do capture total time spent in PAs of all intensities, including lower-intensity and unstructured activities. Each willing DPPOS participant was given an ActiGraph GT3X triaxial accelerometer at either an annual or a midyear clinic visit to wear at their waist during waking hours for 7 consecutive days. Data were collected in 1-s epochs and converted to counts (ActiLife v6 software). Nonwear (monitor removal) was identified as $60 consecutive min of zero counts with the exception of no more than 2 min of nonzero counts. Four or more valid days with $10 h of wear time each day were required for inclusion in the analyses  (11) . Light-intensity and moderate/ vigorous-intensity activity were defined as 150-2,690 and $2,691 counts/min, respectively  (12, 13) . Data were also examined as total activity (light 1 moderate/vigorous activity min/day) and total monitor counts/day (intensity-weighted sum of all movement)."

Models were adjusted for baseline leisure activity, age, and sex.\n\nThe effect of leisure activity from the MAQ (collected yearly from baseline to the beginning of the accelerometry study) on diabetes incidence was examined using Cox proportional hazards models with time-dependent covariates. Hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated for the whole group, for lifestyle participants alone, and for the subgroups that did or did not meet the activity goal at baseline (150 min/week) as determined by the MAQ. Because of the lack of an interaction by treatment, Cox models were examined for both the entire cohort (controlled for treatment) and the lifestyle arm alone (n 5 1,077). Models were adjusted for age, sex, race/ethnicity, baseline activity, and baseline and, in some models, timedependent weight. Although diet was assessed by food frequency questionnaire intermittently throughout DPP and DPPOS, there were negligible differences across intervention groups 9 years after randomization and, therefore, was not included in the model  (15) .\n\nFinally, the same Cox models were reanalyzed over the original DPP (mean of 3.2 years) in the whole cohort and then again in lifestyle participants not meeting the activity goal at baseline.

All of the DPP sites were invited to join the accelerometry ancillary study (National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Disease funded, A.M.K. principal investigator), with all but three clinical sites able to participate. From the 1,932 active DPPOS adults who enrolled at these participating sites, 93% agreed to take part in the accelerometry study (9 were ineligible, and 130 did not attend clinic during substudy enrollment).\n\nA total of 1,622 ancillary study participants (90.4% of 1,793 participants) had at least 4 valid days of accelerometer recording (on the basis of triaxial data). Individuals with complete accelerometer data (vs. those without) were more likely to have confirmed diabetes (54.4% vs. 40.1%, P , 0.001). There were no other significant differences in key covariates across compliance groups (data not shown). At the time of ancillary study data collection, ancillary participants with valid data (n 5 1,622) had a mean age of 63.7 (SD 5 9.8) years, 70% were female, and 47.1% had self-reported race/ethnicity other than White, non-Hispanic.\n\nThe lifestyle participants had slightly higher values for both light-and moderate/vigorous-intensity leisure activity compared with metformin and placebo participants (Table  2 ).

      "title": "CONCLUSIONS",
      "text": "In this cohort, PA was inversely related to the development of diabetes over the long term and remain significant even when adjusted for weight change. This relationship was particularly strong in participants with lower baseline PA, supporting national guidelines suggesting the potential for greater benefits as a result of increasing activity levels in those relatively less active.\n\nThe protective effect of increased PA in this effort was in line with findings from previous prospective studies  (17) (18) (19)  and other large clinical trials  (20, 21) . Among the unique strengths of this current investigation are the yearly collected subjective activity measures over a long follow-up period and the support for persistent treatment group differences in activity provided by cross-sectional results obtained from accelerometry at follow-up by this widely accepted objective measure. Both the diversity of the DPP population and its activity intervention goal, similar to national public health activity recommendations, add to the generalizability of the findings of this investigation to adults, with characteristics similar to those of DPP participants at high risk for type 2 diabetes.\n\nWhen measured objectively with accelerometry in the extended follow-up period, the lifestyle arm had higher total PA levels. Subjective activity across the entire study was also higher in the lifestyle arm. Perhaps in addition to weight loss, higher total PA levels may help to partially explain the lower cumulative incidence of diabetes in the lifestyle compared with the other two randomized arms across the entire study activity (2) that, if true, is supportive of approaches to encourage greater participation in all intensities of PA.\n\nFinally, the current investigation also provided an important lesson in evaluating the impact of PA for investigations  such as the DPP in which baseline weight, but not activity level, is an eligibility criterion. Change in activity from baseline to DPP end (3.2 years) previously shown not to be significantly related to diabetes development (3) is significant if the analyses are limited to those less active at baseline. Included in the limitations of this effort is the fact that the DPP lifestyle intervention, not unlike other published lifestyle investigations in the literature, comprises weight and activity goals and was not designed to test the individual contribution of either goal alone. Another limitation involves the subjective nature of the longitudinal measure of activity, although the MAQ has been widely used and validated against several objective measures, including accelerometry  (16, 22, 23) .\n\nGiven the success of lifestyle intervention in the prevention of type 2 diabetes, such as that shown in the DPP, intervention programs that are based on these landmark clinical trials are being offered in a variety of diverse community settings/clinics for the high-risk adult. Although these community translation studies have adapted the same DPP lifestyle goals of weight loss and increased activity, a review of the translation literature documented that only about onehalf of these published studies include PA change in their results  (24) , making it difficult to assess the impact of activity on health outcomes in these translation efforts. On the basis of our current investigation, which highlights the role of PA on the development of diabetes at various phases of the lifestyle intervention, we would urge public health researchers to examine activity data in their communitybased studies and urge health care professionals to look beyond their high-risk patient's weight and consider his or her habitual PA levels when discussing lifestyle strategies to prevent progression to type 2 diabetes."
