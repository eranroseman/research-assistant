  "title": "Efficacy of interventions that include diet, aerobic and resistance training components for type 2 diabetes prevention: a systematic review with meta-analysis",
  "abstract": "Current recommendations for the prevention of type 2 diabetes advise modification of diet and exercise behaviors including both aerobic and resistance training. However, the efficacy of multi-component interventions involving a combination of these three components has not been established. The aims of this review were to systematically review and meta-analyze the evidence on multi-component (diet + aerobic exercise + resistance training) lifestyle interventions for type 2 diabetes prevention. Eight electronic databases (Medline, Embase, SportDiscus, Web of Science, CINAHL, Informit health collection, Cochrane library and Scopus) were searched up to June 2013. Eligible studies 1) recruited prediabetic adults or individuals at risk of type 2 diabetes; 2) conducted diet and exercise [including both physical activity/aerobic and resistance training] programs; and 3) reported weight and plasma glucose outcomes. In total, 23 articles from eight studies were eligible including five randomized controlled trials, one quasi-experimental, one two-group comparison and one single-group pre-post study. Four studies had a low risk of bias (score \u2265 6/10). Median intervention length was 12 months (range 4-48 months) with a follow-up of 18 months (range 6.5 -48 months). The diet and exercise interventions varied slightly in terms of their specific prescriptions. Meta-analysis favored interventions over controls for weight loss (-3.79 kg [-6.13, -1.46; 95% CI], Z = 3.19, P = 0.001) and fasting plasma glucose (-0.13 mmol.L -1 [-0.24, -0.02; 95% CI], Z = 2.42, P = 0.02). Diabetes incidence was only reported in two studies, with reductions of 58% and 56% versus control groups. In summary, multi-component lifestyle type 2 diabetes prevention interventions that include diet and both aerobic and resistance exercise training are modestly effective in inducing weight loss and improving impaired fasting glucose, glucose tolerance, dietary and exercise outcomes in at risk and prediabetic adult populations. These results support the current exercise guidelines for the inclusion of resistance training in type 2 diabetes prevention, however there remains a need for more rigorous studies, with long-term follow-up evaluating program efficacy, muscular fitness outcomes, diabetes incidence and risk reduction.",

      "text": "Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is one of the fastest growing non-communicable diseases worldwide  [1, 2] . Recommendations for T2DM prevention include maintaining a healthy weight, consuming a healthy diet, and participation in exercise. Most T2DM prevention programs have recommended aerobic (cardio-respiratory) activities  [3]  with strong evidence supporting this approach. Largescale prevention studies such as the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP)  [4]  reported reductions in T2DM incidence of up to 58%  [5]  and improvements in risk factors such as weight and insulin sensitivity.\n\nMore recently, resistance training (RT) has been included in guidelines for T2DM based on evidence established over the last decade, which demonstrates benefits from RT including improved fasting plasma glucose (FPG)  [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] , glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1C )  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] , insulin sensitivity  [8, 14]  and the maintenance of fat free mass during energy restriction for weight loss  [17, 18] . Current guidelines for T2DM prevention and management  [3, 19]  recommend at least 150 min per week of moderate-vigorous aerobic activity and an additional two (ideally three) RT sessions per week (at least 60 min). Studies have reported that the combination of aerobic plus RT has additive benefits on glucose control  [16, 20, 21]  and can achieve greater reductions in T2DM incidence  [22, 23]  than the use of a single exercise modality. However, multi-component (diet + aerobic exercise + RT) lifestyle interventions have the potential to become excessively burdensome, which could compromise program adherence. Further, the long-term efficacy of multi-component programs remains unclear.\n\nTherefore, the aim of this systematic review was to summarize the evidence of the efficacy of lifestyle interventions that include diet + aerobic exercise + RT components in at risk or prediabetic populations. Specifically, this review assesses the effects of these interventions on weight change, glucose regulation, and diet and exercise outcomes. A secondary aim was to conduct a meta-analysis of the impact on weight and FPG. Addressing these aims is necessary to validate the evidence supporting current dietary and exercise guidelines for T2DM prevention."

Inter-rater reliability was calculated on a dichotomous scale using percentage agreement and Cohen's \u03ba. Un-weighted sum totals were calculated for each study. Based on a dichotomy used in recent reviews  [27, 28]  studies were classified as having a low (score \u2265 6) or high risk of bias (score \u2264 5). Two authors (EA and RC) assessed the risk of bias in the individual studies that met the inclusion criteria. In the case of disagreement, discussion took place until consensus was reached."

Meta-analyses for weight and FPG were conducted for eligible randomized controlled trials (RCT). Results were pooled in separate meta-analyses using RevMan 5.1.4 for Mac OS X. All data were continuous and reported on the same scale for weight (kg) and FPG (mmol.L -1 ). Heterogeneity of studies included for meta-analysis was determined using Chi 2 and I 2 statistics. A significance level of P < 0.10 for the Chi 2 test and an I 2 greater than 50% indicated substantial heterogeneity  [24] . The fixed-effects model was used for homogenous samples and the random-effects model was used where heterogeneity was present. The aggregate result was calculated as the weighted mean difference (WMD) between interventions and controls. Metaanalysis was deemed inappropriate for variables where results from fewer than three studies were available."

The impact of interventions on muscular fitness and physical activity were not consistently reported, making it difficult to determine the contributions of these components towards improvements in glucose regulation."

      "text": "All interventions in this review and the meta-analysis found significant weight loss compared to controls. Importantly the DPP identified weight loss as the dominant predictor of their 58% reduction in T2DM incidence  [52] . However, the effects on glucose regulation were less consistent. Meta-analysis found a small but significant reduction that would be of clinical importance in those with borderline prediabetes. The baseline FPG mean of the combined study population in the metaanalysis (5.6 mmol.L -1 ) was at the lower limit of the prediabetes range (5.6 -6.9 mmol.L -1 )  [53] . This suggests that scope to improve further was limited in these cohorts, a circumstance which may be common amongst prediabetic individuals who present in clinical settings. Furthermore, the small magnitude of change observed in the meta-analysis for FPG was heavily influenced by the results of the Finnish DPS, which received a 65% weighting due to its large sample size. The Finnish DPS excluded participants from the study after diagnosis of T2DM. As the majority of those developing T2DM belonged to the control group, this introduces bias, which underestimates the FPG of the control group, leading to an attenuation of the difference between the groups."

      "title": "Exercise programs and measurement of related outcomes",
      "text": "The reporting of exercise programs was inconsistent between studies and most studies provided only general descriptions of their exercise programs. For example, \"The supervised exercise group has additionally been offered supervised, progressive, individually tailored aerobic exercise programs and circuit-type resistance training sessions for 1 hour twice a week\"  [35] . This makes it difficult to determine the specific modes of RT exercises that were performed (e.g., body weight, free weights, isometric exercises, isokinetic exercises, resistance band) and the volume (load, repetitions and sets) prescribed. Future studies are recommended to provide more comprehensive descriptions of the exercise programs. Most studies provided supervised individual or group exercise sessions; only one study included a home-based exercise component  [41] . This has implications for the feasibility,  practicalities and dissemination costs of these programs into community and health-care settings, as few health care systems can afford to provide supervision of exercise programs by qualified personnel.\n\nMeasurement of exercise-related outcomes was also inconsistent between studies. No studies used objective measures (e.g., pedometers or accelerometers) to assess physical activity, which is a major limitation in existing studies. Physical activity levels as measured by selfreport improved in intervention groups versus controls groups  [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] . Aerobic exercise tests to measure or predict VO 2max were the most widely used fitness indicator, and improvements in aerobic fitness in intervention groups were generally observed  [29] [30] [31] 33, 34, [36] [37] [38] [39] [40] . Only one study measured improvements in muscular strength  [29] [30] [31] , assessing only lower body limb strength using an isokinetic dynamometer. Without evaluation of muscular performance (including upper and lower body muscle groups) it is difficult to determine whether the RT program was adhered to or whether the addition of RT in multicomponent programs contributes to improvements in muscular fitness and glycemic control in prediabetes populations, as has been shown in adults with T2DM  [54] . Future studies should provide comprehensive and objective evaluation of the impact on aerobic and muscular fitness."

Of the studies reviewed, incidence of T2DM was only reported in the Finnish DPS and SLIM studies (up to 58% reduction in T2DM incidence). This finding is of great interest, particularly since the US DPP, which did not prescribe RT as part of their physical activity recommendations, also reported a 58% reduction in diabetes incidence (after 2.8 years)  [5] . This suggests that multi-component T2DM prevention programs that include RT are effective, but whether RT provides benefits additional to dietary and aerobic components requires further investigation."

Design characteristics of studies that achieved significant changes for weight loss and FPG  [29] [30] [31] 33, [36] [37] [38] [39] 41]  included: face-to-face intervention delivery mode (individual and/or group), an average of eight contacts per month (including face to face sessions, emails and phone calls), and a minimum of six (preferably 12) months of follow up. Lifestyle intervention characteristics included: 150-210 minutes (3-5 sessions) of aerobic exercise per week; 60-120 minutes (1-3 sessions) of RT per week; recommendations for a specified macronutrient diet profile, energy restriction for weight loss and setting a weight loss goal of 5-10%."

      "text": "Of the studies reviewed, 62% of participants were female. Since there is no reported global difference in gender distribution for diabetes  [1] , this may indicate that women are more likely to participate in diabetes prevention trials. None of the studies targeted a specific sex or reported their results by sex. Whether males and females benefit equally from these multi-component interventions is not known, but future studies should report their results by sex to reveal any differences that may exist. A recent systematic review  [55]  argued that sex-specific design features may be important influences on the effectiveness of lifestyle interventions."

      "title": "Strengths and limitations",
      "text": "This is the first review to synthesize the evidence of multi-component interventions including diet, aerobic exercise and RT for the prevention of type 2 diabetes. It adhered to the PRISMA statement for the reporting of systematic reviews and meta-analyses; a comprehensive search strategy was performed across multiple databases with no date restrictions; high agreement levels for quality assessments were achieved; and detailed data extraction was performed to allow for comparisons between studies.\n\nThe review also has some limitations. Meta-analyses for weight and FPG were based on a small number of studies and the meta-analysis for weight was statistically heterogeneous. The sample for the meta-analyses consisted of 62% females, which introduces a sex bias. Furthermore the mean age of participants was 54.5 \u00b1 9.7 years and only one study targeted older individuals (>65)  [29] [30] [31] . This limits the generalizability of the results particularly for older individuals and highlights an evidence gap in the field. Regular resistance training may result in gains or maintenance of muscle mass; consequently weight loss as an outcome by itself would be confounded by the inability to discriminate between loss of fat mass and gains in fat free mass. Future studies need to include more comprehensive assessments of body composition. For the aforementioned reasons results from the original studies and the synthesis of results presented here must be interpreted with caution. Finally, T2DM prevention studies that employed diet + aerobic exercise, but not RT were not eligible, including the highly successful US DPP."

Systematic investigation of the benefits of each additional component (diet, aerobic, RT, physical activity) of multi-component lifestyle interventions is also required to provide further support for the current recommendations for T2DM prevention. Future studies should report intervention component adherence and use objective measures to detect changes in muscular fitness, aerobic capacity and physical activity. More comprehensive measures of body composition (e.g., waist circumference, dual x-ray absorptiometry or bioimpedance analysis) should be utilised to determine changes in body composition as a result of multicomponent T2DM prevention programs including RT. Studies exploring interventions tailored specifically for men or women are required to determine any impact on recruitment, retention and efficacy."

These results support the current exercise guidelines for the inclusion of RT in T2DM prevention. Further research is required to determine the long-term efficacy of multi-component interventions on T2DM prevention and changes in biomarkers of risk and the specific contributions of each intervention component to these outcomes."
