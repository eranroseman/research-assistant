  "title": "A supportive text message intervention for individuals living with endometriosis (EndoSMS): Randomized controlled pilot and feasibility trial",
  "abstract": "Introduction: As a high symptom burden chronic condition, endometriosis is associated with diminished quality of life (QoL) and psychological distress. The EndoSMS text message intervention was developed to inform and support individuals living with endometriosis. The primary aim of this study is to assess the acceptability, feasibility and preliminary efficacy of EndoSMS, to improve endometriosis-specific QoL and reduce psychological distress in a randomised controlled trial, compared with care as usual. We will additionally assess the impact of EndoSMS on self-efficacy for managing endometriosis. Methodology: A two-arm parallel pilot randomised controlled trial with waitlist control was conducted. Baseline assessments included QoL, psychological distress, self-efficacy, demographic and medical variables. Following baseline survey completion, participants were randomised to either the Intervention (EndoSMS: 3-months of text messaging) or Control condition. At 3-month follow-up, all participants completed an online survey reassessing outcomes, and Intervention participants provided quantitative and qualitative user feedback on EndoSMS. Results: Data collection commenced on 18 November 2021 and was completed on 30 March 2022. Descriptive statistics will be used to analyse feasibility and acceptability of the intervention. Preliminary efficacy analyses will be conducted using linear mixed models for QoL, psychological distress and self-efficacy outcomes. Subgroup analyses will also be conducted for typically underserved populations (e.g., rural/regional). Conclusion: This pilot will provide acceptability, feasibility and preliminary efficacy evidence for the impact of a supportive text messaging program for endometriosis. It will contribute to understanding how to optimally support individuals in living with and managing their endometriosis.",

      "title": "1.. Introduction",
      "text": "Endometriosis is a highly prevalent, incurable and painful chronic condition affecting 1 in 9 Australians  [1]  and 10% of biological females globally  [2] . Symptoms include chronic pelvic pain, dyspareunia, altered bladder and bowel function, abdominal bloating and infertility  [3] . Despite the chronic symptom burden  [4] , interaction with medical professionals is sporadic  [5] . This contributes to individuals having limited understanding of their illness, and feeling misunderstood by health professionals  [6]  and not supported  [7] . Endometriosis is characterised by poor quality of life (QoL)  [8] , a high prevalence of psychological distress (e.g., depression, anxiety, stress)  [9, 10] , and impairments in social functioning  [11] . Issues with low self-image  [8] , low self-esteem  [12]  and lack of self-compassion  [13]  further contribute to psychological distress. Clearly psychologically supportive interventions are warranted for individuals living with endometriosis. The delivery of simple, easy-to-implement strategies for improving quality of life and emotional wellbeing (e.g., advice for self-care), and providing information and guidance for managing endometriosis (e.g., tips on how to reach out for support), may prove effective for individuals living with endometriosis.\n\nOne promising low-cost approach to providing readily accessible, supportive interventions in medical settings is via mobile phones  [14]  (i. e., mHealth). Access to mobile phones worldwide is ubiquitous, with 90% of the global population (including Australians) having ready access to a mobile phone  [15] , providing direct internet access  [16] . mHealth has been used with women with chronic pelvic pain to deliver mindfulness meditation through an mobile phone-based application  [17] . However, users of this phone application expressed a number of concerns navigating and using this technology (e.g., internet connectivity issues, limited storage space)  [17] . Text messaging is another type of mHealth intervention which is highly accessible, not requiring internet connection or navigation of a new phone application  [18] . Text messaging provides a scalable, easy-to-implement approach to rapidly disseminating curated health information and resources to individuals in between usual clinic visits and for those whose clinic access is challenged by geographic isolation or COVID-19 related public health measures  [19] . A further benefit is that texts require little effort on the part of the recipient and can be read at a time of convenience  [20] .\n\nA mixed methods needs analysis study with individuals living with endometriosis revealed a strong desire for easy-to-access, reliable and supportive information  [21] . Reflecting the high prevalence of psychological distress, there was an expressed desire for psychological and emotional support, particularly regarding self-compassion and social relationships  [21] , consistent with prior research  [13] . Consequently, we developed EndoSMS, a supportive text messaging intervention  [21]  using co-design with individuals living with endometriosis, clinical health professionals and researchers  [21] , to ensure the relevancy and suitability of the resultant intervention  [22, 23] . Designed for delivery over a 6-month period, EndoSMS comprises 371 text messages for one-way, automated delivery across several domains providing general information about endometriosis and tips, strategies and guidance for promoting psychological wellbeing  [21] . Four messages are delivered per week, an optimal delivery schedule identified in prior text message interventions  [14, 24] . These text messages have demonstrated high acceptability, relevance and readability from both individuals with endometriosis and healthcare professionals  [21] , consistent with prior text message intervention research  [14, 20] . Addressing key challenges for individuals living with endometriosis, EndoSMS aims to improve psychosocial aspects of wellbeing as reflected in QoL and emotional health.\n\nTo date, no study has examined the use of an endometriosis-specific mHealth intervention or a text message intervention in this context. Text-based interventions generally have improved aspects of psychological wellbeing, such as QoL  [26] , patient empowerment  [27] , perceived support  [28]  and self-efficacy for chronic condition management  [29] . Two text messaging interventions providing information and psychologically supportive messaging (Text4Hope over 3 months addressing mental health concerns during the COVID-19 pandemic  [30] ; Text4Support providing cognitive-behavior based text messaging over 6 months to support community-based adults with addiction and mental health concerns  [31] ) similar to EndoSMS, are of particular relevance to the endometriosis context as both primarily target a female audience. Single arm feasibility studies of these two interventions indicate high user acceptability and potential improvements in mental wellbeing (i.e., loneliness, stress, QoL  [31] , psychological distress)  [30] . Notwithstanding high dropout rates (95.5%  [30] ; 89.3%  [31] ) and the lack of a randomised controlled design, these preliminary findings suggest that supportive text-message interventions may be acceptable and useful for individuals living with endometriosis, a population facing ongoing challenges in terms of psychosocial wellbeing, medication adherence and self-management  [8, 32] ."

This brief version is expected to show evidence of indicative benefit (i.e., preliminary efficacy) for improved QoL, diminished psychological distress and enhanced management of the self-regulatory aspects of living with endometriosis  [34] ."

A waitlist control with usual-care was deemed the most ethical choice for control, as it allows for the testing of experimental effects and provides all participants the opportunity to benefit from the intervention  [35] . After baseline survey completion, participants were randomised in a uniform 1:1 allocation ratio to the Intervention (brief 3-month EndoSMS) and Control (waitlist) condition, using an online central randomization program (randomizer.org). Generation of the allocation sequence was conducted by the lead investigator (KS), with participants allocated by the research assistant (MP). Due to the behavioral nature of this trial, no blinding took place. Participants were told the aim of the study was to understand the impact of a text messaging program designed to support individuals with endometriosis. This research followed Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health Research (EQUATOR) recommendations regarding the conduct of health research  [36] . This protocol adheres to SPIRIT guidelines for clinical trial protocols (see Supplementary File 1)  [37] . The trial is registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry (#ACTRN12621001642875) and CON-SORT guidelines were followed for the conduct and reporting of the pilot  [38] ."

Individuals providing online informed consent and meeting eligibility criteria were invited to provide contact details (including their nominated mobile phone number) and then commence the online baseline survey (see Fig.  1 ) including measures of sociodemographic, medical (including whether they have difficulty remembering to take prescribed medication for endometriosis) and psychological variables. Preferred time to receive a text message was also measured at baseline (i.e., morning, daytime, evening).\n\nAll participants completing at least 70% of the baseline survey were randomized to either the Intervention (EndoSMS messaging for 3months) or Control (waitlist care as usual) condition. Within 48 h of baseline survey completion, participants were notified of their assignment: Intervention participants then started receiving the text messages and Control participants were informed they can opt-in to receive the text messages after the 3-month survey completion.\n\nThree months later, participants were sent an email containing a link to the online follow-up survey re-assessing outcome variables. Additionally, Intervention participants were asked to provide quantitative and qualitative feedback on their user experience with EndoSMS. After completing the follow-up survey, Waitlist participants were invited via email to opt-in to receive EndoSMS for a period of 3-months. Nonresponding participants for the follow-up survey received three reminders via email (one week late), text message (2 weeks' late), and phone call (2+ weeks late) requesting them to complete the survey. Ethics approval was granted from the Macquarie University Human Research Ethics Committee (#52021963527729)."

      "text": "EndoSMS is designed to provide supportive text messages to individuals living with endometriosis  [21] . Messaging covers a range of domains including: general endometriosis information; physical health; emotional health; looking after and caring for your body; social support, patient empowerment; and, interpersonal issues. For this feasibility study, participants received four semi-personalised text messages (to their preferred name) delivered to their nominated mobile phone number each week for three months, free of charge. Each text message has a maximum of 160 characters and should take less than 1 min to read. EndoSMS was developed using an established mixed-methods process  [39] , including consumers and a research-trained citizen collaborator as co-designers. The detailed development process is reported separately  [21] . Briefly, the intervention content and format was derived from the preferences expressed in focus groups and surveys, conducted with individuals with endometriosis, and relevant health professionals and researchers.\n\nTo ensure all 371 developed text messages are evaluated, Intervention participants received one of eight sets of 48 unique text messages (i. e., four messages per week over 12 weeks) containing a random assortment of different text message themes. In two subsets, four text messages from the general bank were replaced by four messages designed to assist individuals in taking prescription medication. These two subsets were randomly assigned to Intervention participants who indicated difficulties remembering to take medication. All other Intervention participants were randomly assigned to one of the six remaining text message sets. Participants who nominated a preferred time of day (i. e., morning 9-12pm, daytime 9-5pm, night-time 5-9pm) were allocated their text messages accordingly. Participants not providing a time preference were defaulted to receive the daytime slot. Text messages were sent using an automated system."

An a-priori power analysis using G*Power indicated a sample size of 265 participants was necessary to detect a small-to-moderate change in the primary outcome of EHP-30 emotional wellbeing, with three covariates. This was guided by the RCT results of a less psychologically focused, 6-month text message intervention conducted by the authors  [46] , which recorded a small change in quality of life post-intervention, in a different health population (breast cancer survivors). Hence, we recruited a sample (N = 274) of just over 265 participants, largely evenly distributed (139 Intervention, 135 Waitlist) across the conditions, to gain indicative data on the full intervention's potential benefit."

      "title": "4.. Discussion",
      "text": "The EndoSMS pilot and feasibility trial will provide valuable insights into the impact of a co-designed mHealth text message intervention developed specifically to meet the diverse needs of individuals with endometriosis  [21] . These findings will extend the emerging evidence based demonstrating the feasibility  [31]  and efficacy of psychologically-focused text message interventions  [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . With a focus on providing psychologically-supportive messaging  [21] , we anticipate the greatest benefits derived from EndoSMS will be improvements in wellbeing as reflected by endometriosis-specific QoL and psychological distress. We further anticipate that the highly accessible EndoSMS intervention  [21]  may be particularly suited for individuals geographically isolated from specialist clinics (e.g., those living in regional/rural locations)  [52] [53] [54]  or for those experiencing other barriers to healthcare access (e.g., perceived stigma)  [55, 56] . Moreover, individuals taking hormone treatments for endometriosis tend to experience a number of side effects  [54] , which may impair QoL, and thus may respond more to a supportive intervention such as EndoSMS.\n\nIdentifying the characteristics of users most likely to benefit from the EndoSMS intervention in this pilot and feasibility study, combined with open-ended program feedback, will help elucidate the barriers and enablers to widespread implementation of the text message program.\n\nWhen considering this protocol, some risks and limitations need to be considered. A key limitation is that these data will only reflect a brief, shortened version of the EndoSMS intervention (i.e., 3-months of text messaging) contrary to the intended 6-month text message delivery and short-term outcomes. Clearly, future large-scale efficacy trials are needed to assess the full impact of the EndoSMS intervention delivered over a six month period, as intended. Further, the pilot study design precludes any possibility of controlling for differences in clinical care provided to study participants, a factor that may impact on our outcomes, particularly self-efficacy. Future large scale efficacy trials stratified by factors such as clinical care are needed to provide longer term efficacy data. As an mHealth intervention, by its very nature EndoSMS precludes access to those who are not mobile phone users; yet, with mobile phone use largely ubiquitous in young to middle-aged adults (the age groups most affected by endometriosis  [8] ), this risk is minimal. Since the cost of delivering the EndoSMS messages is supported by the funder of this research (Endometriosis Australia), there should be no financial barriers to participation in this study. Further, although SMS-system delivery analytics provide some indication of intervention adherence, it will not be possible to assess true drop-out from text message interventions, where participants may simply block the study number."
