  "abstract": "Human behavior shows large interindividual variation in temporal organization. Extreme \"larks\" wake up when extreme \"owls\" fall asleep. These chronotypes are attributed to differences in the circadian clock, and in animals, the genetic basis of similar phenotypic differences is well established. To better understand the genetic basis of temporal organization in humans, the authors developed a questionnaire to document individual sleep times, self-reported light exposure, and self-assessed chronotype, considering work and free days separately. This report summarizes the results of 500 questionnaires completed in a pilot study. Individual sleep times show large differences between work and free days, except for extreme early types. During the workweek, late chronotypes accumulate considerable sleep debt, for which they compensate on free days by lengthening their sleep by several hours. For all chronotypes, the amount of time spent outdoors in broad daylight significantly affects the timing of sleep: Increased self-reported light exposure advances sleep. The timing of selfselected sleep is multifactorial, including genetic disposition, sleep debt accumulated on workdays, and light exposure. Thus, accurate assessment of genetic chronotypes has to incorporate all of these parameters. The dependence of human chronotype on light, that is, on the amplitude of the light:dark signal, follows the known characteristics of circadian systems in all other experimental organisms. Our results predict that the timing of sleep has changed during industrialization and that a majority of humans are sleep deprived during the workweek. The implications are far ranging concerning learning, memory, vigilance, performance, and quality of life.",

      "text": "Our daily life is organized by three different clocks: a solar clock, providing light and warmer temperatures during the day; a social clock, which we see or hear first thing on a working day; and a biological clock, which we sense most vividly when jet lagged, during shift work, or when adjusting to daylight sav-ings time. When shielded from the solar and the social clock (constant conditions), the biological clock \"runs free.\" In real life, however, circadian clocks are usually synchronized (entrained) to the 24 h of the solar clock  (Rajaratnam and Arendt, 2001; Roenneberg and Foster, 1997) . The major environmental signal for entrain-  Roenneberg et al. / LIFE BETWEEN CLOCKS 81  ment (zeitgeber) is light that, in mammals, can reach the biological clock only through the eyes (for references, see  Roenneberg and Merrow, 2002) .\n\nThe circadian clock controls physiology at many levels, from gene expression to complex behaviors (e.g., sleep and performance). As with other genetic traits, circadian properties depend on specific alleles of genes (clock genes; for review, see  Young and Kay, 2001) . In a given population, free-running periods are distributed around a species-specific mean both in animals  (Pittendrigh and Daan, 1976)  and in humans (e.g.,  Dijk and Lockley, 2002; Klerman, 2001; Wever, 1979) . These circadian differences can also be seen when the clock is entrained because the phase angle between dawn and activity onset depends on the individual free-running period  (Aschoff, 1979; Duffy et al., 2001; Roenneberg and Merrow, 2000) . Human preferences in the timing of sleep and wake (called \"chronotypes,\" such as \"larks\" and \"owls\") are, at least partly, based on genetics  (Ebisawa et al., 2001; Jones et al., 1999; Katzenberg et al., 1998; Toh et al., 2001) .\n\nChronotypes have been assessed mainly by questionnaires designed to associate individuals to tendencies that were coined \"morningness\" or \"eveningness\"  (Horne and \u00d6stberg, 1976) . The questions used are mostly subjective, relating sleep and activity times to a personal \"feeling best rhythm\"  (Horne and \u00d6stberg, 1976)  or to the habits of others (e.g., \"I get up later than most people\")  (Smith et al., 2002) , or they ask subjects to assess hypothetical situations (e.g., \"Approximately what time would you get up if you were entirely free to plan your day?\")  (Terman and White, 2001) . These questionnaires yield plausible results, yet oddly enough, in terms of \"real\" behavior, they do not explicitly assess free days and workdays separately nor do they ask for actual sleep times  (Putilov, 2000)  or exposure to outdoor light. These details have, so far, been addressed only in a questionnaire assessing seasonality  (Wirz-Justice et al., 1996 , 2003) .\n\nA growing number of studies investigate the genetic basis of the human circadian clock and its relationship to abnormal sleep times using the existing questionnaires (e.g.,  Ebisawa et al., 2001; Jones et al., 1999; Katzenberg et al., 1998) . However, determination of circadian genes in experimental organisms stems from the excellent ability to quantify circadian outputs (e.g., period length). Thus, successful genetic research into the human clock also requires a quantitative description of circadian traits. Although \"morningness\" scores correlate with the experimen-tally measured timing of the individual's circadian rhythms, for example, temperature, melatonin, or cortisol  (Bailey and Heitkemper, 2001; Duffy et al., 1999 Duffy et al., , 2001)) , the genetics behind \"morningness\" and \"eveningness\" are far from straightforward  (Duffy and Czeisler, 2002; Duffy et al., 1999; Vink et al., 2001) .\n\nWe have developed a new questionnaire to quantitatively assess the timing of sleep within the 24-h day (sleep phase) using simple questions (see the Methods section). The results of this pilot study show that although indicated sleep times correlate well with chronotype self-assessment, they are very different between workdays and free days. Most important, phase and duration of sleep on free days strongly depend on (1) the amount of sleep obtained during the workweek and (2) the amount of time subjects spend outdoors in daylight. Thus, timing of sleep is a good indicator for the underlying chronotype when corrected for these factors."

All questionnaires were filled in voluntarily, and subjects were informed about confidentiality and data handling on a cover page (not shown). We continue to distribute and evaluate the questionnaire in a project that searches for extreme chronotypes and their families, and the results presented here prove to be extremely stable. This first report concentrates on the temporal distribution of daily behavior and therefore does not address all questions. The temporal structure of daily life was assessed separately for workdays and free days. Subjects are explicitly asked to describe their behavior for normal circumstances, that is, without partying. In addition, subjects self-rated their chronotype category based on a description (0 = extreme early, 1 = moderate early, 2 = slight early, 3 = normal, 4 = slight late, 5 = moderate late, 6 = extreme late; see questionnaire in Fig.  1 ).\n\nA preliminary validation was carried out in a random sample of subjects (N = 30) who kept a sleep log for 5 weeks after completing the questionnaire. Actual and indicated sleep times on both workdays and free days correlated highly (p < 0.0001) with slopes around"

For an investigation of chronotypes, it is necessary to define a single phase reference point (e.g., onset, midpoint, or offset). Sleep onset was calculated by subtracting the indicated time it took to fall asleep from the given bedtime. We chose the midpoint between sleep onset and wake up (midsleep) as the phase reference point for sleep (see also  Benoit et al., 1981) . Midsleep has also been reported as the best phase anchor point for melatonin onset  (Terman et al., 2001) ."

      "text": "Midsleep times show a normal distribution for different age groups both on workdays and free days. During the workweek (Fig.  2A ), the phase of midsleep is latest for young adults (21 to 30 years of age), with adults (> 30) and adolescents (< 21) sleeping slightly earlier (see Table  1 ). The distributions are drastically different on free days (Fig.  2B ): All three become wider and shift to later hours. Adolescents delay their sleep on average by almost 3 h, young adults by approxi-mately 2 h, and adults by 1 h. Analysis of variance (two-way ANOVA) shows a significant difference in midsleep between workdays and free days and between the different age groups (p < 0.0001; interaction: p < 0.0001). ANOVA subanalyses reveals the difference between the age groups to be more significant on free days (p < 0.0001) than on workdays (p < 0.001). The fact that self-selected sleep of adolescents occurs much later than in other ages has already been shown  (Carskadon et al., 2001 (Carskadon et al., , 1999)) , and the consequences on performance and health have been well documented  (Fallone et al., 2001) .\n\nSleep duration also differs markedly between workdays and free days (Fig.  2C ). On average, subjects sleep 1 h longer on free days, with extreme individuals sleeping as long as 12 h. Women sleep only slightly longer than do men (see Table  1 ; ANOVA shows this difference to be significant only on workdays, p = 0.002), and men sleep on average slightly later than do women (see Table  1 ), although ANOVA shows this difference to be not statistically significant."

Overall, self-awareness of chronotype is in excellent agreement with the quantitatively assessed sleep times (onset, offset, and midsleep correlate significantly with qualitative chronotype; p < 0.001). Predictably, wake up on workdays, being dictated by the social clock, has the weakest correlation, and midsleep on free days has the highest (r = 0.3 vs. r = 0.6; see also  Bailey and Heitkemper, 1991) . The gender differences in the quantitative assessment (see Table  1 ) are also present in the qualitative assessment.

Error bars in this and other figures represent  Chronotype-specific differences are much more pronounced on free days (Fig.  3C ,  D ).\n\nThe graphs in Fig.  3  also show how long individuals take to feel fully awake. This time is comparable to the so-called sleep inertia, characterized by decreased vigilance and performance  (Ferrara and De Gennaro, 2000) . It spans the transition from sleep to the fully awake state and is different from the time to wake up. While the latter is relatively short, the former can last hours. On workdays, the time to feel fully awake increases with later chronotypes but runs parallel to sleep onset; that is, the shorter the sleep, the longer the sleep inertia. On free days, sleep inertia is independent of chronotype or sleep duration (parallel to wakeup in Fig.  3C ,  D ) and lasts on average 1 h.\n\nThe large differences in chronotype-specific sleep behavior between workdays and free days become even more apparent when subjects' average days are represented as 24-h dials (Fig.  4 ). While average workdays (top row) are similarly structured for all chronotypes (in spite of chronotype-dependent sleep onset and sleep inertia), it drastically changes on free days (bottom row). The immediate time to wake up (black areas) increases from early to late chronotype both on workdays and free days. The only factor independent of chronotype is average time of day when subjects experience a midday energy dip: This, however, differs greatly between workdays (13.4 \u00b1 2.3 h) and free days (15.4 \u00b1 2.4 h)."

      "text": "A chronotype-specific sleep-onset time exists even on workdays despite similar wake-up times for all chronotypes (Figs.  3  and  4 ), indicating that the social clock is not a strong enough zeitgeber to advance the circadian clock or the phase of sleep. Later chronotypes, therefore, accumulate a considerable sleep debt during the workweek, which they compensate for on free days (see diverging regression lines in Fig.  5 ). Except for the 4 extreme early subjects, all chronotypes maintain a weekly average sleep duration of 7 h, 41 min \u00b1 59 min (chronotype-specific weekly averages are indicated as bars).\n\nIn contrast to the loss of sleep of late chronotypes during the workweek, early chronotypes tend to suffer from sleep loss on free days when they comply with social pressures (from the majority, who are late chronotypes) to stay up late. Subjects were asked to state both the time at which they actually wake up and the time until when they would like to sleep on free days. On average, extreme early chronotypes (judged by midsleep) would like to sleep 3.5 h more than they actually do. This difference steadily shrinks to an average of 6 min in extreme late chronotypes. Whereas the social clock wakes late chronotypes too early on workdays, the biological clock wakes early chronotypes too early on free days.\n\nThe most recent sleep study in the United States (N = 1000, older than 18 years) investigated a large number of sleep variables, although timing of sleep was not investigated (see  www.sleepfoundation.org ). The ratios of sleep duration between workdays and free days and between men and women are comparable with our study, but U.S. citizens, on average, sleep less than the European population investigated here (workweek: 6 h, 54 min, compared to 7 h, 22 min; weekends: 7 h, 30 min, compared to 8 h, 27 min; see Table  1 ).

      "text": "The phase of entrainment not only depends on the free-running period (see the opening section of this article) but also on the strength of the zeitgeber (i.e., on the difference between daytime and nighttime light intensity). Mid-daytime light intensities outdoors range from 10,000 to many tens of thousands lux depending on cloud cover, while most indoor environments are generally below 400 lux. Subjects were, therefore, asked to indicate their average duration of exposure to outdoor light on workdays and free days. A previous study comparing self-reported light exposure and daily light logs has shown good consistency  (Wirz-Justice et al., 1996) . On average, subjects spend 1.5 h outdoors on workdays and almost 4 h on free days, with extremes of 5 min and 8 h, respectively. The average phase of midsleep on free days correlates significantly with the average weekly self-reported light exposure (5 \u00d7 workday + 2 \u00d7 free day; Fig.  6 ); the longer the exposure to outdoor light, the more advanced the sleep period.

Because late chronotypes have less time to spend outdoors in daylight, we also correlated midsleep to the relative time spent outdoors (percentage of remaining daylight after wake up), which gave comparable results (not shown).\n\nJudged by the self-reports of light exposure, zeitgeber strength affects the phase of entrainment in humans, as it does in other organisms. On average, each additional hour spent outdoors per day corresponds to an advance of sleep of almost 30 min. This phase dependency is much more likely to be caused by the light exposure than the possibility that people are more active when outdoors because activity has been shown to have little effect on the circadian clock in humans  (Beersma and Hiddinga, 1998)  while the timing of (strong outdoor) light has been shown to affect the phase of sleep  (Okudaira et al., 1983; Savides et al., 1986) . The averages and the trend shown in Fig.  6  are consistent with the majority of individuals whose clock has to be advanced each day (see discussion in the next section). Individuals whose clock has to be delayed by the zeitgeber would show the opposite effect; that is, they would entrain at a later phase with increasing light exposure."

    {
      "title": "Chronotypes in the Context of Circadian Theory",
      "text": "In this section, we hypothesize on how the described preliminary results on light and chronotype distribution can be explained by circadian formalisms relating the free-running period to the phase of entrainment. The free-running period measured in humans who are shielded from the solar and the social clock is influenced by behavior (switching lights on and off or closing eyes during sleep). Initial studies  (Wever, 1979) , disregarding behavioral influences, and studies of blind people  (Klerman, 2001)  showed the human circadian period to be close to 25 h. More recent studies that controlled for behavior  (Dijk and Lockley, 2002; Klerman, 2001)  or forced desynchrony protocols  (Beersma and Hiddinga, 1998; Czeisler et al., 1999)  have revealed an intrinsic, free-running period to be very close to 24 h. These protocols are, however, neither relevant for the evolution of the circadian clock nor for the everyday life described in our questionnaires. To put our results into the context of circadian theory, we therefore based our theoretical considerations on a distribution of circadian periods that includes the influences of behavior (Fig.  7A ) with a mean between 24 and 25 h.\n\nAccording to well-proven circadian mechanisms, the characteristics of entrainment by light (e.g., its phase relationship to the zeitgeber) depend on the fact that light shifts the circadian phase by different amounts and in different directions depending on when the circadian clock is exposed to light. Using single light exposures in otherwise constant conditions, so-called phase response curves (PRCs) can be established that indicate for each circadian time how much the clock is advanced (by definition, a positive value) or delayed (by definition, a negative value). These experiments have also been performed with humans (see discussion and references for human PRCs in  Beersma and Daan, 1993) . Depending on intensity and duration of the light signal, circadian systems respond more or less strongly, leading to steeper or flatter PRCs (see hypothetical curves in Fig.  7B  and  D ).\n\nThe phase of entrainment depends on how much and in what direction the free-running period deviates from 24 h, that is, how much the daily light signal has to advance or delay the clock. Thus, the phase of entrainment depends both on the strength of the zeitgeber and on the individual's free-running period. The extremes of the hypothetical period distribution (Fig.  7A ) are indicated by the black and the gray line for long and short periods, respectively. For entrainment to a 24-h day, subjects with a period shorter than 24 h have to be delayed, while those with a longer period have to be advanced by the daily light signals (see black and gray horizontal arrows in Fig.  7B ,  D ). When the zeitgeber is strong (steep PRC in Fig.  7B ), the phases of the circadian clock at which light achieves these necessary phase shifts are close for the two extremes (see black and gray arrows in Fig.  7B ), resulting in a narrow chronotype distribution (black area in Fig.  7F ). With a weak zeitgeber (flat PRC curve in Fig.  7D ), the phases for the extremes are farther apart and the chronotype distribution is wide (hatched area in Fig.  7F ). Thus, via a PRC, the period distribution can be translated into a chronotype distribution, indicating that well-established circadian principles apparently also apply to humans.\n\nBecause the zeitgeber does not move toward the circadian clock, the clock has to move toward the zeitgeber. If light, for example, has to affect the circadian clock at an early phase (internal time) to achieve entrainment, the daily program has to settle at a later local time. To demonstrate the phase relationships between the biological and the solar clock, the times of the temperature minimum (approximately 2 h before wake up;  Dijk and Lockley, 2002)  are drawn in panels C and E of Fig.  7 . Subjects with a short free-running period (gray dots) will be entrained so that their temperature minimum lies earlier than those with a long period (black dots). With decreasing zeitgeber strength, the difference increases (Fig.  7C  vs. Fig. 7E ).\n\nThe phase distribution on free days for the entire sample population (thick line in Fig.  7G , combining the distributions shown in Fig.  2A ,  B ) is similar to the broad distribution for a weak zeitgeber (Fig.  7F ). Because exposure to outdoor light affects the phase of entrainment (Fig.  6 ), a rural lifestyle would have favored a narrower chronotype distribution (similar to the black distribution in Fig.  7F ). We are currently conducting a survey, including the use of actimeters with integrated light meters, addressing this prediction. Although this narrower distribution is similar to the distribution established from the questionnaires for workdays (thin curve in Fig.  7G ), there is a significant difference between the two. While one reflects entrainment of biological clocks by a strong zeitgeber, the other reflects the effect of the social clock."

      "text": "Proverbs praising early chronotypes are abundant, but the results shown here indicate that worm catchers are rare birds in modern society. Paradoxically, most work schedules are still tailored for this lark minority (note the small differences between workdays and free days for early chronotypes in Figs.  3  and  4 ). Experiments in microorganisms, plants, and animals  (Roenneberg and Merrow, 2002) , as well as humans  (Beersma and Daan, 1993; Czeisler, 1995) , show that light is the major zeitgeber for the circadian clock, and our results indicate that the broader and later distribution of chronotypes is, at least partly, due to the absence of a strong zeitgeber in modern society. There are major consequences of a redistribution of circadian phase. Large portions of society suffer from too little sleep during the workweek  (Figs. 3, 4, and 5) . Although the subjects contributing to this study average 7 h, 41 min, of sleep per day, many do so only by spending almost half of their free days asleep (Fig.  2B ). Sleep debt and long sleep inertia times are known to decrease attention, performance, mood  (Dinges et al., 1997) , and memory consolidation  (Karni and Sagi, 1993) . The consequences are multifarious, ranging from higher accident rates due to increased sleep inertia and decreased vigilance  (Bonnet and Arand, 1995)  to learning deficits in adolescents due to disturbed sleep patterns  (Carskadon et al., 2001) .\n\nOur results are also relevant for refining the search for the genes responsible for circadian timing. Chronotype, as described in this study, reflects both genetic and behavioral components as well as (selfreported) light exposure. When the genetic contribution to different chronotypes is approached by searching for subjects and families with extreme circadian qualities, it is important to consider both individual light exposure and sleep debt accumulated on workdays. So far, this is the first questionnaire that allows both. The search for extreme chronotypes will yield much cleaner phenotypes when a phase distribution of midsleep is calculated for a theoretical day of 12-h exposure to outdoor light and no sleep debt accumulated during the workweek. Those subjects who remain extreme chronotypes after recalculation will be good candidates for genetic evaluation.\n\nAlthough this first pilot study does not presume to be an entirely representative sample, it covers a wide age range. Predictions arising from the data set can be (and are being) tested in independent populations. They show how the temporal structure of our daily life is influenced by the complex interactions between three clocks: the sun, the social clock, and the biological clock."

Small error bars and good correlations are to be expected in Fig.3Dbecause sleep times on free days, by definition, determine the phase of midsleep (quantitative chronotypes). The tight statistics in the other panels, however, show the homogeneity of sleep behavior within the respective chronotypes. During the workweek (Fig.3A, B), early chronotypes fall asleep almost 2 h before the late chronotypes do. This difference shrinks down to 30 min at wake up, leading to a systematic shortening of sleep from early to late chronotype."

      "text": "Figure 7. Theoretical considerations. The distribution of circadian periods measured in humans in isolation shows a peak at periods longer than 24 h (A; the gray line marks the extreme short end of the period distribution and the black line the extreme long end). The responses of circadian systems to light signals at different times of the endogenous cycle can be illustrated with phase response curves (PRCs) that are steeper the stronger the light signal (B, D). The PRCs drawn here exemplify hypothetical phase shifts caused by a light centered on its midpoint (e.g., light from 6 to 18 h is represented by internal time 12 and would not lead to a phase shift regardless of its intensity). The necessary phase shifts to entrain circadian clocks that deviate from 24 h can be achieved only if the circadian clock positions itself at a given phase angle in respect to the light signal (gray and black arrows correspond to the extreme periods indicated in A). These phases of entrainment (dots exemplify the daily temperature minima; gray and black dots correspond to the extreme periods indicated in A) are shown in panels C and E for a strong and weak zeitgeber, respectively, in relationship to an average day with sunlight from 6 AM to 6 PM. The distribution of human periods and the different phase response curves for strong and weak zeitgebers lead to different chronotype distributions (F; black for strong and hatched for weak zeitgeber). In panel G, the distributions shown in Fig. 1A and B for different age groups are redrawn for the entire sample population. For details, see text."

Small error bars and good correlations are to be expected in Fig.3Dbecause sleep times on free days, by definition, determine the phase of midsleep (quantitative chronotypes). The tight statistics in the other panels, however, show the homogeneity of sleep behavior within the respective chronotypes. During the workweek (Fig.3A, B), early chronotypes fall asleep almost 2 h before the late chronotypes do. This difference shrinks down to 30 min at wake up, leading to a systematic shortening of sleep from early to late chronotype."

Like the distribution of timing of sleep, the distribution of sleep duration also changes drastically between workdays and free days (C; all ages).

The bins for grouping quantitative chronotypes by phase of midsleep are the same as in Fig. 1D. Thin horizontal lines represent standard deviation. Dots represent the times when subjects feel fully awake (end of sleep inertia). Regression lines are drawn through sleep onset, wake up, and the times when subjects feel fully awake. Due to their small number (n = 4) and unusually short sleep duration, extreme early chronotypes assessed quantitatively by indicated times were excluded from the regressions in panels B and D. All regressions in the respective panels are highly significant (regression coefficients, r, for the binned/raw data are given for sleep onset, wake up, and the times when subjects are \"fully awake\"): (A): 0.97/0.44, 0.92/0.30, 0.95/0.42; (B): 0.99/0.55, 0.88/0.60, 0.93/0.55; (C): 0.99/0.53, 0.97/0.32, 0.99/0.49; (D): 0.98/0.87, 0.997/0.93, 0.99/0.81."

      "description": "Figure 7. Theoretical considerations. The distribution of circadian periods measured in humans in isolation shows a peak at periods longer than 24 h (A; the gray line marks the extreme short end of the period distribution and the black line the extreme long end). The responses of circadian systems to light signals at different times of the endogenous cycle can be illustrated with phase response curves (PRCs) that are steeper the stronger the light signal (B, D). The PRCs drawn here exemplify hypothetical phase shifts caused by a light centered on its midpoint (e.g., light from 6 to 18 h is represented by internal time 12 and would not lead to a phase shift regardless of its intensity). The necessary phase shifts to entrain circadian clocks that deviate from 24 h can be achieved only if the circadian clock positions itself at a given phase angle in respect to the light signal (gray and black arrows correspond to the extreme periods indicated in A). These phases of entrainment (dots exemplify the daily temperature minima; gray and black dots correspond to the extreme periods indicated in A) are shown in panels C and E for a strong and weak zeitgeber, respectively, in relationship to an average day with sunlight from 6 AM to 6 PM. The distribution of human periods and the different phase response curves for strong and weak zeitgebers lead to different chronotype distributions (F; black for strong and hatched for weak zeitgeber). In panel G, the distributions shown in Fig. 1A and B for different age groups are redrawn for the entire sample population. For details, see text."
