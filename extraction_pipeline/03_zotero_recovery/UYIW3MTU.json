  "title": "Instruments measuring evidence-based practice behavior, attitudes, and self-efficacy among healthcare professionals: a systematic review of measurement properties",
  "abstract": "Background Evidence-based practice (EBP) is well known to most healthcare professionals. Implementing EBP in clinical practice is a complex process that can be challenging and slow. Lack of EBP knowledge, skills, attitudes, self-efficacy, and behavior can be essential barriers that should be measured using valid and reliable instruments for the population in question. Results from previous systematic reviews show that information regarding highquality instruments that measure EBP attitudes, behavior, and self-efficacy in various healthcare disciplines need to be improved. This systematic review aimed to summarize the measurement properties of existing instruments that measure healthcare professionals' EBP attitudes, behaviors, and self-efficacy. \n Methods We included studies that reported measurement properties of instruments that measure healthcare professionals' EBP attitudes, behaviors, and self-efficacy. Medline, Embase, PsycINFO, HaPI, AMED via Ovid, and Cinahl via Ebscohost were searched in October 2020. The search was updated in December 2022. The measurement properties extracted included data on the item development process, content validity, structural validity, internal consistency, reliability, and measurement error. The quality assessment, rating of measurement properties, synthesis, and modified grading of the evidence were conducted in accordance with the COSMIN methodology for systematic reviews. Results Thirty-four instruments that measure healthcare professionals' EBP attitudes, behaviors or self-efficacy were identified. Seventeen of the 34 were validated in two or more healthcare disciplines. Nurses were most frequently represented (n = 53). Despite the varying quality of instrument development and content validity studies, most instruments received sufficient ( +) ratings on content validity, with the quality of evidence graded as \"very low\" in most cases. Structural validity and internal consistency were the measurement properties most often assessed, and reliability and measurement error were most rarely assessed. The quality assessment results and overall rating of these measurement properties varied, but the quality of evidence was generally graded higher for these properties than for content validity. Conclusions Based on the summarized results, the constructs, and the population of interest, several instruments can be recommended for use in various healthcare disciplines. However, future studies should strive to use qualitative methods to further develop existing EBP instruments and involve the target population.",

      "text": "Evidence-based practice (EBP) is well known to most healthcare professionals. EBP refers to the integration of the best available research evidence with clinical expertise and patient characteristics and preferences  [1] . EBP has become the gold standard in healthcare. Implementing EBP in clinical practice is associated with high-quality care, such as improved patient outcomes, reduced costs, and increased job satisfaction  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] .\n\nImplementing EBP in clinical practice is a complex process that is challenging and slow  [3, 7] . The implementation of EBP can be hindered by barriers, including organizational, cultural, or clinician-related factors. At clinician-related level, research shows that a lack of EBP knowledge, insufficient skills, negative attitudes, low selfefficacy, and lack of EBP behaviors can be essential barriers  [8, 9] . The different steps of the EBP process require that healthcare professionals understand the concepts of EBP (knowledge) and have the practical skills to do EBP activities, such as searching electronic databases or using critical appraisal tools (skills)  [1, 10] . Further, the healthcare professionals' confidence in their ability to perform EBP activities (self-efficacy), and their beliefs in the positive benefits of EBP (attitudes), are known to be associated with the likelihood of EBP being successfully implemented in clinical practice (behavior)  [10] [11] [12] .\n\nStrategies to improve EBP implementation should be tailored based on the healthcare professionals' perceived barriers  [13] [14] [15] . However, many healthcare institutions are unaware of potential barriers that could be related to EBP knowledge, skills, attitudes, self-efficacy, and behavior among their workers  [7] . These EBP constructs should be measured using valid and reliable instruments for the population in question  [10] . Former systematic reviews have recommended using and further developing instruments such as the Fresno test as a measure of EBP knowledge and skills across healthcare disciplines based on existing documentation of validity and reliability on this instrument  [7, 10, [16] [17] [18] [19] . However, such clear recommendations do not exist for instruments that measure EBP attitudes, self-efficacy, and behavior.\n\nAlthough several reviews have assessed instruments that measure EBP attitudes, behavior or self-efficacy  [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] , none focused on all three constructs, nor did they include studies across different healthcare disciplines. For instance, Hoegen et al.  [20]  included only self-efficacy instruments, and Oude Rengerink et al.  [21]  included only instruments measuring EBP behavior. The reviews from Belita et al.  [25] , Hoegen et al.  [20] , Leung et al.  [22] , Fern\u00e1ndez-Dom\u00ednguez et al.  [24] , and Buchanan et al.  [23]  included studies from one specific healthcare discipline only. A review focusing on all three constructs are needed, given the known associations between these constructs  [10] [11] [12] . In addition, including studies across different healthcare disciplines could make the review more relevant for researchers targeting an interdisciplinary population.\n\nMethodological limitations across several previous reviews may influence whether one can trust existing recommendations. Although most of the reviews evaluated the included instruments' measurement properties  [20, [22] [23] [24] [25] , only Hoegen et al.  [20]  and Buchanan et al.  [23]  assessed the risk of bias in the studies included. In addition, none of the reviews rated the quality of the instruments' development processes in detail  [26] , and only Hoegen et al.  [20]  graded the quality of the total body of evidence per instrument using a modified GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) approach.\n\nIn short, the results from previous systematic reviews show that information regarding high-quality instruments that measure EBP attitudes, behavior, and self-efficacy among various healthcare disciplines is still lacking. A methodologically sound review is needed to evaluate whether instruments that measure EBP attitudes, behavior, and self-efficacy can be recommended across different healthcare disciplines."

Data on the instruments were also extracted, including instrument name, EBP constructs measured (EBP attitudes, behaviors, and self-efficacy), theoretical framework used, EBP steps covered (ask, search, appraise, integrate, evaluate), number of items, number of subscales, scale type, instrument language, availability of questions, and translation procedure. Data on the EBP constructs measured were based on definitions from the CREATE framework (Classification Rubric for Evidence-Based Practice Assessment Tools in Education)  [10] . In line with the CREATE framework, we defined the EBP constructs as follows: (1) EBP attitudes: the values ascribed to the importance and usefulness of EBP in clinical decision-making, (2) EBP selfefficacy: the judgment regarding one's ability to perform a specific EBP activity, and (3) EBP behavior: what is being done in practice. Finally, data on the instrument's measurement properties were extracted, including data on the item development process, content validity, structural validity, internal consistency, reliability, and measurement error. Data extraction on all items was performed by the first author."

The review members followed COSMIN's four-point rating system, rating the standard of each property as \"very good, \" \"adequate, \" \"doubtful, \" or \"inadequate\"  [27] . The lowest rating per measurement property was used to determine the risk of bias on that particular property, following the \"worst score counts\" principle  [32] .

The review members rated all the results separately, and a consensus was reached in face-to-face meetings. Instrument development and content validity studies were rated independently by the review authors according to criteria determining whether the instrument's items adequately reflected the construct to be measured  [26] . These included five criteria on relevance, one criterion on comprehensiveness, and four criteria on comprehensibility  [26] . The relevance, comprehensiveness, and comprehensibility per study were rated as sufficient (+), insufficient (-), inconsistent (+ / -) or indeterminate (?). The reviewers also rated the instruments themselves. An overall rating was given for the relevance, comprehensibility, and comprehensiveness of each instrument, combining the results from the ratings of each study with the reviewers' ratings on the same instrument. The overall rating could not be indeterminate (?) because the reviewers' ratings were always available  [26] . The assessment of instrument development studies included evaluating the methods used to generate items (concept elicitation) and the methods used to test the new instrument  [26] . COSMIN recommends using qualitative methods, involving the target population, when developing instrument items  [26] .\n\nResults for structural validity, internal consistency, reliability, and measurement error were rated independently against the COSMIN criteria for good measurement properties  [28, 33, 34] . Each measurement property was rated as sufficient ( +), insufficient ( -) or indeterminate (?). To conclude each instrument, an overall rating was given for each instrument per property by jointly assessing the results from all the available studies. If the results per property per instrument were consistent, the results could be qualitatively summarized and rated overall as sufficient ( +), insufficient ( -), inconsistent (+ / -) or indeterminate (?). More information on the COSMIN criteria for good measurement properties is provided in Additional file 2. Details on the COSMIN guideline for assessing and calculating structural validity, internal consistency, reliability, and measurement error can be found elsewhere  (28, 31) ."

The GRADE approach is used to grade the quality of evidence on four levels: high, moderate, low, and very low  [35] . We used the COSMIN's modified GRADE approach, where four of the five original GRADE factors are adopted for grading the quality of evidence in systematic reviews of patient-reported outcome measures  [28] . We downgraded the quality of evidence when there was concern about the results related to any of these four factors: risk of bias, inconsistency, imprecision or indirectness. Further details on the modified GRADE approach are provided in \"COS-MIN methodology for systematic reviews of Patient-Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs)-user manual\"  [28] . The quality of evidence was not graded in cases where the overall rating for a measurement property was indeterminate (?)  [28] .

Some of these studies used qualitative methods to generate items, but the method, or parts of it, was not clearly described. In other studies, it was doubtful whether the included sample was representative of the target population, and some used quantitative methods. Some studies were rated as \"doubtful\" if it was stated that authors of these studies had talked or discussed the items with relevant healthcare professionals as a part of concept elicitation, but it was doubtful whether this method was suitable. Finally, 12 studies received an \"inadequate\" quality rating for concept elicitation  [56, 63-65, 71, 73, 79, 87, 102, 111] . In these cases, it was clear that no qualitative methods that involved members of the target population were used when generating items. The item generation was usually based on theory, research, or existing instruments. Content validity was also assessed as part of the development studies with cognitive interviews or pilot tests or in separate content validity studies performed after the instrument was developed, primarily studies translating an instrument. Some development studies assessed comprehensibility  [47, 56, 65, 68, 73, 76, 78, 82, 87, 89, 93, 95, 105, [107] [108] [109] [110] [111]  or comprehensiveness  [65, 68]  with interviews or pilot tests on samples representing the target population. These were rated as either \"adequate\"  [93, 107]  or \"doubtful\" quality [47, 56, 65, 68, 73, 76, 78, 82, 87, 89, 95, 105, 108-111]. The rest of the development studies could not be rated, either because it was unclear whether a pilot test or interview was performed, or which aspect of content validity was assessed. Most of the content validity studies assessed comprehensibility [41, 49, 51, 52, 54, 58, 59, 84, 88, 90, 92, 97-101, 103, 106] and only a few assessed relevance or comprehensiveness [59, 84, 88, 99, 103]. All content validity studies were rated as doubtful quality [41, 49, 51, 52, 54, 58, 59, 84, 88, 90, 92, 97-101, 103, 106]."

Most instruments were rated as sufficient ( +) on relevance and comprehensibility, and only 6 out of 34 instruments were rated as insufficient ( -) on comprehensiveness. The quality of evidence was graded as \"very low\" in most cases, primarily due to no content validity studies (or inadequate quality) and not enough evidence from (or inadequate quality of ) the development studies.

In both cases inadequate ratings were given due to low sample sizes  [31] .\n\nTo test internal consistency of the items, most studies calculated and reported a Cronbach's alpha (n = 67), and two studies calculated and reported a person separation index.

Six instruments were rated overall as insufficient ( -) structural validity (EBP belief-multifactorial, EBP implement-multifactorial, EBPPAS-s, EBP-KABQ, EBP-COQ Prof, and I-SABE), with the quality of evidence ranging from \"high\" to \"moderate. \" The reasons for downgrading were \"inconsistency\" and \"risk of bias. \" Four instruments were rated overall as inconsistent (+ / -) structural validity (EBPPAS, SE-EBP, EBP2, and EBPAS-36). In these three cases, results were inconsistent and it was not possible to give an overall rating as sufficient or insufficient (e.g., an overall rating based on the majority of studies)  [31] . Finally, four instruments were rated overall as indeterminate (?) structural validity (Al Zoubi Q, EBP Inventory, EBP capability beliefs, and Noor EBM) because not all the information needed for a sufficient rating was reported  [31] .\n\nRegarding internal consistency, 16 instruments were rated overall as indeterminate (?) (EBP belief-multifactorial, EBP implement-multifactorial, Al Zoubi Q, EBP Inventory, EBPPAS, EBPPAS-s, SE-EBP, EBPSE, EBP capability beliefs, EBP-KABQ, EBP2, EBP-COQ Prof, I-SABE, Noor EBM, Ethiopian EBP Implement, and EBPAS-36). Most of these instruments had Cronbach's alpha values that met the criteria for sufficient internal consistency (\u03b1 > 0.70). However, since evidence of structural validity is a prerequisite of internal consistency, they were rated as indeterminate (?) according to the COSMIN methodology  [28] . Furthermore, the summarized result of internal consistency was rated and graded per subscale in cases of multifactorial instruments. This led to several instruments receiving different ratings on different subscales, such as sufficient ( +), insufficient ( -) or inconsistent (+ / -) (EBPAS, MPAS, Quick EBP VIK, ISP-D, and EBNAQ). Seven multifactorial and five unidimensional instruments were rated as sufficient ( +) on all subscales or full scales (EBPAS-50, EBPQ, EBP Beliefs-single factor, EBP Implement-single factor, EBPP-S, EPIC, HEAT, HS-EBP, EBPRS, EBP Beliefs-Short, EBP Implement-Short, and EBP-CBFRI). The quality of evidence ranged from \"high\" to \"low, \" and the most common reason for downgrading was that the quality of evidence of structural validity on the same instrument set the starting point for the grading of internal consistency  [31] ."

      "text": "This review sought to summarize measurement properties of existing instruments that measure healthcare professionals' EBP attitudes, behaviors, and self-efficacy. We evaluated the instruments' development process, content validity, structural validity, internal consistency, reliability, and measurement error. Thirty-four instruments measuring EBP attitudes, behavior or self-efficacy, alone or combined, were identified.\n\nThe assessment of instrument development studies revealed that only three instruments received an \"adequate\" quality rating on concept elicitation (HS-EBP, ISP-D, and EIDM competence measure)  [85, 93, 107 ]. The rest were rated \"doubtful\" or \"inadequate. \" Reasons for \"doubtful\" ratings were mainly related to the quality of the qualitative methods used to generate items and \"inadequate\" ratings were given when no qualitative methods seemed to have been used. The use of well-designed qualitative methods when constructing the items is emphasized in the updated COS-MIN methodology (2018) that was used in this review  [26] . However, over two-thirds of the development studies included in this review were published before the updated COSMIN methodology was published in 2018  [26] . Thus, assessing instrument development studies based on a detailed and standardized methodology to which the developers did not have access when developing instruments can be somewhat strict. At the same time, the quality of the development process (concept elicitation) has not, to our knowledge, been rated in detail in previous reviews of EBP instruments  [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Thus, our findings underpin the importance that future instrument development studies should involve the target population using qualitative methods to generate items for an EBP instrument.\n\nOverall rating of results: ( +) = sufficient result; ( -) = insufficient result; (?) = indeterminate result; ( \u00b1) = inconsistent results Quality of evidence: Modified GRADE-approach  [28, 31] .

Although measuring \"how well items correlate, \" Cronbach's alpha is often misinterpreted as a measure of the dimensionality of a scale. Whether the scores on a scale reflect the dimensionality of the construct measured is defined as structural validity and is most often assessed by factor analysis ([112], p. 169-170,  [113] ). Evidence of unidimensionality of a scale or subscale is an assumption that needs to be verified before calculating Cronbach's alpha to assess the interrelatedness of the items  [113] . Though internal consistency helps assess whether items on a scale or subscale are related, evidence of structural validity must come first to ensure that the interrelated items are on a scale or subscale that also reflects the construct's dimensionality.

While 17 out of the 34 included instruments were validated on two or more healthcare disciplines, 17 were validated on only one [48, 64, 65, 71, 78-80, 87, 93, 95, 96, 102, 105, 107, 109, 110]. When an instrument is validated in only one healthcare discipline, the results from a validation study may not apply if an instrument is used on a population that differs from the one on which the instrument was validated ([114], p. 230-231). Studies have shown that there may be differences between healthcare disciplines in terms of self-reported levels of EBP knowledge, attitudes, and behavior [115, 116]. It is unknown whether interdisciplinary differences in EBP knowledge, attitudes or behavior would directly affect how the items in a questionnaire are understood or to what degree they are perceived as relevant. However, knowing that a questionnaire only can be considered valid for the population on which it has been validated ([112], p.58-59), readers of this review should bear in mind that the results may not be generalizable to other populations. Readers should have a clear conception of the population on which the instrument is tested and of the population intended to target when choosing an instrument for use in future studies or clinical practice. This review's inclusion of studies from various healthcare disciplines may have contributed new knowledge to the current evidence base, identifying several valid instruments over at least two disciplines.\n\nMost of the instruments included in this review were initially developed in English and in different Englishspeaking countries. Several of these instruments have been translated into other languages and used in various countries. Ideally, an instrument translation process should be conducted according to well-known guidelines to ensure that a translated instrument is valid in another language  [112, 117, 118] . In this review, we did not assess the quality of the translation process, as this was not part of the COSMIN methodology recommendations used to conduct this review  [26, 31] . As such, readers are advised to consider the quality of the translation process if they consider using results from studies included in this review that involved translations of instruments."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "Variations in definitions of EBP constructs between the included studies presented a challenge in the review process. Clearly defined constructs are essential to instrument development and are a prerequisite for using quantitative questionnaires to measure nonobservable constructs like EBP attitudes, self-efficacy, and behavior ([112], p. 151-152). In some cases, the differences in definitions of constructs and use of terminology made it challenging to classify the included instruments in terms of the EBP constructs measured. To meet this challenge, we classified the instruments using the CREATE framework's definitions of EBP attitudes, self-efficacy, and behavior mentioned earlier in this review  [10] . For some instruments, the constructs were defined with names and terminology other than those used in the CREATE framework. The differences in definitions of constructs and use of terminology may also have affected the study selection of this review, with potentially relevant studies being overlooked and not being included. To meet this challenge, all titles and abstracts were screened by two independent review members, and a third reviewer was consulted in cases of uncertainty. Still, relevant studies and instruments may have been missed. Even though EBP theory, models, and frameworks exist, there is still a need to develop a more cohesive and clear theoretical articulation regarding EBP and the measurement of it  [10, 119] .\n\nFurthermore, all the included instruments are selfreported, the most common method to measure EBP constructs. Some consider only objectively measured EBP outcomes as high-quality instruments due to the potential of recall and social desirability biases in selfreported instruments  [16, 17, 22, 23] . Despite the risk of bias, others recommend using self-reported instruments as a practical option when time is an issue and an extensive, objective measurement is practically impossible  [119] . In addition, it has been questioned whether the extensive focus on objectivity in EBP instruments is the only right way forward, and qualitative and mixed methods have been suggested for a richer understanding of EBP  [119] . The use of a standardized and rigorous methodology (COSMIN) throughout this review may have reduced possible methodological limitations and increased the likelihood that the results and recommendations could be trusted, despite the potential risk of bias connected to self-reported instruments."

      "title": "Rationale for recommendations and implications of future research",
      "text": "Recommendations of instruments in this review are based on the summarized results and grading of the evidence concerning the construct and population of interest. The recommendations are guided by the COSMIN methodology but are not categorized similarly  [31] . The three categories are categorized based on the number of healthcare disciplines on which the instrument is validated and on the number of EBP constructs the instrument measures. Common for all three categories is that, for an instrument to be recommended, there must be evidence of sufficient ( +) content validity (any level) and no high-quality evidence of any insufficient ( -) measurement properties  [31] . Being recommended means that an instrument has the potential to be recommended, even though it does not have exclusively high-quality evidence of sufficient measurement properties. This aligns with research that suggests building upon existing instruments when measuring EBP attitudes, self-efficacy, and behavior  [10] . Using and adapting existing instruments could also help to avoid the so-called \"one-time use phenomenon, \" where an instrument is developed for a specific situation and not further tested and validated in other studies ([120], p.238)."

      "text": "This review identified 34 instruments that measure healthcare professionals' EBP attitudes, behaviors, or self-efficacy. Seventeen instruments were validated in two or more healthcare disciplines. Despite the varying quality of instrument development and content validity studies, most instruments received sufficient ( +) ratings on content validity, though with a \"very low\" quality of evidence. The overall rating of structural validity, internal consistency, reliability, and measurement error varied, as did the quality of evidence.\n\nBased on the summarized results, the constructs, and the population of interest, we identified several instruments that have the potential to be recommended for use in different healthcare disciplines. Future research measuring EBP attitudes, behavior, and self-efficacy should strive to build upon and further develop existing EBP instruments. In cases where new EBP instruments are being developed, the generation of questionnaire items should include qualitative methods involving members of the target population. In addition, future research should focus on reaching a clear articulation of and a shared conception of EBP constructs."
