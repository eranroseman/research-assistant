  "title": "Telehealth methods to deliver dietary interventions in adults with chronic disease: a systematic review and meta-analysis 1,2",
  "abstract": "Background: The long-term management of chronic disease requires the adoption of complex dietary recommendations, which can be facilitated by regular coaching to support behavioral changes. Telehealth interventions can overcome patient-centered barriers to accessing face-to-face programs and provide feasible delivery methods, accessible regardless of geographic location. Objective: This systematic review assessed the effectiveness of telehealth dietary interventions at facilitating dietary change in chronic disease. Design: A structured systematic search was conducted for all randomized controlled trials evaluating multifactorial dietary interventions in adults with chronic disease that provided diet education in an intervention longer than 4 wk. Meta-analyses that used the random-effects model were performed on diet quality, dietary adherence, fruit and vegetables, sodium intake, energy, and dietary fat intake. Results: A total of 25 studies were included, involving 7384 participants. The telehealth dietary intervention was effective at improving diet quality [standardized mean difference (SMD): 0.22 (95% CI: 0.09, 0.34), P = 0.0007], fruit and vegetable intake [mean difference (MD) 1.04 servings/d (95% CI: 0.46, 1.62 servings/d), P = 0.0004], and dietary sodium intake [SMD: 20.39 (20.58, 20.20), P = 0.0001]. Single nutrients (total fat and energy consumption) were not improved by telehealth intervention; however, after a telehealth intervention, important clinical outcomes were improved, such as systolic blood pressure [MD: 22.97 mm Hg (95% CI: 25.72, 20.22 mm Hg), P = 0.05], total cholesterol [MD: 20.08 mmol/L (95% CI: 20.16, 20.00 mmol/L), P = 0.04], triglycerides [MD: 20.10 mmol/L (95% CI: 20.19, 20.01 mmol/L), P = 0.04], weight [MD: 20.80 kg (95% CI: 21.61, 0 kg), P = 0.05], and waist circumference [MD: 22.08 cm (95% CI: 23.97, 20.20 cm), P = 0.03]. Conclusions: Telehealth-delivered dietary interventions targeting whole foods and/or dietary patterns can improve diet quality, fruit and vegetable intake, and dietary sodium intake. When applicable, they should be incorporated into health care services for people with chronic conditions.",

      "text": "Chronic diseases are the leading cause of ill health, accounting for .68% of all deaths worldwide  (1) . Chronic diseases are characterized by a multifactorial etiology  (1) , including obesity, heart disease, diabetes mellitus, hypertension, stroke, and renal disease, which is often diet related  (2) . Self-management and the adoption of a healthy lifestyle, such as improved dietary habits, increased physical activity, and other health-related behaviors (e.g., smoking cessation) are considered essential for the management of chronic diseases  (3, 4) . Standard chronic disease care models, however, are followed by only a minority of patients for many reasons, including poor compliance and high patient burden  (5) . This suggests that the long-term maintenance of dietary behaviors cannot be facilitated with traditional models of care.\n\nIndividuals with multiple risk factors for cardiovascular disease (CVD)  6  and other chronic diseases have been identified as having higher levels of nonattendance in face-to-face (FTF) consultations  (6, 7) . Patient-centered barriers, including limited transport and geographical isolation, working hours, and forgetting about appointments, can contribute to appointment nonattendance  (8) . Additional health care barriers that can hinder access to traditional FTF care include administrative error, poor access to clinic facilities, limited parking, and unfavorable operating hours of clinics  (7) .\n\nTelehealth technologies can be used to provide education and self-management support to facilitate and sustain lifestyle changes and have several advantages over traditional FTF models 1 The authors reported no funding received for this study. JTK is supported by an Australian Post Graduate Award scholarship through Bond University.\n\n2 Supplemental Figures  1  and  2  and Supplemental Tables 1-3 are available from the \"Online Supporting Material\" link in the online posting of the article and from the same link in the online table of contents at  http://ajcn . nutrition.org. *To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Telehealth strategies may assist patients with chronic disease to achieve dietary behavioral change  (9) (10) (11)  and are flexible in time and location, with the potential to offer intensive interventions that may not be feasible with traditional care models. According to the WHO  (12) , telehealth refers to the delivery of health care services from a distance synchronously (i.e., same time, different location) and/or asynchronously (i.e., different time, different location), by use of information and communication technologies to exchange health information  (12) . A telehealth lifestyle intervention may offer flexibility in delivery mode involving the provision of health education or counseling individuals or groups remotely via the telephone  (13) , computer or Internet  (14) (15) (16) , video  (17) , e-mail  (18) , and/or mobile applications, including text and photo messaging  (19, 20) .\n\nAlthough a number of systematic reviews have covered different combinations of telehealth interventions in healthy  (21) (22) (23)  and chronic disease (24-27) populations, none have specifically evaluated interventions that attempt to change dietary patterns or target multiple dietary changes simultaneously (e.g., multiple food groups, nutrients). These diet interventions represent the dietary advice that is typically provided to chronic disease populations  (28) . This systematic review, therefore, aimed to assess the overall effectiveness of telehealth dietary interventions for facilitating multifactorial dietary change in adults with chronic disease."

There was no date or language restriction in our search strategy. A multistep search approach was taken to retrieve relevant studies through use of forward-and-backward citation searching; expert correspondence; search of conference abstracts, theses, and dissertations (ProQuest); and the International Clinical Trials Register search portal and clinicaltrials.gov to identify ongoing trials. This review follows the format recommended in the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis statement  (30) . Two review authors screened articles independently, with disagreements in judgment resolved by consensus or a third reviewer."

Studies were included in the review if they met all of the following criteria:\n\n1) randomized controlled trial (RCT), cluster RCT, or quasi-RCT; 2) adult participants (.18 y); 3) conducted in a population with an established diet-related chronic disease defined as obesity [BMI (in kg/m 2 ) $30], diabetes mellitus, heart disease, hypertension, stroke, or kidney disease  (29, 31) ; 4) provision of multifactorial dietary education in which the dose of total intervention contact hours and/or the total number of interaction contacts was $50% delivered by $1 telehealth strategy; 5) developed or delivered by a qualified health care professional (e.g., nurse, dietitian, physician); and 6) reported on any measure of dietary intake at baseline and $4 wk later at follow-up.\n\nWe defined a multifactorial dietary intervention as targeting more than a singular nutrient and/or food group. Multifactorial dietary interventions included those aimed at overall diet quality (assessed as any outcome that objectively scores adherence to dietary guidelines)  (32) (33) (34)  and patterns, such as the Mediterranean diet  (35)  and/or the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension diet  (36) , or those that educate patients about $2 dietary components (nutrients and/or food groups) simultaneously. Studies that targeted $2 diet changes within the same nutrient (e.g., manipulation of categories of fatty acids) were excluded because the dietary components related to only 1 nutrient, and thus were not classified as multifactorial.\n\nStudies were included if they compared a telehealth intervention to usual care (as defined by the trial authors); to dietary education in a FTF or group-based environment with no telehealth component; or via methods for which ,50% of the intervention was delivered by telehealth; or to a nondietaryfocused intervention.\n\nThe primary outcome was dietary intake (any measure), with secondary outcomes relating to clinical outcomes such as allcause mortality, cardiovascular mortality, hospitalizations, and clinical markers of chronic disease progression [e.g., blood pressure (BP), weight, blood lipid profiles]."

Means, SDs, SEs, or 95% CIs for all prespecified primary and secondary outcome data that were reported at baseline and follow-up were extracted for analysis.

      "text": "To calculate the overall treatment effect on primary and secondary outcomes, the difference between the intervention and comparison groups' change scores from baseline to the end of follow-up was extracted. If change from baseline values was not available, then end-of-intervention values were extracted, with the assumption that the baseline values were similar. The variance was calculated from the SD or SE from the difference between baseline and follow-up, or from the CI when these values were not available  (38) . When interventions and associated outcomes were assessed as sufficiently homogeneous and when sufficient information was available from the studies, quantitative data were pooled into Revman (version 5.3; Cochrane Collaboration) for meta-analysis through use of the DerSimonian-Laird random-effects model  (39)  and checked with the fixed-effects model to ensure robustness and susceptibility to potential outliers. The I 2 statistic was used to assess the inconsistencies between studies and describe the percentage of variability in effect. Heterogeneity was considered substantial if the I 2 statistic was $50%.\n\nEffect sizes (for combined fruit and vegetable servings, energy intake, blood pressure, weight, and lipid profiles) were converted to standard units and calculated as mean differences (MDs). Effect sizes for diet quality scores, dietary adherence, sources of dietary fat, and sources of dietary sodium intake were calculated as standardized MDs (SMDs) because of the variability in outcome measures. We imputed missing SDs for 1 study in the dietary sodium and systolic BP (SBP) analysis  (40)  with data from an included study that used similar methods and sample sizes  (41, 42) , as recommended  (43) . Egger's plot was explored to assess potential publication bias. Sensitivity analyses were conducted to investigate study results that appeared to be heterogeneous from the results of other analyzed studies, including large studies and high-risk-of-bias studies. Subgroup analyses also were conducted on different chronic health conditions (e.g., diabetes mellitus, CVD); studies that used different telehealth strategies; studies that targeted specified single food groups or nutrients (e.g., modifying sodium, fat, fruit, and/or vegetable interventions) compared with dietary patterns, and multiple lifestyle education interventions compared with solely dietary education interventions."

After this, 345 studies were excluded, leaving 25 for inclusion, involving 7384 participants. Supplemental Table  1  details the characteristics of the included studies, including the frequency of contact, delivery provider, and type of dietary education. In all but 4 studies  (42, (44) (45) (46) , dietary education was delivered as part of a multifactorial lifestyle intervention. Studies were conducted in CVD (15 studies)  (40) (41) (42) (46) (47) (48) (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) (54) (55) (56) (57) , diabetes mellitus (5 studies)  (44, (58) (59) (60) (61) , end-stage kidney disease (2 studies)  (45, 62) , obesity (1 study)  (14) , and a mix of CVD and diabetes mellitus (2 studies)  (13, 63) . The duration of studies ranged from 8 wk  (46, 48, 56)  to 8 y  (61) .

The study was assessed as a low risk of bias and led to significantly reduced allcause mortality in the telehealth group (15.3%) compared with usual care (16.1%; P , 0.05), HF admission (16.8% and 22.3%, respectively; P , 0.005), CV admission (24.1% and 30.1%, respectively; P , 0.006), and all-cause admission (34.3% and 39.1%, respectively; P , 0.05). In the study by Albert et al.

      "text": "Supplemental Figure  2  shows the risk of bias of the included studies. The risk of bias was low-to-moderate across the included studies. The majority (92%) of studies had adequate randomization; however, concealed allocation was reported in only 48% of the included studies, suggesting potential selection bias. Double blinding was achieved in only 1 study  (49) , and blinding of participants to treatment arm only was done in 1 study (41); however, intervention staff was aware of treatment allocation. All other trials were not able to blind participants, given the nature of dietary intervention to facilitate and modify behavior change. This means that detection bias was high in 80% of the dietary measures because they were self-reported. Attrition bias (through high loss to follow-up and no explanation of how such data were addressed) was judged to be high in 32% of studies. Furthermore, there appears to be reporting bias in  FIGURE 4  Effects of telehealth dietary interventions on total cholesterol and triglycerides (in millimoles per liter).

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "This systematic review assessed the effectiveness of complex telehealth dietary interventions for facilitating dietary change in adults with chronic disease. The primary finding was that dietary interventions delivered by telehealth effectively improved dietary adherence on a moderate scale and made small improvements in diet quality  (38) . Single macronutrients were less likely to be modified by telehealth intervention, including energy and total dietary fat intake, which were not significantly different between groups in the pooled analysis.\n\nTelehealth interventions resulted in a significant reduction in dietary sodium intake compared with nontelehealth interventions (SMD 20.39, P = 0.0001), which is considered a moderate effect statistically  (38) . All dietary sodium outcomes showed improved compliance with a reduced sodium intervention by use of telehealth. This has clinical implications for telehealth because it may provide a useful tool in future intervention studies, given that sodium modification is hampered by poor patient compliance in clinical practice  (64) . The finding that fruits and vegetables increased by 1 serving/d following telehealth interventions supports the potential for the use of these interventions to improve diet quality, which is a finding similar to a systematic review in telephone-based interventions in the general population  (65) . Although significant heterogeneity was observed, subanalysis by type of technology reduced the effect size to 0.8 servings/d, but remained significant. Fruit and vegetable consumption is a strong predictor of mortality, and the magnitude of change that we found may reduce the risk of allcause mortality  (66) . The European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition-Heart study estimated that an increase in every 80-g portion of fruit and vegetables was associated with a 4% reduction in risk of death  (67) .\n\nWhole-of-diet approaches, as opposed to isolated singlenutrient interventions, reflect how foods within the diet are consumed and have an impact on other nutrients when manipulated (e.g., a change in fat intake often results in a concomitant increase in the proportion of energy derived from carbohydrates). Developments in nutrition science recognize the effect of the complexity of foods consumed in combination on long-term CVD risk, weight regulation, and disease progression  (68) . Such approaches appreciate the interaction of foods and nutrients, which may be more relevant to chronic disease when examining the cumulative effect over time of food on health  (69, 70) . This shift in nutrition focus suggests that single-nutrient interventions will be used less often clinically and in public health practice  (68) , which is an important consideration for emerging telehealth interventions in the design of dietary educational content. Although we observed only small changes in diet quality, the magnitude of change demonstrated may result in a substantial public health benefit if adopted for secondary prevention of chronic disease  (71) . For example, higher-quality diet has been linked to a reduced risk of all-cause mortality in people .65 y (72). Although a stronger association was found when comparing the highest with the lowest quartiles, the risk decreases at each quartile above the lowest-quality diet  (72) . Furthermore, improving fruit and vegetable intake to better reflect dietary guidelines and therefore overall diet quality may reduce the complications of chronic disease  (33) , which have been demonstrated to result in a reduction in all-cause mortality of 21% during a 15-y follow-up period  (73) .\n\nDietary change through telehealth interventions can translate to small improvements in some clinical outcomes, such as a reduction in SBP of 3 mm Hg. Although this is slightly less than the larger-scale meta-analyses of all dietary sodium interventions in hypertension of 25 mm Hg, the effect size is similar to that in people without hypertension  (74) . A sustained change in SBP of 2-3 mm Hg in a period .6 mo has been suggested to translate into a reduced risk of cardiovascular events  (75) . Other risk factors such as weight, waist circumference, total cholesterol, and triglycerides improved significantly in some studies following telehealth interventions, whereas LDL, HDL, and HbA1c did not. The long-term studies (.12 mo) included were not adequately powered to detect BP and weight change at final follow-up, and the inclusion criteria meant that some larger trials were excluded because of the lack of reporting of dietary outcomes. For example, the Practice-based Opportunities for Weight Reduction study  (76)  observed a between-group change in SBP of 21.8 mm Hg and weight change of 24 kg after 24 mo in the telephone coaching group, but it was not possible to include it. This welldesigned trial supports the effects of telehealth interventions on surrogate CVD outcomes in chronic disease.\n\nA previous systematic review demonstrated that technologies such as telephone and video contact improved adherence to diet  (31) , which we have extended to improved dietary quality, improved fruit and vegetable intake, and reduced sodium intake when compared to usual chronic disease care. Telehealth may facilitate compliance with the diet via a variety of mechanisms beyond the provision of regular review and behavior prompting, although it is likely the most influential on sustained dietary change in our review  (9, 77) . Telehealth strategies offer feasible ways to facilitate dietary changes and offer advantages over FTF consultations, including flexibility (78) and a high rate of patient acceptability  (20, 79) . Smartphones are used by .75% of the population (80, 81), highlighting the widespread potential that telehealth interventions provide to improve access, coverage, and implantation methods, particularly in low socioeconomic populations  (24) . Because primary health care may hold the key to the dissemination of telehealth dietary delivery interventions, evaluation studies are needed. Process evaluation frameworks should be incorporated into future telehealth trials, reporting attendance and participation, acceptability, and costs, which will ultimately assist in their translation into clinical practice  (82) .\n\nTo our knowledge, our study is the first systematic review of telehealth strategies for facilitating multifactorial dietary change. Its strengths are the comprehensive search strategy used, the use throughout the review of 2 independent review authors, and the use of Cochrane methodology to appraise the risk of bias. The TIDieR checklist  (37)  was used to extract data, which allowed multiple sources of heterogeneity and intervention reporting inadequacies to be identified.\n\nOur review has several limitations, including that multifaceted dietary changes usually were a component of multiple lifestyle recommendations (22 of the 25 included studies), making it difficult to delineate the effect of isolated dietary intervention on clinical outcomes. Half of the included studies used telephone delivery methods; other telehealth technologies such as smartphone applications and Internet use were underrepresented and may reduce the generalizability of the findings.\n\nThis review highlights the need for future trials that aim to change dietary behavior with telehealth interventions other than telephone, such as mobile, Internet, or videoconference methods. The application of the TIDieR checklist highlights a need for better reporting of telehealth interventions, because many trials did not report important logistical data relating to intervention conduct. Finally, although favorable changes were reported in some surrogate clinical outcomes such as BP and lipid profiles following telehealth interventions, this may not translate to hard clinical endpoints. Because of a lack of studies, conclusions cannot be drawn about effects on mortality and hospitalizations. Future well-designed intervention studies with adequate length of follow-up are required to assess these important endpoints.\n\nIn conclusion, adults with a diet-related chronic disease may experience improvements in diet quality, fruit and vegetable intake, and dietary sodium intake if they are provided with dietary interventions through telehealth. Although large variations in findings may be explained by differences in intervention conduct, it is difficult to explore as a result of suboptimal reporting of dietary interventions. Single macronutrients (calories and total dietary fat) were not significantly modified following telehealth interventions, which may highlight the benefit of delivering complex dietary intervention that target the quality of the diet and/or dietary patterns facilitated by convenient telehealth technologies. The results of this review support the changes in nutrient focus and may inform the future development of evidencebased telehealth programs, which, ideally, can be tailored to specific chronic disease conditions."
