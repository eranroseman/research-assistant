  "title": "Mobile phone text messaging for improving the uptake of vaccinations: a systematic review protocol",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Low vaccine coverage is a major public health concern, the consequences of which contribute to around 1.5 million child deaths from vaccinepreventable diseases. Thus, innovative strategies to rapidly increase coverage and recall rates for vaccinations are urgently required. Mobile text messaging (or short messaging service, SMS) has the potential to help increase vaccination coverage and therefore we propose to conduct a review of the current best evidence for the use of SMS as an intervention to promote vaccination coverage. \n Methods and analysis: This article describes the protocol for a systematic review of the effectiveness of SMS in improving the uptake of vaccination. Primary and secondary outcomes of interest are prespecified. We will preferably include randomised controlled trials (RCTs). However, non-randomised studies (NRS) will be considered if there is an inadequate number of RCTs. We will search several bibliographic databases (eg,PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, CENTRAL, Science Citation Index, Africa-Wide Information and WHOLIS electronic databases and search sources for grey literature. Following data extraction and assessment of risk of bias, we will meta-analyse studies and conduct subgroup analyses, according to intervention subtypes. We will assess clinical heterogeneity and statistical heterogeneity. For outcomes without quantitative data, a descriptive analysis will be used. This review protocol is registered in the PROSPERO International Prospective Register of systematic reviews, registration number 2014:CRD42014007531 Ethics and dissemination: Ethics is not required for this study, given that this is a protocol for a systematic review, which uses published data. The findings of this study will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. We anticipate that the results could be used by researchers and policymakers to help inform them of the efficacy of mobile phone text messaging interventions to promote increased vaccination coverage.",

      "text": "Vaccinations, when given at the most sensitive developmental years of childhood, help to promote comprehensive and capable immunity, enabling children to fight off certain diseases.  1 2 In addition, vaccinations are widely regarded as one of the most costeffective public health interventions that help to reduce global child morbidity and mortality.  3 4 Low coverage of vaccinations is a major public health concern. In Africa alone, more than seven million children did not receive the full spectrum of vaccinations recommended before reaching 1 year of age in 2009.  5 It is also estimated that 1.5 million children died globally from vaccinepreventable diseases where WHO prequalified vaccines were available.  6 he Global Vaccine Action plan (GVAP) is the most recently launched global effort by the WHO to help increase vaccination coverage. The GVAP has set a target that by 2020 vaccination coverage for populations should reach 90% national vaccination coverage and at least 80% at district levels utilising national vaccination programmes.  7 It is guided by six principles: country ownership, shared responsibility and partnership, equity, integration, sustainability and innovation.  8  variety of factors impact achieving low coverage rates; challenges such as immunisation awareness, demand for immunisation, level of trust in the health system, adequate"

      "text": "\u25aa To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review protocol that will attempt to assess the impact of mobile text messaging on promoting the uptake of vaccination among adults, adolescents and parents or caregivers of children. \u25aa This study will help inform clinical practice and future studies on the effectiveness of media platforms. \u25aa Non-randomised studies of low-quality evidence may be this study's limitation. We will, however, conduct appropriate analyses to assess the overall robustness of the results.\n\nhuman resources, access, timeliness of vaccinations, service delivery, poor infrastructure and vaccination monitoring.  4 Vaccination coverage seems to be lower in low-income households, where limited access to health education, contributes to poor health-seeking behaviour along with an inability to improve general well-being.  1 2 9  Uneducated parents therefore are less likely to understand the importance of vaccinating to prevent potentially harmful diseases. In light of these obstacles to vaccination coverage, the strategy to improve vaccination coverage needs to be innovative as alluded to in the GVAP, well thought out and able to penetrate low-income households effectively. Globally, mobile phone use is rapidly increasing, with an estimated six billion mobile phone users worldwide at the end of 2011.  10  In particular, mobile phone text messaging has gained popularity among people living in low-income and middle-income countries and may be the key to penetrating hard to reach areas in the developing world. Text messaging has proven to be a costeffective method of relaying health information and reminders than the more traditional methods such as face-to-face, phone calls, pamphlets, mail and email.  5 As immunisation usually requires multiple consecutive monthly visits after the first vaccine dose in order to complete the schedule, short messaging service (SMS) can be used as reminder for an upcoming visit and recall when a visit has been missed.  1 In addition, an SMS intervention, also known as mobile phone text messaging, can be delivered alone or bundled with other interventions.  11 Diseases that have used mobile technology successfully include HIV where a 90% adherence was observed among text message recipients compared with a 40% adherence in the control group.  12 We therefore propose to conduct a systematic review of the current best evidence for the use of mobile phone text messaging to improve vaccination coverage."

Where outcomes are measured using different scales, we will report standardised mean differences (SMD).  17 In cases of missing or incomplete information presented in the included studies, we shall contact authors for further information.\n\nWe will assess clinical heterogeneity by examining types of participants, interventions and outcomes in each study. We will pool data only from studies judged to be clinically homogenous. Statistical heterogeneity in each meta-analysis will be assessed using the \u03c7 2 test and quantified using the I 2 statistic.  18 If studies are sufficiently homogenous (in terms of study populations, interventions and outcomes), then we will pool the data across studies and estimate summary effect sizes using a fixed-effects model. Otherwise, we will use the random-effects model. Should heterogeneity remain significant, we will discuss the findings as a narrative summary.\n\nWe will perform subgroup analyses by intervention subtypes: long versus short messages; daily versus weekly messages; short weekly messages versus long weekly messages; short daily messages versus long daily messages; and two-way interactive communication versus one-way communication.  12 19 20 We will also stratify analysis by study design (randomised controlled separate from nonrandomised studies) and intervention type (multiple interventions involving text messaging separate from text messaging alone). We will also conduct a subgroup comparison of self-reported vaccination completion versus verified clinic records as well as according to age categories and country setting.\n\nFinally, we will use the grading of recommendations assessment, development and evaluation (GRADE) approach  21  to assess the quality of evidence for the effectiveness of the SMS intervention. This method results in an assessment of the quality of the body of evidence as high, moderate, low or very low. Evidence is considered of high quality if 'further research is very unlikely to change our confidence in the estimate of effect'; and moderate quality if 'further research is likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and may change the estimate'. Low quality evidence implies that 'further research is very likely to have an important impact on our confidence in the estimate of effect and is likely to change the estimate', and very low quality that 'we have very little confidence in the effect estimate'."

Our systematic review will provide evidence of whether policymakers can adopt mobile phone text messaging alone or in combination with other interventions in efforts to improve uptake of vaccines in national immunisation programmes. It will also inform clinic or hospital managers of how best to use the intervention to improve vaccination coverage. The systematic review may also identify specific considerations that would need to be taken into account for future studies, such as study location, content and timing of messages, whether or not parents or caregivers replied to text messages, how text messages were sent (automated vs manual), indicators for immunisation programmes, variety of text messages sent (inclusion of jokes or lifestyle tips), duration of the study, whether or not participants were provided with the mobile handsets and sample size.  24"
