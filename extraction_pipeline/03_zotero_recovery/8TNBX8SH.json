  "abstract": "Purpose -The purpose of this paper is to examine the actual and potential utility of social return on investment (SROI) analysis as an instrument to strengthen the financial and social \"case\" for local authority sport and recreation services (SRS) in the context of recent research by the Association of Public Service Excellence. Design/methodology/approach -The research for APSE, undertaken by the author, consisted of a survey and a series of interviews over 18 months with policy officers within leisure services across local authorities in England. Data on \"making the case\" for SRS is extracted from this research. Findings -It is argued that SROI has utility where it can demonstrate the contribution of sport, physical activity and recreation to health policy, adult social care, education, youth crime reduction, place shaping agendas and community engagement, for example. However, findings of the APSE research imply that although SROI offers use value in making a case for retaining services, this method of assessment may not be widely employed for a number of political and practical reasons. Research limitations/implications -The research is limited to a sample of 55 local authorities in England from which generalisations are made. Practical implications -In the context of the introduction of the Social Value Act in 2013, SROI offers use value in making a case for retaining or adapting discretionary services within emerging models of strategic commissioning. Implementation will however be challenging for SRS. Originality/value -It is argued that without an evidence base, it is unlikely that a case can be made for retaining discretionary services that benefit local communities.",

      "text": "Following the Coalition Government's Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) 2010  (HM Treasury, 2010) , and subsequent local government finance settlements  (Berman and Keep, 2011; Department of Communities and Local Government, 2010)  research by the Local Government Association (LGA, 2011) demonstrated a disproportional impact of \"the cuts\" on discretionary services in the budgets for 2011/2012. Assessing the specific impact of reductions in local government finance for sport and recreation services (SRS) (Chief Leisure and Culture Officers Association (CLOA), 2011) that typically include facility, parks and playing field management, event organisation and delivery, and community sport development programme design and implementation, reveals the urgent need for a stronger political, financial and social policy case for services (Association of Public Service Excellence: APSE, 2012a). In part, the case for SRS is perceived to be weak in the majority of local authorities due to the difficulties of measuring the value of services  (APSE, 2010; Coalter, 2007; Long and Sanderson, 2001) . In this respect, the use of social return on investment (SROI) analysis (Cabinet Office/Office of the Third Sector, 2010) may be of utility to service managers seeking to demonstrate social and financial value and protect services under threat of curtailment.\n\nThis article is structured into four sections. First, the political, financial, legislative and organisational context within which SRS operates is summarised  (APSE, 2012a; CLOA, 2011; King, 2009) . Second, a brief overview of the discourse around public value is provided  (Bennington and Moore, 2011; Coats and Passmore, 2008; Cole and Parston, 2006; Kelly et al., 2002; Leighton and Wood, 2010; McLaren, 2011; New Economics Foundation (NEF), 2010) . Third, SROI as an instrument for measuring social value and impact is analysed (Cabinet Office/Office of the Third  Sector, 2010; NEF, 2008; Nicholls et al., 2009)  and its relative merits described  (Arvidson et al., 2010; Dattani, 2012; Gair, 2009; Lawlor et al., 2008; Lyon and Arvidson, 2012; Millar and Hall, 2012; NEF, 2004; New Philanthropy Capital (NPC), 2010) . Fourth, the likelihood of SROI being utilised for SRS is explored given that a relatively weak evidence base to support the case for retaining services was identified in the research for APSE (2012a). To date, only a few local authorities have utilised SROI to \"make the case\" for leisure, recreation and sport services, e.g. North Lanarkshire  (Baker Tilly, 2010) , and other research has focused on specific sport-related programmes, for Groundwork  (Smith et al., 2012) , and Positive Futures  (Halliwell, 2012)  where the local authority was a partner organisation.\n\nThe research strategy consisted of the shadowing of an accredited SROI practitioner undertaking a forecast evaluation for an organisation that aims to achieve social policy objectives via a recreation programme for disaffected young people in Liverpool  (Halliwell, 2012) . By observing the stage by stage process of undertaking a SROI analysis, an assessment could be made of the relative utility of SROI for SRS. The author also contributed to the final report to the client through an analysis of the data collated by the practitioner over a three month period. This included survey data acquired from programme participants and interview-based data acquired from the key stakeholders.\n\nThis paper also draws on research undertaken by the author for APSE (2012a). This research took a qualitative approach  (Altheide, 1996)  and specifically included an on-line survey of APSE members and a series of semi-structured interviews  (Devine, 1995)  with senior officers that had oversight for SRS throughout 2011 and 2012. The questionnaire consisted of 60 questions relating to the five core themes identified in a literature review. These themes are namely: the political and administrative status of SRS; the financial context and the impact of funding reductions; relationships between SRS and internal and external bodies; changing modes of service delivery; and differences in levels and quality of council provision. The data were analysed using thematic coding  (Flick, 1998)  in order to make comparisons between council responses (see APSE, 2012a for fuller details of the research strategy). One key theme to emerge from the research, both with local authorities (APSE, 2012a) and via working alongside a practitioner of SROI  (Halliwell, 2012) , and the focus of this paper, is the relative absence of an evidence base, by comparison with education services for example, to support the case for investment in sport and recreation services."

      "title": "The case for sport and recreation",
      "text": "Sport and recreation services in England Leisure Services inclusive of sport and recreation became a distinct administrative unit in local government from the early 1970s and for 40 years has been a core component of local authority provision  (Carter, 2005; King, 2009) . However, with the emergence of global economic recession in 2008, and the election of a new UK government in 2010 that has a policy preference for a \"smaller\" state (Conservative Party, 2010), local government finance has been under significant pressure  (Audit Commission, 2011; Berman and Keep, 2011; DCLG, 2010) . As a result, sport and recreation, as discretionary services, are experiencing severe budgetary reductions  (APSE, 2012a; CLOA, 2011) . Legislative and financial pressures on local authorities are of course not recent  (Wilson and Game, 2011)  but the introduction of market principles  (Coalter, 1995; Nichols and Taylor, 1995; Henry, 2001)  into the management of discretionary services in England has arguably had a disproportional impact on resources and \"welfare\" objectives  (Taylor and Page, 1994; Audit Commission, 2006; APSE, 2012a) . Despite limited resources, the portfolio of leisure-related services delivered via local authorities has broadened over time, where under successive Labour governments in the period 1997-2010, officers were required to deliver social policy outcomes relating to social exclusion, including health, education and criminal justice objectives  (Collins and Kay, 2003; DCMS, 2002; Green, 2006; King, 2009) , and latterly, under a Coalition government (2010-date), SRS are expected to contribute to adult social care objectives  (I&DeA, 2010;  LGA, 2012) and pre-care health objectives (Department of Health, 2012) given the rising costs of statutory provision.\n\nAlthough economic assessment has been made of sport-related interventions  (Gratton and Henry, 2001) , demonstrating social (or welfare) impacts has proved to be problematic  (Coalter, 2007; Long and Sanderson, 2001) . Moreover, it is unclear in many cases what strategic oversight exists for SRS. For example, only 60 per cent of councils in England publish a stand-alone strategic document for SRS  (APSE, 2012a) . In many cases, as the APSE research found, SRS are assimilated into wider cultural, community or education strategies and have weak administrative and political status (APSE, 2012a). Overall, SRS operate in an increasingly challenging financial and political context where the severity of the on-going reductions in local government finance may signal the rapid decline of services that cannot demonstrate either a \"business case\" or social value and impact. Coats and Passmore (2008, p. 4 ) state that \"public value is the analogue of the desire to maximise shareholder value in the private sector\". Therefore, for local authority elected members and officers, public value is concerned with service effectiveness and efficiency, accountability and the core role and remit of services. The principle of \"equity\" in provision is also expected to feature in designing and delivering services. A core challenge facing local authorities is seeking legitimacy for decisions shaping the allocation of public funds where outcomes and impact are unclear. As  Bennington and Moore (2011)  identify, performance management frameworks employed by local authorities fail to fully capture the inputs, outputs, outcomes and impact of provision, the extent of public involvement in decision making, and whether public value can be translated into monetary value. The recent Public Services (Social Value) Act (HM Government, 2012) increases pressure on local authorities, from April 2013, to procure IJPSM 27,2 services that have social, economic and environmental value. This may require changes in modes of service delivery and in engagement with communities in decision-making processes underpinning service priorities, such as via co-production  (Boyle et al., 2010) , voluntary sector partnerships with councils  (The Young Foundation, 2010) , trust management of provision  (CLOA, 2011)  and enacting legislation relating to community right to challenge and purchase  (DCLG, 2011a, b) . This approach to public service ownership and delivery forms one aspect of a wider government agenda to re-shape the welfare state  (Blond, 2009; Conservative Party, 2010) ."

      "title": "Public value",
      "text": "However, the concept and practice of public value is contested. For example,  Mulgan (2007)  observes that more sophisticated measurement of provision does not necessarily result in more significant outcomes and impacts for communities. Moreover, what is considered to be of public or \"social value\" by public sector professionals may not be shared or understood by local residents. Bennington and Moore (2011)  add that \"value\" may be understood differently as either \"value\" produced by services; \"value\" in terms of outcomes (e.g. lowering crime, improving health, raising educational standards); or \"value\" perceived in terms of what is \"fair\" in the distribution of resources. SROI can be viewed as an instrument for establishing public value although its application may vary in part due to the political orientation of specific local authorities. The following section defines and assesses the relative merits of SROI."
    },
    {
      "title": "Social return on investment",
      "text": "Undertaking a SROI analysis or evaluation is about determining whether an intervention has had the intended impact and to what extent. Nicholls et al. (2009)  states that SROI identifies a \"story of change\" via a mix of narrative, qualitative and financial measures. It is a form of adjusted cost-benefit analysis that accounts for the various type of impact that services or programmes have  (Lawlor et al., 2008) . In particular, SROI assists councils in focussing beyond primary outcomes towards secondary and tertiary benefits, if utilised effectively (Centre for Social Justice, 2011). SROI is based on specific principles including the necessity to involve stakeholders in determining the value of an intervention. The process of undertaking a SROI analysis is in five stages where social outcomes are mapped and financial proxies used to assign monetary value to these outcomes (see Cabinet Office/Office of the Third Sector, 2010).\n\nAlthough there are no universal standards for assessing value in the public or third sectors unlike the private sector, SROI as a practice originates from the concept of \"economic value\", and therefore a \"business case\" for social policy interventions can be produced using this method of assessment. Critically, in arriving at a financial value for an intervention, attribution, deadweight, displacement and drop-off are accounted for in order to avoid over-claiming the worth of an intervention (see  Nicholls et al., 2009) . SROI foregrounds the need for transparency in determining value and it is therefore necessary to undertake a careful assessment of impact via a sensitivity analysis. A literature review serves to foreground a number of actual and potential benefits for leisure service managers of using SROI but also a number of challenges and potential issues."
    },
    {
      "title": "Actual and potential benefits",
      "text": "The benefit to organisations in using SROI is found in, first, identifying the financial value of services where outcomes and impact are difficult to quantify, potentially\n\nThe case for sport and recreation improving the efficiency and effectiveness of services, that in turn strengthens the \"business case\" for retaining or even expanding services. Second, given a quantification of social value and impact in monetary terms, SROI may form one component of taking a pre-emptive approach to strategic and operational planning. For example, negative and unintended outcomes can be identified and therefore decisions can be made to reduce costs associated with ineffective activities. Third, the competitive advantage acquired for services that can demonstrate social value and impact may prove to be important where services are to be merged across councils or re-aligned within internal structures. Fourth, apart from retaining services, SROI offers the potential to develop or strengthen a culture of continuous improvement given that it encourages service managers to build an evidence base and improve data collection systems.\n\nFifth, as the foundation of SROI is based on principles of stakeholder engagement  (Arvidson et al., 2010) , SROI can build stakeholder relationships and therefore assist with managing resident and community expectations through improved communication channels; raise community awareness of the constraints under which councils make decisions, deliver services and attempt to evaluate outcomes  (Nicholls et al., 2009; NPC, 2010) ; clarify assumptions and values and reduce conflict founded on misinformation and misunderstanding; and potentially reduce the \"democratic deficit\" through community engagement and empowerment  (Local Government IDA, 2010) . Sixth, where it is effectively used, SROI can strengthen accountability and the legitimacy of publically funded services and this in turn can attract funding and political support. Potentially, SROI enables \"good news stories\" to emerge, generating media and political interest. This is of particular importance to service areas facing \"managed decline\". In particular, SROI can strengthen the legitimacy of services requiring a degree of subsidy.\n\nSeventh, given on-going changes in how health services are managed and delivered (Department of Health, 2012), there is an opportunity for services such as sport and physical activity to demonstrate health outcomes and impact via the use of SROI. As the APSE (2012a) research indicates, the future for SRS may lie in alignment with the emergent in-house health structures. If SRS can demonstrate hidden outcomes and savings for partner organisations in the health sector where outcomes are difficult to identify, then it is possible that health agencies under financial pressure will seek pre-care solutions to reduce the spiralling costs of post-care intervention. Adult social care managers may also seek to benefit from services within SRS that can demonstrate physical and mental health outcomes, given that the costs of social care for older people has multiplied exponentially (LGA, 2012).\n\nEighth, using SROI establishes a policy thread with the Social Value Act and contributes to the co-production agenda  (Boyle et al., 2010) . This in turn potentially embeds a role for SRS in commissioning models and procurement priorities."
    },
    {
      "title": "Challenges and potential issues",
      "text": "However, the use of SROI is not without its challenges and potential pitfalls. First, NPC (2010, p. 1) claim that \"SROI will not reach its full potential until there is more investment in improving the evidence base\". This requires gathering data via primary research in addition to drawing on secondary sources. Leisure service managers, in prior research  (King, 2009) , highlighted an absence of resources to collect data, with IJPSM 27,2 spend on programme evaluation, for example, viewed as reducing the funds available for resourcing programme delivery. A fundamental issue facing service managers and elected members is deciding which services in the portfolio are worth retaining, and without an evidence base decisions can be based on assumptions of \"what works\", concerns with staff retention or, in some cases, political expediency. Where limited data exists, the SROI analyst is required to make subjective decisions regarding what is significant or \"material\" (SROI Network, 2011) based on partial information. Although these challenges are not unique to SRS but relate to many public services  (Mulgan, 2007) , it is discretionary services that need a strong business case in the current financial climate.\n\nSecond, there are difficulties in the comparison and replication of SROI as each service or programme is unique  (Dattani, 2012) . Nonetheless, expanding the evidence base may generate the scope for comparison between services over time and in different locations. Third, political decisions around which services to retain and which to curtail are not necessarily made with reference to research or analysis of the benefits and costs of specific services. As  Arvidson et al. (2010)  identify, SROI does not, as a theory of change, account for pre-existing values held by policy actors or power relations in organisations. However, other forms of cost-benefit analysis face similar difficulties.\n\nFourth, the costs of undertaking SROI can be prohibitive  (Gordon, 2009; Leighton and Wood, 2010; Lyon et al., 2010)  especially for service areas experiencing severe budget reductions, such as SRS. Nonetheleless, depending on the scale and scope of the SROI analysis, cost might not be a barrier for those employing a strategic commissioning model that oversees thematic working across service areas. A longer-term strategic view of investment priorities and benefits would offset short-term concerns with accruing costs. Managers may also engage in the up-skilling of staff to undertake SROI in-house, thereby reducing consultancy costs and gaining greater control over the processes involved. However, fifth, given the limited expertise of leisure service managers in undertaking SROI, an inconsistency in approach is likely. The complexity of mapping change may disengage potential usage, particularly for services that aim to meet multiple objectives and achieve overlapping outcomes. Therefore, buying-in expertise may be required in the short-term.\n\nSixth, given that there is limited use of SROI to assess leisure, sport and recreation services in the UK to date, commissioners, service managers and elected members are relatively unfamiliar with this method of assessing services. Further, where SROI is understood and used, commissioners may focus solely on the SROI ratio (a calculation that determines the social impact per \u00a31 of investment), as this ratio is a succinct and powerful way of communicating value and achievements  (Arvidson et al., 2010) , rather than the other benefits of using SROI. Therefore, seventh, there is a potential for \"misuse\" where commissioners or service managers could over-claim the value and impact of services. As a result, there may be pressure put on staff or consultants to \"accentuate the positive\". Consultants evaluating social value and impact have limited control over how SROI reports are subsequently used by their clients.\n\nEighth, there are significant challenges of stakeholder engagement, such as managing conflicting interests without the expertise to do so and in accounting for stakeholders' views with impartiality. Clearly, within a local authority, and within and between stakeholders, there can be diverse views of what it is that is important or of The case for sport and recreation value. Through undertaking a SROI, assumptions can be clarified, but a lead organisation is still required to decide on a course of action. In other words, organisations need to adhere to the guidance for using SROI  (Lawlor et al., 2008; Nicholls et al., 2009 ) so as to avoid bias in over-claiming value or hiding information that might at a later stage undermine relationships between stakeholders.\n\nNinth, a number of authors raise concerns about SROI itself as an instrument for accounting for social value and impact  (Dattani, 2012) . For example: the discount rate used in the SROI calculation is contested; selecting the time horizon for measuring impact can be problematic as many \"impacts\" are only visible over the longer-term; weighting distributional impacts can be problematic as can estimating attribution, deadweight, displacement and drop-off where data is scarce; \"anchoring bias\" may exist; and the use of financial proxies is challenging where none have been established or there is little data available. Discussion of these issues is beyond the scope of this paper, but it can be claimed that SROI as an instrument of assessment is a \"work in progress\" as a young discipline by comparison with cost-benefit analysis for example.\n\nIn the final analysis, selecting criteria for measurement is a subjective decision and deciding whose views carry the greatest weight is a political decision. The issues raised regarding using SROI are not unique to assessing value and impact but apply to the use of research and evaluation in any decision-making process within local authorities or other organisations  (Weiss, 1997) . Proving causality between welfare interventions and their outcomes and impact is not only a problem facing organisations using SROI.\n\nDiscussion: the value of SROI for local authority SRS This discussion centres on the extent to which using SROI could benefit SRS in England, in the context of the APSE (2012a) findings. As identified, there are clearly a number of actual and potential benefits of using SROI and a number of challenges for service managers seeking to demonstrate the social value and impact of specific components in a broad portfolio. In the current financial context, where further reductions in SRS can be anticipated, a key motivation for using SROI is to attract funding (NPC, 2010), strengthen the provider's position in a competitive environment  (Lyon et al., 2010)  and SROI can enable commissioners to make more informed decisions in procurement processes  (NEF, 2009 (NEF, , 2010;; Ryan and Lyne, 2008) .\n\nThese benefits can be realized where service managers create an engaging narrative that will acquire political support  (Arvidson et al., 2010) . A \"good news\" narrative is more likely to gain attention, secure legitimacy and evoke action by elected members and partner organisations. Specifically, the re-organisation of the Health sector offers a favourable environment and \"home\" for SRS within local authority provision in future years. Potentially, given that health is to become a component of local authority provision in 2013, a SROI analysis can be used to demonstrate the financial and social benefits of services that act as pre-care interventions. If however, health services are fundamentally oriented towards the defence of vested interests around post-care intervention, then the case for investment in SRS is weakened. The Department for Health has actively promoted SROI, although it is not widely adopted to date  (Millar and Hall, 2012) .\n\nArguably, SROI will only be of value to leisure service managers where there is a coherent strategic and operational trajectory for the service area and the IJPSM 27,2 commissioning process includes procurement that considers social and environmental impact and not only economic impact. In the current and projected financial context for the next few years at least, demonstrating social value will be critical  (APSE, 2012a) . This is particularly the case in geographical areas of England where private and voluntary sector provision is not extensive and \"direct\" (in-house) provision is preferred by councils, within an \"ensuring\" state model of provision  (APSE, 2012b) . \"Making the case\" is of course not a guarantee that services will be retained, but not having a case at all is no longer an option, if the principles of the Social Value Act are to take effect in practice  (White, 2012) . However, limited buy-in to Social Value Act can be anticipated across many local authorities where there is little compulsion to do so unless commissioners choose to include leisure services such as sport and recreation within local corporate objectives.\n\nIt can be also be argued that for SROI to have a meaningful impact on services, it will be necessary to replace an organisational culture centred on retaining service areas that operate as silos with a culture where the valued components of SRS are embedded within broader local government objectives around \"place shaping\", \"community engagement\" and \"healthy lifestyles\", for example. One recommendation of the APSE report is that service managers and elected members \"need to look beyond municipal boundaries, departmental silos and service areas in designing services\" (APSE, 2012a, p. 7). As the APSE research found, in only one-third of councils is there a degree of integration between leisure-related services and the wider strategic objectives of the local authority. Without strategic alignment of services, there is little reason to invest in SROI, and to date, few councils have done so.\n\nA key potential strength of SROI is found in the transparency of the process, open to scrutiny by all stakeholders and funders. Given the complexity of mapping change and proving a correlation between service objectives and outcomes and impact, SROI invites critique and encourages open discussion around what is of value, how this can be demonstrated, and critically, who benefits from public services. As APSE (2012a, p. 7) state, \"A significant 'democratic deficit' exists at the local level with SRS needing greater visibility in and engagement with local communities\" and the use of SROI can contribute to addressing this significant challenge. However, leisure service managers may not currently have the expertise or capacity to deliver services via a model of co-production, or pro-active leadership from elected members that aligns leisure, sport and recreation provision within a broader model of strategic commissioning.\n\nMore positively, given that there is a pre-existing culture of performance management in SRS, funders and budget holders may find the expression of social value in financial terms compelling. Replacing centrally imposed key performance indicators (KPIs), where the focus is on inputs and outputs, rather than outcomes and impact, with measurements of value and impact set locally, offers an opportunity to local service managers that may lead to adopting SROI analysis. Nonetheless, many service managers may perceive risks associated with untried methods of analysis. For example, highly valued and protected services may not be subject to analysis in case the findings inadvertently highlight a limited social and financial value. APSE (2012a) make a distinction between senior officers in leisure departments that have demonstrated innovation in defending services and those authorities where, as  Copestake (2007 Copestake ( , p. 1722 ) observed, the organisational mission drifts over time towards\n\nThe case for sport and recreation goals that are more easily quantified, implying a \"deeper problem of lack of transparency and weak performance management\". Discretionary services such as SRS stand at a cross-roads in local government: either service areas become a minor and marginal outpost offering a few (largely unproven or ineffective) safety-net services to residents unable to access private and third sector provision, or service leaders and local politicians with control of the leisure portfolio \"make the case\" for sport and recreation provision and integrate discretionary services with components of statutory provision. In this context, SROI is one instrument that can be used to acquire a degree of legitimacy and secure resources as part of advocacy. However, as the APSE (2012a) research highlighted, without political support and a degree of embeddedness within administrative processes and organisational culture, even the most conclusive evidence arrived at through the most rigorous research processes using effective tools of impact assessment will not result in retaining services. In this regard, APSE (2012a) make a distinction between those councils that chose to pre-empt the current financial crisis and took action to defend valued services, and those authorities that did not, or were unable to do so. In sum, it is likely that some local authorities will utilise SROI whereas others will not, for a number of reasons, including: lack of an existing evidence base; the costs associated with gathering primary data; lack of expertise; fear of highlighting existing weaknesses in services; and budgets being committed to what it is politically opportune to retain.\n\nFinally, it is clear that sport and recreation services can contribute to social policy objectives and SROI can be of value in this respect. For example, SROI can and has been used to assess: increasing the number of young people in education, training and employment (and reducing the costs of NEET)  (Coles et al., 2010) ; reducing anti-social behaviour and youth crime  (LSE, 2003) ; improving the well-being (self-esteem, self-efficacy and confidence) of participants (Centre for Local Economic Strategies, 2011); achieving specific educational outcomes  (NPC, 2007; Princes Trust/LSE, 2009)  such as reduced truancy, improve classroom behaviour and impact on educational standards; and raising awareness of environmental issues  (Spatial, 2011) . Whether opportunities for innovation in measuring the social value and impact of SRS are taken by local authorities remains to be seen."

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "This paper identified a number of actual and potential benefits of using SROI for local authority leisure services: including a tool for strategic planning and influencing decisions around procurement; in the development of a \"business case\" such as targeted investment, value-for-money and service efficiencies and effectiveness; in building accountability and transparency; in demonstrating outcomes and hidden savings for partner organisations; building stakeholder engagement; for attracting investment; developing the \"political case\" in raising the profile of services; and in making a \"social case\" to justify welfare-oriented interventions. Critically, SROI can also assist in building the learning capacity of service areas, increasing innovation and establishing or adding to a culture of continuous improvement.\n\nHowever, as  Millar and Hall (2012, p . 1) conclude, SROI is \"underused and undervalued due to practical and ideological barriers\". In practice, there are difficulties in defining \"value\" and some disagreement around whether \"social\" outcomes are IJPSM 27,2 monetizable. Further, where SROI is an accepted method of assessing social value and impact, there are a number of practical problems in its implementation. Barriers to the use of SROI include existing organisational cultures, capacity (knowledge, financial resources), the status of services, or administrative and political inertia. The successful implementation of SROI requires practitioners with an expertise in stakeholder engagement and it is not altogether clear from the APSE research that sufficient expertise exists in leisure services in England to fully quantify the social impact and value of services.\n\nIt can be concluded that although SROI reports can demonstrate the financial and social value of services to health, adult social care, place shaping, and community engagement agendas, for example, it is not anticipated, given the findings of the APSE (2012a) report, that the majority of local authorities will in practice utilise this method of assessment. Arguably, those councils that utilise SROI following the implementation of the Social Value Act in April 2013, may be those who already have a strong \"case\" for retaining components of SRS rather than those that most need to demonstrate the value and impact of their services, if for no other reason than to maintain staffing and current levels of provision."
