  "title": "Effectiveness of cognitive behavior treatment for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder: Acute outcomes from the Nordic Long-term OCD Treatment Study (NordLOTS)",
  "abstract": "Objective: The purpose of this study was to examine the acute effectiveness of manualized exposurebased CBT with a family-based treatment, as an initial treatment for pediatric OCD delivered in regular community child and adolescents outpatient clinics. The report summarizes outcome of the first treatment step in the NordLOTS, which was conducted in Denmark, Sweden and Norway. Method: 269 participants, age 7e17, with OCD, received treatment for 14 weekly sessions. Treatment response was defined as CY-BOCS score of 15 at post treatment. Results: 241 participants (89.6%) completed all 14 weeks of treatment. Treatment response among the completers was 72.6% (95% CI 66.7%e77.9%). Mixed effects model revealed a statistically significant effect of time F(1,479) \u00bc 130.434. Mean symptom reduction on the CY-BOCS was 52.9% (SD \u00bc 30.9). The estimated within-group effect size between baseline and post treatment was 1.58 (95% CI: 1.37e1.80). Conclusion: This study found that manualized CBT can be applied effectively in community mental health clinics. These findings underscore the feasibility of implementing exposure-based CBT for pediatric OCD in a regular child and adolescent mental health setting. Clinical trials registration information: This study was registered in Current Controlled Trials; Nordic Long-term Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) Treatment Study ( www.controlled-trials.com ISRCTN66385119).",

      "text": "Is it possible to conduct effective treatment for pediatric obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) in regular community child and adolescents outpatient clinics? As demonstrated in many open and randomized controlled trials (RCTs), exposure-based cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) is an efficacious treatment for children and adolescents with OCD. These trials were conducted primarily in university-based clinics, and thus the generalizability of their findings needs to be established in regular community settings.\n\nOCD is characterized by recurrent obsessions and compulsions. Symptoms of OCD in youth are diverse and largely convergent with symptom profiles seen in adults  (Bloch, Landeros-Weisenberger, Rosario, Pittenger, & Leckman, 2008) . Prevalence studies estimate that between 0.5% and 3% of children and adolescents suffer from OCD  (Heyman et al., 2003; Leonard et al., 1993) , childhood or adolescent onset is seen in up to 50% of adult cases  (Geller et al., 1998; Nelson & Rice, 1997; Riddle, 1998; Taylor, Asmundson, & Jang, 2011) .\n\nOCD often causes a high degree of distress and impaired functioning, with a fluctuating course and high risk of chronic outcomes  (Piacentini, Bergman, Keller, & McCracken, 2003; Thomsen, 2000) . OCD related impairment interferes with the child's daily functioning (family, social and academic performance), and may have an adverse impact on the child's psychosocial development  (Peris et al., 2008; Piacentini et al., 2003; Storch et al., 2007; Valderhaug & Ivarsson, 2005) .\n\nControlled clinical trials with young people diagnosed with OCD support the efficacy of CBT as well as medication with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRI)  (Abramowitz, Whiteside, & Deacon, 2005; Geller, Biederman, Stewart, Mullin, Martin, et al., 2003; Watson & Rees, 2008) . International expert guidelines recommend the use of exposure-based CBT as a first-line of treatment for children and adolescents with OCD  (NICE, 2005)  and SRI or combined treatment (CBT plus SRI) for moderate to severe OCD  (Geller et al., 2012) . These recommendations are supported by meta-analyses of randomized controlled trials for pediatric OCD, with between group effect size (ES) estimates of 1.45 (95% CI \u00bc 0.68e2.22) for CBT and 0.48 (95% CI \u00bc 0.36e0.61) for pharmacotherapy  (Abramowitz et al., 2005; Geller, Biederman, Stewart, Mullin, Farrell, et al., 2003; Watson & Rees, 2008) . Even though the data are clear and several international guidelines recommend exposure-based CBT as the first line of treatment for pediatric OCD, few patients actually receive this treatment in child and adolescent mental health clinics  (AACAP, 2012; Abramowitz et al., 2005; NICE, 2005; Watson & Rees, 2008) . Evaluating the effectiveness of exposure-based CBT outside the context of carefully controlled clinical trials represents an important next step in promoting the use of this efficacious treatment in a wider variety of clinical settings.\n\nThe Nordic Long-term  OCD Treatment Study (NordLOTS)  is a clinical trial based on a stepped-care treatment model, conducted in three Scandinavian countries (Denmark, Norway and Sweden). The treatment components evaluated in NordLOTS (CBT and SRI) were those with the strongest evidence base  (Geller et al., 2012; NICE, 2005) . The purpose of The NordLOTS study was: (1) to examine treatment outcome of exposure-based CBT in community mental health clinics (first step), (2) to identify CBT nonresponders; (3) to investigate whether an increased number of CBT sessions or medication offered non-responders would yield the best outcome (second step), and (4) to study the long-term durability of treatment by following patients over three years post treatment.\n\nThe current paper addresses the first aim (point number one) examining outcome of exposure-based CBT in community settings. Second step treatment outcome will be discussed elsewhere, and data collection for follow-up is ongoing. Overall rationale and details of the entire NordLOTS design have been described elsewhere  (Ivarsson et al., 2010; Thomsen et al., 2013) .\n\nEffectiveness trials aim to determine whether treatments are efficacious in natural settings and intend to measure beneficial effects across a more heterogenous population (i.e., more comorbidities and more diverse treatment history), thus being closer to \"real word settings\"  (Godwin et al., 2003) . One of the main issues in evidence based practice (EBP) is the extent to which results from RCTs can be generalized to community mental health clinics, and to patients being treated in such clinics.\n\nThe efficacy of exposure-based (CBT) has been clearly established, and the groundwork which has been laid with respect to examining exposure-based CBT effectiveness, is summarized in Table  1 . This study sets the stage for a broader examination of exposure-based CBT, the transportability to the very setting in which most OCD patients receive clinical services. We argue that the transportability of efficacy-validated treatments to community mental health clinics is an important empirical question that warrants answers driven by data.\n\nThe aim of the present paper was to examine the effectiveness of exposure-based CBT for pediatric OCD patients in community mental health setting. We hypothesized that exposure-based CBT delivered in community mental health clinics would be effectively and feasibly delivered, resulting in a significant change in CY-BOCS total score from pre to post-treatment, with an effect size approaching those reported in efficacy studies."

Assessment points were at baseline, weeks 7 and 14 (post treatment), assessed by independent evaluators (IEs) using the Children Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS). The CY-BOCS is a clinician-rated instrument that combines data from clinical observations, and child and parent reports, CY-BOCS assess obsessions and compulsions separately. As the primary scalar outcome variable, the CY-BOCS total score provides an indication of the degree of change (see Measures)."

The number of patients per therapist varied to a large degree both between and within sites. Nine of the forty-four therapists treated more than ten patients, five treated only one patient. One hundred and fifty-one of the patients (56.1%) came from an OCD clinic (Table  3 ).\n\nTraining in exposure-based CBT varied according to the therapist's prior experience treating pediatric OCD. The pre-experience level of CBT treatment at each site was a deciding factor when determining the degree of pre-study therapist training at each site. Leadership at each site decided the necessity and intensity of CBT training prior to the study in an agreement with the PI of the NordLOTS trial. Therapists at sites with little or no prior CBT experience received ten days of training with the NordLOTS treatment manual. They also received monthly group supervision, for three consecutive hours, at their respective sites throughout the study. Experienced doctor-level clinical psychologists and psychiatrists, were responsible for the CBT training and supervision. The therapists at the two OCD clinics studied the NordLOTS manual prior to study start without additional training or supervision."

To ensure a representative sample of pediatric patients seeking treatment for OCD, exclusion criteria were kept to a minimum. A total of 767 children and adolescents were screened for participation, 491 met inclusion criteria for assessment, and 269 were included in step 1 (Fig.  1 ). The mean baseline CY-BOCS total score was 24.6 (SD 5.1), subscale scores for obsession 12.3 (SD 2.8) and compulsion 12.3 (SD 2.7). Child age ranged from 7 to 17 years, mean 12.8 (SD 2.7) years. Genders were equally represented, females 51.3% (n \u00bc 138). The sample was primarily of Scandinavian ethnicity as 97% (n \u00bc 261) had either mother, father or both of Scandinavian origin. Almost half (40.5%, n \u00bc 109) of the patients had one or more comorbid psychiatric disorder (Table  4 ).\n\nPatients were included into the study if they fulfilled the following criteria: (1) primary diagnosis of OCD in accordance with the criteria in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Text Revision (DSM-IV-TR) (American Psychiatric Association, 2000), (2) CY-BOCS entry score !16, (3) 7e17 years of age, and (4) patients with attention-deficithyperactivity disorder (ADHD) were eligible, after having been stabilized on medication for at least 3 months prior to entry. Exclusion criteria included: (1) the presence of other psychiatric disorders (according to the DSM-IV) having a higher treatment priority (i.e., psychosis and severe depression), (2) any specific developmental disorder (i.e., pervasive developmental disorder [PDD] or Asperger's disorder). However, a diagnosis of PDD NOS  was allowed as long as OCD was judged to be the primary disorder based on the respective Clinical Global Impression-Severity (CGI) scores, (3) a previous failed trial of exposure-based CBT for OCD within less than 6 months prior to inclusion, (4) medication treatment with an SRI less than 6 months prior to inclusion, and (5) inadequate language proficiency by the patient or the parent."

The manual was modified by adding more extensive family participation based on the work of  Piacentini, Langley, and Roblek (2007) . The NordLOTS exposure-based CBT regime consisted of 75 min weekly sessions for 14 weeks. Parents were expected to accompany their children to all sessions. The children were seen together with their parents in six of the fourteen sessions (sessions 1e3, 5, 11, and 14). In the remaining sessions, the child was treated individually for 45 min and then the parents were seen with or without the child for an additional 30 min. This extra time was added specifically to address issues regarding the parents' involvement in therapy, and their attitude and feelings about their child's OCD symptoms.\n\nIn sessions one to three, the main focus was on psychoeducation, explaining the OCD and the treatment, including detailed explanation of exposure and response prevention (E/RP). Furthermore, the sessions included efforts to develop a symptom hierarchy, formulate a treatment plan, and externalize the OCD. E/ RP exercises were initiated in session three and conducted in each subsequent treatment session. The focus of the treatment was a gradual exposure to threatening situations based on a detailed symptom hierarchy, with the goal to reach the top of the hierarchy. Homework exposure exercises were an essential part of the treatment, parents were asked to support and monitor homework assignments, at least for younger children. Towards the end of the therapy, the emphasis shifted to generalizing skills and relapse prevention."

All IEs were trained in the use of the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children e Present and Lifetime version (K-SADS-PL) and the CY-BOCS via formalized training procedures from a doctor-level psychiatrist (the PI for the NordLOTS). The training was based on observing and coding both taped and live K-SADS-PL and the CY-BOCS interviews. Assessments were audiotaped; the same IEs performed the assessment at baseline (K-SADS-PL and the CY-BOCS), and at week 7 and post treatment (CY-BOCS). A random sample of 30 audiotapes of baseline CY-BOCS interviews, out of a possible 269 (11.2%), were evaluated by quality assurance (QA) raters. The QA raters had extensive experience and expertise in the use of the CY-BOCS. The analysis revealed that the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was 0.94 (95% CI 0.85e0.97) for obsessions, 0.87 (95% CI 0.67e0.93) for compulsions and 0.92 (95% CI 0.78e0.97) for the total score. No reliability test was performed for the K-SADS-PL.\n\nAll the therapy sessions were audiotaped and a random sample of 280 (12.8%) treatment sessions out of a total of 2184 available sessions were scored by the QA's for treatment fidelity and therapist competences all therapists were rated at least one time. The randomly chosen sessions were evenly distributed across the 14 treatment sessions with at least one session from each patient. The NordLOTS Treatment Integrity Scale (TIS) was used for determining treatment fidelity. The TIS was developed by the NordLOTS research group, and was largely based on the CBT-QA (quality assessment) form used in the POTS study  (2004) . Three categories of treatment fidelity were evaluated: (1) manual adherence, (2) competence in manual delivery, and (3) therapist relational competencies. Scores in each of these categories ranged from 1 \u00bc very poor compliance to 4 \u00bc very good compliance. All of the sessions were rated \"good\" or \"very good\", for overall manual adherence 94.7% (95% CI 91.4e96.8%), manual competence 96.0% (95% CI 93.0e97.7%), and relational competencies 96.0% (95% CI 93.3e97.7%).

Reliable change was calculated using the formula CY-BOCS total pre-test mean subtracted from the post-test mean, divided by the standard error of difference of the two scores  (Jacobson & Truax, 1991) ."

The Centre for Child and Adolescent Mental Health, Eastern and Southern Norway (RBUP), was the main coordinating site. The database was built using RBUP's data collection infrastructure program (Confirmit Horizons, version 17.0) on a secure research network. In addition to collecting and monitoring data, the database provided flow of patient information throughout the study. All analyses were conducted using intent-to-treat (ITT) principles.\n\nStatistical analyses on the scalar CY-BOCS was conducted using a linear mixed-effects model  (Fitzmaurice, Laird, & Ware, 2011; Gueorguieva & Krystal, 2004) . Fixed effects were time (baseline, week 7 and week 14), site, and the (time \u00c2 site) interaction. In all models, random effects included intercept and linear slope terms. An unstructured covariance was used in order to account for within patient correlation across time. Clinical response was analyzed using Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE). When assuming that data are missing at random, GEE models handle missing data on the outcome as effectively as multiple imputations foot_0    (Twisk & de Vente, 2002; Ziegler & Vens, 2010) . In the GEE models, time was treated as a dichotomous variable (week 7 and 14). Study site and (time \u00c2 site) interactions were also included in the model.\n\nSecondary outcome measures, clinical remission and 30% reduction were analyzed by GEE in a similar fashion as the dichotomous primary outcome. All analyses were conducted in the R statistical program (R Development Core Team, 2008), with packages nlme for mixed effects and gee for GEE analysis.

To assess treatment outcome differences by site, post-hoc pairwise contrasts for the CY-BOCS total score at week 7 and post treatment were conducted. There were significant differences between site, at week 7 (F[4, 264] \u00bc 2.594, p \u00bc .037). Additional, pairwise post-hoc analysis between the five sites revealed that Aarhus site proved superior to Southern and Eastern Norway (p \u00bc .016), Central Norway (p \u00bc .009), and Gothenburg (p \u00bc .021) sites, in getting early responders.

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "The NordLOTS was conducted in three Scandinavian countries, at five sites, in 20 regular community child and adolescents outpatient clinics. This study is the largest treatment study of pediatric OCD carried out to date, and also the first multi-national, multi-center treatment study in pediatric OCD. The large sample size in this study is a significant strength: compared to other studies both open trials and RCTs, the current study sample numbers three to four times as many patients (Table  1 ). Furthermore in NordLOTS, attrition rate was low; nine out of ten patients completed the full treatment protocol. Clinicians successfully guided the vast majority of patients through the time consuming and, at times, uncomfortable aspects of exposure-based treatment. Children and their parents showed a high degree of acceptance and willingness to be treated with exposure-based CBT alone.\n\nThis study evaluated the effectiveness of 14 sessions of manual-guided exposure-based CBT, with a family-based approach. The aim was to investigate the effectiveness and transportability of such treatment, in busy ordinary community clinics, against outcomes achieved in efficacy studies. Implementation of EBP in community settings is widely debated and demands a close collaboration between clinicians and researchers. One of the major challenges reported by both is the lack of demonstrated success in transporting treatments from the university-based to community settings  (Weisz, Weiss, & Donenberg, 1993) . The current study offers an important contribution to treatment research in pediatric OCD, by presenting a successful example of transportability of a university developed treatment into community mental health clinics.\n\nIn the NordLOTS study, pediatric patients treated with exposure-based CBT, showed a high treatment response, seven out of ten patients were rated as responders by independent evaluators. The results are comparable to several previous open trials conducted at expert sites  (Franklin et al., 1998; March, Mulle, & Herbel, 1994; Storch, Lehmkuhl, et al., 2010; Storch, Lewin, et al., 2010) . Moreover, due to the broad inclusion criteria and the varied mental health settings in which the trial was conducted, generalizability of the findings in the NordLOTS study to the clinical settings in which most pediatric OCD patients receive care is likely to be high. Our data add evidence for the clinical utility of exposurebased CBT as a first-line treatment for pediatric OCD.\n\nThere were no significant site differences at post treatment, despite substantial differences between the various settings (i.e., OCD clinics versus communityebased clinics, demographic variations including nationality, urban versus rural catchment areas for sites, clinic size, and comorbidity). The fact that there were no significant differences between the regular outpatient clinics and OCD clinics is especially notable and consistent with previous findings from smaller trials. Exposure-based CBT treatment is effective for pediatric OCD in a wide variety of settings  (Bolton & Perrin, 2008; Valderhaug, Larsson, Gotestam, & Piacentini, 2007) . The results support the generalizability of the CBT outcome from smaller scale efficacy studies of CBT to community outpatient child and adolescent mental health clinics.\n\nThe severity of OCD symptoms decreased significantly over the course of treatment with an observed uncontrolled (adjusted) effect size of 1.58 (95% CI: 1.37e1.80), indicating that CBT treatment is associated with large treatment effect, and absolutely comparable with RCTs (Table  1 ). The mean CY-BOCS score post treatment was 11.4, which is close to the cut off for clinical remission. Mean symptom reduction in NordLOTS was 52.9%, which is consistent with other studies  (Benazon, Ager, & Rosenberg, 2002; March et al., 1994; Wever & Rey,1997) . Nearly half of the patients were defined as being in remission, exceeding the rates reported in most previous studies  (Piacentini et al., 2011; POTS Treatment Study Team, 2004) .\n\nAnother strength of this study was the examination of clinical significant and reliable change. Based on criteria by  Jacobson and Truax (1991)  69% (n \u00bc 164/241) of the patients achieved clinically significant change from baseline to post treatment CY-BOCS, with 70.1% (n \u00bc 169/241) of the patients meeting criteria for reliable change. These findings indicate that the statistically significant reduction found in this sample, which were comparable to those achieved in expert sites around the world, were also clinically meaningful.\n\nThe CY-BOCS, as an outcome measure, has often been reported using either a dichotomization or percentage reduction  (Geller, Biederman, Stewart, Mullin, Martin, et al., 2003; Storch, Lehmkuhl, et al., 2010; Storch, Lewin, et al., 2010) . In this study, we used clinical response defined as a CY-BOCS score of fifteen or less as our primary outcome measure, and a reduction of thirty percent or more on the CY-BOCS as a secondary outcome. Our definition of clinical response at 15 on the CY-BOCS total score, might inflate the rate of responders. It is possible, for example, that some patients with a CY-BOCS score just above the cut-off when entering treatment, and a score just below the cut-off for clinical response at week 13 improved due to chance or normal fluctuation of symptoms, rather than as an effect of treatment. There were, however, only 6 patients (2.2%) who were deemed responders (CY-BOCS 15) and who did not obtain 30% or more reduction on the CYBOCS from baseline to post treatment. There was in fact very little difference between the results on treatment response (72.6%), 30% reduction (77.2%) and clinical reliable change (70.1%). Future studies should examine the validity of various response and remission criteria (e.g. convergence with functional improvement) to guide the field regarding the optimal definitions of both.\n\nNordLOTS was not sponsored by industry funding and patients from a variety of regular community child and adolescent outpatient clinics participated. Independent raters were used to assess all outcome measures and therapy adherence and fidelity were excellent. None of the patients in The NordLOTS's primary treatment step received medication for their OCD, which is quite unusual in such a large treatment study. This enables examination of the effects of CBT treatment without introduction of medication confounds. This is also important with regard to patient inclusion. NordLOTS was likely to enroll patients who, because their parents might be against medication use for their children, are unlikely to be enrolled in clinical trials where randomization to medication is a possibility  (Benazon et al., 2002) ."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "The first step of the NordLOTS was an uncontrolled trial, and the usual threats to internal validity apply here, including the potential effects of time, history, and maturation  (Chambless & Hollon, 2012) . The degree to which these factors influenced the outcomes cannot be directly determined. However, given the strong and consistent treatment effects observed here, in concert with over a dozen randomized trials worldwide attesting to efficacy of exposurebased CBT for OCD  (Barrett, Healy-Farrell, & March, 2004; Bolton et al., 2011; de Haan, Hoogduin, Buitelaar, & Keijsers, 1998; Piacentini et al., 2011; POTS Treatment Study Team, 2004) , and a generally low placebo response rate for OCD across many studies and contexts, it seems unlikely that these factors could explain the overall improvement.\n\nThe lack of ethnic diversity in the sample, is a limitation. As reported 97% of the patients were of Scandinavian ethnicity and therefore the generalizability to more ethnically diverse countries and clinics is uncertain. However, this problem (i.e., limited ethnic diversity) is highly consistent with the existent OCD literature  (Williams, Powers, Yun, & Foa, 2010) . Another limitation is that the implementation of the manualized exposure-based CBT with a family-based treatment, the training and supervision of the therapists conducted herein may be difficult to obtain under ordinary or non-research conditions. We argue that similar or at least sufficient conditions comparable to what was done her may also be possible in full-scale implementation. Furthermore, as this treatment has shown to be effective in a large proportion of patients, arguments for cost effectiveness for the whole procedure could easily be derived from this study."
