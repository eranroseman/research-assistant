  "title": "Looking on the Bright Side: Accessing Benign Meanings Reduces Worry",
  "abstract": "This research investigated whether increasing access to benign outcomes of ambiguous events decreases excessive worry. Participants reporting high levels of worry were assigned either to practice in accessing benign meanings of threat-related homographs and emotionally ambiguous scenarios or to a control condition in which threatening or benign meanings were accessed with equal frequency. Results were assessed by use of a breathing focus task that involved categorizing the valence of thought intrusions before and after an instructed worry period and a test of working memory capacity available to participants while worrying. In comparison with the control group, the benign group reported fewer negative thought intrusions (as rated by both participants and an assessor) and less anxiety during the breathing focus task and showed greater residual working memory capacity while worrying. These findings suggest that enhancing access to benign outcomes is an effective method of reducing both the persistence of worry and its detrimental consequences.",

      "text": "Worry is a primary cognitive characteristic of anxiety and has been described as \"a chain of thoughts and images, negatively affect-laden and relatively uncontrollable\"  (Borkovec, Robinson, Pruzinsky, & Depree, 1983, p. 10) . Worry typically concerns future events whose outcomes are uncertain but that contain the possibility of one or more negative outcomes  (Sibrava & Borkovec, 2006) . Although reported proneness to worry varies continuously across the population, those diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) report particularly high levels of worry about many different topics, unlike the more specific content characteristic of the worries of those with other anxiety disorders. Indeed, the defining feature of GAD, based on the criteria set forth in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV; American Psychiatric  Association, 1994) , is chronic, excessive, and uncontrollable worry about multiple topics. Individuals with GAD and high levels of worry are distinguished from those who do not experience high levels of worry by their reported inability to control worry once it is initiated  (Borkovec et al., 1983) . For example, following instructions to worry about a current personally relevant topic, all participants reported more negative thought intrusions during a subsequent attention-focusing task. However, those who worried excessively, or those who met criteria for GAD, experienced a greater frequency of negative thought intrusions than did nonworriers  (Borkovec et al., 1983) .\n\nThe question remains of why individuals prone to worry find it so difficult to disengage from worry. Although anticipation of probable danger is adaptive, it is unclear why excessive worry persists when it causes frequent mental distress with few apparent benefits. Some research has suggested that individuals who worry excessively believe that they must continue to worry until uncertainty has been resolved  (Dugas, Gagnon, Ladouceur, & Freeston, 1998) . Other researchers (e.g.,  Davey, 2006; Ruscio & Borkovec, 2004; Wells, 1995)  have found that excessive worriers often endorse certain advantages for worry (e.g., that worry helps them to solve problems), despite also endorsing negative beliefs (e.g., that worry may be harmful to health). In a similar vein, both positive and negative beliefs about worry have been found to be elevated in individuals with GAD  (Borkovec & Roemer, 1995) . Such counterproductive beliefs regarding uncontrollability and possible benefits of worry are likely to undermine the motivation for individuals to stop worrying and thus may play a role in maintaining worry in GAD  (Wells, 1995) .\n\nA further possibility is that such reported beliefs are secondary to more basic cognitive processes, such as cognitive biases in attention and interpretation. Relative to nonanxious individuals, those with GAD or high levels of trait anxiety display a bias to attend to threat information (cf. Mathews & MacLeod, 1994) . Evidence for this conclusion derives mainly from experiments on attention to external threat cues (e.g., MacLeod,  Mathews, & Tata, 1986) , but there is no reason to suppose that such a bias would not equally apply to internal cognitive representations of threat, such as worrisome thoughts.\n\nIn a similar light, although nonanxious individuals tend to make benign inferences about emotionally ambiguous information  (Hirsch & Mathews, 1997 , 2000; Hirsch, Mathews, Clark, Williams, & Morrison, 2003) , this presumably protective tendency is less evident in high trait anxious individuals, who tend to interpret emotionally ambiguous information in a more threatening manner  (MacLeod & Cohen, 1993; Richards & French, 1992) , as do those meeting diagnostic criteria for GAD  (Eysenck, MacLeod, & Mathews, 1987; Eysenck, Mogg, May, Richards, & Mathews, 1991; Mathews, Richards, & Eysenck, 1989; Mogg, Bradley, Miller, & Potts, 1994) . Both biased attention and the tendency to interpret ambiguous information in a threatening manner are likely to enhance the perception of threat, perhaps triggering or maintaining negative thoughts and worry  (Mathews, 1990) .\n\nA further cognitive characteristic of anxiety is a reduction in available working memory capacity, sometimes thought to be due to worry taking up working memory capacity (cf. Eysenck, 1982; Eysenck & Calvo, 1992) . According to the model proposed by  Baddeley and Hitch (1974;  and later revised by  Baddeley, 1986) , working memory is a limited-capacity cognitive resource required when one performs, and switches between, different cognitive tasks. Recent research  (Hayes, Hirsch, & Mathews, 2008)  has demonstrated that high worriers have less residual working memory capacity (as shown by poorer performance on a random key-press task) when worrying than do low worriers. Given this, the interesting possibility is raised that an additional reason that worriers find it difficult to disengage from worry might be that they have less working memory capacity available to voluntarily switch their thoughts to nonworry topics.\n\nIf cognitive biases such as interpretation do indeed play a role in maintaining negative thought content, then worry might be reduced by enhancing access to benign outcomes of ambiguous information, thus countering the bias maintaining negative content. In fact, repeated practice in accessing different meanings of emotionally ambiguous material has been found to influence anxiety reactions to subsequent stressful situations. For example,  Wilson, MacLeod, Mathews, and Rutherford (2006)  found that participants who repeatedly practiced accessing benign meanings of homographs showed less anxiety when they later watched distressing video clips than did those who received practice accessing threatening interpretations. In a similar vein,  Hirsch, Mathews, and Clark (2007)  found that repeated practice in accessing benign outcomes of ambiguous scenarios resulted in less anticipatory anxiety and more positive predicted performance in a stressful social situation compared to the outcome for those who practiced accessing threatening interpretations.\n\nBecause the research described above was conducted with nonanxious populations, the question remains whether repeated access to benign meanings reduces anxiety in high trait anxious individuals. Murphy, Hirsch, Mathews, Smith, and Clark (2007)  reported that high socially anxious individuals who were given repeated practice accessing benign outcomes of ambiguous social scenarios showed less anticipatory anxiety about a socially threatening event than did those who did not have the ambiguity resolved. Mathews, Ridgeway, Cook, and Yiend (2007)  also demonstrated that repeated practice in accessing benign meanings of ambiguous scenarios reduced trait scores in a high trait anxious group to a greater extent than in a control group who did not practice accessing valenced meanings.\n\nThe present study was designed to investigate whether related methods might reduce worry frequency in volunteers (university staff and students) reporting excessive worry. It was expected that practice in accessing benign meanings of emotionally ambiguous information related to worry would reduce the availability or intensity of incompatible negative meanings. Hence, this would result in fewer negative thought intrusions when focusing on a nonworry task along with correspondingly lower levels of anxiety in comparison with a control condition. We also hypothesized that if practice in accessing benign meanings of ambiguously threatening information reduced the impact of negative thoughts, this would lead to more residual working memory capacity being available."

      "text": "The experiment involved three phases: an initial phase designed to enhance access to benign rather than threatening meanings of ambiguous events (ambiguity tasks), a worry assessment phase (breathing focus task), and a working memory assessment phase. High worry volunteers were randomly allocated to a benign or control condition. The benign group consistently accessed benign meanings of threat-related homographs and ambiguously threatening scenarios, whereas the control group accessed threatening or benign meanings of similar material with equal frequency. Following completion of a filler task, participants completed the breathing focus task, which involved focusing on their breathing and categorizing the valence of thought intrusions before and after an instructed worry period. Participants subsequently provided expanded descriptions of these thought intrusions to allow an assessor to categorize their valence. Finally, participants completed a task to assess the amount of working memory capacity available while they were worrying."

      "text": "Participants were staff and students from King's College London who had responded to an e-mail request for high worriers. Volunteers initially completed the Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ;  Meyer, Miller, Metzger, & Borkovec, 1990)  and were invited to take part in the study if they had a score of 56 or above. All participants completed the PSWQ again during the experiment to ensure that they continued to meet this criterion, and 2 volunteers were consequently excluded. Forty volunteers were randomly allocated to the benign or control conditions. Of these, 11 in the benign group met criteria for GAD (as assessed with the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire;  Newman et al., 2002) , as did 10 in the control group. Groups did not differ in terms of scores on the PSWQ (M \u03ed 65.40, SD \u03ed 7.60 for the benign group and M \u03ed 65.80, SD \u03ed 6.79 for the control group), t \u03fd 1, or the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory Trait version (STAI-T;  Spielberger, Gorsuch, Lushene, Vagg, & Jacobs, 1983 ; M \u03ed 51.80, SD \u03ed 11.65 for the benign group and M \u03ed 55.00, SD \u03ed 8.28 for the control group), t(38) \u03ed 1.00, ns. Both groups consisted of 4 male and 16 female participants. Average age was 34.9 years (SD \u03ed 13.3) in the benign group and 36.4 years (SD\u03ed13.8) in the control group, with no significant difference between groups, t \u03fd 1. The average years of education was 14.8 years (SD \u03ed 1.9) in the benign group and 14.9 years (SD \u03ed 2.1) in the control group, with no significant difference between groups, t \u03fd 1."

      "text": "Penn State Worry Questionnaire (PSWQ). Trait worry level was measured using the PSWQ  (Meyer et al., 1990) , a 16-item measure consisting of statements about worry (e.g., \"Once I start worrying, I can't stop\"). The PSWQ has a 5-point answer scale ranging from 1 (not at all typical of me) to 5 (very typical of me). Positive items are reverse scored and item scores are summed to form a total score ranging from 16 to 80, with higher scores indicating greater worry levels. The PSWQ has good psychometric properties in student, community, and clinical samples, with studies reporting high internal consistency, short-term retest reliability, and convergent and criterion-related validity  (Brown, Antony, & Barlow, 1992; Davey, 1993) . Prior research with college samples  (Molina & Borkovec, 1994)  found a PSWQ score of 56 to fall one standard deviation below the mean of individuals diagnosed with GAD by the Anxiety Disorders Interview Schedule for DSM-IV (ADIS-IV;  Brown, Di Nardo, & Barlow, 1994) . Participants in the present study were classified as being high worriers if they scored 56 or above on the PSWQ.\n\nGeneralized Anxiety Disorder Questionnaire (GAD-Q-IV). The GAD-Q-IV  (Newman et al., 2002)  is a self-report diagnostic measure of GAD. This measure has demonstrated good test-retest reliability, convergent and discriminant validity, and a high level of diagnostic agreement with the ADIS-IV. The GAD-Q-IV is scored following the DSM-IV criteria for GAD, and individuals meeting all of the criteria are viewed as meeting diagnosis for GAD.\n\nState-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI-T). Trait anxiety was measured using the STAI-T  (Spielberger et al., 1983) . It consists of 20 statements describing anxiety symptoms that participants rate for frequency of occurrence. Scores range between 20 and 80, with a higher score indicating greater anxiety. The STAI-T has good internal consistency (.89) and test-retest reliability (.88;  Barnes, Harp, & Jung, 2002) .\n\nMood ratings. Three visual analogue mood rating scales, each 100 mm in length, assessed the extent of anxiety, depression, and happiness in participants through the use of a scale labeled not at all at one end and extremely at the other. Participants indicated their current mood by placing a cross (x) on each scale. Mood was measured with a millimeter ruler according to the position of the cross placed on each scale, with scores ranging from 0 (not at all) to 100 (extremely)."

      "text": "Homograph task. A set of 200 word pairs used by  Grey and Mathews (2000)  were presented in the homograph task. This set comprised 100 cue words: 80 homographs with threat or nonthreat meanings and 20 nonhomograph fillers. Each cue word homograph (e.g., sack) has two word associates linked to the threat meaning of the homograph (e.g., job; dismiss) and two linked to the nonthreat meaning (e.g., potatoes; bag). Each cue word was presented twice, each time with a different associated word in fragment form (a word in which one letter is missing, e.g., d_smiss). Homographs were consistently paired with threat-or nonthreat-associated word fragments (depending on assigned condition), whereas nonhomograph fillers were paired with neutral word associates.\n\nIn keeping with  Grey and Mathews (2000;  Experiments 1 & 2), on each trial a fixation cross appeared in the center of the screen for 1,000 ms, and then a blank screen appeared for 500 ms. Next, a single cue word appeared in the location of the fixation cross in yellow (e.g., throttle). Later (after 750 ms), a white word fragment (e.g., br_ke) appeared 5 cm below the location of the cue word (which remained on screen) with an underscored gap indicating the position of the missing letter. Participants were instructed to use the cue to help them find a word that was related in meaning to the cue and that matched the fragment and to press the space bar as soon as they knew what the word was. On detecting a response (or after 10 s if no response was detected), the computer produced a message prompting participants to press the key corresponding to the missing letter. When participants typed a letter (or after 6 s if no key was pressed), a feedback message was displayed for 1,000 ms. Once a correct response was detected, the completed word associate appeared on the screen along with the homograph. If an error was detected, the correct word associate appeared in red below the homograph, along with a short tone to signal an error. If no response was detected, a \"no response detected\" message appeared, and the next trial commenced.\n\nThe benign group was consistently given benign meanings of threat-related homographs, while the control group was presented with the threatening meaning 50% of the time and the benign meaning 50% of the time. All participants received the same word associates for nonhomograph filler cues. A total of 200 trials were presented, with each cue word appearing twice, in a random order. On the second presentation of each cue word, a different word associate was used, although the valence of these word associates was constant across both presentations.\n\nAmbiguous scenarios task. Ninety scenarios covering common worry topics identified in the Worry Domains Questionnaire  (Tallis, Davey, & Bond, 1994)  were used in the ambiguous scenarios task. Each scenario described a situation that was emotionally ambiguous until the final word that resolved the ambiguity in either a benign or threatening manner. To cover a variety of worry domains, the scenarios were drawn from a number of different sources. Some were selected from  Mathews and Mackintosh (2000) ; others were adapted from  Holmes, Mathews, Dalgleish, and Mackintosh (2006)  or  Huppert, Pasupuleti, Foa, and Mathews (2007) ; while others were created for this study. An example of a scenario (with final words in parentheses) is as follows: \"You are given the task of arranging the annual office party. Despite having very little time, you do your best to prepare food, drink and entertainment. As the night approaches, you think that the event will be a (success/disaster).\" All scenarios were digitally recorded.\n\nThe 90 scenarios originally designed to induce an interpretive bias were presented to participants over headphones (following the method used by  Holmes & Mathews, 2005; Holmes et al., 2006; and Murphy et al., 2007) . Each scenario remained ambiguous in terms of its emotional interpretation until the final word that resolved the ambiguity in either a threatening or benign manner was presented. Unlike the procedure used by Mathews and Mackintosh (2000; Experiment 1), outcome resolutions were provided rather than generated by participants.\n\nAt the conclusion of each scenario, a comprehension question appeared (e.g., \"Did everyone enjoy the party you planned?\"), and the correct answer to the question confirmed the provided outcome of the scenario. A \"yes/no\" prompt appeared under each question for a maximum of 10 s. At the detection of this yes/no response, a feedback message was displayed for 1,000 ms. If correct, the answer remained on screen with the question. If incorrect, a short computer-generated tone was presented and the correct (yes/no) response appeared in red below the question. If participants failed to respond, \"no response detected\" appeared, and the next trial commenced.\n\nFor the benign group, ambiguity was always resolved in a benign manner. For the control group, 50% of the time the situation was resolved in a threatening manner, and 50% of the time the situation was resolved in a benign manner. Scenarios were presented in five blocks. Blocks were in a fixed order, but the order of descriptions within each block was randomized for each participant by the E-Prime software program  (Psychology Software Tools, 2002) .\n\nFiller task. The Speed of Comprehension Test (Version A;  Baddeley, Emslie, & Nimmo-Smith, 1992)  was administered as a filler task to reduce the likelihood of group differences in mood prior to the breathing focus task. This test consists of 100 sentences, half of which are true (e.g., \"Dragonflies have wings\") and half of which are false (e.g., \"Beer lives in trees\"). Participants were given a paper version of the task and were asked to indicate with a tick or a cross which sentences were true and which were false. Participants performed this task for 2 min. To minimize the likelihood of the task inducing anxiety, instructions were amended to clearly emphasize that speed was not important."

      "title": "Outcome Measures",
      "text": "Breathing focus task. This task was adapted from a standard behavioral measure of worry originally developed by  Borkovec et al. (1983)  and later refined by  Ruscio and Borkovec (2004) . The current version consisted of three phases: a 5-min preworry breathing focus, followed by a 5-min instructed worry period, followed by a 5-min postworry breathing focus. During each 5-min breathing focus period, participants were instructed to focus their attention on their breathing, and a computer-generated tone sounded at random intervals of between 20 and 30 s, generating a total of 12 tones during each breathing focus period. At each of these tones, participants indicated whether their attention was focused on their breathing or if at that moment they had experienced a thought intrusion. If they had an intrusion, they then rated whether it was positive, neutral, or negative in content and gave a brief description (e.g., \"positive-going out tonight\"). At the end of each breathing focus period, participants completed mood rating scales (see above) and answered three questions related to the breathing focus period: \"Estimate the percentage to which you were able to focus on your breathing (0% not at all-100% all of the time)\"; \"Rate how difficult you found focusing on your breathing (0 not at all difficult-100 extremely difficult)\"; and \"Estimate the percentage of time you worried during the last 5 minutes (0% none of the time-100% all of the time).\"\n\nAfter the first breathing focus period, participants identified a current worry topic which they then discussed briefly with the experimenter to ensure that it was related to a potentially negative future situation. The experimenter wrote down a brief summary of the worry topic. Participants were then asked to continue to silently worry about this topic for 5 min, at which point the experimenter left the room. At the end of 5 min, the experimenter returned, the second breathing focus period was completed, and ratings were made (as above). Following this, participants completed retrospective mood rating scales in relation to the worry period and answered the following three questions: \"Estimate the percentage of time that you were able to spend worrying (0% not at all-100% all of the time)\"; \"Rate how difficult you found it to worry for 5 minutes (0 not difficult at all-100 extremely difficult)\"; and \"Rate how stressed you were whilst worrying (0 not stressed at all-100 extremely stressed).\"\n\nFinally, participants were asked to provide fuller descriptions of the thought intrusions reported during the breathing focus periods. For each identified thought intrusion, the experimenter read aloud the participants' summaries and asked them for a fuller description of what was going through their minds at the moment they originally had the thought intrusion. Thought expansions generated by participants were digitally recorded for later rating by an assessor. An undergraduate psychology student, who acted as the assessor, listened to the recordings of the expanded thought descriptions and rated the valence of each intrusion. To assess reliability of the assessor's valence ratings, a psychology graduate also rated 12 participants' thought expansions. Neither assessor was aware of group allocation, nor were they aware of whether the thought intrusion had occurred in the first or second breathing focus period. Interrater reliability for assessors' valence ratings based on percentage of agreement was 84.3%.\n\nAnother psychology graduate acted as an assessor to categorize participants' worry topics (on the basis of the summary provided by the experimenter) into the following categories: work/study, social/relationships, physical, and financial. They also rated how negative the worry topics were (i.e., low, medium, or high negativity of the topic). A psychology undergraduate also categorized and rated a quarter of the worry topics in the same way to provide interrater reliability. Neither assessor was aware of group allocation. The interrater reliability of percentage of agreement between assessors on both the worry topic categorization and negativity ratings was 100%.\n\nWorking memory task. The working memory task followed that used by  Hayes et al. (2008) . Participants were first asked to indicate and briefly think about a personally relevant and current worry topic, with the specification that this topic should be different from the topic identified earlier in the worry task. For the next 2 min, the experimenter asked participants a series of questions designed to prime salient negative attributes of the topic, each taking the general form of \"And what would be bad about that?\"  (Vasey & Borkovec, 1992) . Participants were then asked to continue to think about the topic and were told that this would be their main task. In addition, every time they heard a tone signal, they were required to press a key that should be chosen at random on a 15-key response box. Participants were asked to think of the tone as a signal for them to make a random response, and then to focus back on the worry topic. Participants produced a total of 100 responses by pressing one of the 15 keys, each cued by the signal generated by the computer every 3 s, for a total task duration of 5 min.\n\nRandomness was calculated using Redundancy (R), a measure of informational redundancy first derived from information theory analyses (e.g.,  Attneave, 1959; Baddeley, 1966) . This index reflects (on a scale of 0 to 100) the extent to which each key was pressed equally often. When keys are pressed with too great or small a frequency, R scores will increase. Prior research has indicated that R is one of the most sensitive measures of randomness for use with a random key-pressing task  (Baddeley, Emslie, Kolodny, & Duncan, 1998; Towse, 1998) .\n\nFor the purposes of analyses, each of the 15 keys were represented by numerical values, increasing from left to right and top to bottom, such that the top left key was assigned the value of 1 and the bottom right key 15. R randomness measures were then calculated using the software program RGCalc  (Towse & Neil, 1998) . For this measure of randomness, higher values indicate less random performance, implying less residual working memory capacity.\n\nTo confirm that both groups engaged in this task in the same way, immediately following the task, we asked participants to indicate the extent to which they kept their mind focused on their worry topic. Using a 100-mm scale labeled not at all at one end and totally at the other, they were asked to place a cross (x) on the scale. This was measured with a millimeter ruler according to the position of the cross placed on the scale, with scores ranging from 0 (not at all focused on worry topic) to 100 (totally focused on worry topic)."

Participants then received instructions for the breathing focus task, and then practiced focusing on their breathing and providing a capsule summary of their thoughts at three random time intervals within 45 s. When it was clear that all instructions were understood, participants were administered the breathing focus task. Following this, they received instructions for the working memory task and a 15-s practice of key pressing before completing this task while worrying. This was immediately followed by mood rating scales and thought ratings.\n\nFollowing completion of the experimental part of the study, participants were asked three debriefing questions. First they were asked, \"Did you notice anything in particular about the items in either the word completion task or the situations task?\" They were then asked, \"Do you have any thoughts or ideas as to what the study was about?\" Following this, participants were informed that the study was designed to examine whether the meaning of word associates they completed and the endings of ambiguous scenarios they heard would influence how much they continued to worry following the 5 min they spent deliberately worrying. Following this they were asked, \"So is that what you thought the study was about?\" Finally, participants were debriefed, thanked for their time, and paid \u00a315 ($30)."

These mixed model ANOVAs considered the between-participants factor group (benign vs. control) and the repeated measures factor time (baseline vs. posthomograph task vs. postambiguous scenarios task). 1 When conducted on anxiety ratings, these analyses revealed a significant main effect of time, F(2, 76) \u03ed 10.09, p \u03fd .001, f 2 \u03ed 0.51.

Thus, we found no evidence of significant mood differences prior to the breathing focus task that could account for any differences in negative thought intrusions between groups.\n\nTo determine how mood changed for both groups during the breathing focus task, a mixed model ANOVA was carried out separately on each of the three mood rating scales administered to participants pre-and postworry breathing focus periods and at the end of the worry period (see Table  3  for means and standard deviations). These mixed model analyses considered the betweenparticipants factor group and the repeated measures factor time (preworry breathing focus period vs. immediately postworry vs. postworry breathing focus period).\n\nWhen conducted on anxiety ratings, this analysis revealed a significant main effect of time, F(2, 76) \u03ed 196.13, p \u03fd .001, f 2 \u03ed 2.27.

As predicted, one-tailed independent-samples t tests conducted on anxiety ratings revealed that the benign group reported less anxiety than the control group during both preworry breathing focus (1.70 vs. 3.63), t(38) \u03ed 2.64, p \u03fd .01, d \u03ed 0.84, and postworry breathing focus (2.39 vs. 3.72), t(38) \u03ed 1.79, p \u03fd .05, d \u03ed 0.56. However, there was no difference in anxiety ratings between the two groups during the instructed worry period itself (6.65 vs. 6.71), t \u03fd 1, d \u03ed 0.03 (see Table  3 ).\n\nWhen conducted on depressed mood ratings, the ANOVA revealed a significant main effect of time, F(1.63, 62.04) \u03ed 42.73, p \u03fd .001, f 2 \u03ed 1.06, reflecting an increase in depressed mood from preworry breathing focus to postworry (1.88 vs. 4.81), t(39) \u03ed 7.7, p \u03fd .001, d \u03ed 1.16, as well as a significant decrease in depressed mood from postworry to postworry breathing focus (4.81 vs. 2.62), t(39) \u03ed 5.89, p \u03fd .001, d \u03ed 0.84.

Thus all participants reported an increase in depressed mood from the end of the preworry breathing focus to the end of the worry period, and then a decrease to the end of postworry breathing focus, regardless of group.\n\nWhen conducted on happiness ratings, analyses revealed a significant main effect of time, F(1.53, 58.12) \u03ed 56.39, p \u03fd .001, f 2 \u03ed 1.22, reflecting a decrease in happiness from preworry breathing focus to postworry (5.88 vs. 2.56), t(39) \u03ed 7.83, p \u03fd .001, d \u03ed 1.49, as well as a significant increase in happiness from postworry to postworry breathing focus (2.56 vs. 5.47), t(39) \u03ed 7.89, p \u03fd .001, d \u03ed 1.36.

Prior practice in accessing benign meanings was associated with less anxiety during breathing focus, both before and after instructed worry."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "The main aim of this study was to investigate whether practice in accessing benign meanings of ambiguous information would lead to fewer negative thought intrusions and less worry in high worriers. In keeping with the hypothesis, individuals with high levels of trait worry who were allocated to the benign group reported fewer negative thought intrusions during breathing focus than did those in the control group. This effect was not confined to self-report, since an assessor (who was not informed about group allocation, or during which breathing focus period the intrusions had occurred) did not differ from participants in terms of categorization. Participants' ratings of the extent to which they worried during the breathing focus periods were also lower in the benign than in the control condition; conversely, ratings of ability to focus on their breathing were greater in the benign than in the control group. The benign group also reported lower levels of anxiety during both breathing focus periods (i.e., prior to and after instructed worry) in comparison with the control group. In sum, therefore, it seems that prior practice in accessing benign meanings of worry-related information enabled more effective control over negative intrusions when the current task required it and simultaneously reduced concomitant anxiety. It appears that prior access to worry-related benign meanings may have reduced the capacity of worry content to preempt attention, leaving participants better able to maintain their attention on the task at hand (e.g., breathing focus).\n\nConsistent with this possibility, group differences were also observed in the amount of residual working memory capacity available when instructed to worry. Key-press responses were more random for participants in the benign than the control group, indicating more residual working memory capacity available to perform other cognitive operations. This finding cannot easily be attributed to the extent to which the groups worried during the working memory task, because there were no such group differences, and the randomness effect remained significant when the extent to which participants worried during the working memory task was covaried out. As suggested above, however, it could be that the attention-holding quality of these negative thoughts may have been modified by prior practice in accessing benign meanings, potentially freeing up resources for other tasks.\n\nIt is difficult to attribute these effects to differences in accuracy of performance during the ambiguity tasks, or to differences in mood prior to the breathing focus task, as groups did not differ in these respects. Furthermore, effects are not readily attributable to group differences in the worry topics or perceived ability to engage in worry (when instructed to do so) because no such differences were found in assessor ratings of the type of worry topic or degree of negativity of the worry, and neither were they found on participant ratings of how difficult it was to worry, amount of time worrying, or how stressful it was to engage in worry. It remains possible that experimenter demand effects may have influenced self-ratings, although several other findings suggested that demand is unlikely to provide a complete explanation. During the postexperimental interviews, no one was able to describe the purpose of the study, nor any link between the ambiguity tasks and the breathing focus task. Furthermore, after being told the purpose of the study, none of the participants reported having thought that was what the study had been about. Hence, although it is not possible to completely rule out demand effects, they do not appear likely to provide a complete explanation for the current data.\n\nIf it is granted that such artefactual explanations are unlikely to provide a full account of the findings, then this strengthens the hypothesis that practice in accessing benign meanings was responsible for the effects observed. Because worry is characterized by repeated thoughts about future events that could lead to benign as well as negative outcomes  (Sibrava & Borkovec, 2006) , prior practice in accessing benign outcomes could have changed the form of processing taking place during the breathing focus periods. That is, for participants in the benign condition, later negative intrusions may have cued the generation of alternative and more benign outcomes, thus reducing the capacity of worry to preempt cognitive resources. In contrast, those allocated to the control group (who accessed both negative and benign outcomes equally) may have been less likely than those in the benign group to generate alternative and less threatening outcomes of such thoughts, thus maintaining attention on the perceived threat  (Berenbaum, Thompson, & Pomerantz, 2007) .\n\nThe current study marks the first objective (assessor) assessment of the valence of thought intrusions reported by participants during the breathing focus task. Previously, this paradigm had only provided participants' subjective categorizations of the valence of their thought intrusions. The current finding that assessor ratings and self-ratings did not differ implies that high worriers are indeed accurate in categorizing the valence of their thought intrusions. This suggests that any changes sustained as a result of practice accessing benign meanings led to objectively less negative thought intrusions, rather than to a potential alternative situation in which benign and control participants had objectively similar thoughts (as determined by the assessor); however, the benign group categorized them in a more benign manner.\n\nIn keeping with  Wilson et al. (2006)  and  Murphy et al. (2007) , the lack of group differences in anxiety immediately following completion of both of the ambiguity tasks did not preclude significant group differences in anxiety reactivity during the breathing focus task. Specifically, whereas both groups reported increased anxiety when actively worrying, the benign group reported lower levels of anxiety both prior to and following instructed worry than did the control group. This finding suggests that repeated practice accessing benign meanings of emotionally ambiguous information can result in lower levels of anxiety and a greater ability to reduce anxiety following a stressful situation. Hence, it seems that these methods may have reduced the vulnerability to anxiety, at least in the short term. Further research will be needed to investigate how long these effects can be sustained. This future research should also include an assessment of negative thought intrusions and randomness prior to practice in accessing benign meanings, as this will enable the extent of change to be assessed, as well as ensure that the groups do not differ prior to practice in accessing benign meanings. Another potentially interesting avenue for the research would be to include an assessment of how the practice in accessing benign meanings would influence other cognitive processes, such as attention.\n\nOne potentially problematic feature of the present study was the inclusion of both the homograph and ambiguous scenario tasks. Consequently, we are unable to establish whether group differences observed here are attributable to either one or both of these tasks in combination. One reason for using both tasks was to provide opportunities for generating benign meanings in more than one context, so as to increase the chances of generalization to the negative intrusions occurring in worry. By beginning with singleword meanings (homographs) and progressing to more complex scenarios, we were basing our design on a graded skills learning approach, in which the required response is kept relatively simple at first but then extends to increasingly realistic and complex processes (for similar arguments applied to positive bias modification, see  Mathews et al., 2007) . In this case, we supposed that using homographs would provide the simpler initial learning experiences but that the later scenarios would be closer to the more usual form of worry. Clearly, however, a corresponding disadvantage is that we cannot know whether presenting homographs before ambiguous scenarios was indeed helpful in the way we had anticipated. Further research is therefore needed to establish which cognitive modification techniques are most effective in decreasing worry and whether there are indeed benefits from using a graded approach, such as the approach that we used here.\n\nAnother omission from the present study was that of any direct measure of the extent to which the benign group did indeed selectively access more benign outcomes of future worry-related events as a result of practice accessing benign meanings. The materials and methods used here were originally developed to manipulate interpretive biases  (Grey & Mathews, 2000; Mathews & Mackintosh, 2000) . Although the current study did not assess interpretive bias directly, both  Murphy et al. (2007)  and  Mathews et al. (2007)  have already shown that use of essentially the same method and materials resulted in high anxious individuals adopting a more benign interpretive bias. Furthermore, it is difficult to account for the differences seen during the worry task in the present experiment, such as fewer negative thought intrusions, without supposing that the effects of practice in accessing benign meanings did not carry over to the later assessment period. Nonetheless, future research should include more direct measures of the purported mechanism underlying these effects on worry.\n\nA final issue that needs to be considered is that of how far the present results can be generalized to naturally occurring worry and to clinical disorders such as GAD. The worry task used here was adapted from an established method  (Borkovec et al., 1983; Ruscio & Borkovec, 2004 ), and as with other studies using instructed worry (e.g.,  Mathews & Milroy, 1994) , it is assumed that instructed worry is similar to naturally occurring worry. However, we cannot be certain that the findings of the present study would generalize to naturally occurring worry when individuals focus on daily (nonworry) tasks. It will be important in future research to investigate the extent to which the methods used here reduce real-life problems associated with excessive worry, such as concentration problems, and other anxiety symptoms. Nonetheless, we believe the current findings, based on a sample of university staff and students who worry excessively, may have some clinical relevance because they show that practice in accessing benign meanings can have an effect on the cardinal feature of GAD, namely, worry. Furthermore, the observed effects on working memory may help to explain the difficulty in controlling worry experienced by people with GAD.\n\nIn the present study, over half of the participants in the benign group (and half in the control group) met diagnostic criteria for GAD on the GAD-Q-IV. Furthermore, individuals who met criteria for GAD on this measure did not significantly differ from those who did not meet these criteria in terms of the number of negative thought intrusions, amount of anxiety, or working memory capacity. This suggests that the presence of a GAD diagnosis does not obviate (or even reduce) the effectiveness of the cognitive bias modification methods used here, although further research is clearly needed to replicate the current findings in a clinical GAD population.\n\nCognitive-behavioral interventions often focus on challenging negative thought and meanings; for example, by having clients generate contrary evidence. More recently, however, interest in methods of enhancing positive cognitive content and processes has been increasing (e.g.,  Borkovec, Newman, & Castonguay, 2003; Clark et al., 2006) . The findings from this study provide support for this change in clinical focus by suggesting that helping clients to access benign meanings of emotionally ambiguous information may reduce some of problems reported by clients with GAD, such as worry and concentration problems.\n\nIn summary, the current study demonstrated that repeated practice in accessing benign meanings of emotionally ambiguous information can reduce the number of negative thought intrusions, along with anxious mood, when high worriers attempted to focus on a task unrelated to worry. Moreover, these methods were shown to lead to greater residual working memory capacity when engaging in worry. Future research is required to investigate whether these methods can produce similar changes in clients with GAD, perhaps paving the way for potential improvements in clinical interventions."
