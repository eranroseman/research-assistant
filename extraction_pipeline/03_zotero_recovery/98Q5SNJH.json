      "text": "There is high-quality evidence from the two RCTs that mobile phone text-messaging at weekly intervals is efficacious in enhancing adherence to ART, compared to standard care. There is high quality evidence from one trial that weekly mobile phone text-messaging is efficacious in improving HIV viral load suppression. Policy-makers should consider funding programs proposing to provide weekly mobile phone text-messaging as a means for promoting adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Clinics and hospitals should consider implementing such programs. There is a need for large RCTs of this intervention in adolescent populations, as well as in high-income countries."

      "text": "More than 34 million people are presently living with HIV infection. Antiretroviral therapy (ART) can help these people to live longer, healthier lives, but because of side-effects, adherence (taking these medications every day) can be difficult. Mobile phone text-messaging has the potential to help promote adherence in these patients.\n\nTwo randomised controlled trials from Kenya were included in the review. One trial compared short weekly text messages against standard care. The other trial compared short daily, long daily, short weekly and long weekly messages against standard care.\n\nIn the trial comparing only short weekly messages to standard care, text messaging was associated with lower risk of non-adherence at 12 months, and with the non-occurrence of virologic failure at 12 months.\n\nCombining the data from both trials, weekly mobile phone text-messaging was associated with greater ART adherence at 48-52 weeks. The effect of short weekly text-messaging was also significant.\n\nIn the trial that compared different intervals and lengths for text-messaging to standard care, long weekly text-messaging was not significantly associated with a lower risk of non-adherence compared to standard care. Patients receiving weekly text-messages of any length were at lower risk of non-adherence at 48 weeks than were patients receiving daily messages of any length. There were no significant differences between weekly text-messaging of any length and between short or long messaging at either interval. Compared to standard care, any daily text-messaging, whether short or long, did not reduce the risk for non-adherence.\n\nWeekly mobile phone text messages to patients on ART can help them to take their medication every day. It can also help to reduce the amount of HIV in their bloodstream.\n\nBecause the two included trials were with adult patients only, there is a need for trials of this intervention with adolescents. Also, as the two trials were conducted in Kenya, a low-income country, there is a need for trials of this intervention in high-income countries."

Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews B A C K G R O U N D More than 34 million people were living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in 2010 (UNAIDS 2011). Over 15 million of these people are clinically eligible for antiretroviral therapy (ART), but only around 5.2 million were receiving treatment (UNAIDS 2011). ART can lead to marked reductions in mortality at the population level (Palella 1998), but because of costs, lack of infrastructure and other issues, ART has become available in many low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) only in the past few years (WHO 2010). As provision of ART has become more widely available in LMIC with a high burden of HIV disease, mortality has begun to decline, but is still unacceptably high (WHO 2009).\n\nART can help patients to feel better, live longer and slow progression of the disease (UNAIDS 2011), but many patients find it difficult to comply with the regimens they have been prescribed  (Mills 2006) . Adherence to ART is crucial not only for the patient's survival but also to prevent drug resistance with resultant treatment failure and need to switch to a second-line regimen. In LMIC, second-line regimens are much more expensive than firstline regimens (WHO 2010). Another benefit of adherence is that patients with a suppressed HIV viral load are significantly less likely to transmit the infection to sexual partners  (Anglemyer 2011) .\n\nFor these reasons, it is thus important to find better ways to help patients stay adherent to their ART regimens. As wireless telecommunications networks have spread rapidly throughout sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, and other resource-limited settings with high HIV prevalence, sending text-messages on wireless mobile telephones has become an extremely popular means of communication among people in all sectors of society (Guardian 2009; iTWire 2011). Mobile phone text-messaging, also called short messaging service (SMS), has been proposed as an approach to enhancing patient adherence to ART regimens."

Evidence from observational studies starts at \"low,\" but can be upgraded if the magnitude of treatment effect is very large, if there is a significant doseresponse relation, or if all possible confounders would decrease the magnitude of an apparent treatment effect  (Guyatt 2008) .

In Lester 2010, the control condition was standard care. In Pop-Eleches 2011, the control condition was provision of a cell phone, but this cell phone received no studyrelated text messages or other communication.\n\nLester 2010 : Lester and colleagues in Kenya randomly assigned 273 patients initiating ART to mobile phone text-messaging, and 265 to standard care. Text messages were brief (\"Mambo?\", the Kiswahili term for \"How are you?\"), sent once weekly, with a response requested within 48 hours. The primary outcomes were self-reported ART adherence (measured as >95% of prescribed doses in the past 30 days, assessed at 6 months and 12 months) and suppression of plasma HIV viral load (<400 copies per \u00b5L) at 12 months. The analysis was by intention to treat.\n\nPatients receiving text messages were at lower risk of reporting non-adherence to ART at 12 months (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.93). Patients receiving text messages were also at lower risk of experiencing virologic failure (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.99).\n\nPop-Eleches 2011 : Pop-Eleches and colleagues in Kenya randomly assigned 431 patients recently initiating ART (<3 months) to one of four intervention conditions (receiving short or long mobile phone text messages, either daily or weekly) or to standard care (with provision of a mobile phone but no study-related communication).\n\nThe messages were provided in English, Dhoulou or Kiswahili (as appropriate). The content of the short message was \"This is your reminder.\" The content of the long message was \"This is your reminder. Be strong and courageous. We care about you.\"\n\nThe primary outcome was ART adherence of <90% during each 12week period of analysis, for 48 weeks. The analysis was by intention to treat. Adherence was also measured with a medication event moniitoring system (MEMS).\n\n\u2022 At 48 weeks, patients in any of the four intervention groups were at no lower risk of non-adherence than those in the control group (RR 0.89, 95% CI 0.74 to 1.06). \u2022 Patients in either of the weekly message intervention groups (whether short message or long message) were at lower risk of non-adherence than those in the control group (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.63 to 0.98). \u2022 Patients receiving short weekly messages were not at significantly lower risk of non-adherence than were those in the control group (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.59 to1.03). \u2022 Patients receiving long weekly messages were not at signficantly lower risk of non-adherence than were those in the control group (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.60 to 1.04). \u2022 There was no difference in the risk for non-adherence in patients receiving short daily messages compared to those in the control group (RR 1.00, 95% CI 0.79 to 1.27). \u2022 There was no difference in the risk for non-adherence in patients receiving long daily messages compared to those in the control group (RR 0.98, 95% CI 0.77 to 1.24). \u2022 There was no difference in the risk for non-adherence in patients receiving any daily messages compared to those in the control group (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.20). \u2022 There was no difference in the risk for non-adherence in patients receiving weekly text messages of any length (RR 1.01, 95% CI 0.75 to 1.37), nor between short or long messaging at either interval (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.78 to 1.27). \u2022 Patients receiving weekly text messages of any length were at lower risk for non-adherence than were patients receiving daily messages of any length (RR 0.79, 95% CI 0.64 to 0.99)."

In Pop-Eleches 2011, there is an unclear risk of bias due to a lack of clarity in regard to the allocation concealment method.

Any weekly textmessaging (i.e. whether short or long messages) was associated with ART adherence at 48-52 weeks (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89). Short weekly text-messaging was also associated with ART adherence at 48-52 weeks (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.89). Using data only from Lester 2010, short weekly text messaging was associated with the viral load suppression at 52 weeks (RR 0.83, 95% CI 0.69 to 0.99).\n\nNeither trial addressed quality of life outcomes.\n\n\u2022 See Table  1 , Effects of the interventions."

In meta-analysis of two trials, any mobile phone text-messaging (i.e., whether daily or weekly messages) was associated with greater ART adherence at 48-52 weeks (RR 0.82, 95% CI 0.72 to 0.94).The effect of any weekly text-messaging was also significant (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.68 to 0.89), as was that of short weekly text-messaging (RR 0.77, 95% CI 0.67 to 0.89).\n\nBecause daily text-messaging in Pop-Eleches 2011 suggested no effect (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.82 to 1.20, Analysis 1.6), the measured outcomes for \"any text-messaging\" may better indicate the efficacy of either weekly mode of text-messaging, especially given the larger sample generated by pooling data from Lester 2010 with both weekly-message arms of Pop-Eleches 2011 (Analysis 1.3).

Qualitative findings Haberer 2010 provides qualitative data for Pop-Eleches 2011, although they do not measure the quality of life outcomes specified in this review's protocol. Instead, Haberer and colleagues discuss feasibility issues in implementing the intervention of Pop-Eleches and colleagues. Based on qualitative interviews with participants, the most important issues pointed out by Haberer and colleagues were the need for detailed, multi-session trainings for patients in the use of mobile phone technologies and PIN numbers and the possible need for modest monetary incentives to keep patients sufficiently motivated to participate in the study."

New interventions are urgently needed. Mobile phones and other new telecommunications technologies are being used to address a broad range of healthcare issues, from improving attendance in primary care  (Leong 2006) , to treating sexually transmitted infections  (Menon-Johansson 2006) , to supporting community-based peer health workers caring for people with HIV/ AIDS  (Chang 2011 ) . An industry-funded narrative (non-systematic) review by Atun and colleagues provides an overview of these approaches  (Atun 2006) . A Cochrane review provides evidence that mobile phone text-messaging is efficacious in promoting adherence to tuberculosis medications  (Liu 2008) .

Although adherence in Lester 2010 was measured by self-report, we do not grade down for indirectness because the measured effect was consistent with that of weekly and short weekly messages in Pop-Eleches 2011 (as well as with the outcome measured biomedically in Lester 2010).There is high quality evidence from one trial that mobile phone text-messaging at weekly intervals is efficacious in improving HIV viral load suppression. There is low quality evidence from one trial that textmessaging at daily intervals is no more efficacious than standard care in promoting adherence to ART. The quality of evidence was graded down twice due to very few events."

With adherence to ART such an important factor not only in improving individual patient health but also in reducing viral load sufficiently to prevent further HIV transmission (Anglemyer 2011) , interventions such as mobile phone text-messaging have the potential to make a significant impact on the HIV epidemic. With the rapid expansion of mobile phone networks worldwide, particularly in regions that are new to these technologies (Guardian 2009, iTWire 2011), it will become more feasible to implement these interventions."

With adherence to ART such an important factor not only in improving individual patient health but also in reducing viral load sufficiently to prevent further HIV transmission (Anglemyer 2011) , interventions such as mobile phone text-messaging have the potential to make a significant impact on the HIV epidemic. With the rapid expansion of mobile phone networks worldwide, particularly in regions that are new to these technologies (Guardian 2009, iTWire 2011), it will become more feasible to implement these interventions."
