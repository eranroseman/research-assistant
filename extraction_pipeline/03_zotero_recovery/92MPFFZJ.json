  "title": "Recognizing Unintentional Touch on Interactive Tabletop",
  "abstract": "A multi-touch interactive tabletop is designed to embody the benefits of a digital computer within the familiar surface of a physical tabletop. However, the nature of current multi-touch tabletops to detect and react to all forms of touch, including unintentional touches, impedes users from acting naturally on them. In our research, we leverage gaze direction, head orientation and screen contact data to identify and filter out unintentional touches, so that users can take full advantage of the physical properties of an interactive tabletop, e.g., resting hands or leaning on the tabletop during the interaction. To achieve this, we first conducted a user study to identify behavioral pattern differences (gaze, head and touch) between completing usual tasks on digital versus physical tabletops. We then compiled our findings into five types of spatiotemporal features, and train a machine learning model to recognize unintentional touches with an F1 score of 91.3%, outperforming the state-of-the-art model by 4.3%. Finally we evaluated our algorithm in a real-time filtering system. A user study shows that our algorithm is stable and the improved tabletop effectively screens out unintentional touches, and provide more relaxing and natural user experience. By linking their gaze and head behavior to their touch behavior, our work sheds light on the possibility of future tabletop technology to improve the understanding of users' input intention.",

      "title": "1. INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "Nowadays, interactive tabletops are widely used in exhibition  [49] , education  [23, 27] , military  [4]  and emergency control  [6, 26] , etc. Such a tabletop is expected to combine the advantages of a physical table with a digital computer, by allowing users to directly touch the table's surface to issue input commands. A touchable and unmovable tabletop is distinguished from mobile touchable devices by providing benefits such as body support  [10] , large visual information display  [4, 26, 49]  and simultaneous multiperson collaboration  [3, 4] .\n\nAn interactive tabletop allows for tangible interaction, but not all contacts on the tabletop surface are intended to trigger a digital response. For example, when writing or drawing on the surface, a user may support her body, or rest her palms, wrists, and forearms on the surface to reduce fatigue  [2] . In such cases, an ideal tabletop system should have the intelligence to filter unintentional touches. We define unintentional touches as those touches that Fig.  1 . Intentional and unintentional touches on a tabletop. Face point is the intersection of the tabletop surface and the \"face ray\", which is emitted from the center of the face, in the forward direction. Gaze point is the midpoint of two interactions of the surface and \"gaze rays\", which are emitted from the center of two pupils respectively, in the gaze direction.\n\ndo not contribute to any interaction goal. Previous works also use accidental/unwanted touches  [32, 36] . In our paper, we use them interchangeably with the same definition as unintentional touches.\n\nHowever, currently, the issue of avoiding unintentional touch on tabletops has not been systematically studied in academia; a tabletop system usually recognizes any contact of a human body with the tabletop surface as a touch event. As a result, users tend to behave carefully and prudently on tabletops to avoid triggering unwanted touch events. For example, Annett et al.  [1]  found that users floated their hand over the screen when handling a stylus and drawing on a tablet to avoid accidental palm touches. In other words, it is hard for users to exhibit many of their natural behaviors on interactive tabletops, e.g., resting hands/arms on the surface, stretching arms/elbows to support the body, gesticulating tentatively during contemplation, etc. Users may get even more frustrated when committing unintentional touches disrupts their workflow, despite their effort to avoid them.\n\nIn literature, the issue of unintentional touches has been extensively studied  [9, 13, 37, 65] , but mostly on mobile devices such as phones and tablets  [2, 32, 36] . For instance, some research has looked into palm rejection on mobile devices during tasks such as note-taking and drawing  [2, 14, 52] . However, the interaction paradigm on a large-scale tabletop is different from that on a mobile device because of its physical size and lack of mobility. For example, users can hold and move the mobile phone or tablet when needed, but when interacting with a tabletop, users must move themselves. In our study involving two usual tasks on multi-touch tabletops, we found that on average, 17.1%/45.3% of touches are unintentional on an interactive/physical tabletop. The high frequency of unintentional touches on tabletops motivates our research.\n\nIn this research, we propose a novel approach that leverages the intrinsic relationships between the gaze and face behavior and contact behavior to recognize unintentional touches on interactive tabletops (Figure  1 ). This is inspired by the previous observation that face and gaze direction usually indicates where people's interest and attention lie  [59, 74] . Our work sheds light on the possibility of future tabletop technology to better understand users and their input intention by incorporating the information conveyed by their gaze and head behavior.\n\nThis research has three phases, each contributing to answer one of the three research questions.\n\n(1) RQ1) What are the differences between users' gaze, head, and touch behavior patterns on a digital interactive tabletop and those on a physical tabletop? We conduct a user study to empirically investigate and compare users' gaze, head, and touch behavior on a digital interactive tabletop versus on a physical tabletop, for completing two usual tasks (map navigation and photo categorization). We identify significant differences in terms of the number of unintentional touches, as well as coordination patterns of gaze and head between the two modalities. (2) RQ2) How to filter out unintentional touches on a digital tabletop to allow relaxing postures on the surface?\n\nWe propose a set of features according to the spatiotemporal characteristics of gaze, head and touch data.\n\nBased on these features, we train and compare several machine learning models to recognize unintentional touches. The performance of the best Gradient Boosting model (0.914, 0.913 and 0.913 on average precision, recall, and F1 score, respectively) significantly outperforms baseline models.\n\n(3) RQ3) What is the stability of the algorithm and the usability of the new interactive tabletop? We implement a system that can recognize and filter unintentional touches on an interactive tabletop in real-time. A user study validates the stability of our algorithm (F1 score equals 90.6%), and shows that our new system can effectively screen out unintentional touches, and provide more natural and relaxing user experience."

      "title": "2.1. Recognizing Unintentional Touch on Interactive Devices",
      "text": "Several works have been conducted to recognize unintentional input on small-scale touchscreen devices. Matero and Colley  [36]  tried to classify accidental touch events on mobile phones in daily usage. They investigated numerous typical operations on mobile devices (e.g., sweeping on the screen, device handling and phone calls) and proposed a rule-based classification algorithm according to the contact area and touch duration. Their best algorithm can eliminate 79.6% of unintentional touches with a 0.8% false-positive rate. Lu and Li  [32]  analyzed accidental touches during the standby mode of mobile phones. They compared intentional touch gestures and unintentional touches on a turned-off screen, e.g., putting the device in a pocket. They used a number of touch spatiotemporal features such as duration, touch area trajectory, pressure level on the screen, and acceleration deviation from the motion sensor to classify whether a touch on a turned-off screen was accidental. Their final decision tree model achieved 98.2% on precision and 97.6% on recall.\n\nAnother big family of touch-based devices are tablets. Annett et al.  [1]  compared the unintended touches that occurred when using a stylus on digital versus media. They found that users maintained some unnatural and tiring postures on the digital tablets to avoid unintentional touches caused by their palms, e.g., floating their hands over the screen. They further investigated different algorithms to remove accidental touches on stylusbased tablets  [2] . Their best algorithm used the distance between the screen and the stylus as the threshold and achieved approximately 86% accuracy for the classification. Julia Schwarz et al.  [52]  focused on unwanted interaction triggered by palms on tablets. They used similar spatiotemporal features in  [32]  to distinguish palm touches from stylus input. Their decision forest model achieved a precision of 97.9% and 0.016 errors/stroke.\n\nTo our knowledge, previous works on recognizing unintentional touch were performed on mobile phones and tablets. However, tabletops can accommodate distinct interaction activities. Beyond that, they are more prone to unintentional touches due to their increased surface area and a wider range of possible inputs. For instance, users can easily lean on the tabletop or put an arm on the surface to support themselves. These actions would be far less common when interacting with smartphones or tablets. Although the interactions on tablets have some overlap with those of tabletops, previous works focus on the distinction between the stylus and accidental finger/palm touches. This relieves the technical difficulty, because the stylus has unique properties such as small static touch area, as pointed out in  [52] . The difference on the interface will also lead to the difference in features such as touch trajectories  [40] . In this research, we address the gap by investigating unintentional touches on digital tabletops."

      "title": "2.2. Gaze and Face for Interaction and Intention",
      "text": "People primarily direct their gaze towards regions of interest  [17, 20, 25, 56, 59, 68, 69, 71, 72, 74] . Several works evaluated the coordination patterns of mouse cursor and gaze during daily interaction on PCs. Huang et al.  [19]  investigated the behavioral patterns of gaze and mouse cursor during web searches. They found that while users' gaze-cursor alignment varied a lot, users lagged their cursor behind their gaze by at least 250 ms and on average 700 ms. Liebling and Dumais  [30]  looked into users' daily work on PC in the wild. In contrast to the previous findings, they suggested that the gaze leads mouse only in two-thirds of the time. However, the results in  [30]  still supported the consistency between the cursor and gaze during intentional interactions.\n\nThe consistency between gaze and intention inspired a number of new interaction techniques. Jacob  [20]  proposed several novel interaction methods using eye gaze as the independent channel, e.g., object selection on a PC screen. Since then, many gaze-enhanced input approaches have been proposed. Researchers have tried to facilitate pointing/touch interaction with the gaze. For example, Zhai et al.  [76]  proposed MAGIC pointing, which used gaze for object suggestions on screens and hand-control for confirmation. Stellmach et al.  [58]  designed a gaze-supported selection method for distant display. They used gaze for selection and hand gestures on a handheld device for manipulation. Sidenmark et al.  [54]  leveraged the coordination of gaze and head to acquire gaze targets in virtual reality. Turner et al.  [62]  extended the idea with more gaze-touch combination patterns, such as performing RST (rotate, scale, translate) by touch on the trajectory suggested by gaze. Voelker et al.  [64]  developed an indirect input system, where a user touched on a horizontal surface and looked at a vertical screen. Both Turner et al.  [63]  and Mauderer et al.  [39]  suggested selecting out-of-reach objects through combination of far gaze and close touch on a tabletop. Pfeuffer et al.  [43, 45]  proposed several scenarios on a tablet screen, using gaze for object selection or button selection and using touch for RST. Sidenmark et al.  [55]  utilized eye-hand coordination patterns on interacted objects for eye-tracking calibration in the virtual reality setting. All these works employed gaze as a viable input channel, showing that gaze could play a significant role in enhancing interaction across mobile devices such as tablets and phones or non-mobile devices such as tabletops.\n\nHowever, these works mainly employed gaze as an active channel during interactions. Fewer works discussed using gaze as a cue for human intention. Schwarz and her colleagues  [51]  used the gaze and body direction to determine whether the user was engaged in a Kinect game. Mariakakis et al.  [34]  detected users' gaze to determine whether they were focusing on their phones. Pfeuffer et al.  [44]  proposed a mechanism to switch between direct and indirect input mode based on the alignment of the input area and the user's visual attention. Compared to gaze direction, a relatively lower-cost alternative is to use facial orientation, which also proves to be a powerful proxy for attention. Hollands et al.  [18]  suggested that in approximately 70 percent of scenarios, the gaze direction and face direction are the same. Liao  [29]  used facial direction as one of the clues to determine a user's most interested picture in a photo collection. Maglio et al.  [33]  built a system that used face direction to determine where the user intends to interact with the environment. All these works indicate that eye gaze and head pose can be used to predict regions of interest. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work evaluating the performance using gaze and face features for recognizing the unintentional inputs on touchscreens."

      "title": "2.3. Leveraging Unintentional Touches as Intentional Input Methods",
      "text": "Our goal is to remove unwanted effects of unintentional touches on tabletops. However, some literature interprets the nature of these touches differently: instead of \"ignoring\" unintentional interactions on tabletops, they tried to \"use\" those interactions. For example, Koura et al.  [24]  proposed to use the forearm, which was usually considered problematic (e.g., incorrect recognition and occlusions), as a new interaction technique for menu manipulation and data storage. Le et al.  [28]  proposed to interpret leaning into a new class of gestures to enhance interaction. Matulic et al.  [38]  extended hand interactions from fingertips to the whole hand in hand-shape based interaction. Zhang et al.  [77]  proposed to leverage various hand postures such as using the palm to augment pen and touch interactions. These works provide another perspective to deal with unintentional touches. However, any interaction technique requires additional attention from users. These works do not solve users' concerns about accidentally creating unwanted interaction. Recently, Serim and Jacucci had an interesting discussion on the distinct definition of explicit vs. implicit interaction, and identified new considerations for design and evaluation of implicit interaction  [53] . Similarly, our work tries to obviate the concerns about accidental actions and enable users to operate on tabletops freely.\n\nIn the rest of the paper, we try to answer the three research questions one by one. We begin by answering RQ1 via Study 1."

Measuring the difference helped us understand how users changed their interaction behaviors when using touch-sensitive technology.

The size of the system was 250 cm \u00d7 160 cm \u00d7 80 cm, with a 220cm \u00d7 135cm screen at the center of the table surface, powered by a built-in computer with Windows 10 OS. Its capacitive screen was realized via an iPCT transparent touch foil  [75]  that could sense up to 20 touch events simultaneously at 100Hz, recording the timestamp, location and state (touch down/up/move) of each touch point. Here we defined a touch event as a detected touch point from being put down to lifted up. Note that the system did not provide contact area information. A wide touch area registered as multiple simultaneous touch events. Therefore, if a palm was put on the surface unintentionally, there would be a group of unintentional touch events. Moreover, it did not have any pre-filtering algorithm and registered all touch events, which served as a good platform for answering our research questions.\n\nAdditionally, we used a head-mounted gaze tracker, Binocular 120Hz Pupillab Eye-tracker  [21]  to track users' gaze direction relative to the gaze tracker. The Pupillab was calibrated with its marker system for each participant.\n\nWe employed an Optitrack system with 12 cameras  [46]  to capture the 3D location and angle of the gaze tracker at 120 Hz. The direction of the gaze trackers indicated the head pose and face direction. It could then be used to calculate the face/gaze fixation points. The fixation position on the tabletop where a user was facing/looking at was computed in real-time in Unity 5.5.4. Figure  1  shows the definition and the calculation of the face point and gaze point. We tested the eye-tracking on two authors with 9 markers (3 \u00d7 3, aspect ratio, for all regions of the screen) on the table, with an average gaze angle of 25 \u00b0and an average vision distance of 50 cm. The (a) Digital, Stand, Map Task (b) Physical, Sit, Photo Task Fig. 3. Experiment Setting Examples tracking accuracy is 2.39 \u00b1 1.48 \u00b0and the precision is 1.97 \u00b1 1.05 \u00b0.

These two tasks were commonly used to investigate interactions in previous research. They involve the most common interactions on the surface, such as tapping, dragging, zooming, rotating, etc.\n\nIn the map navigation task, a mid-sized city map is shown on the tabletop, initially at the same size as the screen and centered. None of the participants were familiar with the city. Two subtasks needed to be finished under each condition. In the first subtask, participants were asked to find three landmarks on the map, after which they were instructed to draw a route connecting them. In the second subtask, participants needed to find two landmarks and design a subway route from one to the other. There were several candidate routes, and the subtask could be completely by sketching out any one of them. To avoid memory effect, the details of the subtasks (e.g., the landmarks) between the digital and physical tabletops were different. But the tasks are kept the same among all participants to maintain the difficulty level.\n\nIn the photo categorization task, 40 fixed-size photos (standard A5 size, 148 x 210 mm) were displayed on the surface. These photos belonged to four different groups such as forest, snowfield, beach, and house. 10 samples from each category were randomly scattered on the table in a reachable region. Participants were required to sort them into four piles by category. We prepared 16 different categories to avoid the learning effect."

Participants could press a button to switch between the modes.\n\nThe operations in the photo categorization task were simple.

Therefore, all touch behaviors on the physical tabletop could also be recorded.\n\nFor the map navigation task, we placed a paper map with identical size (before zooming) and color on top of the surface.

The effect of the two main factors' interaction was also not significant (F t abl e\u00d7postur e (1, 11) = 2.67, p = 0.13). As for the number of unintentional touches, the results indicated significance on both main factors and their interaction (F t abl e (1, 11) = 45.16, p < 0.01, F postur e (1, 11) = 14.13, p < 0.01, F t abl e\u00d7postur e (1, 11) = 29.54, p < 0.01). More unintentional touches were observed on the physical tabletop and in the sitting posture.\n\nThe posture factor was designed to incorporate a variety of different behavior patterns on the tabletop. We hence combine the data of the standing and sitting postures. In Figure  6 , the boxplot shows the 12 participants' average number of the intentional/unintentional touches on the digital/physical table respectively. We ran two paired t-tests to compare the number of intentional and unintentional touches between two tabletops. The results do not show significance of tabletop types on the number of intentional touches (t 11 = -0.73, p = 0.48), but revealed significance on unintentional touches (t 11 = -5.86, p < 0.01). Similar numbers of intentional touches were triggered on two tabletops, but more unintentional touch events appeared on the physical tabletop than the digital tabletop. In addition, we found an interesting case where two participants exhibited noteceably higher numbers of unintentional touches on the digital tabletop. From the video, the two participants made attempts to \"imitate\" operations on the physical table by placing their palm on the surface, according to their understanding of \"being natural\". This also reflects the difference in behavior patterns between the digital and physical settings."

Almost all users (11 out of 12) expressed that they would feel uncomfortable if they were asked to interact with the touch screen in the same way as the plain table. \"I never touch screens\u2026in the way on ordinary tables, otherwise, it will annoy me with a lot of unwanted triggers!\" (P1). \"It does sometimes make me tired, but compared to unwanted triggers, I'd rather be careful\" (P11). One of the two outliers said \"Although I tried to operate naturally on the digital screen, I cannot resist the temptation to raise my hands. It is an awkward experience\u2026\" (P7). We speculate this phenomenon is caused by different mental models towards digital and physical tables. Users are accustomed to use digital screens more cautiously. In order to avoid triggering unwanted touch events, they are willing to pay more attention to their actions."

To answer RQ2, we extracted features from user behavior data and trained a binary classifier. We blended the data of two tabletops, only focusing on whether the touches were intentional or not. The analysis of the behavior patterns (Table  1 ) provided insights for feature extraction, which shed light on the features that were useful for classification. Specifically, the difference between intentional and unintentional touches is summarized as follows:\n\n\u2022 The majority of the gaze is in line with intentional touches, but not with unintentional ones (Gaze/Face Distance) \u2022 A large number of unintentional touches are more static, ephemeral and closer to the edge compared to intentional ones (Side Distance) \u2022 Intentional touches usually involve one to three fingers while unintentional ones often appear in groups (Clustering) \u2022 Historical behavior affects current touches. E.g., sometimes gaze leads intentional touches shortly, the unintentional touches clustering area often spawn more unintentional touches subsequently (History)\n\nWe randomly split our dataset into an optimization set (30%) for feature analysis, and a traintest set (70%) for model training and testing. In Section 4.1, we introduce the features extracted from the gaze, face and touch data (as summarized in Table  2 ). We present an overview of these features through descriptive statistics, using data from the optimization set. Note that we purposefully only extract features that are compatible with real-time system implementations. Other features, e.g., the lifetime of a touch event, are not included in our analysis."

In comparison with unintentional touches, intentional touches have smaller gaze/face distance in both digital and physical conditions. Compared with Figure  7b , Figure  7a  has a more pronounced difference between intentional and unintentional touches. This indicates that the gaze point stays more in line with touches than the face point.\n\nFigure  8a  shows a heatmap of touch locations. Intentional touches are distributed in the center of the surface while the majority of unintentional touches are scattered near the bottom edge. Side distance is defined as the perpendicular distance of a touch point to the nearest screen edge. The near-margin property of unintentional touches on both tabletops is salient (Figure  8b )."

This may be explained by users' casualness: users would usually rest their hand or even their arm on the table, which triggered a wide contacting region. Owing to the hardware properties of the customized tabletop, the system recognized a large contacting region as a group of separate touch points rather than a continuous area. A dynamic distance matrix was created. Each row and column represents a touch point at the frame. Touch (a) Heatmaps of touches (b) Side Distance/cm distance, the mean of the element of the matrix, is the distance between two touch points. Number of adjacent touches of each touch point is defined as the count of other touches whose distance to this touch point is smaller than some particular threshold. Figure  9  suggests apparent clustering of unintentional touches on both tabletops: most intentional touches have zero or one adjacent touch point, while the majority of unintentional touches have at least three adjacent touch points. Several distance thresholds were tested (Figure  9  only shows two examples).\n\nCompared to a 10 cm threshold (see Figure  9a ) and other values, the threshold of 20 cm appeared to have the strongest splitting power between intentional and unintentional touches (see Figure  9b ). Hence, the clustered threshold is set to 20 cm, which is approximately the width of a stretched palm."

Moreover, we observe the phenomenon of clustering not only on the spatial dimension but also on the temporal dimension: if a location is clustered with a group of touches, a new touch will be more likely to appear within or near the clustering area shortly afterward, especially when users are unaware of the touches. Hence a historical time window may carry useful information. 700 ms is selected as the width of the window according to  [19] , counted backward from the down time of a touch event. Historical gaze/face distance represents the distance between the current touch point and previous gaze/face points in the window. Historical touch distance and historical number of adjacent touches can be similarly obtained based on the distance between the current touch point and previous ones. Figure  10  shows the historical gaze/face distance. It is similar to Figure  7  but with a higher degree of separation. We categorized all features into four different groups based on their characteristics (see Table  2 ). Some features appear more than once because they belong to different types simultaneously.

The first three models are typical approaches to classification problems. Both Random Forest and Gradient Boosting employ decision trees as weak classifiers. They are suitable for feature selection  [7] . MLP also proves to be a suitable model for complex problems where the relative importance of features is unknown  [12] . Every person's behavioral pattern has consistency, thus merging all users' data for training will lead to information leaks, which makes the classification naive and impractical. Therefore, we trained models using the leave-one-user-out method, where the models were trained on the data of 11 participants and tested on the remaining one. This can better measure the model's generalizability. The tuning of the hyperparameters of each model was conducted within the leave-one-user-out set using an inner five-fold cross-validation loop. After the best parameters were chosen, the ignored user's data was used for testing. Final metrics (precision, recall and F1 score) were the average of 12 models (same as the number of participants).

The features of a stylus's input in  [52]  can be very different from a finger's input. [52]  considers palm as the major source of unintentional touches, while in our case other parts of the hand and the arm were also a source.

We enhanced our findings through a feature ablation study to investigate the effect of gaze and face features, i.e., removing certain feature types and observing the performance decrease of the model.\n\nThe removal of the gaze features, including any features that involved gaze information, both in Gaze and History feature types, led to a significant drop in the model performance. This emphasized the importance of gaze-based features, which is a reflection of previous research concluding that people tend to look at the place where they have interest  [17, 74] . Our results further reveal its positive effect in classification and show that Gaze is a strong clue that conveys human intention. These findings are consistent with previous studies on human gaze-attention correlation  [17, 20, 25, 59] . The intuition of \"where we look is where we have interests, therefore where we touch\" is validated again by our study in the context of tabletop interaction.\n\nSurprisingly, compared to Gaze, the removal of Face did not cause much decrease in the performance. Compared to the model with gaze features ablated, the model with all gaze and face features removed just decreased by 0.009 on the F1 score. These results suggest that Face may not be an appropriate alternative for Gaze. This indicates that there will be a significant drop in classification performance by substituting gaze tracking with a lower-cost head tracking. This may be explained by the lack of head-gaze consistency during the interaction on the large-scale surface.\n\nTo further understand the consistency, we investigated the included angle between the face ray and gaze ray during the experiment. Figure  11  shows the heatmaps of the average included angle between the two rays throughout the Study 1. The angle is calculated frame by frame and takes the face point as the position of the  value. Two heatmaps of the sitting and standing postures share similar patterns. Users' gaze direction has a greater deviation from their face direction in the main working area. The figure of standing posture has a wider red region than that of sitting because of the larger movement space for the upper limbs during the standing posture. The heatmaps indicate that when people are focusing on tasks within their reaching range, they may have more gaze movement rather than head movement. The gaze direction greatly deviates from the normal direction of the face -users do not always stare strictly forward, but often move their eyes around, especially when they are operating on the surface close to them."

The reasons may lie in the fact that some features that hide deep beneath the data are not extracted effectively, or even some patterns that can not be captured by the current feature set.\n\nThe comparison between the GB model with human annotation can reveal some information that is not observable from the data. The videotape allowed the authors to obtain the context information of operations with two additional dimensions, both historical and future, either task-specific or person-specific. These two dimensions can further provide insights into the misclassification issue. For instance, \"The participant just found the start place on the map. So in the next step, he needed to find the destination, so he was searching at that time. \" (Author 1, historical and task-specific). \"Several seconds after this touch, he switched his attention to another place far from the current position. Then he got excited since he found the target, which was quite different from his current state. \" (Author 2, future and user-specific). These messages cannot be reflected in the data from the tabletop or eye tracker because both future and task-specific information are missing. This indicates the limitation of just leveraging gaze and touch information. The task information and emotional state (e.g., getting excited) can be two promising candidate features that worth further exploration to achieve better classification performance."

As found in Study 1, this posture condition provoked users to trigger more accidental touches. Similar to Study 1, the tasks consisted of map navigation and photo categorization. In each session of Study 2, participants needed to finish a long map navigation task and a long photo categorization task with a balanced order. The operations in two tasks were the same as Study 1. A 5-minute warm-up stage was scheduled before each session for users to get familiar with the system. Both tasks were designed to take approximately 15 minutes and a 2-minute break was inserted between the two tasks. Participants needed to perform each task in the sitting posture for a long time, henceforth their arms would easily be affected by fatigue, which could make them more \"willing\" to rest their arms on the surface. These modifications could provide more \"opportunities\" for users to evaluate the performance of this new system and have a better sense to compare the systems in the two sessions.\n\nWe manipulated users' expectations of the tabletop in Study 2.

Participants were told that the tabletop was expected to be intelligent so that it could recognize and filter any unintentional touches. However, the system was not yet perfect. They were asked to perform either carefully or casually as long as they were comfortable with the system, and report any touches they deemed \"wrong\" during the experiment, which can reflect users' subjective evaluation on system's performance in practice. The word \"wrong\" is used to describe those touches that ideally should have been removed (false positive) or should have appeared (false negative), but are noticed by users. Specifically, in the with session, the \"wrong\" touches represent those misclassified touches observed by participants (either intentional touches are classified as unintentional ones or vice versa). In the without session, the \"wrong\" touches mean the accidental touches that trigger responses in the system and are noticed by users. Whenever participants found anything wrong, they needed to speak up to the instructor immediately.\n\nAt the end of each session, users rated the system with a questionnaire.

These gesture-related or task-related misclassified touches do not change the procedure of the on-going operation, and thus are difficult to be noticed by users.

Our findings suggest that those features share similarities between tabletops and mobile devices. For example, unintentional touches are more prone to cluster together (Clustering  [2, 52] ). They appear more often near the edge of the device, in spite of the size of the touch screen (Side  [32] ). The distribution of the unintentional touch duration has a long tail  [32, 36] . These similarities suggest the potential to transfer our method to mobile devices. Technology . Our tabletop used capacitive sensing technology to register touch events. However, the features used in our model are actually independent of the sensing technique. Features in Table  2  only require positional and temporal information of touch events. E.g., Gaze distance can be calculated once the positions of both touch points and gaze points are obtained, History can be calculated once the timestamps of touch points are recorded. As long as a system's technology can provide accurate information, it will be compatible with our model. Therefore, our system has the potential to be generalized to tabletops with other technologies such as FTIR  [15] , diffused illumination  [50] , etc. However, we point out that some technical issues related to the sensing accuracy of the positional and temporal information are beyond the scope of our paper, e.g., the noise effect of environment lightness on FTIR/DI desktops."

The major differences between multi-user and single-user scenarios lie in two aspects  [35] : 1) users can have close collaboration, where their touch points are mixed together. 2) users can have human-human interaction, where their attention is drawn away from the surface. These greatly increase the complexity of the system. For the first aspect, there are some works trying to distinguish users when multiple users are interacting with a tabletop (e.g.,  [10] ).

For example, users \"have to\" put the palms on the surface to support their body while reaching out to distant targets, or they \"have to\" rest their arms because of fatigue.\n\nThe mental model essentially works only on the inevitable touches but not those unconscious touches, since the model works only when users are conscious of their touches, either explicitly or implicitly, as reflected in our Study 2. However, designers and developers should be careful about unconscious touches. If they are not filtered, it will have a more significant effect on user experience than the unfiltered inevitable touches, since users do not expect any responses from these unconscious touches."

      "title": "6.3. Limitations and Future Work",
      "text": "First, in this research, we explore user touch behavior in only two tasks: map navigation and photo categorization. Although these tasks are common on multitouch tabletops, there is other unintentional touch behavior we did not investigate which may appear in other interactive scenarios such as drawing sketches. Task-specific patterns may also affect the filtering, which will make the classification more complicated. Studies on more tasks will be involved in future work. Our technique leverages the coordination between touch and gaze. There are some cases where touch input is less guided by visual attention, such as blind typing. The technique might also conflict with other interaction paradigms such as remote object manipulation or peripheral-vision-based interaction  [47] , as summarized in Section 2.3. In these tasks, the benefit of our method is diminished. In addition, although with a limited number of users we found a consistent result (see the 2nd and 4th box in  Fig 6) , 12 people is a relatively small number for a two-factor within-subject design. The manually labeling of intentional and unintentional touches can introduce potential bias. In the future, the number of participants needs to be increased to incorporate more diverse behavior patterns across different users. Better palm-rejection models  [52]  and more sophisticated deep learning (e.g., LSTM) methods are worth exploring.\n\nSecond, due to the hardware properties of the tabletop, the screen does not have the ability to measure the contact area and pressure level of any touch events  [10, 32, 52, 70] . Although the touch area is partially reflected by the Clustering features, the lack of these features limits the performance of our system. For example, the accuracy of our system is not as good as previous work on tablets which leveraged contact size features (91.3% vs. 97.6% [52] ). Regardless of the different interaction paradigms on tablets  [52]  and tabletops, it reflects how the contact size feature can improve recognition. Meanwhile, touch pressure can also reflect interaction intention to some extent  [61] . These pieces of literature indicate the potential of enhancing our model by including these features. There are some commercial multi-touch tabletops that can provide contact images (e.g., Microsoft Pix-elSense  [38] ) or pressure distribution (in the foreseeable future) with fairly high resolution, which needs further exploration. However, nowadays there are a great number of tabletops that cannot provide area or pressure information, our feature sets can be applied for those tables to support intention recognition.\n\nThird, to obtain accurate head orientation and gaze direction, a head-mounted eye tracker is still necessary, which hinders the direct implementation of our model into an ordinary digital surface. This reduces the system's viability and scalability. Some previous researches have worked on head/gaze direction estimation directly from a camera  [41, 48] . It is enticing to obviate the necessity of additional devices. Our work provides an example of improving user understanding by leveraging other aspects of user behavior  [66, 67, 73] . More behaviors beyond gaze and face are worth exploration in the future."

      "title": "7. CONCLUSION",
      "text": "In this paper, we investigated the face-gaze-touch coordination patterns of touches on large-scale multi-touch tabletops. In the first user study, we collected empirical behavioral data from 12 participants' performing usual daily tasks on both digital and physical tabletops. Inspection of the data indicates a significant difference between the two types of tabletop: users tend to be more careful and prudent when interacting with the digital tabletop than the physical table. We then extracted five types of spatio-temporal features to classify real-time unintentional touches. A Gradient Boosting model was trained on the data and achieved 0.914, 0.913 and 0.913 on precision, recall and F1 score respectively. It significantly outperformed the start-of-the-art model by 4.3% on the F1 score. The model reveals the importance of gaze features for unintentional touch recognition. Our second user study evaluated our model in a real-time system. The results validated the advantage of our system over baselines. Participants' positive subjective feedback indicates the effectiveness of our algorithm. provide a user friendly experience by reducing the cognitive barrier preventing users from interacting naturally with the table. This work sheds light on the possibility of future tabletop technology to improve the understanding of users' input intention by linking their gaze and head behavior to their touch behavior."
