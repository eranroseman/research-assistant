      "text": "We obtained information about laboratory orders and results for all Medicare fee-for-service beneficiaries in 10 eastern states who had outpatient laboratory tests conducted by a large national laboratory services vendor in 2011. Using a combination of direct identifiers and patient demographic characteristics, we linked patients in these laboratory data to Medicare beneficiaries, enabling us to associate test results with existing claims.\n\nResults: Nearly all patients in the laboratory data were able to be linked to Medicare beneficiaries. There were over 2 million distinct beneficiaries with nearly 125 million specific test results in the laboratory data. For specific tests ordered in an outpatient or office setting in these 10 states, between 5% and 15% of them had linked laboratory data. Medicare beneficiaries initiating angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors or angiotensin II receptor blockers who had laboratory results data had similar patient characteristics to those without results data.\n\nConclusions: This novel linkage of laboratory results data to Medicare claims creates unprecedented opportunities for conducting comparative effectiveness research related to patient safety and quality.\n\nKey Words: clinical laboratory services, medical record linkage, Medicare (Med Care 2015;53: 974-979)\n\nU se of administrative claims data enables comparative effectiveness research with greater external validity than many randomized trials and most single-site nonrandomized studies.  1, 2 However, the broad coverage of claims data is offset by the lack of clinical detail. Diagnosis codes reported in claims submitted for reimbursement rarely allow for accurate assessment of the severity of a patient's condition. Having the results of diagnostic and laboratory testing available for research could enable finer risk stratification, more clinically nuanced outcomes assessment, and even a more detailed understanding of the treatment options truly available or contraindicated for a patient.\n\nAdministrative claims often record payment for laboratory procedures through Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, but the laboratory test results are rarely available in claims.  3 Medicare is the single largest purchaser of laboratory testing in the United States, with expenditures for laboratory services increasing from $3.9 billion in 2000  4  to $9.7 billion in 2012 (representing 1.7% of total Medicare spending).  5 Test results associated with Medicare laboratory claims have historically not been available to researchers. Integrated delivery systems with longstanding electronic health records, such as Kaiser Permanente or the Veterans Administration, have been using laboratory results for many years for quality improvement (eg, performance assessment)  6  and research.  7, 8 Linkage of laboratory test results to Medicare claims would enable such assessments in a broad Medicare population.\n\nIn this paper, we describe the laboratory data recently purchased from a large national laboratory services vendor and the process used to link those data to Medicare beneficiaries. We summarize the results of this linkage and discuss the limitations and potential uses of these data."

      "text": "The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) purchased 2011 laboratory data for all Medicare feefor-service beneficiaries who lived in 10 states in the eastern United States-Alabama, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Virginia-from a large national laboratory services vendor. These states were chosen in consultation with the laboratory vendor, because it had the largest market share in these states. The laboratory data consist of order, test, result, and note files, as described in Table  1 , for tests performed in outpatient settings and processed by the vendor. Of most interest to researchers are the data in the result and associated notes files that describe the result values obtained from the tests ordered, the reference ranges for each result, and an indicator of whether the result was abnormal. These data included the Medicare Health Insurance Claim (HIC) number and/or Social Security number (SSN) for each patient, which we used for linking to Medicare data."

      "text": "Medicare research-identifiable claim files and the associated beneficiary summary file for 2011 were obtained from CMS for beneficiaries enrolled in fee-for-service Medicare living in the 10 states listed above. Claims for laboratory services can be found in both the outpatient file and the carrier file. The outpatient file contains institutional claims from facilities for the services they provide. The carrier file contains claims from noninstitutional professional providers, including physicians, nurse practitioners, and independent clinical laboratories, among others. We determined which beneficiaries had any laboratory claims by looking for claims having Berenson-Eggers Type of Service (BETOS) codes in the range T1B through T1H, which reflect laboratory testing services. The beneficiary summary file includes Medicare beneficiary identifiers, demographic characteristics, information about Medicare eligibility and enrollment, death dates, and summary measures of comorbid conditions maintained by the Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse.  9, 10 ll Medicare research-identifiable files use an encrypted beneficiary identifier instead of HICs or SSNs to cross-reference beneficiaries across different data files. CMS maintains a crosswalk file between SSNs, Medicare HICs, and these encrypted beneficiary identifiers. This file was used in the linkage process described below.\n\nBecause of the sensitive nature of both data sources, all work was performed within the CMS Virtual Research Data Center (VRDC), a computing environment that is compliant with the Federal Information Security Management Act and is accessed remotely through a secure virtual private network. The laboratory data were shipped directly to the CMS contractor that administers the VRDC. The institutional review board of the Duke University Health System approved the study, and the data use agreements with both CMS and the laboratory vendor permitted this linkage."

Records were declared to be linked if there was agreement on any of the following sets of variables:\n\n(1) HIC or SSN+date of birth+sex.\n\n(2) HIC or SSN+date of birth (but not sex).\n\n(3) HIC or SSN+2 of 3 components (day, month, year) of date of birth+sex. Note that matching HIC or SSN between data sources was a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for linkage.\n\nIf a patient in the laboratory data was linked to the correct Medicare beneficiary, we would expect to see 1 or more laboratory claims in the Medicare data on all the dates for which they had laboratory testing recorded in the laboratory data. Therefore, in an effort to validate the resulting linkages, we created a list of distinct laboratory testing dates from the laboratory data and a list of distinct laboratory claims dates from the Medicare data for each linked patient. We then calculated the proportion of all laboratory testing dates that coincided with laboratory claim dates overall."

      "title": "Generalizability of Patients in the Linked Data",
      "text": "An important factor to consider when using these linked data is the generalizability of patients with laboratory data to the larger population of patients. Because of the heterogeneity of the population with laboratory data-having different tests for different clinical reasons-it is not necessarily meaningful to compare this population as a whole to all other patients who have Medicare data. This comparison should occur on a project-by-project basis among a welldefined cohort of patients.\n\nTo demonstrate generalizability, we used a population of patients identified for another study that explored the We compared the patients with laboratory results data to the rest of the patients in this population on demographic characteristics (age, sex, race) and selected comorbid conditions (Alzheimer disease, related disorders, or senile dementia; heart failure; chronic kidney disease; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and bronchiectasis; depression; diabetes; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; ischemic heart disease; osteoporosis; rheumatoid arthritis/osteoarthritis; stroke). Demographic characteristics were identified from the Medicare Beneficiary Summary File. Comorbid conditions were taken from the Chronic Conditions Data Warehouse summary variables derived from claims-based algorithms of diagnosis and procedure codes over a prior 1-, 2-, or 3-year period, depending on the condition.  10 We summarized these patient characteristics using means with SDs for continuous variables and frequencies with percentages for categorical variables. We also calculated standardized differences on each variable between the 2 groups.  12 This metric measures the distance between 2 groups for any variable independent of sample size. A standardized difference of over 10% is typically considered a substantial difference."

      "title": "RESULTS",
      "text": "Overall, we were able to link 98.6% of the 6 million patients in the laboratory data to beneficiaries in the Medicare data. These linked patients represented 2.4 million distinct Medicare beneficiaries (Table  2 ). This link rate was consistent across the 10 states (Table  2 ). Among the patients who linked, 97.2% matched on HIC or SSN, date of birth, and sex; 0.6% matched on HIC or SSN and date of birth, but not sex; and the remaining matched on HIC or SSN, sex, and 2 of the 3 components of date of birth. Most patients in the laboratory data who did not link had incomplete information for both HIC and SSN.\n\nThere were 5,487,715 distinct patient testing dates in the laboratory data, of which 5,474,537 (99.8%) coincided with laboratory claim dates for the same patients, indicating that the linkage was matching up the correct records in both data sets. This rate was consistent regardless of which set of variables the patient matched on.\n\nFor the 2.4 million linked beneficiaries, the laboratory data contained information on >17 million tests and 123 million different specific results. Among the result values, over 111 million reported numeric results and 12 million reported text-based results. Over 15% of all results were indicated to be abnormal or outside the expected range of values. The 25 most common tests ordered, and the specific results generated by those tests, are shown in Table  3 . These 25 tests accounted for over 70% of all tests ordered and about half of all results generated. Once patients were linked to Medicare beneficiary identifiers, we created a laboratory results table that could be used as a data set alongside the Medicare claims. This table included the Medicare beneficiary identifier, the test date, the result name and LOINC  11  code, the result value and units, and the result's reference range.\n\nTable  4  summarizes the completeness of the laboratory data, with respect to Medicare claims, for some common results. As an example, based on outpatient and carrier laboratory claims, there were nearly 25 million tests across the 10-state study area that should have generated a result for blood urea nitrogen. The linked laboratory data included 2.8 million (11.1%) of these results. The completeness of blood urea nitrogen results varied by state, from a low of 2.6% in New York to 27.3% in Delaware. The overall completeness of other results shown varied from 4.5% for prothrombin time to over 15% for C-reactive protein. For results that appear on the same panels with one of the specific results listed (Table  3 ), completeness is similar to that for the specific result shown in Table  4 .\n\nTo assess the comparability of patients in the linked data set, we examined a population of 66,859 Medicare beneficiaries who initiated an ACE inhibitor or ARB in the last half of 2011 and had an outpatient baseline serum creatinine test. Of these, 9034 (13.5%) had a corresponding serum creatinine result in the linked laboratory data. Beneficiaries for whom we had result data were somewhat more likely to be older and substantially less likely to be black than the 57,825 beneficiaries without result data (Table  5 ). The distribution of sex was similar in both groups, as were most of the comorbid conditions. Ischemic heart disease was the condition most disparate between the groups, yet its prevalence was still close, with 50.0% in the linked group of beneficiaries having this diagnosis compared with 44.6% in the unlinked group."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "Linking Medicare claims for fee-for-service beneficiaries from 10 states in 2011 with outpatient laboratory results data from a large national laboratory services vendor was straightforward and nearly complete. For specific chemistries and other quantities, like hematocrit, we found that between 5% and 15% of tests completed in an outpatient or office setting had result values in the linked laboratory results data. Although this percentage is lower than might be desired, we showed, for a cohort of patients constructed to answer a specific clinical question, that beneficiaries with laboratory results data had a similar medical history to Medicare beneficiaries without laboratory results data. There may be additional value in obtaining laboratory results data from other large laboratory vendors to increase the completeness above the 5%-15% that was achieved with this single vendor's data. Across the Medicare program, the 10 largest national laboratory vendors process nearly two-thirds of all tests performed by independent laboratories.  13 hese linked data create the opportunity to conduct a number of cross-sectional safety, quality, and comparative effectiveness studies within the Medicare population that are not possible in the absence of linked laboratory results data. For example, laboratory results allow the identification of potentially contraindicated medication prescribing.  14 Laboratory results data have been shown to enhance risk adjustment for performance management among inpatient populations,  [15] [16] [17]  and it may also be useful for enhancing the assessment of disease severity beyond simple diagnosis codes in clinical research involving patient populations undergoing outpatient procedures. Finally, multiple years of laboratory results data for Medicare beneficiaries would enable longitudinal tracking of specific chemistry levels for ongoing therapeutic or safety assessment associated with medications.  18, 19 here are several considerations that must be acknowledged when using Medicare claims data in combination with these laboratory results data. The primary consideration is one of coverage, as only testing done by this vendor's independent laboratories is reported. In the 10 states we studied, many Medicare beneficiaries with claims for laboratory services had no data in the laboratory results file from this single vendor. Even among beneficiaries with some results data in these laboratory files, a complete record of results associated with their laboratory claims is unlikely, because testing is often performed at multiple facilities, not all of which are affiliated with a single vendor. This issue was also identified by researchers who examined a different multistate HIC database linked with data from 2 large laboratory vendors.  20 One would likely need to obtain comparable laboratory results data from multiple other large national laboratory vendors to create a data set where most reimbursed laboratory tests had matching laboratory results. In contrast, many providers have contractual relationships with a limited number of laboratory vendors, and patients typically have usual sources of care, so it is possible that a limited set of patients have the vast majority of their laboratory work done by a single vendor.\n\nAnother practical challenge with using these data is that the laboratory results present in the vendor data represent tests performed for a variety of indications in the context of clinical care. This differs from study-based visits for standardized testing during randomized trials that occur at predetermined, fixed intervals for all study patients. If a research question requires the use of laboratory values to help define eligibility for an exposure, for example, there may or may not be a test result in the data coincident with the index date. In addition, inpatient and outpatient institutional laboratory tests (ie, those associated with a hospital-owned laboratory facility) are not represented in these data, which limits the types of questions that are appropriate for these data. Clinical questions involving laboratory results associated with a hospitalized patient population may not be feasible given the limits of these data.\n\nDespite these limitations, this linkage of laboratory data to Medicare claims makes some detailed clinical data available and creates numerous opportunities for conducting comparative effectiveness research related to patient safety and quality."
