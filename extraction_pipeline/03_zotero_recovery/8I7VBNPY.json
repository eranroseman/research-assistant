  "abstract": "In families composed of parents and children, the health of parents and children is often interrelated: the health of children can have an impact on the health of parents, and vice versa. However, the design of health tracking technologies typically focuses on individual self-tracking and self-management, not yet addressing family health in a unified way. To examine opportunities for family-centered health informatics, we interviewed 14 typically healthy families, interviewed 10 families with a child with a chronic condition, and conducted three participatory design sessions with children aged 7 to 11. Although we identified similarities between family-centered tracking and personal self-tracking, we also found families want to: (1) identify ripple effects between family members; (2) consider both caregivers and children as trackers to support distributing the burdens of tracking across family members; and (3) identify and pursue health guidelines that consider the state of their family (e.g., specific health guidelines for families that include a child with a chronic condition). We contribute to expanding the design lens from self-tracking to family-centered health tracking.",

      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "Self-management and self-tracking helps people understand their health, maintain wellbeing, manage a chronic condition, or engage in sense-making to change habits and improve overall health  [59] . However, it is still widely regarded as an individual practice. Self-tracking tools tend to be designed primarily for individuals, with the notable exception of commonly-included features for comparison, competition, and social sharing  [10, 19, 39, 41, 48, 49, 63] .\n\nAlthough health tracking at an individual level is important, many aspects of health or health-related behaviors affect and are affected by other people. Prior research has examined how to support diverse forms of health-related collaboration. Examples include patient-provider interaction  [7, 31] , adolescents living with a chronic condition as they transition to adults  [30, 56, 69] , adult caregivers tracking information about a child (e.g., development  [36] , diabetes management  [70] ), and caregivers supporting adult family members with chronic conditions (e.g., cognitive impairments  [57] , depression  [73] , Parkinson's  [51] ).\n\nIn families, the health of parents and children can be interconnected  [16] . Some health conditions are commonly experienced by both parents and children (e.g., ADHD  [13] , diabetes  [46] , poor sleep quality  [77] ). In many situations, the act of caregiving takes a toll on the health of informal caregivers  [4, 55] . These interconnected health issues occur in families with a child living with a chronic condition, as well as in typically healthy families. Previous work on families has supported improving eating habits  [61, 66] , increasing exercise through family-focused exergames  [64] , and improving family awareness and health goals through online family portals and social networks  [8, 37] . Our work expands family-centered design by examining how models of self-tracking can be expanded and applied to the family context, where family members are tracking together to improve the health of a family member or the entire family.\n\nTo inform the design of family-centered health technologies, we examined how family members living together manage their health. For the purpose of this study, we define family as: \"two or more people related biologically, legally, or emotionally who have lived together long enough to have patterns of interaction as well as stories that justify and explain these patterns\"  [47] . We focused on families composed of parents and children living together because we were interested in age and development-related issues that may arise, but future work should also include other types of families (e.g., couples living together).\n\nOur study aimed to answer the following research questions:\n\n\u2022 How do families with children, either with or without a chronic condition, manage their health together? \u2022 What are common barriers that families encounter in managing their health together, and how might technology design help families overcome those barriers?\n\nTo answer these questions, we interviewed 24 families with young children living at home. Of these families, 14 were typically healthy (TH) families and 10 had at least one child living with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA). Our primary focus in the interviews was sleep. We chose sleep because it is one of the health issues that most impacts families  [14]  and both TH and JIA families experience poor sleep  [77] . Therefore, sleep allowed us to compare and contrast families with a child with chronic condition versus families more focused on general health and wellness. Our interviews primarily took place at the family's home, with all family members living in the household present. Our goal was to elicit how family members support each other or work together toward health and wellness. We also supplemented interviews with three participatory design sessions with a cohort of children aged 7 to 11. We wanted to ensure children's perspectives on health, tracking, and family, without the interference or pressure of parents.\n\nDuring our interviews, all participants connected sleep with overall health including mental health, physical activity, and diet. To triangulate insights from the interviews, our participatory design sessions with children covered both sleep and overall health and tracking. Our contributions identify themes in family health informatics that go beyond sleep:\n\n\u2022 TH and JIA families want to identify ripple effects between family members. \u2022 JIA families prioritize and collaborate toward the wellbeing of the child with JIA, while TH families try to balance the health of every family member. \u2022 TH and JIA families want both caregivers and children to be able to collect data, in support of distributing the burden of tracking across family members. \u2022 Children have a nuanced understanding of health, tracking, and technology and have privacy concerns. \u2022 TH and JIA families want health guidelines based on families in a similar state (e.g., guidelines for families that include a child with a chronic condition, or guidelines for families with similar demographics).\n\nIn examining the needs, opportunities, and challenges that families experience around managing their health, we find that the current dominant paradigms of self-management and self-tracking are insufficient to guide the design of technologies to support maximizing health across the family. Our contributions inform the design of health tracking technologies that expand the design lens from a single person towards a family-centered approach.\n\nIn the remainder of this paper, we offer background on JIA and present related work. We then give an overview of our qualitative study, our participants, and our analysis. Finally, we present our results and discuss their implications for designing family-centered health tracking technologies."

      "text": "Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis (JIA) is a chronic inflammatory disease, with no known cause and poorly understood underlying mechanisms  [60] . An estimated 20% of children with JIA experience lifelong pain and chronic disability  [24] .\n\nWith early diagnosis and treatment, many children can live long lives. Symptoms vary, but children experience joint swelling, stiffness, tenderness and pain, limited range of motion, and poor sleep quality  [77] . Children experience unpredictable episodes of active disease including joint inflammation, tenderness, and pain  [54] ."

      "title": "Designing for Caregivers",
      "text": "More than 34 million people in the US are unpaid caregivers who care for a relative  [3] . Research in HCI and CSCW has examined a caregiver's role from the perspective of the care they provide  [4, 67]  and the impact of caregiving on a caregiver's wellbeing  [42, 73] . Related work on caregiving covers a range of topics, such as supporting parents with premature babies  [27, 42] , the role of caregivers in managing the online accounts of older adults  [57, 70] , and designing technologies that support caregivers in providing better care for a person living with a chronic condition (e.g., cancer  [32] , Parkinson's disease  [51] , or autism  [35] ). Much of the related work has focused on settings where the family member with a chronic condition is increasingly transitioning toward dependence on the caregiver, such as with aging or a progressive condition. Work on children, however, often involves a transition toward independence  [30, 56, 69] . An implication of this body of work is that health management designs need to consider the care recipient as well as the caregiver. We build on this thread of research by identifying opportunities and challenges to support both caregivers and children in collaboratively tracking."

      "title": "Designing for Families",
      "text": "Designing for families spans a variety of topics. Prior work investigated the crucial role that calendars play in family coordination  [52, 53] , how parents coordinate to complete errands  [68] , improving a sense of connection  [2, 74] , and development of systems that learn routines to improve pick up and drop offs of children at afterschool activities  [15] .\n\nResearch has also examined how parents and children manage the use of personal digital devices  [28]  and the tensions around sharing of personal information. In the case of location tracking, even though people might be motivated by good intentions, having access to geographical location traces can cause tension in family relationships  [44, 72] .\n\nExamining the relationship between caregivers and children around monitoring a child's health, Toscos et al. present design suggestions for technology that enhances teenager self-care, considers caregivers, but avoids parent-child conflict around a child's ability to self-care according to parental expectations  [71] . Our work expands this body of work by examining opportunities to balance caregivers tracking themselves, caregivers tracking children, and children self-tracking towards family monitoring of health."

      "title": "Designing for Health Tracking",
      "text": "Increasing rates of chronic illness and interest in preventive health have led to an increased focus on home care  [22] . In home care, it is often important for people to track behaviors, outcomes, and context to monitor and adjust their behavior, a process known as personal informatics  [40] . Several models describe this process  [6, 20, 40, 62] . Each describes the activities of tracking, integrating data, reflecting, and then acting on insights gained. Many products now support these activities for a variety of health and wellness concerns, including sleep, posture, physical activity, mood, and nutrition. The more recent lived informatics model describes the important role of deciding to track and selecting tracking tools, while also noting that people often lapse, sometimes abandon, and sometimes resume tracking  [20] .\n\nThese models describe the activities involved in tracking for health, but do not describe who will take on the roles. Instead, health tracking is primarily treated as an individual activity, hence the term \"self-tracking\". Some literature discusses social uses (e.g.,  [10, 19, 48, 49, 63] ), collaboration between patients and providers (e.g.,  [7, 43] ), or surveillance, particularly of older adults (e.g.,  [57] ). As noted above, however, care and health activities are often collaborative and interdependent, especially among cohabitating family members. New research is needed to guide designers in creating tools to help families collaboratively track and act to manage their health."

      "text": "Prior research in health collaboration examines collaboration in the hospital among clinicians  [1, 65] , between clinicians and adult patients  [7, 43, 45, 58] , or between behavioral specialists monitoring various behaviors of children with different neurodevelopmental needs during school  [35] .\n\nIn the home setting, caregivers and care receivers work together to manage the health of care receivers  [51, 57, 70, 80] . For example, sharing a child's glucose levels between parents and children can improve diabetes management  [71] . Diet is heavily shaped by family, motivating work by Grimes et al.  [25]  to explore opportunities to support family diet and by Schaefbauer et al.  [66]  in SnackBuddy, a mobile application to help caregivers and children monitor their snacks. For physical activity, Saksono et al.  [64]  examined encouraging physical activity by creating exergames that focused on families. Last, Colineau  [8, 9]  and Kimani  [37]  thought to support family wellbeing through online family portals and social networks. In these systems, family members review and reflect on family health goals and engage in these goals together. The results of this work show that health monitoring does not have to be an individual endeavor, that engaging the entire family can create family awareness on a particular health topic, and that technology can facilitate this group effort.\n\nResearch in personal informatics provides models describing describe the process of self-tracking  [6, 20, 40, 62] . However, less work has examined applying these models in the family setting: where the same person can self-track and also track on behalf of another family member. Our work examines these models that describe the process and stages of self-tracking when applied into a focus on family tracking. Applying models of self-tracking to families will help researchers and designers understand how to account for the stages of tracking within family dynamics, accounting for multiple trackers with different family roles, expertise, and abilities working together toward family health goals. We examine these models with two types of families: typically healthy and families with a child with a chronic condition."

The first was through a previous study on family sleep, which compared sleep between typically healthy families and families with a child with JIA  [77] . We contacted families from both cohorts that consented to be contacted for future studies. The second participant source was through the University of Washington Communication Studies Participant Pool, which is a roster of people who have opted in to being contacted to participate in research studies. Our inclusion criteria from this list was to recruit families that registered as typically healthy. We defined typically healthy as families that do not have family members diagnosed with a chronic condition (e.g., cancer), or a neurodevelopmental condition (e.g., autism).\n\nWe interviewed 24 families that fit our criteria, 14 TH families and 10 JIA families. All children older than five were assented and had parental consent according to our university's IRB protocol. In all interviews, parental caregivers were present with their children. Of the 24 families, five identified as divorced, re-married, or single (TH=2, JIA=3). In one of the four divorced families, both parents participated in the interview (JIA=1). All families that consented to participate are heteronormative, though this was not criteria for inclusion. Table  1  summarizes participant demographics.\n\nWe interviewed all family members living in the same household together. Interviews lasted between 40 minutes and 100 minutes, focused on how families address sleep. Whenever possible, we interviewed families at their home, because we wanted them to be comfortable, in a location where they spend time together, and a location where they take part in activities related to health (e.g., diet, sleep). Of 24 interviews, 17 took place at the home of the family. Of 7 families we interviewed outside of the home, 3 were at the hospital after a medical appointment (JIA=3), 3 at a coffee shop (TH=2, JIA=1), and 1 at a school (TH=1)."

Our interview protocol had four parts, with only the first different between the two cohorts. In the first part of the interview we asked TH families about their health monitoring and priorities. For JIA families, we additionally asked how they manage their child's condition, how they monitor it, and how they address the challenges they face. We made sure to get answers from every family member. We also gave time for family members to build on each other's answers, allowing us to learn about their collaborative practices. Last, we also gave children coloring pens and paper to give them an additional means to express their thoughts.\n\nTo focus on sleep, the second part of the interview consisted of presenting data collection tools that are commercially available or have been published at CHI or CSCW that focus on issues related to sleep. Our goal was to elicit conversations about current tracking practices as a family and to identify opportunities. Our range of tools included pen and paper checklists, diet journals  [12] , self-report-based sleep journaling  [5] , and sensor-based sleep systems such as Fitbit 1 , Jawbone 2 , and Lullaby  [34] .\n\nThe third and fourth parts elicited conversations about data representation, sharing preferences, and privacy concerns.\n\nThe third part consisted of family members sketching how\n\n1  www.fitbit.com  2  www.jawbone.com Family Family Member Age Gender Marital Status Occupation TH1 Father 31-40 Male Married Construction Management Mother 31-40 Female Stay at Home Mom 2 Children 7, 5 TH2 Father 31-40 Male Married Banker Mother 31-40 Female Clinic Coordinator 2 Children 8, 5 TH3 Mother 41-50 Female Married Nurse Practitioner Father 51-60 Male Marine Maintenance 3 Children 11, 7, 7 TH4 Father 41-50 Male Married Research Scientist Mother 41-50 Female Clinical social worker 2 Children 12, 9 TH5 Mother 31-40 Female Married Physical Therapist Assistant Father 51-60 Male Nurse 2 Children 12, 9 TH6 Father 41-50 Male Married Marketing Consultant Mother 41-50 Female Physical Therapist 2 Children 15, 12 TH7 Father 41-50 Male Married IT Manager Mother 31-40 Female Current Stay at Home 2 Children 8, 5 TH8 Mother 41-50 Female Married Government (Civil Service) 2 Children 11, 8 TH9 Mother 31-40 Female Married Manufacturer Sales Father 41-50 Male Business Owner 2 Children 10, 7 TH10 Stepfather 41-50 Male Re-Married Finance Mother 41-50 Female N/A 2 Children 14, 12 TH11 Mother 41-50 Female Married Program Coordinator Father 51-60 Male Dentist / Professor Child 16 TH12 Mother 51-60 Female Married 2nd Grade Teacher Father 51-60 Male School Administrator Child 14 TH13 Mother 51-60 Female Co-Habitating Nutrition Services Manager Child 13 TH14 Mother 31-40 Female Divorced Marketing Child 13 (a) Typically Healthy Families Family Family Member Age Gender Marital Status Occupation JIA1 Mother 31-40 Female Married Instructional Coach Father 31-40 Male Heavy Equipment Operator 4 Children 10, 9, 6, 4 JIA2 Father 41-50 Male Married Aircraft Mechanic Mother 41-50 Female Stay at Home Mom 3 Children 18, 16, 8 JIA3 Mother 41-50 Female Married Health Assistant 1 Child 17 JIA4 Mother 41-50 Female Divorced IT Consultant 1 Child 18 JIA5 Mother 31-40 Female Married Nurse 2 Children 7, 5 JIA6 Mother 41-50 Female Divorced Nurse Father 41-50 Male Electrical Engineer 1 Child 5 JIA7 Father 41-50 Male Married IT Consultant Mother 41-50 Female IT Consultant 2 Children 20, 17 JIA8 Father 31-40 Male Single Sales Child 13 JIA9 Mother 31-40 Female Married Massage Therapist 2 Children 14, 12 JIA10 Mother 41-50 Female Married Stay at Home Mom 3 Children 18, 16, 14 (b) Families Including a Child with Juvenile Idiopathic Arthritis Child Age Gender PD1 9 Female PD2 7 Female PD3 7 Male PD4 9 Female PD5 7 Female PD6 9 Male PD7 11 Female PD8 11 Female PD9 11 Female (c) Participatory Design Participants Table  1 : Overview of study participants.

For each session, we began with a \"Question of the Day\" and presented the children with specific design and informant activities to understand their conceptions of health technologies. In Session 1, we used the \"Big Paper\" technique  [26]  to have children collaborate together to draw out what they considered healthy and unhealthy habits about themselves and about their parents. In Session 2, we implemented the \"Line Judging\" technique  [78] , where children voted on health technologies as really like, really dislike, and not sure. The room was divided into three spaces representing the three possible responses. Children voted on each technology by standing in the space in the room that corresponded to one of the three responses and gave a reason for their vote. We presented the children with 20 different health technologies for children and also the sleep tracking tools presented in the second part of the family interviews. Finally, to further explore sleep and associated technologies, Session 3 had children create \"Bags of Stuff\" low-fidelity prototypes  [17]  of their ideas for sleep technologies.

Parents of children with chronic conditions struggle to attend to their self-care and are concerned other children are unintentionally a lower priority (e.g., siblings of the child with JIA).\n\nTH families do not need organize themselves as much around the care of a particular family member. With respect to wellness and health, TH families tend to be less structured. TH parents make efforts to self-care (e.g., diet, exercise, sleep) and strive to balance self-care between work and family responsibilities. TH parents describe how they try to do healthy activities together with their children, and our PD sessions with children revealed the same theme. However, children in the PD sessions expressed a nuanced view on what they consider to be healthy activity they do with their family:"

If it's a fever, change in appetite, or mood.\n\nThe primary caregiver becomes the most involved in caregiving, monitoring, tracking, mediating treatment, and facilitating information to the team of healthcare providers.\n\nIn two-parent families, the second parent, or an older sibling, takes on an assisting role, which we call the secondary caregiver. The secondary caregiver assists when needed, such as maintaining regular intake of medication and facilitating information management when the primary caregiver needs support. JIA7 (secondary caregiver, father): I don't go along to every appointment \u2026 I go when \u2026 we go through the whole situation. The reason why, it's so much information \u2026 I'm just kind of sitting here, the backup, and remind her [primary caregiver] of everything I know has been said or questions that we discussed.\n\nTH families organize themselves similarly: one parent is the primary caregiver, and another caregiver, such as the second parent, is secondary. However, the intensity of these roles is lower because children do not require as much care.\n\nThese collaborative caregiving roles are based on practical reasons: having one family member be the main point of contact, maintaining records, and facilitating information coordination with healthcare providers. Existing designs support a primary caregiver tracking to manage their children's health. However, designing for just the primary caregiver makes it difficult for secondary caregivers to track or have access to the data collected to support the care of children. Consequently, only the primary caregiver can track, which can lead to tracking fatigue and sometimes leave this caregiver overwhelmed. Our work identified primary and secondary caregivers working together to care, monitor, and track the health of their children.\n\nViewing tracking and monitoring as a collaborative practice means personal informatics artifacts need to provide opportunities for other family members to be equally informed and better support the primary caregiver. Kimani et al. found that mothers and daughters tended to use a family-focused online social network for health at higher rates compared to their male family members, but stated that there is an opportunity to increase engagement of male family members  [38] . Our results indicate that supporting primary and secondary caregivers will also support balancing family-health responsibility regardless of gender."

      "title": "DISCUSSION OF FAMILY INFORMATICS",
      "text": "Our results illustrate needs, challenges, and opportunities that present themselves when designing for families to monitor and act on their health. Designs that work for families, not just individuals, are necessary because:  (1)  there is often a relationship between the health of parents and children  [16, 47, 77] , and (2) children, especially younger children, cannot always track for themselves and therefore depend on adult caregivers to do second-hand tracking.\n\nPrior research has developed models of self-tracking to inform the design of personal informatics tools  [19, 40, 62] . These models identify stages, challenges, and barriers in the process of self-tracking. Li et al.'s five-stage model characterizes personal informatics as an iterative process with five stages: preparation, collection, integration, reflection, and action. Each stage presents barriers, and failures cascade into later stages  [40] . Epstein et al.'s lived informatics model expands upon this with additional stages: deciding, selecting, lapsing, and resuming tracking  [20] . This section uses these models to discuss design challenges and opportunities for families. Families can include several types of trackers (i.e., self-trackers and second-hand trackers), with varying needs and responsibilities (e.g., due to differences such as age and family role), working together towards common goals (e.g., overall family health, helping managing a family member's chronic condition).\n\nDeciding: This first stage is when a person decides they want to track. Epstein et al. describe self-tracker motivations to include: behavior-change, instrumentation (e.g., tracking without a particular goal), and curiosity  [20] . Family tracking often requires multiple people deciding to track, and our interviews reveal differences in family motivation for this decision. TH families were motivated by a sense of curiosity, because they want to verify that the health of family members is as well as perceived, or because they wanted to change a particular behavior. On the other hand, the decision to track by JIA families is based in improving the wellbeing of the child with JIA. JIA families have a strong motivation to collect and track with the intent to use gathered data to improve diagnosis and treatment. For example, caregivers are asked to track medication, reaction to medication, amount of sleep, and diet. However, as caregiving takes a toll on caregivers in JIA families, tracking technologies need to support not only monitoring the child with JIA but the wellbeing of the rest of the family. Differences in how families come to tracking suggest designing for these different needs and expectations."
    },
    {
      "title": "Selecting and Preparation:",
      "text": "In these stages, a person decides how they will track, including selecting what tools to use. Families face all of the same barriers as individuals, such as struggling to identify tools that will collect the data supporting insights they seek  [20, 40] . Families also face additional barriers. In the case of young children, families need to determine if both adults and children can use the same tool. If not, they may need to determine if there is a similar tool designed for young children. Families collaborating with medical providers need tools that can track the information requested by providers and support appropriate sharing with those providers. There are also additional barriers and burdens in purchasing and maintaining multiple tracking devices, especially if a child version is more expensive due to a focus on child safety. These complex requirements for selection are currently poorly supported.\n\nCollection: Families collect, capture, or record desired data using their selected artifacts. There will be generally be multiple family members tracking, either manually or using tools that automatically collect data. Prior work in individual tracking identifies collection barriers that include a lack of time, lack of motivation, not remembering to regularly collect, and difficulties with subjective estimation  [40] . These barriers also apply in the family setting and may occur at greater scale considering the different cognitive abilities and knowledge of every family member.\n\nBalancing collection of data from a family perspective will need to consider how shifts in motivation will change over time. For example, when a child with JIA is experiencing a flare, the entire family is focused on helping the child overcome that flare. Just as the competing commitments and health goals of other family members can be de-prioritized in this situation, tracking may also be de-prioritized. Tracking tools for families may benefit from improved approaches to automating tracking in times and contexts when tracking will be a lower priority.\n\nIn previous work, leveraging shared experiences within a family can lower the barriers to tracking diet  [25, 66]  and physical activity  [64]  as well as reflecting on health goals  [8] . Designing for families can lower barriers to tracking by leveraging shared experiences and having family members track on behalf of each other. With respect to sleep, family members can track the perceived mood of other family members, environmental factors (e.g., noise), and daily events (e.g., stress) that could be affecting their own sleep as well as the sleep of other family members.\n\nWe have also seen that family informatics presents additional challenges surrounding self-tracking vs. second-hand tracking (e.g., a parent tracking on behalf of child). Current designs generally do not support a single person simultaneously self-tracking and second-hand tracking (e.g., a parent tracking their own sleep as well as the sleep of their children). The lack of multi-directional tracking makes it difficult to support health goals at a family level. The matter of who does the tracking also surfaces several additional challenges and opportunities. Tools that limit tracking to a primary caregiver both: (1) force the primary caregiver to bear the entire responsibility of tracking, and (2) present barriers to secondary caregivers utilizing tracked information (e.g., in collaborations with health providers). As children mature, they will also want to take primary responsibility for self-tracking. These challenges in coordinating and transitioning tracking are not well supported in current tools.\n\nIntegration: Integration entails preparing and transforming data for analysis and reflection. Our interviews found that visualization techniques that are effective with data streams of an individual can quickly become overwhelming when multiplied by the complexity of a family. Additional challenges can also result from different approaches to tracking by different members of a family. For example, a secondary caregiver might collect data at a courser granularity or less frequently compared to the primary caregiver. Therefore, family health informatics systems will have to address the challenge of aligning or otherwise reconciling data from different sources.\n\nReflection: Reflection needs to be supported at the individual and family level. Toward this, designers need to consider when and how members of a family access data. This includes taking into account the type of family member that is reflecting when presenting insights and visualizations of collected data. In the case of children, the design of reflection needs to consider the devices they use and their cognitive ability to self-reflect.\n\nSupporting reflection at the level of the family surfaces another set of challenges. Our interviews revealed families wanted guidelines and comparisons appropriate for the nature of their family (e.g., accounting for age and chronic conditions). Families also want systems to help account for the different needs and goals of each family member, and to help in identifying positive and negative ripple effects among family members. Addressing such needs requires integrating data across family members. But families are complex and faced with many competing commitments, so designs need to be mindful of potential tensions and negative implications of tracking.\n\nAction: Action can occur after collection, integration, and reflection  [40] , or it can be intertwined with these stages of tracking  [20] . In addition to the challenges that individuals face in identifying what action to take and succeeding in that action, families face additional challenges presented by coordination and collaboration among family members. For example, if improving the sleep of a family member (e.g., an adult with sleep apnea) means that a child also needs to go to sleep earlier, then the family needs to reassess evening routines of both parent and child. Our interviews also found families were better able to maintain healthy practices if all family members were engaged. Appropriate action in a family informatics perspective therefore requires examining potential actions for every family member that account for sustainability and appropriateness."

      "title": "Lapsing and Resuming:",
      "text": "Lapsing is an inherent element of tracking  [20] . It can include forgetting (e.g., not remembering to journal a meal), failures in upkeep (e.g., not charging a sleep sensor), skipping (e.g., choosing not to journal a meal), and suspending (e.g., deciding not to track while on vacation). Lapses sometimes cascade into to abandonment, or people can decide they have obtained the value desired from tracking and explicitly choose to no longer track. These same activities occur in family informatics, although with additional coordination and collaboration. For example, the additional challenges of family tracking may make lapses more likely. A decision to resume tracking after a lapse may require collaboration among family members to restructure priorities to support a return to tracking. A decision to discontinue tracking entirely may be difficult depending on whether family members agree they have identified an actionable plan or otherwise gained desired knowledge.\n\nAt a more fundamental level, our results reveal that a family can continue tracking even when one or more individuals lapse. The roles of tracking are not statically assigned to a single family member (e.g., one family member could be collecting data, a second could be integrating, and reflection could occur as a family). This also corresponds to family members taking on different roles in managing family health (e.g., primary caregiver, secondary caregiver, self-manager). Although tracking together is poorly supported in current tools, we believe it is an important insight gained from the family informatics perspective. Sharing the burdens of tracking will not come without costs, as we have noted tools can present integration barriers and may create coordination overhead within families. Future designs should account for fluidity in family health when considering the stages of personal informatics in the context of family-centered design."

      "title": "LIMITATIONS AND CONCLUSIONS",
      "text": "Personal informatics research has primarily focused on individual self-tracking and self-management, with much less investigation of how groups such as families collaborate in monitoring and managing their health together. Our research has examined practices, needs, and opportunities in families supporting and collaborating to manage family health.\n\nWe interviewed two cohorts of families: typically healthy families and families that include a child with a chronic condition. To help ensure an understanding of children's perspectives, we additionally conducted PD sessions with typically healthy children. We believe our results generalize well beyond the families studied in this work, and we have used prior models of personal informatics to help foreground more general insights into family informatics. Nevertheless, our studies still present some limitations. First, all families we interviewed included heteronormative parents, although this was not an inclusion criterion. Second, we were not able to interview caregivers other than parents, although these can play a crucial role in caregiving. Last, we did not explore other types of families, such as couples living together. Future work should further explore family informatics in additional family arrangements.\n\nOur research examined models of personal informatics in the context of families tracking for health. We found similarities, additional challenges to account for, and opportunities that could lower barriers to family tracking. Family informatics technologies need to account for the case where a single person is simultaneously acting as a self-tracker and a second-hand tracker, need to account the different needs of family members (e.g., differences in the amount of sleep for adults versus children), and should take advantage of shared goals and contexts to support family members in tracking on behalf of each other. Expanding models of personal informatics to family-centered informatics provides designers and researchers with guidance in considering self-tracking and second-hand tracking in the context of family-centered health. Whether supporting a family working toward their collective health, or a family working to manage one member's health concerns, there are many opportunities for tools to better support coordination."
