  "abstract": "In mobile health (mHealth) smart devices deliver behavioral treatments repeatedly over time to a user with the goal of helping the user adopt and maintain healthy behaviors. Reinforcement learning appears ideal for learning how to optimally make these sequential treatment decisions. However, significant challenges must be overcome before reinforcement learning can be effectively deployed in a mobile healthcare setting. In this work we are concerned with the following challenges: (1) individuals who are in the same context can exhibit differential response to treatments (2) only a limited amount of data is available for learning on any one individual, and (3) non-stationary responses to treatment. To address these challenges we generalize Thompson-Sampling bandit algorithms to develop Intel-lIgentPoolIng. IntellIgentPoolIng learns personalized treatment policies thus addressing challenge one. To address the second challenge, IntellIgentPoolIng updates each user's degree of personalization while making use of available data on other users to speed up learning. Lastly, IntellIgentPoolIng allows responsivity to vary as a function of a user's time since beginning treatment, thus addressing challenge three.",

      "title": "1. Introduction",
      "text": "Mobile health (mHealth) applications deliver treatments in users' everyday lives to support healthy behaviors. These mHealth applications offer an opportunity to impact health across a diverse range of domains from substance use  (Rabbi et al. 2017) , to disease self-management  (Hamine et al. 2015)  to physical inactivity  (Consolvo et al. 2008) . For example, to help users increase their physical activity, an mHealth application might send walking suggestions at the times and in the contexts (e.g. current location or recent physical activity) when a user is likely to be able to pursue the suggestions. A goal of mHealth applications is to provide treatments in contexts in which users need support while avoiding overtreatment. Over-treatment can lead to user disengagement  (Nahum-Shani et al. 2017) , for example users might ignore treatments or even delete the application. Consequently, the goal is to be able to learn an optimal policy for when and how to intervene for each user and context without over-treating.\n\nContextual bandit algorithms appear ideal for this task. Contextual bandit algorithms have been successful in a range of application settings from news recommendations  (Li et al. 2010)  to education  (Qi et al. 2018) . However, as we discuss below, many challenges remain to adapt contextual bandit algorithms for mHealth settings. Thompson sampling offers an attractive framework for addressing these challenges. In their seminal work  (Agrawal and Goyal 2013) ,  Agrawal and  Goyal show that Thompson sampling for contextual bandits, which works well in practice, can also achieve strong theoretical guarantees. In our work, we propose Thompson sampling contextual bandit algorithm which introduces a mixed effects structure for the weights on the feature vector, an algorithm we call Intel-lIgentPoolIng. We demonstrate empirically that IntellIgentPoolIng has many advantages. We also derive a high-probability regret bound for our approach which achieves similar regret to  (Agrawal and Goyal 2013) . Unlike  (Agrawal and Goyal 2013) , our regret bound depends on the variance components introduced by the mixed effects structure which is at the center of our approach."

      "text": "There are significant challenges to learning optimal policies in mHealth. This work primarily addresses the challenge of learning personalized user policies from limited data. Contextual bandit algorithms can be viewed as algorithms that use the user's context to adapt treatment. While this approach can have advantages compared to ignoring the user's context, it fails to address that users can respond differentially to treatments even when they appear to be in the same context. This occurs since sensors on smart devices are unlikely to record all aspects of a user's context that affect their health behaviors. For example, the context may not include social constraints on the user (e.g., care-giving responsibilities), which may influence the user's ability to be active. Thus, algorithms that can learn from the differential responsiveness to treatment are desirable. This motivates the need for an algorithm that not only incorporates contextual information, but that can also learn personalized policies. A natural first approach would be to use the algorithm separately for each user, but the algorithm is likely to learn very slowly if data on a user is sparse and/or noisy. However, typically in mHealth studies multiple users are using the application at any given time. Thus an algorithm that pools data over users intelligently so as to speed up learning of personalized policies is desirable."

Our main contributions are:\n\n\u2022 IntellIgentPoolIng: A Thompson sampling contextual bandit algorithm for rapid personalization in limited data settings. This algorithm employs classical random effects in the reward function  (Raudenbush and Bryk 2002; Laird and Ware 1982)  and empirical  (Bayes Morris 1983; Casella 1985)  to adaptively adjust the degree to which policies are personalized to each user. We present an analysis of this adaptivity in  Sect. 3.5  showing that IntellIgentPoolIng can learn to personalize to a user as a function of the observed variance in the treatment effect both between and within users. \u2022 A high probability regret bound for IntellIgentPoolIng.\n\n\u2022 An empirical evaluation of IntellIgentPoolIng in a simulation environment constructed from mHealth data. IntellIgentPoolIng not only achieves 26% lower regret than state-of-the-art approaches, it also is better able to adapt to the degree of heterogeneity present in a population than this approach. \u2022 Feasibility of IntellIgentPoolIng from a pilot study in a live clinical trial. We demonstrate that IntellIgentPoolIng can be executed in a real-time online environment and show preliminary evidence of this method's effectiveness. \u2022 We show how to modify IntellIgentPoolIng to learn in non-stationary environments.\n\nNext, in Sect. 2 we discuss relevant related work. In Sect. 3 we present IntellIgentPoolIng and provide a high-probability regret bound for this algorithm. We then describe how we use historical data to construct a simulation environment and evaluate our approach against state-of-the-art in Sect. 4. Next, in Sect. 5 we introduce the feasibility study and provide preliminary evidence into the benefits of this approach. We then discuss how to extend this work to include time-varying effects in Sect. 6. Finally, we discuss the limitations with our approach in Sect. 7 before concluding."

      "title": "2.1. Connections to Bandit algorithms in mHealth",
      "text": "Bandit algorithms in mHealth have typically used one of two approaches. The first approach is person specific, that is, an algorithm is deployed separately on each user, such as in  Rabbi et al. 2015; Jaimes et al. 2016; Forman et al. 2018 and Liao et al. 2020 . This approach makes sense when users are highly heterogeneous, that is, their optimal policies differ greatly one from another. However, this approach can present challenges for policy learning when data is scarce and/or noisy, as in our motivating example of encouraging activity in an mHealth study where only a few decision time-points occur each day (see  (Xia 2018)  for an empirical evaluation of the shortcomings of Thompson sampling for personalized contextual bandits in mHealth settings). The second approach completely pools users' data, that is one algorithm is used on all users so as to learn a common treatment policy both in bandit algorithms  (Paredes et al. 2014; Yom-Tov et al. 2017) , and in full reinforcement learning algorithms  (Clarke et al. 2017; Zhou et al. 2018 ). This second approach can potentially learn quickly but may result in poor performance if there is large heterogeneity between users. We compare to these two approaches empirically as they not only represent state-of-the-art in practice, they also represent two intuitive theoretical extremes.\n\nIn IntellIgentPoolIng we strike a balance between these two extremes, adjusting the degree of pooling to the degree that users are similarly responsive. When users are heterogeneous, IntellIgentPoolIng achieves lower regret than the second approach while learning more quickly than the first approach. When users are homogeneous our method performs as well as the second approach."

      "title": "2.2. Connections to multi-task learning and meta-learning",
      "text": "Following original work on non-pooled linear contextual bandits  (Agrawal and Goyal 2013) , researchers have proposed pooling data in a variety of ways. For example,  Deshmukh et al. (2017)  proposed pooling data from different arms of a single bandit problem. Li and Kar 2015 used context-sensitive clustering to produce aggregate reward estimates for the bandit algorithm. More relevant to this work is multi-task Gaussian Process (GP), e.g.,  Lawrence and Platt 2004; Bonilla et al. 2008 ; Wang and Khardon 2012, however these have been proposed in the prediction as opposed to the reinforcement learning setting. The Gang of Bandits approach  (Cesa-Bianchi et al. 2013) , which is a generalization from the original LinUCB algorithm for a single task  (Li et al. 2010) , has been shown to be successful when there is prior knowledge on the similarities between users. For example, a known social network graph might provide a mechanism for pooling. It was later extended to the Horde of Bandits in  (Vaswani et al. 2017 ) which used Thompson Sampling, allowing the algorithm to deal with a large number of tasks.\n\nEach of the multi-task approaches introduces some concept of similarity between users. The extent to which a given user's data contributes to another user's policy is some function of this similarity measure. This is fundamentally different from the approach taken in IntellIgentPoolIng. Rather than determining the extent to which any two users are similar, IntellIgentPoolIng determines the extent to which a given user's reward function parameters differ from parameters in a population (average over all users) reward function. This approach has the advantage of requiring fewer hyper-parameters, as we do not need to learn a similarity function between users. Instead of a pairwise similarity function it is as if we are learning a similarity between each user and the population average. In the limited data setting, we expect this simpler model to be advantageous.\n\nIn meta-learning, one exploits shared structure across tasks to improve performance on new tasks. IntellIgentPoolIng thus shares similarities with meta-learning for reinforcement learning  (Nagabandi et al. 2018; Finn et al. 2019; Finn et al. 2018; Zintgraf et al. 2019; Gupta et al. 2018; Saemundsson et al. 2018) . At a high level, one can view our method as a form of meta-learning where the population-level parameters are learned from all available data and each user's parameters represent deviations from the shared parameters. However, while meta-learning might require a large collection of source tasks, we demonstrate the efficacy of our approach on data on the small scale found in clinical mHealth studies."

      "title": "2.3. Connections to Gaussian process models for Thompson sampling contextual bandits",
      "text": "IntellIgentPoolIng is based on Bayesian mixed effects model of the reward, which is similar to using a Gaussian Process (GP) model with a simple form of the kernel. GP models have been used for multi-armed bandits  (Chowdhury and Gopalan 2017; Brochu et al. 2010; Srinivas et al. 2009; Desautels et al. 2014; Wang et al. 2016; Djolonga et al. 2013; Bogunovic et al. 2016)  , and for contextual bandits  (Li et al. 2010; Krause and Ong 2011) . However the above approaches do not structure the way in which the pooling of data across users occurs. IntellIgentPoolIng uses a mixed effects GP model to pool across users in structured manner. Although mixed effects GP models have been previously used for offline data analysis  (Shi et al. 2012; Luo et al. 2018) , to the best of our knowledge they have not been previously used in the online decision making setting considered in this work."

      "title": "2.4. Connection to non-stationary linear bandits",
      "text": "There is a growing literature investigating how to adapt linear bandit algorithms to changing environments. A common approach is for the learning algorithm to differentially weight data across time.\n\nDifferential weighting is used by both Russac et al. 2019 (using a LinUCB algorithm) and Kim and Tewari 2019 (using perturbation-based algorithms). Cheung et al. 2018 to estimate the parameters in the reward function and (Zhao et al. 2020) restart the algorithm at regular intervals discarding the prior data. Similarly (Bogunovic et al. 2016), using GP-based UCB algorithms, accommodate non-stationarity by both restarting and using an autoregressive model for the rewards function. Kim and Tewari 2020 analyze the non-stationary setting with randomized exploration. Wu et al. introduce a model which detects abrupt time changes cite ( https:// dl. acm. org/ doi/ pdf/ 10. 1145/ 32099  78. 32100 51 ).\n\nIntellIgentPoolIng allows for non-stationary reward functions by the use of time-varying random effects. The correlation between the time-varying random effects induces a weighted estimator whereby more weight is put on the recently collected samples, similar to the discounted estimators in  Russac et al. 2019 and Kim and Tewari 2019. In contrast to existing approaches, IntellIgentPoolIng considers both individual and time-specific variation."

      "title": "3.1. Overview",
      "text": "The central component of IntellIgentPoolIng is a Bayesian model for the reward function. In particular, IntellIgentPoolIng uses a Gaussian mixed effects linear model for the reward function. Mixed effects models are widely used across the health and behavioral sciences to model the variation in the linear model parameters across users  (Raudenbush and Bryk 2002; Laird and Ware 1982)  and within a user across time. Use of these models enhances the ability of domain scientists to inform and critique the model used in Intel-lIgentPoolIng. The properties and pitfalls of these models are well understood; see  (Qian et al. 2019)  for an application of a mixed effects model in mHealth. IntellIgentPoolIng uses Bayesian inference for the mixed effects model. As discussed in Sect. 2.3, a Bayesian mixed effects linear model is a GP model with a simple kernel. This facilitates increasing the flexibility of the model for the reward function, given sufficient data.\n\nFurthermore, IntellIgentPoolIng uses Thompson sampling  (Thompson 1933) , also known as posterior sampling  (Russo and Van Roy 2014) , to select actions. At each decision point, the parameters in the model for the reward function are sampled from their posterior distribution, thus inducing exploration over the action space  (Russo et al. 2018) . These sampled parameters are then used to form an estimated reward function and the action with the highest estimated reward is selected.\n\nThe hyper-parameters (e.g., the variance of the random effects) control the extent of pooling across users and across decision times. The right amount of pooling depends on the heterogeneity among users and the non-stationarity, which is often difficult to pre-specify. Unlike other bandit algorithms in which the hyper-parameters are set at the beginning  (Deshmukh et al. 2017; Cesa-Bianchi et al. 2013; Vaswani et al. 2017) , IntellIgentPool-Ing includes a procedure for updating the hyper-parameters online. In particular, empirical (Bayes Carlin and Louis 2010) is used to update the hyper-parameters in the online setting, as more data becomes available."

For each user, we use k \u2208 {1, 2, \u2026 } to index decision times, i.e., times at which a treatment could be provided. Denote by S i,k the states/contexts at the k th deci- sion time of user i. For simplicity, we focus on the case where the action is binary, i.e., A i,k \u2208 {0, 1} . The algorithm can be easily generalized to cases with more than two actions. After the action A i,k is chosen, the reward R i,k is observed. Throughout the remainder of the paper, S, A and R are random variables and we use lower-case (s, a and r) to refer to a realization of these random variables.\n\nBelow we consider a simpler setting where the parameters in the reward are assumed time-stationary. We discuss how to generalize the algorithm to the non-stationary setting in Sect. 6. The goal is to learn personalized treatment policies for each of the N users. We treat this as N contextual bandit problems as the reward function may differ between users. In mHealth settings this might occur due to the inability of sensors to record users' entire contexts. Section 3.3 reviews two approaches for using Thompson Sampling  (Agrawal and Goyal 2012)  and Sect. 3.4 presents IntellIgentPoolIng, our approach for learning the treatment policy for any specific user."

At each decision time k, we would like to select a treatment A i,k \u2208 {0, 1} based on the context S i,k . We model the reward R i,k by a Bayesian linear regression model: for user i and time k where (s, a) is a pre-specified mapping from a context s and treatment a (e.g., those described in Sect. 4.2), w i is a vector of weights which we will learn, and i,k \u223c (0, 2 ) is the error term. The weight vectors {w i } are assumed independent across users and to follow a common prior distribution w i \u223c ( w , w ) . See Fig.  1  for a graphical representation of this approach. Now at the k th decision time with the context S i,k = s , Person-sPecIfIc selects the treat- ment A i,k = 1 with probability where wi,k follows the posterior distribution of the parameters w i in the model (1) given the user's history up to the current decision time k.

Only the prior parameter values are shared, all else is updated independently where the common parameters, w , follows the prior distribution w \u223c ( w , w ) . See Fig.  2  for the graphical representation of this approach. We then use the posterior distribution of the weight vector w to sample treatments for each user.

IntellIgentPoolIng uses, at the update times, the empirical (Bayes Carlin and Louis 2010) approach to choose/update = ( u , 2 ) based on the currently available data.

      "text": "IntellIgentPoolIng uses random effects to adaptively pool users' data based on the degree to which users exhibit heterogeneous rewards. That is, the person-specific random effect should outweigh the population term if users are highly heterogeneous. If users are highly homogeneous, the person-specific random effect should be outweighed by the population term. The amount of pooling is controlled by the hyper-parameters, e.g., the variance components of the random effects.\n\nTo gain intuition, we consider a simple setting where the feature vector in the reward model (Eq. 1) is one-dimensional (i.e., p = 1 ) and there are only two users (i.e., i = 1, 2 ). Denote the prior distributions of population parameter w pop by (0, 2 w ) and the random effect u i by (0, 2 u ) .

      "text": "HeartstePsV1 was a 6-week micro-randomized trial of an Android-based physical activity intervention with 41 sedentary adults. The intervention consisted of two push interventions: planning and contextually-tailored activity suggestions. Activity suggestions acted as action cues and were designed to provide users with actionable options for engaging in short bouts of activity in their current situation. The content of the suggestions was tailored based on the users' location, weather, time of day, and day of the week. For each individual, on each day of the study, the HeartSteps system randomized whether or not to send an activity suggestion five times a day. The intended outcome of the suggestions-the proximal outcome used to evaluate their efficacy-was the step count in the 30 minutes following suggestion randomization.\n\nHeartstePsV1 data was used to construct all features within the environment, and to guide choices such as how often to update the feature values. Recall that S i,k and R i,k denote the context features and reward of user i at the k th decision time. The reward is the log step counts in the thirty minutes immediately following a decision time. In HeartstePsV1 three treatment actions were considered: A i,k = 1 corresponded to a smartphone notification containing an activity suggestion designed to take 3 minutes to perform, A i,k = 0 corresponded to a smartphone notification containing an anti-sedentary message designed to take approximately 30 seconds to perform and A i,k = -1 corresponded to not sending a message. However, in the simulation only the actions 1, 0 are considered.\n\nFigure  5  describes the simulation while Table  1  describes context features and rewards. Each context feature in Table  1  was constructed from HeartstePsV1 data. For example, we found that in HeartstePsV1 data splitting participants' prior 30 minute step count into the two categories of high or low best explained the reward. Additional details about this process are included in Appendix 4.\n\nThe temperature and location are updated throughout a simulated day according to probabilistic transition functions constructed from HeartstePsV1. The step counts for a simulated user are generated from participants in HeartstePsV1 as follows. We construct a one-hot feature vector containing the group-ID of a participant, the time of day, the day of the week, the temperature, the preceding activity level, and the location. Then for each possible realization of the one-hot encoding we calculate the empirical mean and empirical standard deviation of all step counts observed in HeartstePsV1. The corresponding empirical mean and empirical standard deviation from HeartstePsV1 form S i,k S i,k respectively. At each 30 minute window, if a treatment is not delivered step counts are generated according to  Heterogeneity This model, which we denote HeterogeneIty, allows us to compare the performance of the approaches under different levels of population heterogeneity. The step count after a decision time is a modification of Eq. 8 to reflect the interaction between context and treatment on the reward and heterogeneity in treatment effect. Let be a vector of coefficients of S i,k which weigh the relative contributions of the entries of S i,k that inter- act with treatment on the reward. The magnitude of the entries of are set using Heart-stePsV1.\n\nStep counts ( R i,k ) are generated as\n\nThe inclusion of Z i will allow us to evaluate the relative performance of each approach under different levels of population heterogeneity. Let l i be the entry in i corresponding to the location term for the i th user. We consider three scenarios (shown in Table  6 ) to generate Z i , the person-specific effect, and l i the location-dependent effect. The performance of each algorithm under each scenario will be analyzed in Sect. 4.3. In the smooth scenario, is equal to the standard deviation of the observed treatment effects [f (S i,k ) \u22a4  \u2236 S i,k \u2208 HEARTSTEPSV1] .

D.\n\nIn the bi-modal scenario each simulated user is assigned a base-activity level: low-activity users (group 1) or high-activity users (group 2). When a simulated user joins the trial they are placed into either group one or two with equal probability. Whether or not it is optimal to send a treatment (an activity suggestion) for user i at their k th decision time depends both on their context, and on the values of z 1 , l 1 and z 2 , l 2 . The values of z 1 , l 1 and z 2 , l 2 are set so that for all users in group 1, it is optimal to send a treatment under 75% of the contexts they will experience. Yet for all users in group 2, it is only optimal to send a treatment under 25% of the contexts they will experience. Group membership is not known to any of the algorithms\n\nTable 2.

      "text": "In this section, we compare the use of mixed effects model for the reward function in INTELLIGENTPOOLING to two standard methods used in mHealth, COMPLETE and PERSON -SPECIFIC from Sect. 3.3. Recall that IntellIgentPoolIng includes person-spe- cific random effects, as described in Eq. 14. In PERSON -SPECIFIC , all users are assumed to be different and there is no pooling of data and in COMPLETE , we treat all users the same and learn one set of parameters across the entire population.\n\nAdditionally, to assess IntellIgentPoolIng's ability to pool across users we compare our approach to Gang of Bandits  (Cesa-Bianchi et al. 2013 ), which we refer to as gan-goB. As this model requires a relational graph between users, we construct a graph using the generative model (  9 ) and Table  6  connecting users according to each of the three settings: homogeneous, bi-modal and smooth. For example, with knowledge of the generative model users can be connected to other users as a function of their Z i terms. As we will not have true access to the underlying generative model in a real-life setting we distort the true graph to reflect this incomplete knowledge. That is we add ties to dissimilar users at 50% of the strength of the ties between similar users.\n\nFrom the generative model (  9 ), the optimal action for user i at the k th decision time is\n\nwhere * i is the optimal for the ith user. In these simulations each trial has 32 users. Each user remains in the trial for 10 weeks and the entire length of the trial is 15 weeks, where the last cohort joins in week six. The number of users who join each week is a function of the recruitment rate observed in HEARTSTEPSV1 . In all settings we run 50 simulated trials.\n\nFirst, Fig.  6  provides the regret averaged across all users across 50 simulated trials where the reward distribution follows (9) for each of the Table  6  categories. The horizontal axis in Fig.  6  is the average regret over all users in their nth week in the trial, e.g. in their first week, their second week, etc. In the bi-modal setting there are two groups, where all users in group one have a positive response to treatment when experiencing their typical context, while the users in group two have a negative response to treatment under their typical context. An optimal policy would learn to not typically send treatments to users in the first group, and to typically send them to users in the second. To evaluate each algorithm's (11)\n\nability to learn this distinction we show the percentage of time each group received a message in Table  3 .\n\nThe relative performance of the approaches depends on the heterogeneity of the population. When the population is very homogenous comPlete excels, while its performance suffers as heterogeneity increases. Person-sPecIfIc is able to personalize; as shown by Table  3 , it can differentiate between individuals. However, it learns slowly and can only approach the performance of comPlete in the smooth setting of Table  6  where users differ the most in their response to treatment. Both IntellIgentPoolIng and gangoB are more adaptive than either comPlete or Person-sPecIfIc. gangoB consistently outperforms Person-sPe-cIfIc and achieves lower regret than comPlete in some settings. In the homeogenous setting we see that gangoB can utilize social information more effectively than Person-sPecIfIc does while in the smooth setting it can adapt to individual differences more effectively than comPlete. Yet, IntellIgentPoolIng demonstrates stronger and swifter adaptability than does gangoB, consistently achieving lower regret at quicker rates. Finally, the algorithms differ in their suitability for real-world applications, especially when data is limited. Table  3  The fraction of time that messages were sent to users in each group Recall at each decision time either an activity suggestion or anti-sedentary message is sent.

      "text": "The feasibility study of IntellIgentPoolIng involves 10 participants added to a larger 90-day clinical trial of HeartSteps v2, an mHealth physical activity intervention. The purpose of the larger clinical trial is to optimize the intervention for individuals with Stage 1 hypertension. Study participants with Stage 1 hypertension were recruited from Kaiser Permanente Washington in Seattle, Washington. The study was approved by the institutional review board of the Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute (under number 1257484-14). HeartSteps v2 is a cross-platform mHealth application that incorporates several intervention components, including weekly activity goals, feedback on goal progress, planning, motivational messages, prompts to interrupt sedentary behavior, and-most relevant to this paper-actionable, contextually-tailored suggestions for individuals to perform a short physical activity (suggesting, roughly, a 3 to 5 minute walk). In this study physical activity is tracked with a commercial wristband tracker, the Fitbit Versa smart watch.\n\nIn this version of the intervention, activity suggestions are randomized five times per day for each participant on each day of the 90-day trial. These decision times are specified by each user at the start of the study, and they roughly correspond to the participant's typical morning commute, lunch time, mid-afternoon, evening commute, and after dinner periods. The treatment options for activity suggestions are binary: at a decision time, the system can either send or not send a notification with an activity suggestion. When provided, the content of the suggestion is tailored to current sensor data (location, weather, time of day, and day of the week). Examples of these suggestions are provided in  Klasnja et al. 2018 . At a decision time, activity suggestions are randomized only if the system considers that the user is available for the intervention-i.e., that it is appropriate to intervene at that time (see Fig.  8  for criteria used to determine if it is appropriate to send an activity suggestion at a decision time). Subject to these availability criteria, IntellIgentPoolIng determines whether to send a suggestion at each decision time. The posterior distribution was updated once per day, prior to the beginning of each day. Figure  7  provides a schematic of the feasibility study.\n\nThe feasibility study included the second set of 10 participants in the trial of Heart-Steps v2, following the initial 10 enrolled participants. IntellIgentPoolIng (Algorithm 1) is deployed for each of the second set of 10 participants. At each decision time for these 10 participants, IntellIgentPoolIng uses all data up to that decision time (i.e. from the initial ten participants as well as from the subsequent ten participants). Thus the feasibility study allows us to assess performance of IntellIgentPoolIng after the beginning of a study instead of the performance at the beginning of the study (when there is little data) or the performance at the end of the study (when there is a large amount of data and the algorithm can be expected to perform well).\n\nIn the feasibility study, the features used in the reward model were selected to be predictive of the baseline reward and/or the treatment effect, based on the data analysis of Heart-stePsV1; see Sect. 6.2 in  (Liao et al. 2020)  for details. All features used in the reward model are shown in Table  4 . The feature engagement represents the extent to which a user engages with the mHealth application measured as a function of how many screen views are made within the application within a day. The feature dosage represents the extent to which a user has received treatments (activity suggestions). This feature increases and decreases depending on the number of activity suggestions recently received. The feature location refers to whether a user is at home or work (encoded as a 1) or somewhere else (encoded as a 0). The temperature feature value is set according to the temperature at a user's current location (based off of phone GPS). The variation feature value is set according to the variation in step count in the hour around that decision point over the prior seven-day period. As before we construct a feature vector , however here we only use select terms to estimate the treatment effect. Here, (12)"

E. The prior distribution was also constructed based on HeartstePsV1; see Sect. 6.3 in  (Liao et al. 2020 ) for more details. As this feasibility study only includes a small number of users, a simple model with only two person-specific random effects, each on the intercept term in S and S \u2032 (Eq. 12) was deployed.\n\nHere we discuss how much data we have to personalize the policy to each user. Recall the 10 users only receive interventions when they meet the availability criteria outlined in Fig.  8 , thus we find that in practice we have a limited number of decision points to learn a personalized policy from. In the case of perfect availability, we would have at most 450 decision points per person. However due to the criteria in Fig.  8 , the algorithm is used with only approximately 23% of each user's decision points. Pooling users' data allows us to learn more rapidly. On the day that the first pooled user joined the feasibility study there were 107 data points from the first set of 10 users.\n\nThe 10 users received an average number of .20 ( \u00b10.015 ) messages a day. The aver- age log step count in the 30-minute window after a suggestion was sent was 4.47, while it was 3.65 in the 30-minute windows after suggestions were not sent. Figure  9  shows the entire history of treatment selection probabilities for all of the users who received treatment according to IntellIgentPoolIng. We see that the treatment probabilities tended to be low, though they covered the whole range of possible values.\n\nWe would like to assess the ability of IntellIgentPoolIng to personalize and learn quickly. To do so we perform an analysis of the learning algorithms of IntellIgentPoolIng, comPlete and Person-sPecIfIc on batch data containing tuples of (S, A, R). Note that the actions in this batch data were selected by IntellIgentPoolIng, however, here we are not interested in the action selection components of each algorithm but instead on their ability to learn the posterior distribution of the weights on the feature vector.\n\nPersonalization By comparing how the decisions to treat under IntellIgentPoolIng differ from those under comPlete, we gather preliminary evidence concerning whether IntellIgentPoolIng personalizes to users. Figure  10  shows the posterior mean of the coefficient of the A i,k term in the estimation of the treatment effect, for all users in the feasibility study on the 90th day after the last user joined the study. We show this term not only for IntellIgentPoolIng but also for comPlete and Person-sPecIfIc. We see that for some users this coefficient is below zero while for others it is above. While the terms under IntellI-gentPoolIng differ from comPlete they do not vary as much as those learned by Person-sPecIfIc. Yet, crucially, the variance is much lower for these terms.\n\nFigure  11  displays the posterior mean of the coefficient of the A i,k term in the estimation of the treatment effect. This coefficient represents the overall effect of treatment on one of the users, User A. During the prior 7 days User A had not experienced much variation in activity at this time and the user's engagement is low. Note that the treatment appears to have a positive effect on a different user, User B, in this context whereas on User A there is little evidence of a positive effect. If comPlete had been used to determine treatment, User A might have been over-treated.\n\nSpeed of policy learning We consider the speed at which IntellIgentPoolIng diverges from the prior, relative to the speed of divergence for Person-sPecIfIc. Figure  12  provides the Euclidean distance between the learned posterior and prior parameter vectors (averaged across the data from the 10 users at each time). From Fig.  12  we see that Person-sPecIfIc Fig.  9  We see that IntellIgent-PoolIng covers the full range of treatment selection probabilities. The tendency seems to be to send with a lower rather than higher probability Fig.  10  Posterior mean and standard deviation of the coefficient of A i,k in Eq. 12 for all users in the feasibility study hardly varies over time in contrast to IntellIgentPoolIng and comPlete, which suggests that Person-sPecIfIc learns more slowly.\n\nIn conclusion IntellIgentPoolIng was found to be feasible in this study. In particular the algorithm was operationally stable within the computational environment of the study, produced decision probabilities in a timely manner, and did not adversely impact the functioning of the overall mHealth intervention application. Overall, IntellIgentPoolIng produced treatment selection probabilities which covered the full range of available probabilities, though treatments tended to be sent with a low probability."

Let w i,k be the highest number of weeks user i has completed at time k; X w encodes a user's current week in a trial,\n\nWe set w such that the longer a user has been in treatment, the less they respond to a treatment message. When a simulated user is at a decision time the user will receive a treatment message according to whichever RL policy is being run through the simulation.\n\nIn order to evaluate the effectiveness of our time-varying model we compare to Time-Varying Gaussian Process Thompson Sampling (tV-gP)  (Bogunovic et al. 2016) . This approach incorporates temporal information for non-stationary environments and was shown to be competitive to stationary models. To compare this method to IntellIgent-PoolIng we use a linear kernel for the spatial component. We then modify Eq. 6 to compute the posterior distribution by removing the random-effects and modifying the kernel (Eq. 5) to include the temporal terms introduced in  (Bogunovic et al. 2016) .\n\nFigure  13  provides the regret averaged across all users across 50 simulated trials where the reward distribution follows generative model DISENGAGEMENT .

Thus, Table  5  provides the average number\n\nof times a treatment is sent in the last week of the trial for both the first and last cohort.

Our Table 5 Average fraction of times treatment was sent (action=1), over 50 simulations (generative model HeterogeneIty with homogenous Z h setting) Cohort one week 10 Cohort six week 10 Complete 0.62 0.44 Person-specific 0.76 0.59 HordeOB-0.50 0.57 TV-GP 0.64 0.31 Intelligent-Pooling 0.30 0.06\n\ncurrent model instead determines the extent to which a given user deviates from the population and does not consider between-user similarities. A limitation with our current understanding of mHealth is that it is unclear what a good similarity measure would be. We leave the question of designing a data-efficient algorithm for learning such a measure as future work.\n\nA component of IntellIgentPoolIng is the use of empirical Bayes to update the model hyper-parameters. Here, we used an approximate procedure. However, with our model it is possible to produce exact updates in a streaming fashion and we are currently developing such an approach.\n\nIdeally, we would evaluate IntellIgentPoolIng against all other approaches in a clinical trial setting. However, here we only demonstrated the feasibility of our approach on a limited number of users and did not have the resources to similarly test the other approaches.\n\nTo overcome this limitation we constructed a realistic simulation environment so that we could evaluate on different populations without the costly investment of designing multiple arms of a real-life trial. While the simulated experiments and the feasibility study together demonstrate the practicality of our approach, in future work one might deploy all potential approaches in simultaneous live trials.\n\nFinally, IntellIgentPoolIng can incorporate a time-specific random effect to capture the phenomenon of responsivity changing over the course of a study. There is much to be improved with this model. For example, the first cohort in a study will not have prior cohorts to learn from, and the final cohort will have the greatest amount of data to benefit from. Other models might treat different cohorts with greater equality. Furthermore, this representation does not incorporate alternative temporal information, such as continually shifting weather patterns, where temperatures might change slowly and gradually alter one's desire to exercise outside."

      "text": "When data on individuals is limited a natural tension exists between personalizing (a choice which can introduce variance) and pooling (a choice which can introduce bias). In this work we have introduced a novel algorithm for personalized reinforcement learning, IntellIgentPoolIng that presents a principled mechanism for balancing this tension. We demonstrate the practicality of our approach in the setting of mHealth. In simulation we achieve improvements of 26% over a state-of-the-art-method, while in a live clinical trial we show that our approach shows promise of personalization on even a limited number of users. We view adaptive pooling as a first step in addressing the trade-offs between personalization and pooling. The question of how to quantify the benefits and risks for individual users is an open direction for future work. Specifically, we assume that the posterior distribution of all users is updated after every decision time and the hyper-parameters are fixed throughout the study. Vaswani et al. (2017)  also provided a regret bound for the Thompson Sampling Horde of Bandits algorithm where the data is pooled using a known, prespecified, social graph. Vaswani et al. (2017)  employ the conceptual framework of  Agrawal and Goyal (2012)  which uses the concept of saturated and unsaturated arms to bound the regret. They show that the regret for playing an arm from the unsaturated set (which includes the optimal arm) can be bounded by a factor of the standard deviation which decreases over time. Additionaly, they show that the probability of playing a saturated arm is small, so that an unsaturated arm will be played at each time with some constant probability. Vaswani et al. (2017)  follow this argument, but adapt their proof to include the prior covariance of the social graph in the bound of the variance. Our proof follows along similar lines with the primary difference being how the prior covariance of all parameters is formulated. Specifically, the prior variance in  Vaswani et al. (2017)  is constructed by the Laplacian matrix of the social graph, whereas ours is constructed based on the Bayesian mixed effects model (4). As a result, while in  Vaswani et al. (2017)  the regret bound is stated in terms of properties of the social graph, our bound depends on properties of our mixed effects model (i.e., the covariance matrix of the random effects).\n\nRecall that w is the prior covariance of the weight vector w pop , u is the covariance of the random effect u i and 2 is the variance of the error term. We assume that both w pop and u i have the same dimensions and that u is invertible. Additionally, for simplicity of presentation we assume that the largest eigenvalue in w is at most d and the largest eigenvalue of u is at most dN.\n\nRecall that Theorem 1 bounds the regret of IntellIgentPoolIng at time T by: with probability 1 -."

Specifically, for a given time t, we retrieve the user index encountered at time t by i(t) and retrieve this user's decision time index by k(t). IntellIgentPoolIng selects an action A i(t),k(t) \u2208 A for time t \u2208 [1, \u2026 , T] . We denote the selected action at time t by A t .\n\nIn this setting, we combine each user specific variable into a global shared variable. Recall that a feature vector (A i,k , S i,k ) encodes contextual variables for the action and state of user i at their k th decision time. For simplicity, we denote by A t the action A i(t),k(t) at time t and denote the vector (A i(t),k(t) , S i(t),k(t) ) at time t by A t ,t . Additionally, we let a,t refer to (a, S i(t),k(t) ) for any a \u2208 A . We introduce a sparse vector A t ,t \u2208 \u211d dN , which contains A t ,t vector among N d-dimensional vectors, the rest of which are zeros .\n\nIn proving the regret we consider the equivalent way of selecting the action. Instead of randomizing the action by the probability, here to select an action we assume the algorithm draws a sample wt = wi(t),k(t) and then selects the action A t = A i(t),k(t) = argmax a\u2208A  T a,t wt that maximizes the sampled reward. Analogously to a,t , we define \u0302 t and \u0303 t as the sparse vec- tors which contain \u0175i(t),k(t) and wi(t),k(t) respectively as the i(t)-th vector among Nd-dimen- sional vector, the rest of which are zeros.\n\nWe concatenate the person-specific parameters w i into \u2208 \u211d dN .

We prove that with high probability both \u22a4 a,t \u0302 t and \u22a4 a,t \u0303 t are con- centrated around their respective means. The standard deviation around the reward at decision time t for action a is thus s a,t = \u221a \u22a4 a,t  -1 t-1 a,t . We proceed as in  Agrawal and Goyal (2012) ,  Vaswani et al.

We then provide the procedures for generating state variables (features) in the simulation. Finally, we discuss how we used HeartstePsV1 to arrive at the feature representations used in the simulation.\n\nSimulation dynamics Within the simulation states are updated every thirty minutes. Each thirty minutes is associated with a date-time, thus we can acquire the month from the current time which is useful in updating the temperature. The decision times are set roughly two hours apart from 9:00 to 19:00.\n\nAvailability In the real-study users are not always available to receive treatment for a suite of reasons. For example, they may be driving a vehicle or they might have recently received treatment. Thus, at each decision time we update the context feature Available i \u223c Bernoulli(.8) . for the i th user where Available i is drawn from a Bernoulli. This condition reduces the distance between the settings in the environment and those in a realworld study. At each decision time interventions are only sent to users who are available; i.e. user i cannot receive an intervention when Available i = 0.\n\nRecruitment We follow the recruitment rate observed in HEARTSTEPSV1 . For example, if 20% of the total number of participants were recruited in the third week of HEARTSTEPSV1 we recruit 20% of the total number of participants who will be recruited in the third week of the simulation. To explore the effect of running the study for varying lengths we scale the recruitment rates. For example, if the true study ran for 8 weeks, and we want to run a simulation for three weeks, we proportionally scale the recruitment in each of the three weeks so that the relative recruitment in each week remains the same. In these experiments we would like to recruit the entire population within 6 weeks. Thus about 10% of participants are recruited each week, except for the second week of the study where about 30% of all participants are recruited. This reflects the recruitment rates seen in the study, which were more of less consistent throughout besides one increase in the second week.\n\nWe generate states from historical data. Given relevant context we search historical data for states which match this given context. This subset of matching states can be used to generate new states. We discuss this in more detail in Sect. C.1. Then, we describe in more detail how we generate temperature, location and step counts."

For example, if we would like a probability distribution over discretized temperature IDs under a given context, we would search over the historical data for all temperature IDs present under this context. This set of context-specific temperature IDs can then be used to form a distribution to simulate a new ID. This process of querying historical data is used throughout the simulation and is outlined in Algorithm 2. For example, it is used in generating new step counts, new locations and new temperatures.\n\nAs the simulation environment simulates draws stochastically from a variety of probability distributions, it is possible it draws a state which was not present in the historical dataset. In this case there is a process for finding a matching state. Similarly we might have a state in the historical dataset with insufficient samples to form an informative (not overlynoisy) distribution. In this case we also find a surrogate state with which to generate future step counts. The idea of the process is to find the closest state to the current state, such that this close state has sufficient data to generate a good distribution. Again, given a state, we want to be able to generate a step count from a distribution with sufficient data to inform its parameters. The pseudocode for how we do so is shown in Algorithm 3\n\nThis algorithm takes as input a target state, s * . We also have a dictionary(hasmap) formed from the historical dataset. The keys to this dictionary are the states which existed in the dataset. A value is an array of step counts for this state. This procedure gives the closest state with the most data points to our current state. To be more explicit about lines 8-11. A state is a vector of some length, for example [1, 0, 1]. When we consider all subsets of size 2, we are considering the subsets [1, 0],[1, 1], and [0, 1].

Recall, that if a user is available the final step count is generated according to Eq. 25. This equation requires sufficient statistics from HeartstePsV1.

We repeat the process for different partitions of the day.\n\nTime of day To discover the representation for time of day which best explained the observed step counts, we considered all sequential partitions from length 2-8. We found that early-day, late-day, and night best explained the data.\n\nDay of the week To discover the representation for day of the week which best explained the observed step counts, we considered two partitions: every day, or weekday/ weekend. We found weekday/weekend to be a better fit to the data.\n\nTemperature Here we choose different percentiles to partition the data. We consider between 2 and 5 partitions  (percentiles at 50, to 20,40,60,80 ). Here we found two partitions to best fit the step counts.
