  "abstract": "Background Experts recommend that treatment for substance use disorder (SUD) be integrated into primary care. The Digital Therapeutics for Opioids and Other SUD (DIGITS) Trial tests strategies for implementing reSET \u00ae and reSET-O \u00ae , which are prescription digital therapeutics for SUD and opioid use disorder, respectively, that include the community reinforcement approach, contingency management, and fluency training to reinforce concept mastery. This purpose of this trial is to test whether two implementation strategies improve implementation success (Aim 1) and achieve better population-level cost effectiveness (Aim 2) over a standard implementation approach. \n Methods/Design The DIGITS Trial is a hybrid type III cluster-randomized trial. It examines outcomes of implementation strategies, rather than studying clinical outcomes of a digital therapeutic. It includes 22 primary care clinics from a healthcare system in Washington State and patients with unhealthy substance use who visit clinics during an active implementation period (up to one year). Primary care clinics implemented reSET and reSET-O using a multifaceted implementation strategy previously used by clinical leaders to roll-out smartphone apps (\"standard implementation\" including discrete strategies such as clinician training, electronic health record tools). Clinics were randomized as 21 sites in a 2x2 factorial design to receive up to two added implementation strategies: (1) practice facilitation, and/or (2) health coaching. Outcome data are derived from electronic health records and logs of digital therapeutic usage. Aim 1's primary outcomes include reach of the digital therapeutics to patients and fidelity of patients' use of the digital therapeutics to clinical recommendations. Substance use and engagement in SUD care are additional outcomes. In Aim 2, population-level cost effectiveness analysis will inform the economic benefit of the implementation strategies compared to standard implementation. Implementation is monitored using formative evaluation, and sustainment will be studied for up to one year using qualitative and quantitative research methods.",

      "text": "Substance use disorders (SUD) are prevalent, undertreated, and costly to society  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] . Approximately 265 people a day died from drug overdose in the United States in 2021  [6] . However, just 8-14% of people with past-year SUD receive treatment  [1, 2] . Most individuals with SUD prefer to receive treatment in primary care  [7] , and it is believed that providing SUD care in primary care would be less stigmatizing  [8] . Consequently, to increase access to SUD treatment, the National Academies of Medicine, Science, and Engineering and others have called for increased integration of substance use care in primary care  [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] .\n\nNew ways to address SUD in primary care are needed. Health systems have taken steps to prevent and treat SUD in primary care through screening, brief intervention, referral to specialty care, and medication treatments that can be prescribed by primary care providers (PCPs)  [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] . However, health systems have been unable to effectively provide treatment to the high volume of patients with SUD who visit primary care  [22, 23] . Implementation of SUD treatments is often hindered by feasibility problems, lack of capacity, and discomfort in treating SUD in primary care  [24] [25] [26] . For instance, traditional treatments such as cognitive behavioral therapy and contingency management are among the most proven psychosocial treatments for SUD  [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] , but may require extensive resources to implement and deliver  [32, 33] . Buprenorphine, a life-saving treatment for opioid use disorder (OUD), can be prescribed in office-based settings, but most do not receive this medication  [34] [35] [36] .\n\nThere is a clear need to identify treatments that are both effective and feasible to implement in primary care.\n\nThe adoption of digital therapeutics in primary care is potentially one way to increase access to evidence-based treatments. Several digital therapeutics for SUD are supported by evidence for their efficacy or effectiveness  [37] [38] [39] . Digital therapeutics may deliver intervention content such as assessments, treatment modules, and normed feedback to patients via websites or smartphone apps, often under the guidance of a clinician  [40] . The use of digital therapeutics could potentially help overcome common barriers in primary care, while providing access to an effective treatment  [41, 42] . For instance, studies have shown that digital therapeutics for SUD can produce beneficial effects while reducing the amount of time that clinicians need to spend with patients  [39, 43] , they are acceptable to patients  [44, 45] , they may improve clinical outcomes when delivered in real-world care  [46] [47] [48] [49] , and they can be effective when added to usual care approaches that lack an evidence-base  [39, 43] .\n\nAt least two logistical challenges must be addressed in implementation research to determine how to achieve a far-reaching, sustainable implementation of digital therapeutics in primary care. First, health systems must solve barriers to getting clinicians to offer these treatments to patients. For instance, clinicians encounter difficulty with executing novel workflow processes  [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] , such as creating login accounts for patients and \"teaching\" them to use apps  [40, 55, 56] , often impacting adoption of these treatments  [52, 57, 58] . A second challenge is that patients often need human support to effectively engage in digital therapeutics  [53, 54, [59] [60] [61] [62] . Successful implementations must provide support to patients to help them engage in use of apps, without overburdening primary care teams  [51, 53, 54, 59, 63] . Given the known time constraints and competing demands in primary care  [25, 64] , teams may find it infeasible to offer adequate support for engagement in digital therapeutics. It is unknown whether clinicians in primary care can add additional tasks to their already demanding workload to encourage digital therapeutic engagement, or if they alternatively need dedicated staff to ensure engagement."

      "title": "The DIGITS Trial",
      "text": "The Digital Therapeutics for Opioids and other SUDs trial (DIGITS Trial) seeks to identify how to best implement digital therapeutics for SUDs in primary care. The clinical intervention includes two 12-week, smartphonebased prescription digital therapeutics, reSET \u00ae and reSET-O \u00ae made by Pear Therapeutics, which have been authorized by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for the treatment of SUD and OUD, respectively. reSET and reSET-O are commercial versions of a computerized cognitive-behavioral treatment, the Therapeutic Educational System, which was shown to improve patient outcomes in four RCTs  [39, 43, [65] [66] [67] . However, all prior RCTs were conducted in specialty addiction treatment settings, not in primary care.\n\nThe DIGITS Trial seeks to evaluate whether practice facilitation and health coaching can improve digital therapeutic deployment in primary care beyond a standard implementation strategy. The standard implementation strategy, which serves as a comparator, is based on a multifaceted implementation strategy previously used by clinical leaders at the participating healthcare system to implement app-based treatments for depression and anxiety. It includes discrete strategies such as clinician training and electronic health record (EHR) tools.\n\nPractice facilitation is designed to overcome workflow challenges by supporting clinicians to tailor implementation to their local context  [68] [69] [70] . Facilitation methods have been used to implement addiction interventions and experts describe it as one of the most successful implementation strategies  [58, [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] . It is both a process and a set of strategies designed to build relationships, identify and overcome barriers, and help the clinical team with implementation. Meta-analysis has demonstrated that facilitation increases the odds of evidence-based primary care  [76] .\n\nHealth coaching employs a centralized mid-level provider, namely, a medical assistant (MA), to coach patients to engage in the digital therapeutic while reducing burden on primary care teams. The health coach encourages patient engagement and use of the apps, reinforces learning and skill practice, and encourages completion of healthcare visits with the primary care team. The strategy's conceptual targets are informed by the literature on patient-mediated implementation strategies, such that health coaching is designed to inform and educate patients, activate them in healthcare, and promote collaboration between patients and healthcare teams  [77] .\n\nCoaching is an effective strategy for engaging patients in digital therapeutics  [53, 54, [59] [60] [61] .\n\nThe DIGITS Trial is a parallel group, factorial, cluster-randomized trial. Cluster-randomization is at the clinic level because the implementation strategies were assigned to primary care clinics. The strong evidence for reSET and reSET-O from specialty care settings provides sufficient inferential evidence to conduct a trial in primary care that uses a hybrid effectiveness-implementation design with a main focus of evaluating implementation outcomes and a secondary focus of evaluating population-level effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of implementation strategies (\"hybrid type 3\")  [78] ."

      "text": "The first aim is to estimate the effect of practice facilitation and health coaching in increasing the reach and fidelity  [79, 80]  of digital therapeutics. We hypothesize significantly higher reach among clinics randomized to practice facilitation (hypothesis 1) and significantly higher fidelity among clinics randomized to health coaching (hypothesis 2), compared to clinics that did not implement with these respective strategies.\n\nThe second aim is to compare the population-level cost-effectiveness (PLCEA)  [81]  of the implementation strategies in improving reach, fidelity, and substance use. This analysis will inform the economic value of the additional implementation strategies relative to the standard implementation strategy. PLCEA methods consider that real-world implementations of an evidence-based practice may yield different effectiveness or cost-effectiveness results than tightly controlled RCTs of the same intervention.\n\nOther study objectives are to: 1) conduct a formative evaluation to provide feedback to the healthcare system, monitor implementation fidelity, and record adaptations, 2) evaluate additional secondary and other outcome measures, including sustainment of the implementation, to provide a comprehensive assessment of implementation success, and 3) evaluate patient-level moderators of reach."

To maximize the number of study clinics, clinics could become eligible if they met criteria from 12/9/2021 through 8/11/2022 (Fig.  1 ). Each clinic has an active implementation period of a minimum of 6 months to a maximum of 12 months, starting on the clinic's randomization date. Table  1  displays a chart of study eligibility assessment, allocation to study arms, and assessments periods following SPIRIT guidelines  [82] .\n\nEach clinic's implementation approach is assigned using a 2x2 factorial design (see Randomization  Procedures) . This allows this study to estimate the main effects of the implementation strategies, compare their effectiveness, and evaluate their interactions. This design yields four distinct implementation approaches (Table  2 ).\n\nThe study obtains all quantitative data for sample identification and outcome measurement from secondary data. The study is not proactively recruiting participants into the analytic sample; rather, outcomes will be analyzed among all patients who screen positive for unhealthy substance use in primary care, allowing for unbiased assessment of reach into the target population."

Changes are intrinsic in implementation efforts, thus implementation teams Fig.  1  Timing of active implementation and sustainment periods at the study sites must seek to \"maximize fit\" by iteratively monitoring, recording, and adapting to changes over time to increase the likelihood of reach and sustainment  [84] . A failure to maximize fit may lead to implementation failure and lack of sustainment. We chose an adaptive implementation strategy, practice facilitation, to attend to clinic-level barriers and facilitators that vary across clinics and over time  [52, 86] . The DSF also guides our approach to formative evaluation and its continuous assessment of key DSF constructs (see Formative Evaluation)."

Prior to piloting, the study required contracting with the vendor, healthcare system approval of the app's use of monetary\n\nTable 1 Timing of the DIGITS Trial's assessment schedules, following SPIRIT 2013 guidelines (Standard Protocol Items: Recommendations for Interventional Trials)\n\nt 1 through t 8 are discrete 3-month periods. Sites with shorter active implementation and sustainment periods have shorter assessment periods. For instance, the reach & adoption assessment period will be 7 months for a site with a 7-month active implementation period. 1 While sites are allocated to arms upon randomization, an open cohort design is used to identify patients for the analysis. Patients who visit a site after randomization, or in the 2 weeks before randomization, are eligible for the analysis. This 2-week period before randomization allows for the possibility that clinicians will identify patients with recent visits who could benefit from the intervention. 2 Patient covariates are assessed in the year prior to a patient's qualifying visit. 3 For each patient, we will identify whether they were reached from the day of their first qualifying visit through the end of the active implementation period plus a 2 week \"grace\" period. The grace period allows patients who have their first qualifying visit at the end of active implementation at least 2 weeks to be reached."

Learnings led to the modification of EHR tools, training materials and processes, procedures for virtual visits, and economic analysis and formative evaluation data collection materials.

The assessment period includes up to 18 months after each patient's qualifying visit to help ensure a follow-up measure is collected. These will be analyzed among patients who become eligible before the last 3 months of active implementation (to help ensure the patients could complete the 12-week prescription before the outcomes were measured).

Reach is the site-level proportion of patients who initiate reSET or reSET-O.

Fidelity is the site-level mean number of weeks in which patients use the digital therapeutic as recommended. This includes completing a recommended 4 or more modules per week while under the care of a clinician  [39, 95, 96] .\n\nPatient engagement in SUD care, a secondary outcome, is operationalized as the mean number of months in which patients make at least one visit for SUD in any setting. Engagement is conceptualized as an effectiveness outcome. Economic costs are another secondary outcome operationalized using PLCEA methodology (see Economic Evaluation).\n\nOther pre-specified outcome measures include an additional measure of reach quantifying the proportion of patients who are prescribed reSET or reSET-O by a clinician, irrespective of whether a patient initiates its use. An additional fidelity measure will estimate the number of weeks in which patients complete at least one module per week.

One adoption measure is operationalized as the proportion of healthcare providers prescribing reSET or reSET-O, overall and by provider type. Another adoption measure is the mean number of months in which providers access clinician dashboards. An additional reach variable will indicate the proportion of patients who download and unlock the digital therapeutics. Two additional fidelity variables indicate the mean number of weeks in which patients use 4 modules per week regardless of whether they see a clinician, and the mean number of modules completed over the 12-week prescription. Additional substance use and abstinence measures will use self-report timeline followback data collected by the app every four days during the 12-week prescription  [75] .

We will test hypotheses 1 and 2 by testing the appropriate contrast from the regression model and use the Holm procedure to control the familywise type 1 error rate of the two primary hypotheses at 0.05. In addition to the hypothesis above (see Specific Aims), we secondarily hypothesize that practice facilitation is superior to health coaching in increasing reach, and health coaching is superior to practice facilitation in increasing fidelity.

Population-level costs include implementation costs, direct intervention costs and indirect healthcare costs. While the primary outcome analyses above test specific hypotheses regarding the main effects followed by exploratory tests of interactions, the PLCEA will estimate the difference in the outcomes of reach, fidelity and engagement (see Outcome Measures) between respective populations targeted by one of the enhanced implementation strategies and the standard strategy. This produces information about incremental costs of each implementation approach while accounting for potential multiplicative effects on implementation costs  [104] . Analyses will be performed from the perspective of a healthcare system and payer. Implementation Costs Implementation costs, which are collected for all trial arms, include the monetary value of time and resources incurred by the healthcare system needed to roll-out the digital therapeutics. We use an activity-based approach to calculate the opportunity cost of time devoted to activities related to implementation  [105] . This approach uses microcosting, applying unit costs to the amount of time spent by multiplying the number of hours devoted to activities by the estimated wage rate of an implementation participant. Wage rates will be ascertained from Bureau of Labor Statistics data that captures the average wage for an implementation participant's occupation in the geographical area of employment. Implementation costs also include the direct cost of implementation resources (e.g., printing cost of materials to support adoption). We will sum costs associated with activities and resources needed to execute all implementation strategies. Details about cost data collection are in Additional file 5.\n\nOperating Costs Operating costs are dollars spent on regular operation of the digital therapeutics incurred by the healthcare system and patients. We include both direct operating and indirect overhead costs for completeness. Direct costs include digital therapeutic licensing fees. Indirect cost expenditures include infrastructure/technical resources and staff support such as information technology, office space, and capital equipment. We will estimate infrastructure costs from public data sources following methods used in prior implementation cost studies  [106] .\n\nDirect Intervention Costs Intervention costs include encounters with clinicians related to the initiation and continued use of reSET and reSET-O. We will identify patient visits with app prescribers and health coaches during the 12-week prescription period, using EHR data.\n\nWe will count encounters on the day of and in 12-weeks after patients activate their prescription.\n\nUsing patient-level encounter records, we will calculate intervention costs using KPWA's internal accounting that measures actual production costs incurred by the healthcare system in providing care to members. This model allocates costs to all encounters based on a general ledger for all services. Cost values include a direct care component (e.g., nurse salaries) or an overhead component (e.g., facilities). Costs excluded from allocation include those not directly related to delivering health services (e.g., insurance) and patient out-of-pocket costs.\n\nOther Indirect Healthcare Costs Digital therapeutics usage may impact patients' use of services other than SUD care. Thus, we will sum costs for all outpatient encounters (including primary care, specialty mental health, specialty medical, ancillary, acute care) and dispensed medications expected in this population."

Using templated forms (Additional file 6), evaluators take field notes at implementation meetings and review secondary data sources (e.g., meeting notes, communications, and implementation documents). Analysis procedures consist of structured data reduction to categorize and summarize fieldnotes and secondary data sources according to predetermined domains  [90, 107, 111] , while also capturing emergent findings (e.g., decision points). Summary data are entered into a strategy-by-domain matrix to systematically extract themes, detect trends, and answer main evaluation questions (Additional file 7).

Real-world implementation studies in health systems may provide more actionable information to decision makers such as health system leaders than traditional effectiveness trials  [81, 84] . For instance, other trials may be conducted within selected patient populations who consent to participate in studies of treatment for SUD, who may not be representative of typical patients. Moreover, other trials may rely on researchers to deliver digital treatments whose workloads and primary responsibilities are very different from those who are delivering clinical care.\n\nThis study fills a gap in implementation science, where evidence is needed on the comparative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of different implementation strategies on improving care. Findings regarding the populationlevel cost effectiveness of implementation strategies will further provide information to decisions makers about the financial implications of this study's strategies. For instance, while an implementation strategy may result in greater effectiveness, it may not necessarily be more cost-effective. Other aspects of this study, such as the workflows created and the insights into sustainment ascertained through qualitative research methods, will help create a roadmap for other health care organizations wishing to care more effectively for SUDs."

However, the study design also presents limitations. Notably, the study is being conducted after the COVID pandemic began; in the context of significant healthcare system staffing shortages, fewer clinics were recruited, and the intervention is delivered in clinics with reduced capacity. The substance use and abstinence measures collected from the EHR will be available only for an estimated ~70% of patients because of reliance on follow-up screening data. Findings may not generalize into systems that primarily serve uninsured populations."
