  "title": "Supportive text messaging for depression and comorbid alcohol use disorder: single-blind randomised trial \u2606",
  "abstract": "Background: Mobile phone text message technology has the potential to improve outcomes for patients with depression and co-morbid Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). Aims: To perform a randomised rater-blinded trial to explore the effects of supportive text messages on mood and abstinence outcomes for patients with depression and co-morbid AUD. Methods: Participants (n= 54) with a DSM IV diagnosis of unipolar depression and AUD who completed an in-patient dual diagnosis treatment programme were randomised to receive twice daily supportive text messages (n = 26) or a fortnightly thank you text message (n= 28) for three months. Primary outcome measures were Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI-II) scores and Cumulative Abstinence Duration (CAD) in days at three months. Trial registration: NCT0137868. Results: There was a statistically significant difference in three month BDI-II scores between the intervention and control groups; 8.5 (SD = 8.0) vs. 16.7 (SD = 10.3) respectively after adjusting for the baseline scores, F (1, 49) = 9.54, p = 0.003, \u03b7 p 2 = 0.17. The mean difference in change BDI-II scores was -7.9 (95% CI -13.06 to -2.76, Cohen's d = 0.85). There was a trend for a greater CAD in the text message group than the control group: 88.3 (SD = 6.2) vs. 79.3 (SD = 24.1), t = 1.78, df= 48, p = 0.08. Limitations: Limitations of the study include the small sample size, the potential for loss of rater blinding and the lack of long term follow-up to determine the longer term effects of the intervention. \n Conclusion: Supportive text messages have the potential to improve outcomes for patients with comorbid depression and alcohol dependency syndrome.",

      "text": "Among the numerous forms of comorbid mental health and substance use disorders, the co-occurrence of depression and alcohol use disorders (AUD) has received considerable attention  (Li et al., 2004) . Depression and AUDs co-occur at levels greater than expected by chance in clinical and epidemiological samples  (Boschloo et al., 2011a (Boschloo et al., , 2011b;; Sullivan et al., 2005; Swendsen and Merikangas, 2000)  with about 80% of patients with AUD complaining of depressive symptoms at some time in their lives. This includes 30% or more who relate periods of intense depression lasting for weeks that fulfill criteria for a major depressive episode  (Kessler et al., 1996; Regier et al., 1990; Schuckit, 1986) . As separate disorders, depression and AUDs exact a tremendous toll world-wide. The World Health Organization reports that the two disorders are among the leading causes of disability in the world as measured by disability-adjusted life years and years of life lived with disability  (Room et al., 2005; Ustun et al., 2004) . Individuals with co-morbidity present greater challenges to treatment than individuals with a single disorder since they have more severe symptoms  (Grant et al., 1996) , greater disability, poorer quality of life,  (Bolton et al., 2009; Burns and Teesson, 2002)  higher likelihood of suicide attempts  (Conner et al., 2007; Preuss et al., 2002; Sher et al., 2005)  and completed suicides  (Conner and Duberstein, 2004)  and may pose a greater economic burden to society due to their higher use of treatment services  (Burns and Teesson, 2002; Kessler et al., 1996) .\n\nGiven the treatment challenges and poor prognosis associated with this dual disorder  (Curran et al., 2000; Kranzler et al., 1996; Mueller et al., 1994; Sellman and Joyce, 1996) , novel treatment strategies aimed at reducing illness burden are required. Mobile phone technology has the potential to provide personalised support for patients and improve outcomes for this group of patients  (Agyapong et al., 2011) . In a recent study in the U.S.A, 45 young adults identified as hazardous drinkers and discharged from three urban emergency departments were randomly assigned to either weekly text message-based feedback with goal setting or weekly text message-based drinking assessments without feedback. After three months, participants who were exposed to the text messages with feedback had a mean 3.4 fewer heavy drinking days in the previous month and a mean 2.1 fewer drinks per drinking day compared to baseline  (Suffoletto et al., 2011) . In another study to assess the impact of mobile text message technology on cannabis consumption among the youth, participants reported that they felt motivated to reduce their level of cannabis abuse and to maintain a reduced level  (Laursen, 2010) .\n\nThere are also evidence for using text messages to support smoking cessation,  (Free et al., 2011; Whittaker et al., 2009)  remind general medical patients of scheduled medical appointments  (Chen et al., 2008; da Costa et al., 2010; Downer et al., 2005 ; Geraghty et al., 2008; Koshy et al., 2008; Leong et al., 2007; Liew et al., 2009)  and improve compliance with medication  (Armstrong et al., 2009; Depp et al., 2010; Ollivier et al., 2009; Pal, 2003; Strandbygaard et al., 2010) . In a review of text messaging for clinical and healthy behaviour interventions,  Wei et al. (2011)  found that among sixteen randomized controlled trials, ten reported significant improvement with interventions and six reported differences suggesting positive trends  (Wei et al., 2011) . Mobile phone technologies offer the possibility of managing non-critical care within the community, thus reducing hospitalization while improving patients' quality of life and controlling costs  (da Costa et al., 2010; Downer et al., 2005; Koshy et al., 2008) . They also allow for substantial numbers of messages to be sent simultaneously with the benefit of further reducing labour expenditure and costs. Furthermore, they have the advantage of being location independent so that healthcare is not confined to fixed locations  (Istepanian and Lacal, 2003) . Currently, there are high penetration rates for the mobile device across all age groups, income and cultures  (Norris, 2002)  and despite this huge potential for using text message interventions in psychiatry, to our knowledge, no previous studies have assessed the impact of supportive text messages on patients with either depression alone or in those with depression and comorbid AUD. In light of the above, we sought to explore the effects of supportive text messaging on mood and alcohol abstinence in patients with depression and comorbid AUD following discharge from an in-patient dual diagnosis programme."

      "text": "This was a single-blind, randomised, pilot study of supportive text messages delivered through mobile phone technology. The study was conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (Hong Kong Amendment) and Good Clinical Practice (European Guidelines). The protocol was approved by the Research Ethics Committee of St Patrick's University Hospital. Written informed consent was obtained from each subject. The trial was undertaken in St Patrick's University Hospital (SPUH) in Dublin, Ireland, and participants were recruited between February 2010 and September 2011. The trial has been registered (NCT0137868).\n\nThe participants were patients who satisfied the criteria below. a) Age over 18 years and able to provide informed consent. b) Mini Mental State Examination  (Folstein et al., 1975)  score \u226525. This cut-off point was chosen to ensure that patients did not have cognitive deficits  (Bertolucci et al., 1994)  that could impact on their ability to fully benefit from the supportive text messages. c) Patient fulfilled the criteria for both Major Depressive Disorder and Alcohol Dependency Syndrome/Alcohol Abuse according to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID)  (First et al., 1996)  and was enrolled on the in-patient dual diagnosis treatment programme in St Patrick's University Hospital  (Farren and Mc Elroy, 2008 ). d) Did not fulfil the criteria for bipolar affective disorder, psychotic disorder or current poly-substances dependence or abuse according to the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I Disorders (SCID)  (First et al., 1996) . e) Patient had a mobile phone, was familiar with text messaging technology, was able to read and be available for follow-up during the study period."

Participants were assigned the next available number from the randomisation sequence and, depending on whether the number was even or odd, they were placed respectively in the intervention group or control group. Patients were asked not to disclose the allocated treatment group to the investigator (VIOA) who performed the follow-up assessments and who remained blinded about allocation throughout the study period. To test the success of blinding, the rater was asked to guess the allocated treatment after the end of the final assessments. Of the 50 patients assessed for follow-up, the rater correctly guessed the treatment allocation for 39 (78%) patients; 20/24 (83%) in the text message group vs. 19/25 (73%) in the control group. Despite being asked not to discuss their treatment with the rater, many patients inadvertently did so at the follow-up assessment."

      "title": "Procedures at baseline",
      "text": "All consenting patients underwent baseline assessments during the third week of a four week inpatient therapeutic programme using a form to collect demographic and clinical data. As previously described, the inpatient programme consists of lectures on the definition, epidemiology, medical complications of alcohol dependence and affective disorders, interaction between mood and substances, psychotherapy and pharmacotherapy  (Farren and Mc Elroy, 2008) . It also includes twice weekly individual supportive psychotherapy session and group video sessions on managing anxiety and stress, stigma, relaxation techniques and assertiveness. The programme focuses on relapse prevention and recovery planning and as part of a group discussion, each client produces and discusses a practical plan to avoid relapse of mood and substance use.\n\nFor the purposes of the present study, patients were all rated for their level of depression in the last week of the programme using the Beck's Depression Inventory version II (BDI-II)  (Beck et al., 1961) . At the same time, the Time Line Follow Back (TLFB) was used to record the quantity of alcohol consumed and number of drinking days during the 90 days preceding admission  (Sobell and Sobell, 1992) . Other clinical measures included the Obsessive Compulsive Drinking Scale (OCDS)  (Anton RF and Latham, 1995)  and the Alcohol Abstinence Self Efficacy Scale (AASES)  (DiClemente et al., 1994)  that evaluated both temptation to drink and confidence to abstain across 20 items representing cues in the four subscale areas of Negative Affect, Social, Physical, and Withdrawal/ Urges. Functional outcome was measured using the Global Assessment of Function (GAF)  (Luborsky, 2000)  Scale. All these clinical measures were all assessed during the last week of the in-patient programme and related to the clinical state of the patient at that time. Results of admission blood tests for mean corpuscular volume (MCV), aspartate transaminase (AST) and \u03b3-glutamyl transferase (GGT) that could be affected by alcohol use were also recorded."

      "title": "Interventions",
      "text": "Starting from the day of discharge from in-patient care, patients in the intervention group received twice daily supportive text messages for three months. The messages were sent by a computer programme at 10.00 and 19.00 h each day and were set up and monitored by the research worker who undertook the randomisation. 180 text messages were written by the research team and two addiction counsellors to ensure that the same text message was not sent twice within a 3 month period. They were specifically designed around multiple themes aimed at dealing with stress, maintaining good mental wellbeing, promoting abstinence from alcohol, dealing with cravings, promoting adherence with medication, and providing general support. About half of the messages targeted improvement in mood and compliance with medication while the other half targeted abstinence from alcohol. About 80% of the text messages reflected lessons patients had learned on the dual diagnosis treatment programme. On any given day, the same text messages were sent to all participants who were in receipt of the intervention.\n\nThe messages included the following:\n\n\u2022 Monitor changes in your mood; develop a list of personal warning signs.\n\n\u2022 Develop a support system; isolating yourself can bring on depression. \u2022 Stress cannot be avoided; learn to cope better by adopting new strategies. \u2022 If you are having a good day, share your joy with others. If you are having a bad day, share it with others and accept their help. \u2022 To change the outside world all you have to do is change the way you think and feel. \u2022 Stick to your treatment plan; take your medication as prescribed and keep your appointments. \u2022 Keep Sobriety as a number one priority and you will reach your goals. \u2022 We have this choice everyday of our lives. We can take the path of sobriety that leads to a happy and useful life. \u2022 Make a list of 5 people you can call if you are craving. Make sure you carry their numbers with you all the time. \u2022 AA meetings are crucial; attend regularly; if you don't like a particular AA meeting, shop around until you find one that suits you.\n\nPatients in the non-intervention group received text messages once fortnightly thanking them for participating in the study. Patients in the two groups were not precluded from participating in any follow-up programme, including attendance of the aftercare programme in SPUH, attendance of self-help groups or counselling, review by a General Practitioner (GP) or Psychiatrist (see Table  1 ). At three months following discharge from in-patient care, all the study participants were contacted by the blinded investigator who assisted them to complete a range of assessment tools relating to the primary and secondary outcome measures as listed below. They were also asked about which follow-up programme (apart from receiving or not receiving supportive text messages) they had received. No contact was made by the research team with any of the follow-up programmes to confirm patients' active participation."

In addition, their levels of satisfaction with treatment at this stage were measured using an adaptation of a treatment evaluation questionnaire developed by  Sobell and Sobell (1993)    (Sobell and Sobell, 1993) . Primary outcome measures included BDI scores at 3 months and Cumulative Abstinence Duration (CAD) which was measured using the TLFB at 3 months. This was expressed as the total number of days abstinent from alcohol since in-patient discharge to the study end point. Secondary outcome measures included the GAF, OCDS and AASES scores at 3 months, proportion of patients continuously abstinent from alcohol at 3 months, time to first alcoholic drink following inpatient discharge, units of alcohol per drinking day at 3 months and patient satisfaction (for both groups) with their overall follow-up treatment at 3 months."

      "text": "As data regarding the results of text messaging interventions in a dual diagnosis patient group were not found in the available literature, a proper calculation of the sample size to obtain the generally accepted statistical power of 0.8 could not be achieved a priori. Consistent with the idea that this was an exploratory study, the research used the data elicited from the participants that could be enrolled within the existing resources, a principle described by Haynes et al. as using \"the patients I can get\"  (Haynes et al., 2005) . The study was therefore limited to a pilot trial with a sample size of 54, with 26 patients in the intervention group and 28 patients in the nonintervention group.\n\nData were analysed on an intention-to-treat basis using SPSS version 17 for Windows (SPSS Inc. Chicago, IL). Data are presented as mean (standard deviation) and tests were two-sided, with p values of less than 0.05 judged as significant. Effect sizes  (Cohen's d)  were calculated between-groups based on the pooled standard deviation (Cohen's d =M 1 -M 2 / \u03c3 pooled. ) where M 1 is the change on outcome measures from baseline to post treatment for the text message group; M 2 is the change in outcome measures from baseline to post treatment for the control group and\n\nSmall effect sizes were defined as Cohen's d \u2265 0.20 but b 0.5, medium effect sizes were defined as Cohen's d \u22650.5 but b0.8 and large effect sizes were defined as Cohen's d \u2265 0.80  (Cohen, 1988) .\n\nBaseline demographic and clinical characteristics of the two groups were analysed using Student's t-test and an ANOVA. Categorical baseline variables were compared with chi-square tests. Three months BDI scores were compared between the intervention and control groups using an analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) with the treatment condition (supportive text messages v. no supportive text messages) as the independent variable, baseline BDI as the covariate and BDI at three months as the dependent variable. Preliminary checks were conducted to ensure that there was no violation of the assumptions of normality, linearity, homogeneity of variance, homogeneity of regression slopes, and reliable measurement of the covariate. The CAD at three months between the treatment groups was compared using Student's t-test. Student's t-test, Fisher's exact test and ANCOVA were also used to explore statistical differences in the secondary outcome measures in the two groups, with adjustments made for baseline GAF, OCDS and AASES scores and also the units of alcohol per drinking day. For participants with missing data (two in each group), we used the last observation carried forward (baseline measures) to impute missing data thus attempting to correct for any potential bias caused by missing data  (Molenberghs, 2007) . We performed sensitivity analyses to explore the impact of imputation of data loss on primary outcome analysis."

The mean difference in change GAF scores was statistically significant (Table  2 ).\n\nThere was no relationship between the mean baseline GAF scores and the mean three month GAF scores, as indicated by \u03b7 p 2 of 0.004, F (1, 49) = 0.18 p = 0.67, which implies that baseline GAF scores explained only 0.4% of the variance in the three month GAF scores compared to 20% of the variance which was explained by the supportive text message intervention.\n\nThere was no difference in three months OCDS scores between the intervention and control groups (Table  2 ) after controlling for the baseline OCDS scores; F (1, 49) = 0.76, p = 0.40. However, after adjusting for baseline AARE scores, there was a trend to finding a significant difference in mean three month AARE scores between the intervention and the control groups, F (1, 49) = 3.08, p = 0.09, \u03b7 p 2 = 0.06, with patients in the intervention group having higher scores than those in the control group (Table  2 ). When the scores for the AARE sub-scores for negative affect were analysed controlling for baseline sub-scores, we found a statistically significant difference in mean three month AASES negative affect sub-scores between the intervention and the control groups: 19.0 (4.46) vs. 16.3 (4.07) respectively, F (1, 49) = 5.73, p = 0.02, \u03b7 p 2 = 0.11. The mean difference in change AASES sub-scores for negative affect was statistically significant: 2.9 95% CI 0.46 to 5.34, (Cohen's d = 0.82). The other sub-scores on the AASES showed no significant differences between the intervention and control groups.\n\nComparing with the Fisher's exact test, we found no statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups with regards the number of participants who were completely abstinent from alcohol at three months (Table  2 ). There was also no statistically significant difference in the mean days to first drink between the intervention and control groups (Table  2 ). However, after controlling for the baseline values, there was a trend towards patients in the supportive text message group consuming lower units of alcohol per drinking day at three months compared to those in the control group (Table  2 ) with F (1, 49) = 2.52, p = 0.1 and \u03b7 p 2 = 0.05."

An independent sample t-test was performed to compare the mean scores for the two groups (Table  3 ).

      "text": "The trial has shown that supportive text messaging added to standard care has the potential to help people with depression and co-morbid AUD to improve their levels of depression and global functioning. The response rate in terms of improvement in BDI scores and global functioning was significantly greater in the supportive text message group compared with the control group. Effects were clinically relevant, with effect sizes in the large range (ranging from 0.85 for reduction in BDI scores to 1.02 for improvement in global functioning). While the precise mechanisms for improvement in mood and global functioning are unclear, it may well be that the supportive text messages provided psychological support similar to those provided by other face to face and web-based psychological and supportive therapies. The effect size recorded in our study in terms of improvement in BDI in the text message group is comparable to those recorded in recent randomised controlled trials of web-based cognitive behavioral therapy for unipolar depression which ranged from 0.7 to 1.09  (Ruwaard et al., 2009; Titov et al., 2010) .\n\nAlthough not significant, the trends towards increased CAD and lower units of alcohol per drinking day in patients receiving supportive text messages are interesting. These results are consistent with findings from the study by  Suffoletto et al (2011)  in which it was noted that at 3 months, young adults with harmful use of alcohol discharged from an Emergency Department who were exposed to the text messagebased intervention had 3.4 (5.4) fewer heavy drinking days in the previous month and 2.1(1.5) fewer drinks per drinking day when compared to baseline  (Suffoletto et al., 2011) . Other randomised trials of supportive text messages in addiction have focused mainly on smoking cessation with promising results  (Free et al., 2011; Whittaker et al., 2009) . To our knowledge, this is the first randomised trial to examine the effects of supportive text messages on patients with depression and comorbid AUD. Trials of supportive text messages for smoking cessation which have produced significant differences in terms of outcomes have had larger sample sizes (from 200 to 5800 )  (Free et al., 2011; Whittaker et al., 2009)  and it is possible that a trial involving a lager sample of dual diagnosis patients may produce statistically significant results in terms of differences in the cumulative abstinence duration.\n\nAnother interesting finding is the significantly higher scores in the negative affect sub score for the AASES for patients receiving supportive text messages, which is consistent with trends observed in the CAD for the two groups. Furthermore, our results indicate that patients who received supportive text messages expressed significantly greater satisfaction with the quality of their care compared to patients in the control group. This may support the theory that supportive text messages play a role in providing increase psychological support with the result that there is an improvement in patients' mood and overall functioning as evidenced by improvement in BDI and GAF scores for patients in the intervention group. It is unclear why this seemingly increased psychological support did not also translate into statistically significant reductions in the CAD for patients in the intervention group.\n\nAs hypothesized above, the low sample size might provide an explanation for these conflicting results. Another explanation could be that the intervention did not impact on participants' ability to deal with their cravings as much as it impacted on their mood, thus diminishing the potential benefits of the intervention in terms of promoting abstinence.\n\nThese results would support a larger scale exploration of the use of supportive text messages as an intervention for patients with dual diagnosis. It also supports the view that mobile technologies have the potential to help manage non-critical care within the community whilst improving patients' quality of life  (Norris, 2002) . The technology empowers patients to play an active role in their care rather than being simple recipients of holistic care by placing in them the responsibility of deciding whether or not to read the messages and when to read such messages once they have been delivered  (Leong et al., 2007) . Because the messages remain on patients' phones until they decide to delete them, patients could always refer to them when it suits them."

      "title": "Strengths and limitations of the study",
      "text": "The study has two important strengths. First, the use of a series of computer generated random numbers for allocating participants into groups ensured that baseline demographic and clinical characteristics were well balanced between the two groups (Table  1 ). Second, there was a high follow-up rate (over 92%) for both the supportive text message and control groups. This was similar to the 87% follow-up rate at three months achieved in the recent randomised trial of text message-based interventions for harmful use of alcohol in young adults discharged from an Emergency Department  (Suffoletto et al., 2011) .\n\nA drawback of the study, being the first pilot randomised controlled trial of supportive text messages in this patient group, was its small sample size which limits our power to detect differences between groups and the generalizability of our results. This notwithstanding, the treatment effect sizes in terms of improvement in BDI and GAF scores are large enough to suggest that these are reliable effects that warrant further investigation, including cost-benefit analysis as part of a larger randomized controlled trial. In this regard, the study has been effective in generating effect sizes which would aid future power and sample size calculations for expanded research projects on the subject. A second limitation of the trial is the potential for loss of rater blinding which could be a source of bias, particularly for our secondary outcome, the observerrated GAF scores. Future studies on the use of supportive text messages in this patient group should adopt additional measures to ensure successful blinding such as repeatedly reminding and encouraging patients not to make any reference to the contents or benefits of the messages they might have received. A third limitation is that the supportive text messages were delivered for only three months with outcome measures assessed at the end of this period. It is therefore not known what the effects on outcome measures would be if they were to be delivered for a longer period. It is also not known from this study whether the effects of the intervention would last beyond the period in which participants received the supportive text messages. A final limitation of the study is that patients who did not meet the eligibility criteria for inclusion in the"
