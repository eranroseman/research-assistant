  "title": "Strengthening Social Capital to Address Isolation and Loneliness in Long-term Care Facilities During the COVID-19 Pandemic: Protocol for a Systematic Review of Research on Information and Communication Technologies",
  "abstract": "Background: The COVID-19 pandemic has had the greatest impact in long-term care facilities (LTCFs) by disproportionately harming older adults and heightening social isolation and loneliness (SIL). Living in close quarters with others and in need of around-the-clock assistance, interactions with older adults, which were previously in person, have been replaced by virtual chatting using information and communication technologies (ICTs). ICT applications such as FaceTime, Zoom, and Microsoft Teams video chatting have been overwhelmingly used by families to maintain residents' social capital and subsequently reduce their SIL. Objective: Because of the lack of substantive knowledge on this ever-increasing form of social communication, this systematic review intends to synthesize the effects of ICT interventions to address SIL among residents in LTCFs during the COVID-19 period. \n Methods: We will include studies published in Chinese, English, and French from December 2019 onwards. Beyond the traditional search strategy approach, 4 of the 12 electronic databases to be queried will be in Chinese. We will include quantitative and intervention studies as well as qualitative and mixed methods designs. Using a 2-person approach, the principal investigator and one author will blindly screen eligible articles, extract data, and assess risk of bias. In order to improve the first round of screening, a pilot-tested algorithm will be used. Disagreements will be resolved through discussion with a third author. Results will be presented as structured summaries of the included studies. We plan to conduct a meta-analysis if sufficient data are available. Results: A total of 1803 articles have been retrieved to date. Queries of the Chinese databases are ongoing. The systematic review and subsequent manuscript will be completed by the fall of 2022. Conclusions: ICT applications have become a promising avenue to reduce SIL by providing a way to maintain communication between LTCF residents and their families and will certainly remain in the post-COVID-19 period. This review will investigate",

      "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately harmed older adults and subsequently heightened their social isolation and loneliness (SIL)  [1, 2]  and suicidal vulnerability  [3] [4] [5] . Long-term care facilities (LTCFs) are the most profoundly affected sector with the highest mortality rate of 81%  [6, 7] . Apart from being the hardest hit during the pandemic, residents have already been experiencing long-lasting SIL before the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic  [8] . To address this SIL, information and communication technologies (ICTs) have become key resources for families to maintain a socio-emotional connection with their loves secluded in LTCFs  [9] . Families remain LTCF residents' strongest support system. The Canadian Institutes for Health Information contends that the majority (82%) of older adults need family involvement in their instrumental activities of daily living  [10] [11] [12] .\n\nSystematic  [13]  and Cochrane  [14]  reviews undertaken before the COVID-19 pandemic were inconclusive with regard to the effect of ICT in reducing SIL in older adults. However, the pandemic has confirmed the importance of ICT's applications worldwide to provide remote chatting conferencing-a feature that maintains vital interactions between families and their loved ones. Owing to stringent public health restrictions on physical access to LTCFs, ICT has been the only alternative to maintaining social capital and subsequently reducing SIL among seniors in LTCFs  [15] . Residents in these settings are more fraught with SIL, varying from 40%  [16]  to 71.6%  [17] . As noted by Abbasi  [18] , during the current COVID-19 pandemic, SIL resulted in an uptake of antidepressants, antipsychotics, and anxiolytics in LTCF residents. Along with being physically and psychologically separated from the community, many older adults find that relocation to a LTCF itself is a stressful life event. The literature clearly contends that the majority of older adults are reluctant to be relocated  [19] [20] [21] . Many older adults are widowed, under guardianship or tutorship, and an unknown proportion-4% in the Canadian general population in 2018  [22] -sel-identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, questioning, or two-spirit  [23] . These vulnerable older adults often become further isolated once admitted into a LTCF and experience greater levels of SIL  [24] , which underlines the necessity for providing interactive connections with others.\n\nSIL negatively affects quality of life and is associated with an increase in all-cause mortality, an effect that is slightly stronger in men than in women  [25] [26] [27] . Owing to the public health restrictions imposed during the COVID-19 pandemic, LTCF residents had limited contact with staff and were often secluded in their rooms and no longer able to partake in communal meals, in-person activities, or family visits. The threat of infection and the loss of contact with loved ones has contributed to SIL and has likely exaggerated subsequent negative outcomes in older people. Nevertheless, SIL in LTCFs has just started being considered in the literature. With an increasing incidence of COVID-19, the use of ICT applications has skyrocketed to facilitate social communication  [15] , providing a necessary support for older people in long-term care  [28] . The use of ICT to reduce SIL has been extensively studied, including the effects of internet-based interventions  [29] [30] [31] [32] [33]  and Humanoid Robot approaches  [34] [35] [36] . Methods currently used in LTCFs to connect older adults with their families and friends range from the conventional telephone to web-based platforms such as Skype, FaceTime, Zoom, or Google Meet (for a review see Banskota et al  [37]  or Chen and Schulz  [38] ). Zamir et al  [39]  employed an intercare home group \"Skype\" to reduce SIL in 3 care homes and found that video calls reduced feelings of loneliness in residents seemed acceptable and was a feasible, low-cost model, especially during times of public crisis such as during the COVID-19 pandemic."

The following objectives will be considered to address this research question: 1. To synthesize the effects of ICT interventions to address SIL in LTCF residents during the COVID-19 period; 2. To identify studies that use ICT, namely through a varied function of communication such as messaging or chat, video, voice mail, or photo as a strategy for interaction and connection with older family members living in LTCFs; 3. To measure the impact of ICT on the interaction between families and their family members in LTCF facilities."

SIL in older people has been identified as a risk factor for premature mortality  [27]  for both poor physical (eg, cardiovascular and obesity)  [41] [42] [43]  and psychiatric health (eg, depression and anxiety)  [44] .

Liotta et al  [46]  explained how increased social connectedness was a powerful tool for nursing home residents that it decreased SIL during the pandemic. Thus, innovative use of digital tools can provide a method to address this urgent public health matter on a long-term basis  [47] . As opportunities offered by ICT applications have the potential for long-term solutions for the COVID-19 pandemic and postpandemic period, this systematic review will help inform policy and practice interventions in this area.\n\nThe proposed systematic review is also necessary to shed light on the pre-COVID-19 pandemic literature on the impact of ICT on SIL. Systematically examining the evidence on the association between ICT and SIL will help establish up-to-date knowledge to develop best practices and support evidence-based policy decision-making."

To increase the reliability of screening by the two independent reviewers, a random sample of articles will be screened on the basis of the eligibility criteria in a pilot test phase. For the screening, a structured algorithm that was previously validated by IB, SD, and ETN will be used.\n\nA standardized data extraction grid that has been developed and piloted will be employed to extract data from all full texts. This includes the following: authors, year of publication, language, design, objectives, participants' characteristics, ICT intervention, outcomes, population, setting, and the fields of the AMSTAR checklist. The K statistic will then be calculated to determine the intrarater agreement for study inclusion  [51] . Studies excluded during the screening phase will be recorded along with the reason for exclusion by each reviewer.

This is one of 7 elements that can help older adults maintain their independence, proposed in a white paper by the Center for Technology and Aging  [54] . Targeted interventions can be delivered individually or in groups and can take place over one or more sessions of various time frames. Any type of digital tool will be considered, including computers, smartphones, or tablets, with the ultimate goal of addressing SIL using commercial applications including Facebook or Zoom for conversation.

      "text": "According to the International Federation on Ageing, the number one emerging issue faced by seniors in Canada is keeping older people socially connected and active  [56] . SIL can be a chronic issue that burdens older adults. This has sharply augmented with the arrival of COVID-19. Active and vigorous programs exist throughout the world to address SIL such as the following: \"End Loneliness\" in the United Kingdom  [57] , Danmark spiser sammen  [58] , \"ALONE\" of Ireland  [59] , or even \"Better Together,\" the Canadian family and caregiver presence initiative  [60, 61]  that has resulted in a significant involvement of families (ie, 20% of families spending over 10 hours per week in supportive activities)  [62] . Despite this, more work is needed, and ICT interventions are a good fit.\n\nVirtual communication and technologies that have come to the forefront as the primary mode for LTCF residents during the COVID-19 pandemic appear to be a promising new avenue to maintain social connections and capitalize on the ties among families, their loved ones, and the \"outside world.\" Furthermore, many older adults have higher levels of eHealth literacy with the baby boomer generation becoming older seniors. Nonetheless, many LTCFs do not have the technological capabilities to support modern-day technologies. This is one area of health care system that the COVID-19 pandemic has shed light on. Indeed, in 2020, Canada Infoway reported that LTCFs health technology is the least funded component of the entire health system; a reality that may also be applicable to the rest of the world  [53] .\n\nAt the same time, the current number of studies on ITC does not reflect the mortality inflicted by COVID-19 in long-term care. When and if visiting condition return to \"normal,\" greater efforts will be required to further develop and promote a secure way of virtually connecting LTCF residents with their loves in the community. Furthermore, initiatives should be tailored to address individual social isolation needs. This review is a step toward highlighting the need for more high-quality program evaluation of interventions and other initiatives implemented in the course of the COVID-19 pandemic. The findings of this systematic review will help draw attention from relevant stakeholders of health systems, or specifically LTCF-oriented ones, to address this urgent issue. Although SIL is a socially complex issue that requires a multi-sectorial approach, knowledge gathered and synthesized from this exercise may inform the actions of governments, researchers, and frontline LTCF managers."
