  "title": "Impact of male-only lifestyle interventions on men's mental health: A systematic review and meta-analysis",
  "abstract": "Despite rising mental health problems worldwide, engaging men to seek mental health support is challenging. Male-only lifestyle interventions have shown promise for improving men's physical health, but the overall impact of these programs on psychological outcomes is unclear. This review aimed to evaluate the impact of maleonly lifestyle interventions on men's mental health and to identify if any study or intervention features were associated with effectiveness. A systematic literature search with no date restrictions was conducted across four databases and returned 15 946 citations. Nine studies were eligible for inclusion, representing 1427 participants. Risk of bias was generally low across studies, although none were specifically powered to detect changes in mental health. Overall, significant group-by-time effects were reported for 26% of mental health outcomes examined. In the fixedeffects meta-analyses, small-to-medium intervention effects were observed for mental health-related quality of life (SMD = 0.24), self-esteem (SMD = 0.51), and positive affect (SMD = 0.58). Insights into effective study or intervention features were limited because of the low number of heterogeneous studies. Although male-only lifestyle interventions have improved men's mental health in some circumstances, studies that are specifically powered to detect long-term changes are urgently required, particularly in groups with pre-existing mental health concerns.",

      "title": "| INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "Mental health problems such as depression and anxiety are leading contributors to the global burden of disease.  1  In 2010, the global cost of mental disorders was estimated to be $2.5 trillion, with this figure projected to reach $6 trillion by 2030.  2  Having a mental health condition increases the risk of every major chronic disease  3  and can reduce life expectancy by 12 to 15 years.  4 People experiencing mental illness are also twice as likely to be overweight or obese compared with the general population.  5, 6 though increasing rates of mental illness are a concern for both sexes,  7  engaging men to seek help for their mental health is a unique challenge.  8 For instance, traditional masculine norms such as stoicism (ie, not showing emotions or displaying feelings of weakness) and selfreliance (ie, pressure to solve problems without burdening others)  [9] [10] [11]  may discourage help-seeking behaviours.  [12] [13] 3] [14] [15]  Additionally, many men have negative attitudes towards psychological treatments,  12  with psychotherapy or medication previously described as unappealing and antimasculine.  16, 17 As such, men are consistently less likely than women to seek professional mental health support, regardless of age, ethnicity, and social backgrounds.  13 This indicates an increasing need for mental health promotion strategies that are effective in both engaging and assisting men.  18, 19  interest, lifestyle behaviour change interventions have shown promising efficacy to improve mental health outcomes in adults. For example, multiple reviews indicate that physical activity is a highly effective strategy for preventing, treating, and managing mental illnesses including depression  [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25]  and anxiety.  26, 27 Further, emerging evidence has highlighted the important role of dietary behaviours for promoting mental health and improving mood.  [28] [29] 9] [30]  However, most insights in this area have been gained from highly controlled, clinical studies exploring the impact of supervised exercise  31, 32  or prescriptive diets on mental health,  33  with far less known about how to generate sustained improvements in these behaviours in the real world.  34 though lifestyle behaviour change programs may have potential to improve men's mental health, many previous programs have failed to engage men.  [35] [36] 6] [37]  For example, men represent only one in four participants in behavioural weight loss programs  35  and physical activity interventions.  37 Possible explanations for this is that men are reluctant to enrol in behaviour change programs where the majority of participants are women  38  or men are generally less interested in information concerning disease prevention compared with women.  39 ditionally, traditional masculine norms that perceive positive health beliefs and behaviours as a feminine characteristic may also be associated with the very low number of men enroling in health promotion programs.  9, 10 Although men are often reluctant to participate in traditional mental health treatments (eg, therapy and medication),  40  studies have found men will seek help if it is accessible, appropriate, and engaging.  14 This is an important area of future research, particularly with scholars recently suggesting that it may be more fruitful to improve men's mental health indirectly through lifestyle interventions.  19  engage men, researchers are now designing and testing \"gender-tailored\" programs, which specifically account for men's unique preferences and values.  38, 41, 42 These programs have shown promising results for both engaging and assisting men to lose weight and improve their health behaviours.  [43] [44] 4] [45] [46]  However, despite evidence suggesting that weight status and lifestyle behaviours are bidirectionally associated with mental health in men,  47  the overall impact of these programs on men's psychological outcomes has not been evaluated.\n\nTherefore, the aim of this systematic review was to (a) examine current evidence of male-only lifestyle behaviour interventions on men's mental health and (b) identify if any particular intervention components or lifestyle behaviours are associated with improved mental health."

When a study compared multiple intervention groups with a single control (n = 2) group, the sample size of the shared control group was divided to avoid double counting.  49 en required, standard deviations were converted from standard errors or 95% confidence intervals (ICs) according to the procedures outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (section 7.7.3.2).  49  Pooled results were presented as standardized mean difference (SMD) in mental health change scores with 95% ICs. The effect sizes were interpreted as small (0.2), medium (0.5), and large (0.8).  55, 56  Independent analyses were planned for posttest and follow-up results to investigate maintenance of outcomes.\n\nThe second aim of this review was to investigate whether changes in mental health were moderated by key study or intervention characteristics. Although a formal moderator analysis was planned for the meta-analyses, this investigation was precluded because of the low number of studies identified. To provide preliminary insights, studies were grouped by key characteristics (eg, mode of delivery) and the groups were compared for the proportion of significant mental health outcomes identified relative to the number explored in each group. A similar approach has been used in reviews assessing key characteristics in other behaviour change interventions.  57 | RESULTS"

Six studies had weekly face-to-face sessions (range 60-90 minutes), which included lifestyle education seminars and/or physical activity-based training sessions.  [60] [61] [62] 62] [63] [64] 67  The remaining three studies were largely selfdirected,  59, 65, 66  although two trials required participants to attend an introductory information session.  59, 66 With regard to the setting, the three sports-focused interventions used club stadiums,  62, 63, 67  two targeted the workplace,  61, 66  and two required participants to attend a research institution or clinic.  60, 64 Two of the programs were completed individually by participants at home.  59, 65 All studies included posttest assessments and five included an additional follow-up assessment.  [62] [63] [64] 64] [65] 67  However, two of these studies reported follow-up results for the intervention group only.  62, 67 Overall, the follow-up assessments ranged from 6 to 12 months after baseline.\n\nAll included studies were lifestyle behaviour change interventions that explicitly targeted physical activity, diet, or sedentary behaviour for general health and well-being  60  or weight loss.  59, [61] [62] 2] [63] [64] [65] [66] [67]  Eight of the studies tested interventions targeting multiple lifestyle behaviours (eg, physical activity, diet, and/or sedentary behaviour).

Examples of gender tailoring were evident in the setting (eg, sporting venues and male-dominated workplaces), program materials (eg, men's health literature and gender-specific strategies), and methods of communication that men prefer (eg, frank and direct approach and thoughtful use of humour)."

      "title": "| DISCUSSION",
      "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review to investigate the impact of male-only lifestyle interventions on psychological out- This study provided novel evidence that male-only behaviour change programs can improve men's mental health in some circumstances. However, intervention effects on mental health outcomes were mostly small, and the majority were not significantly different from changes in the control groups. This finding was somewhat unexpected, given researchers have suggested that lifestyle behaviour change programs may play a key role in improving men's psychological well-being.  19 However, it is also important to note that the review did not retrieve any studies that (a) targeted men with pre-existing mental health conditions, (b) were powered a priori to detect changes in mental health outcomes, or (c) included substantive mental health support to complement the behaviour change advice. As such, the potential for the interventions to create and detect substantive changes in mental health may have been limited.\n\nGiven the increasing rates of mental health issues in men,  7, 73  the lack of published studies examining the role of behaviour change programs to treat men with current mental health conditions (eg, depression or anxiety) is an important limitation to address in future research. Indeed, observational research suggests that men with mental health concerns often report using lifestyle behaviour change as a way of managing their condition.  18, 19 For example, in a recent study of men with depression, Proudfoot and colleagues reported that exercise and eating healthy were two of the top five prevention strategies men used regularly to deal with their symptoms.  18 Further, behaviour change programs may be particularly appealing for men who align to traditional forms of masculinity, as studies suggest they are less likely to seek help for psychological concerns  15, 74  because of socialized negative beliefs associated with traditional mental health treatments.  75 spite no current evidence existing for male-only lifestyle programs F I G U R E 5 A meta-analysis comparing positive affect changes in male-only lifestyle intervention groups and controls at postintervention\n\nA meta-analysis comparing negative affect changes in male-only lifestyle intervention groups and controls at postintervention to alleviate symptoms associated with mental illness, a recent systematic review highlighted the potential of online lifestyle interventions as treatment to improve physical and mental health in adults experiencing depression.  76  is also notable that no lifestyle behaviour studies with men appear to have included mental health as a primary outcome.\n\nAlthough this may have limited the studies capacity to detect more subtle mental health effects, when these effects were grouped together in the meta-analyses, significant small-to-medium effects were confirmed for mental health-related quality of life (d = 0.24), self-esteem (d = 0.51), and positive affect (d = 0.58). From a health promotion perspective, this could be considered meaningful for improving mental health, particularly with the effectiveness of treatments in psychiatry and medicine for mental health often judged on whether a small intervention effect size is achieved.  77  note, similar findings to this review have been identified in meta-analyses testing exercise interventions on overall quality of life (d = 0.11) and psychological well-being (d = 0.21) in healthy adults, although most included data were collected in highly supervised studies with predominantly female participants.  78 Of interest, all studies in this review that measured self-esteem reported significant weight loss, which is comparable with the consistent improvements in self-esteem that were also described in a review assessing the psychological benefits of weight loss.  79 In contrast, the meta-analysis for negative affect (d = 0.15) did not reach practical significance (d = <0.2). This aligns with a recent meta-analysis that found promising, but smaller effects in nonclinical populations compared with clinical sample groups when measuring the benefits of physical activity on symptoms of anxiety and depression.  80 To accurately capture the effects of these programs on mental health, future studies of lifestyle programs directed at men should focus on mental health as a primary outcome, particularly in prevention trials where mental health improvements may be more subtle.\n\nA common limitation of studies in this review was the duration of follow-up. Most included studies had intervention periods of approximately 3 months, with very few studies conducting follow-up assessments beyond posttest, particularly in the long term. This appears to be common in behaviour change intervention studies, including those that target men.  [44] [45] 5] [46]  Of concern, the positive intervention effect detected for mental health-related quality of life in the posttest meta-analysis was not observed in the meta-analysis of longer-term follow-up data. Although fewer effect sizes were available for the follow-up meta-analysis, this may suggest that positive effects may not persist once the intervention has concluded. This finding is consistent with reviews measuring psychological benefits of weight loss  79  and exercise interventions on quality of life in well populations,  78  suggesting that there is a lack of good quality research evidence about the long-term effects of these programs on mental health. To improve the evidence base, longer-term data are required to demonstrate the true effects of lifestyle modification on men's mental health, particularly as mental health concerns are often chronic and relapsing.  81 is review contained eight studies that tested interventions targeting multiple lifestyle behaviours (eg, physical activity, diet, and/or sedentary behaviour), with weight being the primary outcome in seven articles. Indeed, overweight and obesity are associated with a negative stigma that may impact self-esteem and quality of life.  82, 83 th a reciprocal link existing between obesity and mental illness (eg, depression),  47  it is encouraging that weight loss achieved through lifestyle modification has been found to improve mental health and wellbeing.  79, 84, 85 Specifically, lifestyle behaviour change programs may be particularly effective for men who are overweight and obese in order to manage symptoms associated with depressive  47, 86  and anxiety disorders.  87 Although physical activity and diet have been established as key lifestyle intervention components to improve physical health,  44, 88  it was difficult to determine which health behaviour had the greater effect on mental health as most of included studies targeted these components in combination. Further, it was difficult to detect any moderating factors for several reasons, including many characteristics that could not be explored because they were shared by almost all studies (eg, weight loss as the primary aim). Additionally, the small number of eligible studies and large variation in mental health measures used also limited the findings from this investigation. More research is warranted in this area so that future reviews can explore these factors in greater detail.\n\nTraditionally, men have much lower rates of participation in lifestyle interventions compared with women.  35 This is likely because health behaviour change programs frequently target women, and men may feel uncomfortable participating with females.  38 In this context, it was encouraging to see that seven of the nine studies in this review were specifically gender-tailored to appeal to men. Although it was difficult to identify which gender-tailored strategies were regularly attributed to success, across studies, there was a diverse range of approaches utilized. Promisingly, evidence is growing that gendertailored lifestyle interventions containing positive mental health strategies can engage and assist men,  19, 89  especially for those who may otherwise avoid help seeking.  18 When additional data become available, it would be of interest for future reviews to examine whether gender-targeted interventions for males with existing mental health concerns are more likely to improve men's mental health than genderneutral interventions.\n\nIt is evident that very few studies have integrated mental health support into behaviour change interventions, particularly in men.\n\nAlthough effective treatments (eg, medication and psychotherapy) to improve mental health exist,  90  they become largely irrelevant if men who require help do not come forward to receive it.  91 Given mental health researchers have noted difficulty for engaging men to seek help for their mental health concerns compared with women,  13, 15  a rich opportunity may exist by focusing on physical health,  19  to get men through the \"front door.\"  91 Specific mental health strategies integrated into lifestyle interventions to support men might involve framing messages around mental fitness promotion (eg, building resilience) to reduce stigma,  19  using \"hands-on,\" action-oriented techniques from cognitive behavioural therapy (eg, cognitive restructuring),  91  and considering strengths-based approaches to reframe masculinities (eg, showing courage by putting hand up, instead of not seeking help).  91 Further, eHealth approaches may provide an ideal context to engage men who prefer confidential and autonomous support.  40 spite the limited number of studies retrieved for this review, it was promising that the overall risk of bias across studies was low. This is relatively unusual in the literature, with previous reviews in the field indicating common problems with randomization procedures, retention rates, use of validated measures, and appropriate statistical analyses.  44 In contrast, these items were adequately addressed by at least 80% of studies in the current review. However, the current evidence could be further strengthened with more studies specifically targeting mental health, providing power calculations for mental health outcomes, and including long-term postintervention follow up."

In addition, very high levels of interrater agreement were detected for study selection and risk of bias assessments, and the review aligned with the PRISMA statement for transparent reporting of systematic reviews. Another strength of the study was that it considered RCTs only, which are the highest quality of evidence for establishing causality and minimizing bias.\n\nThere are also some limitations to note, for example, the review only considering articles published in English language journals and excluded studies containing female participants, which may have provided some additional insights if findings were disaggregated based on gender. In addition, the limited number of eligible articles and variation in assessment methods made it difficult to determine which study or intervention components were most important for generating improvements in mental health. Finally, most data in the review were collected over a relatively short time frame."

      "text": "Currently, little research exists regarding the effectiveness of maleonly lifestyle behaviour interventions for improving men's mental health. This is concerning given mental health issues are increasing in men, but many remain reluctant to seek professional help. This review provides novel evidence indicating that male-only lifestyle interventions improve men's mental health in some circumstances. However, where significant improvements were detected, the effects were generally small-to-medium in size. To improve the evidence base, further high-quality studies that are specifically powered to detect long-term mental health changes are required, particularly in high-risk subgroups. These studies will also help illuminate which intervention components or targeted health behaviours are most important to optimize participant outcomes. This is critical, given men are reluctant to participate in traditional mental health treatments and require tailored solutions to prevent and treat mental health concerns."

The review was not limited to participants with pre-existing mental health disorders. Types of intervention: Lifestyle behaviour change interventions that explicitly targeted physical activity, diet, or sedentary behaviour for general health or weight loss purposes were eligible for inclusion. Interventions that included bariatric surgery and medication or that targeted weight, physical activity, diet, or sedentary behaviour for clinical purposes (eg, impact of a supervised exercise regime on depressive symptoms), with no clear intent to create lasting behaviour change, were excluded. Types of outcome measures: Studies were required to include at least one measure of mental health (eg, quality life or self-esteem)"

At posttest, significant group-by-time changes were observed for weight loss favouring the online group (-4.4 kg) and resources group (-3.0 kg) relative to the controls, which were maintained at 6-month follow-up. Significant improvements in physical activity, portion size, hazardous alcohol score, and blood pressure were also noted for men in both intervention arms compared with the control at both time points.

This review aimed to (a) examine current evidence of maleonly lifestyle behaviour interventions on men's mental health and (b) identify if any intervention characteristics or targeted lifestyle behaviours are particularly aligned with improved mental health. Overall, nine eligible RCTs were retrieved, and the risk of bias across the studies was generally low. Despite positive intervention effects detected for weight and other lifestyle behaviours (eg, physical activity and diet), significant intervention effects were only reported for 26% of the mental health outcomes explored. Opportunities to identify which study characteristics or program components were linked to effectiveness were limited due to the small number of heterogeneous studies."
