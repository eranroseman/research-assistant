  "title": "Teledermatology Transformed Through an Automated Previsit Engagement Strategy",
  "abstract": "With an increase in teledermatology, accelerated by the Covid-19 pandemic, leaders at Penn Medicine recognized a need to improve the value of videoconference-based visits by developing an innovative process to simplify the method by which patients can share photos in advance of the visit while automating instructions and reminders for patients to reduce the burden on staff. The process enables patients to submit photos via cell phone text attachments rather than using the traditional patient portal, if they prefer. Initial results show improvements in patient compliance and engagement, photo quality, and teledermatology encounters. KEY TAKEAWAYS \u00bb Simplification enhances access and engagement; less is more. Pared-down educational materials pushed out via low-tech text-based messaging led to increased engagement and compliance. \u00bb Patient choice increases engagementsome patients who were familiar with the patient portal chose to send photos through text messaging, and some patients decided to sign up and engage through the portal for the first time. When presented with options, patients are allowed to weigh which works best for them and be satisfied with their choice.",

      "title": "The Challenge",
      "text": "Prior to the Covid-19 pandemic, Penn Medicine's Dermatology telemedicine footprint was limited. Across seven sites and 70 dermatology providers, our virtual patient engagement consisted primarily of asynchronous, nonreimbursable communications with established patients via our Epic-based patient portal, myPennMedicine (mPM).\n\nIn March 2020, the health care industry was presented with an unprecedented challenge. Almost overnight, our department's physical locations were closed. Our in-person volumes decreased from approximately 2,200 visits per week before Covid-19 to seven visits per week in April 2020. We recognized the need to efficiently and effectively adopt a new practice paradigm to ensure an optimal care experience.\n\nExamination of the skin can be difficult through live video teledermatology, given poor image resolution or connectivity. This necessitates that still photos be obtained from patients and transmitted before a telemedicine visit to augment the physical examination. Initially, our workflow required clinic staff or clinicians to reach each patient manually, notifying them of the photo requirement and providing often lengthy verbal instructions (2-3 hours to prepare for a provider's half-day clinic schedule, a 4-hour block) and written instructions (up to 10 pages long) on how to upload their photos via mPM. Despite these targeted outreach efforts, we had low previsit photo submission rates (46.7%), with many poor-quality photos of patients that were unusable in practice.\n\nThis abrupt shift from in-person to virtual care uncovered a growing digital divide, as well as a need for our patients to have baseline health and technical literacy in order to succeed when engaging in telemedicine.  1, 2 Not everyone had ready access to the tools they need to participate in telemedicine. For example, although 98% of U.S. adults own a cell phone, only 85% own a smartphone; also, only 77% own a desktop or laptop computer, and 53% own a tablet computer. There is demographic variation; for example, 12% of white individuals are reliant on smartphones for Internet access (with no home-based broadband use) compared with 17% of Black individuals and 25% of Hispanic individuals. By income, 27% of those earning less than $30,000 per year rely on smartphones for Internet access, compared with 6% of those earning more than $75,000 per year.  3 me patients lacked in-home Internet or smartphone technology, thus limiting their ability to access Web-and application (app)-based platforms. For patients who rely on phones for connectivity, multimedia messaging service (MMS) allows them to send messages with photos from almost any mobile phone on a cellular network.  4 Text messaging via short message service (SMS) can also be effective for some types of patient engagement.  5 The Heart Safe Motherhood program\n\nat Penn Medicine is an example of a program that has leveraged text messaging. In a study designed to improve the collection of postdischarge blood pressure readings among a high-risk population with a significant amount of severe hypertensive disease, there was greater collection via text messaging of at-home readings compared with traditional office-based follow-ups.  5  deliver uninterrupted patient care, our dermatology practitioners were required to push forward with live video visits despite poor image quality, low prephoto submission rates, and tremendous burden on clinician and staff time. While experiencing these challenges, we recognized that a majority of individuals have phones with cellular data and texting ability and were aware of disparities in access to telemedicine.  6 As such, the Department of Dermatology engaged Penn Medicine's Center for Digital Health (CDH), which leverages nontraditional data sources to disrupt conventional approaches to care, and Way to Health (W2H), a National Institutes of Health-funded evidence-based patient engagement-focused research platform, and together sought to adopt an equitable approach to reimagining the practice of teledermatology.\n\n\" When patients submit photos via text message, the photos can be easily accessed within the patient's EMR, allowing providers to compare photos side by side, zoom in as necessary, and review while completing documentation.\""

      "title": "The Goal",
      "text": "The collection of digitized patient-generated health data (PGHD) conventionally involves secure app-and Web-based platforms. More recently, there has been increased adoption of MMS remote monitoring platforms to collect actionable text and numerical PGHD. However, little is known regarding the acceptability and feasibility of using an MMS-based platform as an adjunctive modality to app-and Web-based patient-generated clinical photo collection. Our team aimed to design and implement an MMS-enabled teledermatology patient engagement strategy to equitably augment patient compliance with previsit photo submission requirements, while ensuring an uncompromising patient experience and reducing low-value processes in clinical and staff workflows.\n\nGiven the pandemic-related limitations, we did not get formal patient input in the development of the new process; however, informal input from patients about the patient portal experience was one of the reasons for the development of this program. We used increased uptake and engagement as a proxy for satisfaction."

      "title": "Initial Process",
      "text": "Initially during the pandemic, our clinic staff spent significant time calling patients before each visit to teach them how to download and activate the mPM patient portal, take photos, and upload them via the portal. At times, our staff were not able to reach patients in advance of a telemedicine appointment, even with repeated attempts. In these cases, during the visit, patients would attempt to show us their dermatologic area of concern by holding it (or a photo of it) up to their video camera, which often produced grainy resolution. Given that this approach was both inefficient (a considerable drain on time and resources) and often ineffective (suboptimal ability to examine the dermatological area), we sought to redesign it by partnering with the CDH and W2H."

This outreach delivers initial welcome messaging, clear stepby-step photo submission instructions 7 days before the date and time of their appointment, and smart reminders leading up to the appointment in the event of noncompliance (Figure  2 ).\n\nThe program is also designed to support photo submission directly via text message or the patient portal, providing simplified instructions, clear example photos, and reminders tailored to the selected method (Figure  3 ). These messages also include targeted reminders to complete other previsit requirements.\n\n\" After launch, we learned about the importance of visibility into how patients submitted their photos (mPM vs. MMS) and the difficulty of having photos housed in two different sections within our EMR.\"\n\nStreamlining the Process for Patient Previsit Image Submission\n\nThe process for patients to provide photos in advance of a dermatology appointment was streamlined by using cellphone texting (five steps) via the short message service (MMS)-based method rather than the 11 steps required to upload images to the patient portal in the traditional method."

If patients submitted their photos through the patient portal, the photos were stored directly within the EMR Media tab. If patients selected text message, the photos were stored within a separate EMR tab for W2H. Despite having compliance and location statuses displayed on Switchboard, these separate storage locations initially led to some confusion for clinicians reviewing the photographs. Given clinician feedback, the team worked with clinical image governance and Information Services groups to successfully streamline this and integrate all photo submissions directly into one location, the Media tab, of the EMR."

      "text": "After the go-live on April 26, 2021, we reviewed all telehealth appointments scheduled in Penn Medicine's Dermatology Department across the health system in November/December 2020 and May/June 2021. These groups constituted our pre-and postintervention cohorts, respectively. For the preintervention group, all 2,713 appointments were queried and manually reviewed in our EMR to determine: (1) if the scheduled appointment occurred; (2) if photos were submitted at least 7 days prior to that appointment; (3) if those photos were locationally identifiable on the body; and (4) if those photos offered multiple views of the same problem area. If a scheduled appointment and its associated photos met all four criteria, we labeled it as optimal. The optimal designation was given only if all four criteria were met. We did not approach these criteria on a scale, but rather, as an all-or-nothing designation.\n\n\" Photo quality also improved; 87% of preintervention submissions were locationally identifiable, and only 32% were labeled as optimal (meeting all four criteria). In the postintervention group, 95% of photo submissions were locationally identifiable, and 53% were labeled as optimal.\"\n\nThe same process was used for the 1,832 postintervention cohort, with the additional step of accessing W2H to review any photos submitted via MMS. We reviewed a total of 4,545 completed appointments within the two 2-month periods. Before implementation, clinician access to patient photos was 47%, and after implementation, it was 78%. (Figure  5 ). Successful patient engagement may have been due to the simplified workflow, ability to upload photos using only a cellular phone, ready access to basic instructions, and text reminders.\n\nPhoto quality also improved; 87% of preintervention submissions were locationally identifiable, and only 32% were labeled as optimal (meeting all four criteria). In the postintervention group, 95% of photo submissions were locationally identifiable, and 53% were labeled as optimal. These increases in quality were driven primarily by the cohort of patients submitting photos via the new MMS system. Our analysis of the postintervention submission modalities showed that 50% of preappointment photos were sent in using MMS; among those, 98% were locationally identifiable and 72% were optimal. Postintervention photos uploaded via the original mPM route also showed increases in quality, albeit less of an increase than the MMS cohort: 91% were locationally identifiable and 34% were optimal (Figure  6 ).\n\nSociodemographic patient reach also improved across groups with potential barriers to engagement. We found increased engagement of Black patients (up 2.68 percentage points, to 24.24% from 21.56%), patients making less than $75,000 annually (up 4.60 percentage points, to 53.00% from 48.40%), and patients receiving Medicaid (up 7.52 percentage points, to 26.8% from 19.28%) when"

See Figure  7 .\n\nThe increase in usage by our Medicaid population and patients with lower income levels is consistent with other studies that have found increased engagement by these groups with text-based applications over patient portals, given they do not require broadband Internet and are often easier to use.  7 The change in the age of the patients may have been multifactorial. The text-based system was highly used by young patients (under 29 years old). In contrast, after the intervention, older patients had started to get Covid-19 vaccinations, and many of them were at high risk for skin cancer or had suspicious lesions that needed to be biopsied. Rather than engaging in teledermatology, they were required to come into the office, and their usage of the system declined."

As a second step, getting the support of departmental and health system leadership allowed us to continue our work and to move this process forward. Offering patients an accessible text-based alternative to traditional app-based health care patient portals promises to equitably increase the overall engagement and quality of patient-generated health data. Penn Preview is now a standard process in our department, as teledermatology continues to be an important care delivery method. Key next steps include exploring further generalizability of the platform to procedural-based specialties and greater data collection and analysis to support the evaluation of the impact of this approach on health care disparities.\n\nAssessment of Photos Before and After Implementation\n\nComparison of the percentage of submissions that were (A) locationally identifiable or optimal (met all four criteria) prior to intervention versus after intervention; and, (B) locationally identifiable or optimal after intervention that were submitted through multimedia messaging service (MMS) versus myPennMedicine (mPM).
