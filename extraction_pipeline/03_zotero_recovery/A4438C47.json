  "title": "Exploring the Tensions of Self-tracking Wearable Technologies Through Design",
  "abstract": "In the last decade, the research interest in self-tracking practices mediated by wearable technologies has risen exponentially. A variety of contributions is focused on examining interaction modalities and user experiences to increase the usability and utility of such systems. However, several scholars are also committed to unveiling the inherent ethical, social and political implications of the self-tracking phenomenon, proposing an alternative perspective. Based on the review of contributions investigating polarities and issues in the landscape of self-tracking technologies, the current work proposes five interrelated tensions at play in the self-tracking domain. The tensions presented are allusion to objectivity and non-neutrality of numbers; trust in data and reliance on subjective experience; reductionism and complexity of lived phenomena; performance and wellbeing; and surveillance and self-surveillance. Rather than researching ways to avoid these tensions, the present contribution discusses the role that design may play in further exploring them. In particular, the paper illustrates studies leveraging speculative and critical design approaches to explore the ethical, political, and social issues of technologically-mediated self-tracking practices, as well as individuals' relations with data, beyond conscious interaction.",

      "title": "1. Introduction",
      "text": "Wearable technologies for self-tracking are attracting increasing research interest due to their widespread adoption, from e-health and workplace to fitness and lifestyle. Wearables will likely become a mega-trend within the next few years  [28] , dominated by smartwatches and activity trackers. According to Statista  [31] , smartwatches are expected to grow from 37 million devices in 2016 to over 253 million units by 2025. In this scenario, understanding the effects of wearable technologies for self-tracking on individuals' everyday life, identities, and behaviours has become critical, requiring attention from Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and digital fashion researchers  [45, 46] .\n\nPrior studies addressing self-tracking practices acknowledge the potential of wearable technologies to offer individuals previously inaccessible information about their bodies, performance and lifestyle, enabling them to leverage the acquired knowledge for self-improvement and self-reflection. However, quantifiedbased representations produced by self-tracking wearable technologies may yield tensions between the subjective experience of the self/body and their objectified representation in the data. Rather than seeking ways to avoid these tensions, the current study argues that they could represent interesting research paths to be explored through design.\n\nThis paper is divided into five sections. Section 4 briefly overviews wearable technologies for self-tracking, illustrating typologies, functioning processes, and data representation modalities. The third section examines research concerning the analysis and implementation of self-tracking devices to serve human empowerment from a utilitarian standpoint. Subsequently, we illustrate contributions investigating the implications at the interplay of individuals, devices, and sociocultural forces beyond utility and usability. In this section, a selection of five tensions emerging from the analysis of the literature is presented. In the fifth section, the principles and features of speculative and critical design are presented and contextualized within the broader discourse of non-solutionist design.\n\nHere, we propose a designerly way of exploring the tensions leveraging speculative, critical design and design fiction. Our conclusions and reflections are drawn in the final section."

      "title": "2. Self-tracking Practices Mediated by Wearable Technologies",
      "text": "The practice of self-tracking is not new. Personal diaries, bullet journaling, and weighing scales have been used for a long time as instruments to keep track of personal life aspects  [57]  for self-care, self-improvement and self-management, as Foucault's \"technologies of the self\"  [18] . In the last decades, sensor-equipped wearable technologies brought selftracking to a new level. By seamlessly detecting body signals and movements, these technologies enable automatic detection, triangulation, and interpretation of data streams offering a detailed picture of individuals' physiological and behavioural status  [36, 40, 64] . Thanks to dedicated sensors, algorithms, and artificial intelligence techniques, these close-to-the-body systems are able to collect sensor records, pre-process and transfer filtered information for analysis through computing paradigms, process data through aggregation, clustering and classification, and compare a large set of users' information to provide a variety of visualizations, insights, and recommendations for the wearers to act upon  [47] . Privileged channels and data representation modalities to convey the resulting knowledge are screen-based quantified data-driven visualizations (numbers, charts and tables, scores, icons, and text) displayed on dedicated apps, web dashboards or directly on the wearable device itself  [5] .\n\nAmong the most popular devices enabling the collection of personal data are smartwatches and activity trackers. Products like AppleWatch, FitBit, and Garmin, allow consumers to measure biometrics (like heart rate and blood oxygen) and monitor movements, activities performance, and location (such as steps, stairs climbed, distance travelled, sports and fitness). Moreover, like many other wearables, they claim to detect stress levels, sleep quality, and daily readiness. According to Statista  [31]  wearable technology will become a megatrend within the following years, as smartwatches are expected to grow from 37 million devices in 2016 to over 253 million units by 2025. The market interest in wearables is also attested by the number of devices populating Vandrico's database  [3] . The platform hosts more than 400 wearables (including headbands, wristbands, smart rings, and foot-worn devices) dedicated to lifestyle, fitness, entertainment, gaming, and medical domains.\n\nThe buzz around wearables and their exponential growth are not only driven by the consumers' interest and curiosity in novel technologies. The premises and drivers contributing to the establishment of technologically-mediated selftracking practices can be retraced to: the context of the current cultural moment of the belief that data are superior forms of knowledge, combined with the affordances of contemporary digital technologies that allow individuals to produce large masses of data about themselves. [35]  These discourses are directly linked with other contextual factors: the pervasiveness of the digital data economy and datafication of human phenomena; the neoliberalist culture of healthism and self-responsibility; individualisation, reinvention and self-entrepreneurship; and the importance of gaining self-knowledge as a way to work upon and improve the self  [11, 35, 39, [63] [64] [65] [66] . The combination of the above reasons is further supported by the establishment of bottom-up worldwide movements and communities like the Quantified Self, a label for a well-established community made of life hackers, data analysts, computer scientists, early adopters, health enthusiasts, productivity gurus, and patients [...] believing in the notion of 'self-knowledge through numbers'  [12]  Finally, the miniaturization of sensor-equipped wearable technologies, the greater accessibility and monitoring capacities of these devices, and their affordable prices are exponentially increasing the democratization and the diffusion of wearable technologies for self-tracking practices to a mainstream audience  [52, 53] . In this scenario, understanding the effects of wearable technologies for selftracking on individuals' everyday life, identities, and behaviours has become critical, requiring attention from HCI and digital fashion researchers  [45, 46] ."

      "title": "3. Self-tracking Research: Towards Data Analysis, Usability, and Utility",
      "text": "Paralleling the diffusion of self-tracking technologies among the broader population, scholarly research has increased, generating a plethora of labels framing different shades of this emerging field of inquiry. Some examples include Quantified Self  [68] , Personal Informatics  [33] , Personal Analytics  [69] ,\n\nLived Informatics  [58] , Self as Database  [60] , Data Double  [59] , and Data-Human Assemblage  [38] . By cross-reading these expressions it is thus possible to grasp the intertwined and dialogic interaction of two worlds. On one hand, terms like quantified, informatics, analytics, data, and database recall the data-driven and rationalistic ground upon which the tracking practice is based. On the other hand, concepts like self, personal, lived, double and assemblage capture the intimate, embodied, and ever-evolving nature of these practices. This twofold dimension is greatly illustrated by Ruckenstein's definition of \"data double\" adapted from Haggerty and Ericson  [23] :\n\nthe conversion of human bodies and minds into data flows that can be figuratively reassembled for the purposes of personal reflection and interaction. [59]  The desire to understand the engagement and interaction modalities individuals establish with self-tracking technologies -such as wearables -led to several empirical research in the HCI domain. According to the literature review by Epstein et al.  [15] , which mapped 253 publications since 2010 in the personal informatics field, the main research effort focused on investigating and designing for health and wellness, behaviour change and self-improvement, primarily relying on examination of users' interaction with commercial trackers, in lieu of the development of novel artifacts. Other research streams include exploring the motivations and reasons for individuals to adopt such technologies  [10, 12, 22, 40] , identifying users' profiles and engagement modes  [24, 36, 50, 54, 58] , illustrating interaction models and stages  [12, 29, 33, 44] , and listing abandonment reasons [6,  13, 47] .\n\nThe majority of the above contributions, especially the ones examining abandonment motivations, provide a vast range of suggestions and design guidelines for HCI researchers and practitioners to improve current devices. Some examples include discovering and aligning the device features with the target users' expectations, supporting self-reflection and data sense-making, and building trustworthy systems for long-term use.\n\nWhile the knowledge disseminated by all the above studies may dramatically contribute to implementing devices' usability and utility, supporting users' decision-making processes, and increasing the technologies' adoption rate, the utilitarian perspective may overlook ethical implications and issues  [15, 32, 56] , emerging beyond conscious interaction."

      "title": "4. Widening the View: Scholarly Debate and Tensions of the Phenomenon",
      "text": "A growing number of scholars from HCI, science and technology studies, philosophy of technology, and critical studies are starting to elaborate on the polarities, paradoxes and implications of the self-tracking phenomenon, beyond a utilitarian view  [11, 39, 56, 61, 64, 65] . These works acknowledge the intrinsic complexity of forces and interplay among the self, wearables and quantified data representations, the stakeholders involved in the technology design, and societal norms and values.\n\nBased on the review of these contributions, the current work proposes five interrelated tensions for HCI and digital fashion designers to reflect upon. The term 'tension' stands for a state of stress between different or opposing forces, arguments, or influences, possibly generating conflicts  [2] . In prior contributions, similar conditions were defined as paradoxes and polarities  [8, 61] .\n\nIn this paper, we use the term tension to refer to more subtle coexisting, at time opposing, conditions taking place at different levels of the interaction. The tensions illustrated below are:\n\n-allusion to objectivity and non-neutrality of data; -data reductionism and complexity of lived phenomena; -trust in data and reliance on subjective experience; -performance and well-being; -surveillance and self-surveillance."

    {
      "title": "4.1. Allusion to Objectivity and Non-neutrality of Data",
      "text": "As previously stated, the mainstream paradigm for displaying personal tracking data in commercial devices is through quantified-based representations (e.g. numbers, tables, graphs, and scores) and data-driven recommendations  [5] .\n\nMany scholars note that this way of framing data representations is firmly grounded in the semantic domain of science and healthcare, implicitly pointing to a straightforward and accurate relation between data and an individual's behavioural and biological states  [8, 25, 43, 65] . In addition, as Hepworth remarks referring to FitBit's user interface and experience:\n\n[t]heir persuasive, apparent objectivity is furthered by the modernistinfluenced functionalist aesthetic commonly found in visualizations [...] to give an aesthetic appearance of objectivity and efficiency. [25]  This is even truer if we consider the widespread mainstream perception of objectivity and fairness surrounding sensors and algorithms. However, the lure of precision, authority, and trustworthiness is often far from the actual self-tracking system's capabilities  [65] . Wearables-based data streams are nothing but neutral and impartial for multiple reasons.\n\nFirstly, besides the significant improvements in micro-electronics and computing processes, accuracy issues may prevent the system from providing a reliable reading of the wearers' activities and biological data. Many researchers demonstrated that commercially viable devices might suffer from precision problems because of the technical limitations of the sensors and/or the algorithms in detecting activities and biosignals, or the misuse of the device from the user's side  [9, 16, 17, 21, 42] .\n\nSecondly, as Baker  [8]  notes, the kind of data and interaction modalities available to the user are mediated by a plethora of stakeholders from the industry. This mediation results from the interplay of interests and biases from business managers, computer scientists, engineers, psychologists, designers, and other professionals which impact on, for instance, the ways in which data and recommendations are delivered to the users.\n\nThe tension here is traceable where virtually inaccurate and biased information are represented using a scientific authoritative semantic, alluding to an implicit inherent reliability and authority of the system."

    {
      "title": "4.2. Data Reductionism and Complexity of Lived Phenomena",
      "text": "The quantification and digitization of human phenomena operated by selftracking devices are critiqued by many scholars because of their reductionist nature  [61, 65] . The trade-off here is between the reductive but accessible, comprehensible and actionable data-driven knowledge and the complex nature of lived experiences, that is to say qualitative, messy, and challenging to measure. The reduction may be played at different levels. Wearable technology companies frequently claim to enable the detection and assessment of wellness, stress, and sleep quality, leveraging bodily data streams and Artificial Intelligence algorithms. In turn, these are rendered through scores, numbers, and recommendations; again, conveyed as quantifiable and monitorable entities.\n\nThis reductive intervention has the potential to displace \"other meaningful and possibly intangible ways of talking about a phenomenon\"  [43]  by amplifying the visibility of specific trackable signals of the body and concealing others, not measurable by sensors and algorithms  [11, 64] . Baker alerts us on the risks of considering the device's readout more inclusive than it actually is, leading to what she calls \"erosion of choice\"  [8] , that is, the limitation of users' actions and choices, and change of behaviours and habits as adaptation to the technology constraints  [39, 65] .\n\nBy conceptualizing ideals of healthiness, fitness, wellness, and good sleep, technology developers and the wearables industry leaders push individuals towards sociocultural stereotypes and normative bodies in line with dominant expectations and paradigms  [64, 65] . Van Den Eede articulates the concept \"fixed entity fallacy\"  [64]  to express the notion that certain phenomena can be set as unchangeable, unambiguous entities (for example, \"sugar\" is \"bad\"; \"exercise\" is \"healthy\"). Lupton  [37] , in the contribution \"Quantified sex: a critical analysis of sexual and reproductive self-tracking using apps\", captures another implication of the reduction that may be operated by self-tracking devices:\n\n[t]hese technologies [...] act to support and reinforce highly reductive and normative ideas of what is 'good sex' and 'good performance' by encouraging users to quantify their sexual experiences and feelings in ever finer detail and to represent these data visually in graphs and tables. The discourses of performance, quantification and normality suggest specific limited types of sexualities. Gender stereotypes are reinforced. [37]"

    {
      "title": "4.3. Trust in Data and Reliance on Subjective Experience",
      "text": "Many scholars documented the multiple shades of the tension between the trust in the objectified data-driven version of the self, and the subjective experience of the phenomenon tracked. The following examples deepen the relations individuals may establish with this \"reductive summary\"  [8]  either by trusting it, disregarding its validity, or negotiating reliance on both data and subjective experience.\n\nThe over-trust in data and measurements can lead individuals to consider the \"objective\" representation provided by the device as more reliable than their subjective experience  [59] . Consequently, this could lead to obsessive tracking, data dependency, and self-fulfilling prophecies  [65] . Rapp and Tirabeni  [54, 55]  observed that the tendency to rely on and trust numbers is stronger in amateur sportspeople than in professional athletes. While the former may blindly follow the data representations prompted by the wearables, the latter seem to operate a calibration between the device's readout and their own bodily feelings, considering both sources of information as important.\n\nOther research depicted situations in which the device counterfeits the user's self-perceptions, unveiling a \"false\" or \"alter\" self  [30, 42] . The misalignment between the two sources may lead to reflection and negotiation strategies to deal with data uncertainty  [4] . On the same line, more committed individuals may establish a dialogic relationship with sensor-based data, recontextualizing quantitative data into \"qualitative narratives\" in order to make sense of and learn something new about their \"selves\", despite commercial devices are not designed for this aim  [51] . The increased self-awareness achieved through engagement with personal data in form of visualizations may lead to a change in self-perception and in the way trackers experience their bodies  [30] . Van den Eede defines this phenomenon as perceiving \"in an embodied manner an objectified version of the self\"  [64] .\n\nThe spectrum of experiences illustrated above serves to highlight the continuum trade-off and tension between the system's representation of data and the subjective experience of the wearer in time and space. Pink et al.  [49]  acknowledge these time-related, context-dependent and situated dimensions using the expression \"broken data\", pointing to the iterative maintenance and repair processes integral to individuals' everyday interactions with data to complement their meaning."

      "title": "4.4. Performance and Wellbeing",
      "text": "By seamlessly measuring and monitoring one's aspects of life and body, wearables make the otherwise extremely time-consuming activity of tracking easier to manage. One of the main reasons why people engage in self-tracking practices is to improve their fitness, health, and overall lifestyle  [12] . In this scenario, individuals may experience tensions between the pleasure of performing an activity with the stress deriving from the pressure to perform. The risks of this attitude are synthesized by Baker  [8]  in the irony of \"well-being versus never being well enough\".\n\nWhile the performance discourse may be familiar within sports and fitness domains, de Boer  [11]  notes how by tracking daily life activities like eating, meditating, making steps and sleeping, these technologies are turning previously transparent actions into performative acts to be measured and optimized. Peculiar examples of this are the meditation and focus-training brain-sensing headband Muse  [1]  and sexual activity trackers  [37]  providing feedback loops, challenges, and rewards to improve the wearer's performance.\n\nAs Whitson  [66]  notes, the framework within which self-tracking practices and data representation designs operate is the one of gamification.\n\nGamification practices, operating under the umbrella of play, foster a quantification of the self; collecting, collating and analyzing minute data and providing feedback on how to better care for one's self. This quantification of the self feeds into neoliberal governance projects that promise to make daily practices more fulfilling and fun. Enabled by increased levels of surveillance (self-monitoring and otherwise), these projects use incentivization and pleasure rather than risk and fear to shape desired behaviours. [66]  In the marathon to achieve ideals of wellness within a quantified reductionist framework, individuals may find themselves optimizing the recorded data (for example \"steps\") in lieu of more fundamental concepts, like \"health\"  [11] .\n\nThe other side of the coin is the diffused practice of cheating to obtain rewards  [65] . The device accuracy issue, in this case, could be exploited by users to represent a fictional but performative self, gaining achievements and reaching goals without actually performing the necessary activities. The Wall Street Journal article and video \"Want to Cheat Your Fitbit? Try a Puppy or a Power Drill\"  [7]  offers an interesting outlook on this practice."

    {
      "title": "4.5. Surveillance and Self-surveillance",
      "text": "In the western culture of healthism and self-entrepreneurship, communities of individuals are called to be responsible for their own health and wellbeing, and invited to voluntarily measure and track aspects of their life, turning their gaze inward  [39] . Whitson  [66]  characterize these digital quantification practices as a \"surveillance apparatus\" since it directly involves data collection in view of a behaviour change and gaining control over one's body and life. In disciplining and improving the self, individuals may contribute to what Lupton calls a \"participatory surveillance\"  [35] . In this scenario, by nudging users to engage in selfsurveillance, sharing personal data on social media and other digital platforms, and involving peers in monitoring activities, self-tracking leads to increasingly more intricate kinds of surveillance that converge the lines between private and public monitoring  [39, 61] . This is particularly relevant considering the increasing diffusion of corporate wellness programs and health insurance packages where employees and clients are invited to wear tracking devices and stimulated through competitions and rewards to perform in the workplace and beyond. As Sharon  [61]  argues: Self-tracking [...], in such accounts, is portrayed as a paradigmatic practice of contemporary surveillance society, as one of the many ubiquitous technologies used to monitor, measure, and record individuals' activities for purposes of disciplining and managing populations via an extension of the medical or \"panoptic\" gaze.\n\nHere a delicate trade-off is at play between the individuals' interest in engaging in self-tracking practices to improve health and fitness, and the interests of third parties, like employers, wearable technology companies, and other stakeholders interested in exploiting personal data for multiple reasons.\n\nIn less subtle and visible power dynamics than \"pushed\" and \"imposed\" self-tracking modes  [39] , the signs of \"neoliberal health regimes and culture of self-surveillance\" [71] are disguised in the design elements and interaction flow of self-tracking devices and apps for private use. The gamification-driven user experience, the promise of empowerment through digital quantification of human phenomena, normativity towards sociocultural stereotypes, and widespread sharing of intimate personal data contribute to making wearable technologies for selftracking extremely complex and multifaceted technologies to investigate. This raises several concerns regarding privacy issues, data ownership, and the use of intimate information by the wearable ecosystem stakeholders (and beyond), that may be overlooked in favour of the perceived comfort and convenience these technologies provide to individuals.\n\nThe tensions presented in the previous subsections enable us to grasp at a glance the complexity pervading the self-tracking practices mediated by wearable technologies, which are far from mere tools at the service of human empowerment. The first temptation for design and HCI practitioners may be to address the tensions by adopting a problem-solving and solution-oriented approach, at least trying to mitigate their negative effects on users.\n\nConversely, this paper argues that these tensions, far from being solvable, could be the starting point for reflecting on where design may play a crucial role. To do so, we turn to alternative design approaches  [48]  found in design and HCI research and practice to delineate current and future research opportunities.\n\nIn the next section, we introduce speculative design, critical design and design fiction as alternative approaches to the affirmative, problem-solving, and consumer-oriented nature of traditional design."

      "title": "5. Addressing the Tensions Through Design: Alternative Design Approaches to Solutionism",
      "text": "Speculative design, critical design and design fiction are approaches where the act of designing artifacts, scenarios, and imaginaries is not directed towards the market, in a production-driven optic. Rather, these future-oriented and criticaloriented design approaches  [70]  aim to raise questions and prompt reflections on the political, ethical, and societal implications of emerging technologies by materializing issues for consideration  [14, 41] . Key levers for alternative designs are inherent ambiguity, ambivalence, and even contradiction of the propositions with respect to contemporary conventions and expectations  [48] . The encounter with these kinds of speculative artifacts and systems produce a variety of 'soft' kinds of knowledge which are: subject to change; highly contextual; asks questions; doesn't provide answers; intends to be rhetorical; aspires towards messy accounts of social situations. The processes by which this knowledge is produced [...] when applied in a Research context, provide a unique (and otherwise hard to attain) way to better understand the world we live in. [34]  The words used by Lindley and Green  [34]  to summarize what speculative design is, contribute to strengthening the value of generating new knowledge and better understanding messiness and complexity we live in, through design.\n\nIn this paper, we argue that these alternative design approaches may serve Research through Design (RtD) inquiries, by materializing the inherent tensions of self-tracking into future-oriented plausible but fictional design artifacts. By building on existing Research through Design (RTD) investigations, we propose different ways through which HCI and digital fashion design researchers can explore the tensions emerging from the self-tracking phenomenon.\n\nThe speculative project \"Quantuition\"  [67]  aims to explore the relationship between personal biometric data and the multiple interpretations we ascribe to it. The designer imagined a future where sensors would be able to seamlessly track every aspect of one's life, and designed a fictional self-tracking system made of nanosensors collecting data from the body, and data physicalizations as edible 3D sculptures. To support the speculation, the researcher visualized the relationship between the wearer and the data via Instagram posts. The picture captions tell the hypothetical tracker's feelings and thoughts on the resulting data sculptures. Some of the data sculptures realised by the designer, made with play-doh, simulate physicalisations of the users' daily laughs and smiles, sun exposure, food supplements in response to dietary data, and activity nudges. Through the project deployment, the author engaged in reflections on how personal data should be represented and interpreted, the benefits and downsides of feedback loops produced by biometric monitoring, and the relationship between individuals and data concerning free will, agency, and control.\n\nAnother design-driven speculation is proposed by Fox et al. in the pictorial \"Vivewell: Speculating Near-Future Menstrual Tracking through Current Data Practices\"  [19] . \"Vivewell\" is conceived as a fictional company presenting a product catalogue of menstrual self-tracking technologies. The products are: Lithe, a sensorized underwear set detecting and communicating the woman's emotional data with the partner; Privvy, a smart office toilet, analysing employers' urine and fecal matters to assess their health status and improve workplace efficiency and productivity; and Vivid, a smart menstrual disc equipped with sensors sharing newly menstruating child's data with parents. The project aims to explore the advantages, and social, economic and legal implications of the widespread collection and sharing of personal intimate data with a variety of stakeholders. Specifically, it aims to spark reflections on ways in which near-future technologies may serve novel forms of intimate surveillance, establish and reinforce power systems, and generate new threats due to pervasive self-tracking data-sharing practices.\n\nOther projects show instead the power of exposing speculative designs to the wider audience as (fictional) commercial products.\n\nIn \"Problematising Upstream Technology through Speculative Design: The Case of Quantified Cats and Dogs\",  [32]  Lawson et al. investigate the public's reaction to near-future monitoring technologies for animals, in line with existing market trends. The team designed and presented three products from the fictional start-up \"The Quantified Pet\" in various focus groups, involving pet owners and animal behaviour experts. These included the smart collar Emoti-Dog revealing the pet's emotional state, the microchip Cat-a-log detecting the animal's movements and spotting its exact location in the garden, and Litterbug, a non-invasive system to track the cat's dietary health and comportments. A focus group revealed, on the one side, a diffuse unconcerned enthusiasm of the pet owners, on the other side, doubts and concerts coming from professionals and experts. The latters, specifically, expressed worries about the risk that technologies could exacerbate existing issues in human-animal relations and generate new tensions in the ecosystem of pet owners, pet clinicians, and residents.\n\nFollowing the same startup-like rhetoric, S\u00f8ndergaard and Hansen  [62]  proposed the speculative fictional project PeriodShare: a sensor-equipped menstruation cup that seamlessly measures and posts menstrual data on social media. The team's intention was to explore the social and cultural facets of menstruation by conjecturing a situation in which data from its tracking would acquire social and economic value. PeriodShare was presented by a fictional start-up team at an entrepreneurial fair. The materials supporting the speculation were a midfidelity prototype characterized by a Do It Yourself aesthetic, a dedicated app, a Kickstarter crowd-funding campaign, and a commercial video. The researchers state that PeriodShare created space for discussions on a taboo topic, stimulating critical questions on the monetization of intimacy through technology and the self-tracking positivist promise of empowering individuals.\n\nIn all the above cases, the designs request the viewers to imagine their potential relation with the technology and data representations. The artifact plays the role of a trigger inviting the person to consider social, political and ethical aspects, rather than introspective ones based on actual data  [67] . Conversely, developing working research prototypes and letting participants interact with their own data may elicit more introspective accounts, eliciting personal vulnerabilities and intimate meanings projected in individuals' data.\n\nHowell et al.  [27]  in \"Tensions of Data-Driven Reflection: A Case Study of Real-Time Emotional Biosensing\" report a user study in which 17 participants were asked to wear for two days Ripple, a sensorized shirt responding to the wearer's skin conductance arousal parameters via colour-changing threads sewn on the garment. The researchers documented their intention to design the system according to ambiguity  [20]  and design for contestability principles  [26] . The aim was to downplay the system's authority, making participants question the device's accuracy and reflect upon the reliability of such devices. The study results raised the author's awareness of unexpected tensions at play in datadriven reflections. Ethical concerns were related to participants not questioning the system's reliability, and users projecting their vulnerabilities onto the displayed data, to fill the gap left by the ambiguity of information.\n\nThe cases presented in this section, far from being exhaustive, offer interesting points for reflection highlighting how design can be a powerful means to make the technologically-mediated self-tracking issues visible and open to debate. By leveraging the designers' skillset and tools, researchers may convey the criticalities of the phenomenon through fictional and working prototypes, also involving people in a variety of ways. New knowledge could be generated from the recipients' interaction with the speculation artifacts, in terms of concerned and unconcerned feedback. The researchers' (self)reflection on the design practice and study deployment may offer additional insights. The reflection may not be limited to the possibility of stimulating debate but may also address the novel issues that the designs raise with respect to the existing tensions initially guiding the design process."

With this contribution, we call for HCI and digital fashion researchers to advance our understanding of the self-tracking implications through design.\n\nAfter briefly presenting some of the current research trends in the HCI field, this contribution gathers and clusters the opinions of scholars from philosophy, science and technology, and critical studies into five intertwined and pervasive tensions crossing the self-tracking phenomenon. The tensions presented are allusion to objectivity and non-neutrality of numbers; trust in data and reliance on subjective experience; reductionism and complexity of lived phenomena; performance and wellbeing; surveillance and self-surveillance. This overview aims to offer at a glance the complexity at the interplay of individuals, wearable technologies, stakeholders involved in the technology design and sociocultural norms and values, emerging beyond deliberate and conscious interaction.\n\nRather than pursuing problem-solving endeavours, digital fashion and HCI practitioners and researchers may develop speculative design interventions intentionally deepening the tensions. In this vein, we suggest looking at alternative approaches to traditional design, like speculative design, critical design, and design fiction within a Research through Design inquiry framework. Designing according to emerging trends and existing tensions may help researchers gain a deeper understanding of the present and future risks of the self-tracking domain, making subtle instances more visible for consideration."
