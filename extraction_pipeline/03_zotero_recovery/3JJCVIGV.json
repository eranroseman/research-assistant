  "title": "Automated Reminders and Physician Notification to Promote Immunosuppression Adherence Among Kidney Transplant Recipients: A Randomized Trial",
  "abstract": "Background: Immunosuppression nonadherence increases the risk for kidney transplant loss after transplantation. Wireless-enabled pill bottles have created the opportunity to monitor medication adherence in real time. Reminders may help patients with poor memory or organization. Provision of adherence data to providers may motivate patients to improve adherence and help providers identify adherence barriers. Study Design: Randomized controlled trial. Setting & Participants: Kidney transplant recipients (n 5 120) at a single center. Intervention: Participants were provided wireless pill bottles to store tacrolimus and record bottle openings. Participants were randomly assigned 1:1:1 to adherence monitoring with customized reminders (including alarms, texts, telephone calls, and/or e-mails), monitoring with customized reminders plus provider notification (every 2 weeks, providers received notification if adherence decreased to ,90% during that period), or wireless pill bottle use alone (control). Outcomes: The main outcome was bottle-measured tacrolimus adherence during the last 90 days of the 180-day trial. A secondary outcome was tacrolimus whole-blood concentrations at routine clinical visits. Measurements: Adherence for the primary outcome was assessed via wireless pill bottle openings. Results: Mean participant age was 50 years; 60% were men, and 40% were black. Mean adherence was 78%, 88%, and 55% in the reminders, reminders-plus-notification, and control arms (P , 0.001 for comparison of each intervention to control). Mean tacrolimus levels were not significantly different between groups. Limitations: The study did not assess clinical end points. Participants and study coordinators were not blinded to intervention arm. Conclusions: Provider notification and customized reminders appear promising in helping patients achieve better medication adherence, but these strategies require evaluation in trials powered to detect differences in clinical outcomes.",

[14] [15] 5] [16]  First, sustaining behaviors such as medication adherence often requires repeated concrete feedback to help the patient stay engaged.  17 Unfortunately, adherence to immunosuppression creates adverse effects, but does not make patients feel better because early rejection does not usually lead to symptoms. Reminders or repeated incentives may be effective in keeping patients focused on the importance of immunosuppression adherence to future health. Second, physicians often overestimate their patients' medication adherence.  [18] [19] ] [20]  Early notification to the health care team about nonadherence might enable providers to overcome patients' concerns about adverse effects or clarify misunderstandings about dosing. Providers can also schedule appointments at shorter intervals, refer patients to specialists such as a pharmacist, or direct patients to social support when financial barriers exist. Third, social forces may influence individual behavior.  [21] [22] 2] [23]  Specifically, patients may desire to avoid disapproval from their physicians related to medication nonadherence. In transplantation, immunosuppression nonadherence can be stigmatized by health care staff and even patients' families because kidney transplant recipients are stewards of a precious gift-the organ.  24, 25 Therefore, real-time monitoring of medication adherence by physicians and other transplantation providers may create a \"social incentive\" for patients to comply with their immunosuppression regimens.  15 ireless technology has created opportunities to estimate pill-taking behavior in real time, supplemented by customizable visual and audible alarms, texts, telephone calls, and e-mails when a dose is due. To our knowledge, real-time provider notification of low adherence using wireless pill bottles has not previously been tested. However, directly observed therapy-either in person or using video-has been widely implemented in tuberculosis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) treatment, with some successful trials, particularly when there is flexibility about who receives the adherence report.  [26] [27] 7] [28]  Additionally, interventions that alert physicians when patients do not refill prescriptions have also been tested.  29 ireless pill bottles also introduce challenges, such as requiring patients to master a new technology and clinical teams to respond to a continuous data stream. However, the transplantation setting usually features a clinical coordinator assigned to each patient who is responsible for helping with many aspects of care. If wireless pill bottles were implemented in the future, these transplantation coordinators could feasibly monitor output from pill bottles and help devise solutions.\n\nWe conducted a randomized controlled trial among new kidney transplant recipients provided with wireless pill bottles to determine whether automated reminders alone or paired with provider notification in cases of low adherence improve tacrolimus adherence compared to adherence monitoring alone. We considered the trial a pilot because of minimal preliminary data about pill bottle2measured adherence in the 6 months posttransplantation. The primary outcome was the percentage of correctly taken tacrolimus doses as estimated by pill-bottle openings. Given evidence of providers' limited ability to detect nonadherence, a secondary aim was to examine the accuracy of pharmacists' predictions of each participant's adherence during the trial."

For each participant receiving reminders (arms 1 and 2), a light on the bottle would illuminate and the cap would chime when the medication was due. Participants could select additional reminders, including texts or telephone calls with recorded messages or e-mails with a weekly adherence summary. Each participant could change their intended times of taking medication and/or reminders.\n\nFor each participant in the reminders-plus-notification group (arm 2), the percentage of pill bottle2measured adherence was calculated every 2 weeks by Way to Health. If adherence decreased to ,90%, the study coordinator would telephone the participant to ascertain whether there was evidence of pill bottle malfunction. The study coordinator would enter a note into the electronic medical record (Item S1, provided as online supplementary material), copied to the participant's transplant nephrologist and the transplantation coordinator, regarding concerns about suboptimal adherence and a summary of the call.\n\nParticipants in the control group (arm 3) received a wireless pill bottle that provided no alerts and only tracked adherence.\n\nThe wireless bottles resembled a standard pill bottle, provided as a kit with (1) a cap that sent a timestamp when it was removed, and (2) a plug-in gateway that transmitted this information via cellular network to the bottle's manufacturer  30  and the Way to Health platform.\n\nWhile traveling, the participant could use the bottle or both the bottle and gateway. If a participant traveled outside a cellular network, the pill bottle could store up to 1 month of data and download data when reconnected to the gateway and a cellular signal."

      "text": "The primary outcome was adherence measured by the pill bottle, calculated for the final 90 days of the intervention period as percentage of days with bottle openings as expected from the intended timing of daily tacrolimus dosing. Adherence was estimated for the first half (2 AM to 2 PM) separately from the second half (2 PM to 2 AM) of the day. The outcome of the final 90 days was selected because adherence is likely to be uniformly high in the immediate weeks after transplantation, when recipients are seen at frequent intervals.  4, 33, 34 dherence data collection ended at transplant failure and death. Secondary outcomes included: (1) pill-bottle-measured adherence between 14 days and the end of the study; (2) the coefficient of variation of tacrolimus blood concentrations (calculated within each participant), drawn as a morning trough level approximately 12 hours after the preceding evening dose, measured by center protocol at routine intervals (twice weekly in the first posttransplantation month, weekly in the second posttransplantation month; biweekly from 3 to 6 months  [35] [36] [37]  ); (3) the coefficient of variation of any morning tacrolimus blood concentration, measured for any indication; and (4) the Basel Assessment of Adherence to Immunosuppressive Medications Scale (BAASIS), a validated 5-item self-reported questionnaire specific to immunosuppression, administered at study end.  38 e performed 3 post hoc analyses. First, we compared pillbottle-measured adherence with censoring of data when participants appeared to permanently discontinue pill bottle use. Blinded to study arm, 2 investigators (J.T.-C. and S.L.) independently assessed the time of pill bottle discontinuation by visually examining adherence figures and tacrolimus levels for each participant; disagreements were resolved by discussion and adjudication with a third investigator (D.L.). Second, we compared adherence in the final 6 weeks. Third, we treated days when participants were hospitalized as fully adherent."

We inflated sample size by 25% to account for dropout, resulting in a total sample size of 120.\n\nWe conducted analyses using SAS (version 9.3, 2011; SAS Institute Inc) with 2-sided P , 0.05 as the criterion for statistical significance. Median values are reported with interquartile ranges. We compared distributions of demographic variables and tacrolimus levels using the F test (analysis of variance, across all 3 arms) or t test (between 2 groups) for continuous variables and Pearson c 2 test or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Kruskal-Wallis test was used to compare differences in self-reported tacrolimus adherence.\n\nWe estimated daily odds of bottle-measured adherence using generalized estimating equation models that produced robust standard errors by assuming an autoregressive correlation structure for repeated measurement (per patient) while adjusting for study arm as a fixed effect.

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "This pilot trial demonstrated the feasibility of integrating wireless pill bottles into the early posttransplantation period and using continuously collected adherence data for real-time interventions. Compared with participants in the control group, pill-bottle2measured adherence was significantly higher among participants randomly assigned to the reminders and reminders-plus-notification groups. However, we did not detect differences in the secondary outcome of tacrolimus level coefficients of variation between arms. These results demonstrate the need for larger multicenter studies with sufficient power to quantify the degree to which adherence interventions may translate into differences in clinical outcomes.\n\nWe found that the combination of automated reminders and provider notification led to consistently high adherence (88% vs 55% for control) during the first 6 months after transplantation, when rejection risk is most elevated. An observational study that relied on medical possession ratio to assess adherence would suggest that the effect size in our trial could improve transplant survival, although our trial was not powered to detect effects on transplant survival.  42 ill-bottle2measured adherence in the reminders and control groups gradually declined during the final 90 days of the trial. Worsening adherence over time in the groups without provider notification is consistent with studies in transplant recipients and other patient groups.  4, 33, 45, 46 Posttransplantation, declining Am J Kidney Dis. 2017;69(3):400-409\n\nadherence over time may be related to less frequent clinical visits, with fewer reminders about the importance of immunosuppression. Notably, reminders with provider notification only appeared to improve adherence versus reminders alone in a post hoc comparison of the final 6 weeks. A potential explanation is that reminders lose efficacy over time (alarm fatigue), whereas the influence of provider notification was more enduring. Given that provider notification alerts took place infrequently, the main mechanism of this intervention may have been social pressure; ie, participants took their tacrolimus (or used wireless pill bottles) more consistently to preclude having their nonadherence detected by providers. However, better adherence in the 2 intervention arms was not reflected in differences in tacrolimus troughs. One potential explanation was that actual tacrolimus adherence was similar across arms and that participants in the control group were simply less adherent using the wireless pill bottles. However, an exploratory analysis with censoring when patients appeared to permanently stop using the wireless pill bottles also demonstrated significantly better adherence in the 2 intervention arms versus the control group. A second possibility is that tacrolimus level coefficients of variation (or standard deviations) do not accurately capture adherence. Some prior studies have demonstrated an association between tacrolimus level coefficient of variation and clinical outcomes such as rejection, although these assessments have important limitations.  35, 47 For instance, the patient must not take the tacrolimus pill until after blood is drawn to get an accurate trough. Some of the highest tacrolimus levels (and variation) in clinical practice probably result from patients erroneously taking their tacrolimus before phlebotomy. Therefore, it is possible that high tacrolimus coefficients of variation succeed in identifying a general limitation in the ability to follow complex instructions, rather than identifying individuals with the greatest problems with daily immunosuppression adherence.\n\nThese results should motivate larger adherence studies in transplantation that pair wireless pill bottles with theory-driven interventions and sufficient statistical power to quantify whether these types of interventions improve clinical and/or immunologic outcomes.  [48] [49] 9] [50]  The cost of these devices is likely to decrease.  30, 51, 52 In the transplantation setting, reminders and provider notification have the advantages of scalability and the ability to customize the intervention to the participant. Because kidney transplantation extends survival and provides better quality of life for lower cost compared to maintenance dialysis, investments in medication adherence after transplantation could plausibly be cost-effective.  53, 54 ne study of Medicare claims for immunosuppression in 15,525 kidney transplant recipients found that persistently low adherence was associated with $12,840 higher 3-year medical costs per recipient versus recipients with high adherence.  42 Recent studies also suggest that a variety of alternative behavior change strategies such as behavioral contracting (in a kidney transplant recipient population), financial incentives (among general internal medicine patients), and reciprocal peer support (among African American veterans with diabetes) could be useful in promoting medication adherence in the organ transplantation setting.  12, 55, 56 In addition to measuring clinical outcomes, investigators designing future transplantation adherence studies should consider innovative measures of immunologic reactivity, including peripheral-blood whole-genome gene expression profiles, donor-specific antibody, and urine messenger RNA and metabolite profiles.  57, 58 e acknowledge our study's limitations. Outcomes were limited to adherence measurements, all of which have shortcomings. The pill bottles measure only openings, not actual pill ingestion. The bottles cannot distinguish between opening the cap for resupplying the bottle with tacrolimus versus opening for taking tacrolimus. The study did not limit enrollment to patients with a high probability of having adherence challenges. Although the principal investigator, pharmacist, and statistical analysts were blinded to study arm, the study coordinators were not. Another limitation is that compared with the reminders group and control group, study coordinators had more contact with participants in the reminders-plusnotification arm, prompted by low-adherence events. This increased contact, rather than provider notification, might have explained the higher adherence in that arm. Additionally, this study focused on only tacrolimus adherence, although kidney transplant recipients often take 10 or more medications.  59 We chose to focus on tacrolimus adherence because tacrolimus is the most effective maintenance immunosuppressant in kidney transplantation; better adherence could plausibly improve transplantation outcomes.\n\nIn summary, this pilot trial demonstrated the feasibility of implementing wireless pill bottles into the care of kidney transplant recipients. The strategies of adherence monitoring with customized reminders and customized reminders with provider notification led to improved tacrolimus adherence versus control as estimated by the wireless pill bottle, although tacrolimus levels were similar across trial arms. Transplantation pharmacists were able to successfully identify participants at high risk for poor medication adherence.
