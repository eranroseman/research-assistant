  "abstract": "Objective: To evaluate in patients who deteriorate and require transfer to the intensive care unit (ICU), how many have a critical text message communicating deterioration and what is the quality of this message? Is message quality, message response or the timeliness of rapid response team (RRT) activation related to death? Methods: We conducted a retrospective chart review of all ICU transfers from General Internal Medicine (GIM) wards from January 2012 until August 2014. All critical messages (CM) in the 48 h prior to ICU transfer were analyzed for RRT calling criteria, time to RRT activation, message quality, presence of vitals, and the quality and timeliness of physician response. Results: Of the 236 patients in the study, 93 (39%) had a CM in the 48 h prior to ICU transfer. Within this subset, 76 patients did not have prior RRT activation and the median times from CM to RRT activation and CM to ICU transfer were 8.9 [IQR 2.9, 20.7] and 15.6 [IQR 9.0, 28.7] hours, respectively. Only 45% of messages contained 2 or more vitals and only 3% of messages contained Situation, Background, Assessment, and Recommendations (SBAR). Physician response was timely (3 [IQR 2, 17] min) but response quality was poor; nearly one quarter of responses only acknowledged receipt. Among message characteristics, only the number of SBAR elements was correlated with in-hospital survival (p = 0.047). Conclusion: Communication between nurses and physicians about critically ill patients could be improved. There appear to be significant gaps in the quality of messages, their responses, and delays in RRT activation.",

      "title": "1.. Introduction",
      "text": "One of the main reasons patients are admitted to hospital is that they are significantly unwell and need the monitoring and therapy best provided in an acute care facility. Monitoring patients at risk of deteriorating is important, and there has been increased recognition of the importance of acting on deteriorating patients and escalating their care using rapid response teams (RRT)  [1] . RRTs assess hospital-ward patients at an earlier stage of clinical deterioration with the aim of preventing serious adverse events such as cardiac arrests and unexpected deaths  [2] . Criteria for RRT activation include abnormal vital signs as well as \"patient at risk\" indicators, which are reliable in detecting patient deterioration six to eight hours prior to an adverse event  [3] [4] [5] [6] .\n\nTo ensure the appropriate escalation of care in deteriorating patients, there are recommendations that nurses need to frequently record all vital signs; to recognize deterioration and the urgency of a situation; to summon the assistance of more senior physicians without delay; to communicate concerns clearly, sensibly and with confidence; and to give a deadline for a response to a call. These actions help to avoid the two usual barriers to escalation: 1) failure to recognize patient deterioration and 2) failure to communicate to a more senior colleague. Communication frameworks such as SBAR (Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendation) are recommended between nurses and physicians to improve the quality of communication and increase situational awareness  [7] . These have been found to improve communication and reduce unexpected deaths  [8] .\n\nUnfortunately, little is known about the actual communication that occurs between nurses notifying physicians about deteriorating patients. While tools such as SBAR are recommended, urgent communication from nurses to physicians still often occurs through paging with a telephone call back, making analysis of communication difficult  [9, 10] . However, at some hospitals, communication is occurring by text messaging from nurses to physicians. This move from an unrecorded verbal message to text allows for analysis of these critical messages. Since 2011, we have used secure electronic text messages (Clinical Message system) between nurses and physicians on General Internal Medicine (GIM) wards at University Health Network. An analysis of these messages in patients who deteriorate may help identify issues with communication and provide feedback on escalating care of deteriorating patients to clinical staff for quality improvement purposes.\n\nIn this study of patients who deteriorated on the General Medicine Wards and required transfer to the intensive care unit, our aims were to determine (1) How many had critical messages prior to transfer and what was the quality of these messages? (2) Was the quality of the message, the quality of the response or the timeliness of rapid response team activation related to death?\n\nTo our knowledge, this is the first study of text messages sent between nurses and physicians in deteriorating patients."

      "text": "At the time of the study, there were 76 inpatient GIM beds at Toronto General Hospital (TGH). Since 2005, there has been an RRT which responds to calling criteria of vital signs, abnormal level of consciousness or serious concern about a patient. The RRT accepts calls from nurses and physicians. On GIM wards, most urgent communication between nurses and physicians occurs electronically using the Clinical Message system  [11] . In brief, nurses log into the system, select the patient and then compose a text message that includes a subject, details, desired response (call back, text message or no response required) and urgency of message (immediate or allowing some time to respond). The physician caring for that patient receives a notification on their smartphone and is able to view the message and respond directly. All messages are recorded in a database and can be retrieved for review. For patients requiring transfer to ICU, there were no strict formal admission criteria at our institution but patients were transferred when their care requirements could not be met on a medical ward. The study was approved by the Research Ethics Board at University Health Network."

Note, for each admission, only the first ICU transfer was considered. For each patient, we obtained messages sent in the 48 h period before ICU transfer occurred. For each message, information included, date/time of message sent, urgency and type of response requested (call back as soon as possible, text message as soon as possible, text within specified period, no response requested), message content and date/time of message response.\n\nThe content of messages was coded by two investigators (RCW and SL) and disagreements between coders were resolved by consensus. Messages were analyzed to determine if they met the above definition for CM by the same two investigators. Only the first CM was considered for each patient for analysis. CM content was then analyzed to determine the quality of communication, specifically whether at least two vital signs were included and which of the Situation, Background, Assessment, Recommendations (SBAR) components were contained in the message. Physician responses to CM were also analyzed to determine if they contained an indication to call back, a statement to assess, an order or action, an acknowledgement, or no response."

For this subset of patients, we summarized CM characteristics and their responses. We also examined whether there was an association between various message characteristics and in-hospital death using Pearson chi-square/Fisher exact test. We analyzed eight message characteristics: (1) time from CM to ICU transfer, (2) reason for CM (altered mental status, desaturation, heart rate \u2265 130, respiratory distress, systolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg, worried about patient), (3) requested response to CM (call ASAP, text ASAP, text within specified period, FYI-no reply needed), (  4 ) physician response to CM (called back, assessed, order placed, acknowledged, no response), (  5 ) time from CM to physician response, (6) time from CM to RRT activation (if activated), (  7 ) SBAR elements and (8) vital signs. All analyses were 2-sided and a p value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. We used SPSS version 23.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA)."

We excluded 1 patient in which there was no scanned record of the patient's hospital stay available. Characteristics of the remaining 236 patients are summarized in Table  1 . The majority of patients (160 patients or 67.8%) belonged to the sub-population who either did not have a CM in the 48 h prior to ICU transfer or already had RRT activation prior to a CM. The remaining 76 patients (32.2%)characterized as the subpopulation with potential for improvementhad a CM followed by, or without, RRT activation. Nearly half (47.5%) of all patients, independent of CM, died in hospital. RRT was activated in 186 patients (78.8%) while code blue was called for 9.3% of patients. In 27.5% of patients, sepsis was the GIM admission diagnosis and patients commonly had diabetes (20.3%), leukemia/lymphoma/myeloma (17.8%) or chronic heart failure (14.0%). The most prevalent reason (30.1%) for transfer to ICU was desaturation."

      "title": "3.2.. Patients with delayed rapid response team activation",
      "text": "In the sub-population of 76 patients who did not have RRT activation prior to the first identified CM, 13 patients (17%) did not have any RRT activation prior to ICU transfer while 63 patients (83%) had delayed RRT activation (RRT activation after CM). The CM and response characteristics of this sub-population are summarized in Table  3 . The most frequent reason for sending a CM was desaturation (32%), 45% of messages included at least 2 vital signs and only 3% of messages included all four SBAR components. In nearly half (47%) of CMs, no physician reply was requested from the nurse. Nonetheless, 82% of CMs were responded to, with a median response time of 3 [IQR 2, 17] minutes. The remaining 18% of CMs without physician response all consisted of messages where the nurse did not request a response. The most frequent physician responses were an indication that they would assess the patient shortly (45%) and acknowledgement of the message (24%). For patients with delayed RRT activation, the median time from CM to RRT activation was 8.9 [IQR 2.9, 20.7] hours; the median time from CM to ICU transfer was 15.6 [IQR 9.0, 28.7] hours.\n\nFor the subset of 63 patients that had delayed RRT activation, the only significant correlation with in-hospital survival was the number of SBAR components in the CM (Table  4 ). In-hospital death was not correlated with the reason for, or time to ICU transfer, a delay in RRT activation, presence/absence of vital signs in the CM, response requested by the nurse, or the quality or timeliness of the MD response."

      "title": "4.. Discussion",
      "text": "In the present study, we investigated the role of text messaging as a means of urgent communication between nurses and physicians for patients admitted to General Internal Medicine prior to deterioration and ICU admission. Text messaging was used in 40% of patients to relay critical information about patient deterioration. There was a median delay of 9 h from critical message to RRT activation in patients where RRT was activated after a critical message was sent. Message quality, specifically, the number of vital signs and SBAR elements, was poor. Physicians responded to critical messages in a timely manner but response quality was poor with nearly a quarter of responses only acknowledging receipt. Message quality as defined by the number of SBAR elements was positively correlated with in-hospital survival.\n\nPoor communication has been cited as an explanation for failure to activate RRT  [12] . Our study adds to the literature by providing a picture of actual communication prior to deterioration. The poor message quality we observed in this study is similar to the documentation and communication issues observed in other studies of deteriorating patients. Chen et al. reported that prior to introducing a medical emergency team (MET) system (also known as RRT), nearly 77% of patients suffering adverse events had at least one vital sign missing immediately before the event  [13] . De Meester et al. reported that prior to an SBAR educational intervention only 4% of serious adverse events had all 4 SBAR elements documented in the patient records  [8] . More broadly, failures in communication (written and verbal) have been frequently cited, and widely recognized by patients, as contributing to patient safety incidents in numerous hospital processes including medication administration and discharge planning  [14] [15] [16] . At the same time, there is growing evidence to suggest that use of organized, standardized tools and communication frameworks like SBAR improves nurse and physician communication skills  [17] . Indeed, a recent study  found that integrating SBAR with the electronic medical record decreased time to clinician notification and frequency of notes  [18] . Use of SBAR may also reduce nurse time spent documenting shift reports and conducting interdisciplinary rounds by enabling more focused communication;  [19]  it may also help nurses in schema development that allows rapid decision making  [20] . As communication systems between providers and with patients become more technologically advanced, there is an increasing need to show the effects of communication technology on patient safety, outcomes and experience  [21, 22] . We found an association between the number of SBAR elements reported in the critical message and in-hospital death. This result confirms previous findings  [8]  that increasing the use of SBAR could improve patient outcomes. In an ideal state, the nurse would provide more context, an assessment that included vital signs and recommendations, and an insistence of an urgent reply from the physician. Ideally, the physician would not just acknowledge a message but would respond promptly and indicate their plan. By responding with their understanding of the situation, this would let the nurse know whether their situational awareness was congruent.\n\nOur results are also consistent with literature that report frequent and lengthy delays in RRT activation. Downey et al. found that delayed MET activation occurred in 35% of patients with an acute change in conscious state and in 24% of arrhythmia patients with a median delay of 16 and 13 h, respectively  [23] . In a large retrospective study of all RRT activations in 2012,  Barwise et al.  found that 57% of all RRT activations had more than 1 h pass between the first appearance in the record of an abnormal vital sign meeting RRT criteria and RRT activation  [24] . The above studies found that delays in RRT activation were independently associated with increased risk of in-hospital death. While we did not find a similar association, key methodological differences (chart review of abnormal vital signs and use of lower threshold values for definition of delay) and patient populations between our study and the Downey and Barwise studies may account for these differences.\n\nImproving communication of deteriorating patients could occur through education and organizational interventions. Education and feedback to nurses on the importance of using SBAR and providing vital signs could improve the situational awareness provided to physicians. Education and feedback to physicians about the appropriate response to critical messages may also reduce the delay in escalation of care. System level improvements could include communication systems that ensure closed loop communication. Communication tools could also suggest or enforce the use of SBAR in communication of deteriorating patients. Decision support could also highlight the option for RRT activation. Finally, increased use of secure text messaging and associated analysis of message content can be a powerful tool for identifying gaps in communication as well as providing feedback to clinicians. Advanced smart systems that incorporate both vital signs and electronic communication as well as predictive analytics could intelligently alert providers about patients who are likely to deteriorate and who may require escalation of care including the activation of rapid response teams. For example, the EarlySense monitoring system has trend-tracking abilities that alert clinicians to vital sign trends, rather than just threshold parameters, which may increase its predictive ability to detect deterioration  [25] . Additionally, recent predictive modeling studies of cardiac arrest and ICU transfer based on vital sign, demographic, location and laboratory data extracted from the electronic medical record show promise in providing more real-time accurate predictions of clinical decline  [26, 27] .\n\nOur research into communication at onset of patient deterioration contains limitations. We only studied communication for patients whose deterioration led to ICU transfer. No communication between nurses and physicians about deteriorating patients in whom RRT was activated but did not lead to ICU transfer were included. This limited our ability to compare our results to communication for patients whose health improved on the ward. Another limitation of this study is that communication between nurses and physicians about deteriorating patients was characterized solely via text message analysis. We had no information on the nature of information contained in phone calls or face-to-face communication. Therefore, it is likely that some messages did not accurately represent the full nature and extent of conversations between healthcare professions with respect to a deteriorating patient. Furthermore, the use of text messages may be associated with lower RRT activation rates, as it is difficult to convey urgency or concern using a text message. There are limitations in the amount of emotion that can be conveyed through text messages and the way in which a text message is interpreted may vary depending on the recipient of the message. As technology use in healthcare systems increase in popularity, the amount of messaging within healthcare teams will increase. Therefore, it is important to design and develop a system in which urgency or concern is easily identifiable and can elicit the appropriate response by the recipient."
