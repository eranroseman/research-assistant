The fundamental difference between them is that PMA produced only one estimate of pooling effects from the selected pair of interventions, while the NMA produced multiple comparative estimates of pooling effects by connecting all alternative interventions  16  .\n\nWe incorporated direct and indirect treatment comparisons within the NMA providing greater statistical precision compared to a PMA. Rankings of a set of drugs or combined interventions for assessing chronic pain with respect to their efficacy was calculated based on the network models. Homogeneity and Consistency were tested to see if the assumptions in NMA were violated. The overall pharmaceutical efficacy of extracted studies was produced by pooling all treatment effects. PMA was also used on studies with the same drug as the treatment group to see the specific drug efficacy.\n\nI 2 and p-value were commonly used to detect statistical heterogeneity. A value of I 2 larger than 50% with a much smaller p-value indicates strong heterogeneity. Correspondingly, I 2 less than 50% with a large p-value indicates fairly weak heterogeneity  17  . A random effects model was chosen when there was high heterogeneity, whereas a fixed effects model was used if weak or no heterogeneity was detected  18  . Due to the presence of high heterogeneity, subgroup analyses were carried out to identify the sources. To assess the robustness of the pooled results within the PMA, a sensitivity analysis was completed. Publication bias was evaluated with funnel plots and Egger tests.

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "We identified opioids and non-opioids were the two primary classes of pharmacological interventions in chronic pain management. Opioids are widely used in the management of cancer pain and non-cancer associated pain  20, 21  . The long-term use of opioids in the management of chronic non-malignant pain has come under scrutiny more recently and is now recommended only if benefits of initiating treatment would significantly outweigh the potential risks, and possibly as an adjunct to the primary intervention  22, 23  . Our study has shown that judicious use of non-opioid medications along with other treatment modalities could provide better outcomes in managing chronic pain thereby removing long-term side-effects observed during opioid therapy. With cancer patients increasingly being cured or achieving long term remission, prolonged use of opioids could result in aberrant behaviour and dependence. Awareness of an opioid crisis globally has prompted clinicians to exercise caution in their prescription habits, but the WHO supports the use of opioids including Fentanyl and Methadone as an essential class of medication for the management of cancer pain  24, 25  .\n\nThe meta-analysis of baseline pain scores lacked statistical significance between experimental and control groups. The significant reduction in chronic pain scores of patients taking NSAID versus non-steroidal opioid drugs compared to patients given placebo under a random effects model. The presence of a significant drug efficiency with BTX-A and Ketamine is interesting although the pooled results of other drugs and interventions had statistically insignificant results with a 95% CI of 0. The pooled evidence indicated Ketamine showed the highest pain reduction (1.26) followed by BTX-A (0.98). Studies testing on other drugs including Amitriptyline, Gabapentin, Morphine and Lidocaine had a high heterogeneity and insignificant drug efficiency. Overall, evidence from the PMA showed a strong efficacy within the NSAIDs group with managing pain which were remarkably narrowed when exclusive trials with low risk of bias were included  [26] [27] [28]  . In this study, a pairwise meta-analysis and NMA consolidating the evidence of 46 studies was carried out, with the former comparing several different opioids. Morphine has traditionally been used for the management of moderate to severe chronic pain  29  . Despite morphine being a potent analgesic [MD 0.01 (95% CI [-1.18, 1.21], newer opioids are now being employed owing to their superior safety profile. Oxycodone and Fentanyl appear to be popular due to better availability and vast clinical experience including the well accepted effectiveness demonstrated, as per patient and clinically reported outcomes. Our results are aligned to these trends where the effectiveness is shown to include a MD 1.77 (95% CI [-2.11, -1.43]) for Oxycodone and a MD of -0.90 (95% CI [-2.03, 0.23])] for Fentanyl (32). However, untoward gastrointestinal effects (constipation, nausea, and vomiting) still remain a major concern with opioid use and are often responsible for discontinuation of treatment  30, 31  . Recent evidence favours the use of a combination of oxycodone and naloxone in patients with chronic pain (after ensuring that there is no cause for porto-systemic anastomosis), to offer an improved bowel function without any effective change in analgesia  32  . The concerns of developing tolerance, opioid-induced hyperalgesia, aberrant behaviour and dependence with opioids is a pragmatic reason to develop effective alternative treatment modalities especially for vulnerable individuals. In pairwise comparison, we observed Ketamine to be superior to other pharmacological interventions with a mean difference MD -1.26 (95% CI [-1.85, -0.68]).\n\nThere are several guidelines recommending the use of Pregabalin, Gabapentin, Duloxetine, and Amitriptyline as first line drugs in the management of neuropathic pain  [33] [34] [35]  . However, the use of gabapentinoids is being challenged as it lacks favourable robust evidence for efficacy against pain syndromes other than fibromyalgia, post herpetic neuralgia and diabetic neuropathy, and many clinicians have also highlighted the potential for misuse and developing dependence  [36] [37] [38]  . The use of BTX-A, Ketamine, Ningmitai and THC for the management of various chronic pain conditions is popular and well established  [39] [40] [41] [42] [43]  and our study shows the effective use of these as analgesics when compared to placebo. There is evidence to support the efficacy of BTX-A for the management of neuropathic pain although the sample sizes used in the studies were small and therefore the real-world applicability remains limited  29  . BTX-A is also used in management of myofascial pains  44, 45  although further evidence on the efficacy and tolerability within all populations, especially those with existing co-morbidities needs to be evaluated. Ketamine was found to be beneficial in managing some neuropathic pains  46  and as an infusion the rates of serious adverse effects were found to be similar to placebo  47, 48  . Further studies are required to gather evidence to better understand its psychedelic effects and its role in the management of PTSD, anxiety and depression. A renewed use of magnesium in managing chronic pain has been demonstrated in some literature  49  . Our results indicate similar evidence in the use of magnesium, but will require further research to determine the efficacy, safety and effectiveness in managing short, medium and long-term pain.\n\nThe NMA provided more reliable results with direct and indirect comparisons between different drugs under different study designs. However, only a small number of multi-arm trials were eligible and the distribution of trials studying different drugs was uneven. It resulted in the lack of direct evidence of certain drugs and their relative efficacy in the network was unstable due to excessive reliance on indirect comparisons. Therefore, well designed and robust clinical trials should be conducted to verify the efficacy of pharmaceutical interventions used in chronic pain management."

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is the first pairwise MA and NMA reporting the synthesis of the prevalence of the efficacy of pharmacological treatments used in the management of chronic pain with a large sample size of 17,708 participants. Management of long-term chronic pain needs to be prioritised for several reasons including humanitarian, the strain on the healthcare systems and the impact on the economy due to loss of productivity. The use of pharmaceutical agents in the long-term management of chronic pain has been debated for several decades, yet there has not been a consensus on this matter. This study supports the importance of generating better evidence by way of robust clinical trials, the need for drafting clinical guidelines that is pragmatic, practical as well as clinically significant and the use of better data-connectivity methods to improve clinical practice in the real-world.\n\nStudy number Author Intervention abbreviation Intervention details Weizman et al.
