  "title": "Uptake and attrition in couple-based interventions for cancer: perspectives from the literature",
  "abstract": "Objective: Recognition that patients and partners are both affected by a cancer diagnosis has led to increased interest in couple-based interventions. Although these interventions show promise for enhancing both patients' and partners' illness adjustment, couples' acceptance of these interventions is not well documented. This review explores these issues as reflected in uptake and attrition rates in published trials. Methods: A literature search identified 17 manuscripts reporting the uptake and attrition rates of couple-based interventions for couples facing cancer. The uptake (percentage of eligible couples randomised into a trial) and the attrition (percentage of couples who dropped out of a trial) rates were extracted by cancer type, cancer stage, intervention type, intervention focus and intervention delivery method. Results: Uptake and attrition rates ranged from 13.6% to 94.2% and 0% to 49.4%, respectively. Low uptake rates were noted for communication-focused interventions and those requiring both the patient and the partner to participate in the intervention simultaneously. Attrition was also high in the latter group. Uptake rates appeared slightly lower than individual-based interventions (58%-76%), as were attrition rates, although only for late stage cancer (~30% couple-based vs. ~69% individual-based). Common barriers to uptake included accessibility, competing priorities and illness severity. Conclusions: The couple-based interventions had slightly lower uptake rates than what has been previously reported for individual-based interventions; however, lower attrition suggests patients and partners may be more inclined to complete an intervention when they participate together. The findings support the need to develop strategies to improve the delivery and acceptability of couplebased interventions in clinical practice.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "In recent years it has become increasingly recognised that how patients and partners 1 cope with a cancer diagnosis influences how well they adjust to the illness, and that patients' and partners' responses to cancer tend to be heavily entwined  [1] [2] [3] . Consequently, clinicians and researchers have begun to explore more closely the efficacy of couple-based interventions and the role of these in providing couples with the necessary support to deal with cancer  [4] [5] [6] [7] . Several reviews  [8] [9] [10]  and a meta-analysis  [11]  have been published recently supporting the efficacy of couple-based interventions in reducing anxiety and depression and improving quality of life. Despite the promise of couple-based interventions, there has been little exploration of the factors associated with the uptake and attrition of couple-based interventions. Among individual-based interventions, the uptake rate for patients with early stage cancer has been reported at approximately 76%  [12, 13] , and attrition rate has been reported to be as high as 54%  [14] . For patients with advanced cancer, uptake rates ranging from 4% to 62% and attrition rates of up to 66% have also been reported  [15] . For partners, uptake of psychosocial interventions ranges between 31%  [16]  and 76%  [17]  and attrition rates between 19.5%  [18]  and 69%  [19] . This review set out to identify some of the influential factors that may be unique to couplebased interventions.\n\nIn their review of couple-based interventions, Baik and Adams  [8]  suggested that there was no systematic pattern of intervention refusal or attrition based on the demographic or baseline measures. Badr and Krebs  [11]  and Regan et al.  [9]  further highlighted the paucity of detail regarding uptake and attrition rates reported in existing couple-based interventions and suggested that to improve the applicability of couple-based interventions, there needs to be a better understanding of how these interventions have been designed and delivered to couples, and whether intervention designs and/or delivery modes influences couples' participation. A closer examination of whether there are patterns in uptake and attrition rates according to factors such as cancer type and stage, intervention focus and type and delivery method will provide some insight into why couples do or do not engage with interventions and what may influence their continued participation and ultimately the efficacy of these interventions. This may assist the future design and implementation of couple-based interventions among psycho-oncology researchers and clinicians."

      "title": "Data extraction and analysis",
      "text": "As uptake and attrition rates were not systematically reported across manuscripts reviewed, all rates were manually calculated on the basis of raw data provided on the number of participants referred to the study, eligible and withdrawn. Complete data to calculate the uptake and attrition rates were available for 17 of the 23 studies identified in the Regan et al.  [9]  review (see Tables  1  and  2  for each studies' uptake rate, attrition rate and other study details). Attempts to obtain missing data from the authors of the remaining six studies were unsuccessful. Uptake of an intervention was defined as the percentage of eligible participants (i.e. the number of participants that were referred to the study and met the study inclusion criteria) randomised into the intervention trial. Attrition rates, defined as the percentage of randomised participants that dropped out of an intervention, were calculated for the first and final follow-ups. Three studies  [4, 20, 21]  used a pre-post design, and therefore, their rates were included at the first follow-up point only. Uptake and attrition rates are reported by cancer type and stage, and intervention type, focus and mode of delivery. For cancer type, seven studies  [5, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26]  were conducted with couples facing breast cancer, five with couples facing prostate cancer  [20, [27] [28] [29] [30]  and five with other diagnoses (four studies with mixed diagnoses and one with gastrointestinal cancer)  [4, 21, [31] [32] [33] . For cancer stage, eight studies were conducted with patients with early stage cancer (i.e. stages 1-2)  [5, [22] [23] [24] [27] [28] [29] [30]  and nine studies with patients with late stage cancer (i.e. stages 3-4)  [4, 7, 20, 21, 25, 26, [31] [32] [33] . For intervention focus (i.e. the primary focus of the therapeutic principles applied), eight studies focused on improving communication within couples  [4, 5, 7, 21, 22, 25, 27, 30] , seven studies focused on developing specific skills to enhance coping ability (e.g. mutual relaxation techniques)  [20, 24, 26, 29, [31] [32] [33]  and two studies focused on educating patients and partners on cancer care (e.g. symptom management)  [23, 28] . These categories were determined by reviewing the descriptions of intervention content provided in each study and discussion among authors. For intervention type, 11 interventions were dyadic (patient and partner engage in all components of the intervention equally and simultaneously)  [4, 5, 7, 20, 21, 24, 26, [29] [30] [31] 33] , three were coaching interventions (partner takes on a 'coaching' role, assists patient application of newly learnt strategies)  [25, 28, 32]  and three were individual-based interventions\n\n2640 T. Regan et al.\n\n(patients and partner receive the same intervention separately)  [22, 23, 27] . For intervention delivery, rates were compared across 13 interventions delivered faceto-face  [4, 5, 7, 21, [24] [25] [26] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33]  and four delivered by phone  [20, 22, 23, 27] ."

It is important to note that the uptake rate for breast cancer and the uptake rate for early stage cancer may have been influenced by two studies with particularly low uptake rates, Kayser et al.

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "The aim of this review was to describe the patterns of uptake and attrition in couple-based interventions by cancer type and stage, and intervention type, focus and delivery. The authors acknowledge that presenting proportions across multiple categories (e.g. cancer type and cancer stage) may limit generalizability of the findings.\n\nAlthough this review was not able to conclude the statistical significance of comparisons of uptake and attrition rates across disease or intervention groups, some observations are noteworthy. First, when accounting for outliers  [5, 24] , the uptake rate among couples facing breast cancer appeared similar to those facing prostate cancer, which is somewhat surprising, given the evidence that women are often more likely to accept psychosocial services in an oncology outpatient clinic than men  [36] . Taken together with the growing evidence that partners experience as much, if not more, psychological distress following a cancer diagnosis as patients  [22, 37, 38] , it is possible that the uptake rates for prostate cancer was partially influenced by female partners encouraging prostate cancer patients to participate in the intervention. On the other hand, given that sexual functioning is often impacted, men with prostate cancer may be more open to accepting an intervention they feel will help them within a relational context.\n\nThe second noteworthy pattern was that uptake rates varied across intervention types. Uptake rates slightly favoured coaching interventions (59.2%, CI = 55.8%-62.6%) than individual-based interventions (48%, CI = 44.6%-51.2%) and dyadic interventions (46.3%, CI = 44.5%-48%). This is somewhat surprising and may reflect a logistical issue for couples who are unable to commit to an intervention simultaneously or feel they do not require the same level of psychosocial support. This is consistent with a study by Lambert et al.  [39]  regarding the feasibility of a self-directed, couple-based The third noteworthy pattern that emerged from this review was that at the final reported follow-up point, patients with a late stage diagnosis and their partners reported similar attrition (patients = 30.7%, 95% CI = 28.1%-33.3%; partners = 29.5%, 95% CI = 26.9%-32.2%), whereas attrition among partners of patients with early stage cancer was somewhat higher than the patients themselves (patients = 19.8%, 95% CI = 17.4%-22.4%; partners = 27.1%, 95% CI = 24.3%-30%; Table  4 ). Previous studies of attrition have found that late withdrawal from interventions was more likely to occur among employed participants  [40] ,\n\nand thus this might suggest that towards the conclusion of studies partners of early stage cancer patients may perceive the intervention as interfering with family or work commitments and wish to move on from it.\n\nThe fourth notable uptake/attrition pattern that emerged from the findings was the variation in uptake and attrition that existed among communication-focused, coping-focused and education-focused interventions. Communication-focused interventions seemed to have slightly lower uptake (43.1%, 95% CI = 40.5%-45.7%) than coping-focused (51%, 95% CI = 49.1%-52.9%) and education-focused interventions (51.8%, 95% CI = 48.1%-55.5%). Communication-focused interventions also seemed to have more favourable attrition rates than coping and education-focused interventions, particularly at the final follow-up. This might highlight that these types of interventions might not be appealing to couples initially, but once they are enrolled, the benefits of these might become more apparent and encourage couples to continue with the intervention. Conversely, and although based on just two studies (one delivered to individuals separately  [23]  and one delivered as a coaching intervention  [28] ), educationfocused interventions appear to have high initial face validity, but the high attrition noted (at the first follow-up) might highlight issues pertaining to their relevance as participants progress through the cancer trajectory and actual usefulness of these interventions."

      "title": "Barriers to intervention uptake and completion",
      "text": "Two studies had notably lower uptake rates than the others  [5, 24] . Whereas Baucom et al. provided little information about why their interventions were not as readily accepted as others, Kayser et al. reported 42.3% declined because of the distance to the intervention being too great, and 13.2% said they were too busy to participate. Across all interventions, travel distance was most often cited as a major barrier for couples, followed by illness severity, being too busy/not having the time and the intervention not meeting couples' expectations. Few studies provided details regarding the differences (i.e. variations in demographic information or medical history) between eligible couples that accepted an intervention and those who did not. Two studies reported notable differences in terms of the rate of attrition between patients and partners  [26, 30] . Thornton and colleagues  [30]  reported that patients who did not complete the study were more likely to be employed than patients who completed the study and that partners who dropped out reported lower relationship quality and less positive affect than partners that completed the study. Northouse et al.  [26]  found that in patients with shorter disease-free intervals, more disease symptoms and more uncertainty about their illness were more likely to drop out of the study. Taken together, this suggests that a subsample of participants who may benefit most from a psychosocial intervention were less likely to see the trial through."

    {
      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "Given the wide variation in samples, interventions and outcomes, it was deemed inappropriate to conduct a meta-analysis. This limits the generalizability of some of the patterns described here, particularly across multiple categories (e.g. cancer stage and type, and intervention type). As such, the results are intended to be interpreted as being descriptive only. A limitation of this review and of the literature of couple-based interventions for cancer in general, particularly for studies with patients with advanced cancer, is that mortality was not consistently reported, making it difficult to tease out the reasons for attrition."

    {
      "title": "Future research",
      "text": "This review has identified some of the patterns that might be associated with couples' willingness to participate in and complete couple-based interventions following a cancer diagnosis and identified a number of promising avenues for future research. First, additional research with homogenous subsamples is needed to determine the cumulative influence of the factors explored in this review on uptake and attrition rates. Second, research to date has given relatively little attention to how the advances in evidence regarding efficacy of couple-based interventions in cancer settings can be translated into clinical practice. Hence, effectiveness studies are needed in diverse clinical settings. In addition, to promote the translation of the evidence on couple-based interventions, studies are needed to explore the views and attitudes of health care professionals about the needs of couples. In particular, a focus on strategies to integrate couple-based interventions into routine clinical care and strategies to reduce stigma that can sometimes accompany psychosocial interventions in cancer care are required  [41] . Third, few studies have investigated the characteristics of couple-based interventions that are likely to increase uptake and reduce attrition (e.g. the therapeutic focus and simultaneous participation by patients and partners). Further investigation of the views held by couples regarding the influence (including risks and benefits) of a focus on couple or relationship issues would be beneficial  [33] . Fourth, the barriers to uptake and the reasons for attrition identified by the manuscripts reviewed, including employment and level of satisfaction with relationship, suggest the content and mode of delivery of couple-based interventions need to be tailored to the couples' needs to improve accessibility and acceptability. This is particularly pertinent for couples, as finding the time to engage in an intervention together as well as managing the demands of treatment visits, family and work commitments might be an unrealistic expectation  [30] . Tailoring of the content of couple-based interventions was suggested by couples participating in a study by Lambert et al.  [39]  as a means of increasing the relevance and acceptability of the intervention. Last, few studies reviewed considered the influence of specific relationship factors (e.g. cultural or religious influences and sexual orientation) on the uptake and attrition of couple-based interventions, an area in urgent need of more attention. The application of couple-based interventions for same-sex couples is yet to be comprehensively addressed in the cancer literature, although important findings from fields such as HIV care may 2645 Uptake and attrition in couple-based interventions be informative and relevant  [42] . A greater understanding of these issues from both clinicians and researchers may help to improve the uptake and delivery of couple-based interventions, and ultimately improving the care provided to patients and partners."
