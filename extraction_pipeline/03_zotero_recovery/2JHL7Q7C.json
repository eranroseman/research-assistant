  "abstract": "Primary objective: Interventions are needed to address chronic health conditions, such as obesity and diabetes, faced by adults with traumatic brain injury (TBI). The objective of this narrative is to present the justification for and an exemplar of an active attention control condition as a needed comparison group in clinical trials for intensive lifestyle interventions after TBI. Research Design: Narrative review Methods and Procedures: N/A Main Outcomes and Results: Despite the historical use in scientific research, integration of appropriate control conditions to account for not only the placebo effect, but also to isolate the \"active ingredients\" of behavioural interventions, remains a challenge. This is particularly true for intensive lifestyle interventions, especially with the increasing use of mobile health (mHealth) to augment these interventions. Herein we describe the design, content, and implementation of a group-based, attention control condition, referred to as the Brain Health Group, as an exemplar active comparison to an intensive lifestyle intervention for weight-loss among individuals with TBI (GLB-TBI). Conclusions: Intervention studies should incorporate strong scientific designs and active control conditions to assess effectiveness and aid in replication. Following recommended guidelines, we provide an active control condition for future group-based intensive lifestyle interventions post-TBI.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "For nearly 80 years, researchers have incorporated control conditions into clinical trials to account for the placebo effect  (1) . Conditioned responses and participant expectations likely drive positive (and sometimes negative) effects of the control condition on self-appraised health outcomes  (1) . Beyond the neurobiological mechanisms within a person that may contribute to the effect of the control condition, the relationship between the treating interventionist and the participant, the participant's psychological state, and environmental factors also contribute  (1) . Isolating the \"active ingredients\" of any intervention -those mechanisms of change not present in a control condition -therefore requires thoughtful and intentional study design. This is especially true for behavioural interventions, including intensive lifestyle interventions, which inherently rely on working alliance and rapport with an interventionist and often aim to change behaviours and improve psychological states. Despite a long history of including control conditions in clinical trials for medical interventions, designing adequate control conditions for behavioural interventions remains in its infancy. The need to improve the design and reporting of scientifically strong control conditions in research is increasingly important with the growing focus on identifying evidence-based approaches, like intensive lifestyle interventions, to manage the ever-growing burden of chronic health conditions such as diabetes and obesity. Further, with the proliferation of interventions exploring the impact of technology (e.g., mobile applications, devices, wearables) there is a need to develop appropriate control conditions that also incorporate parallel technology, to strengthen the knowledge base. This presents researchers with a challenge to develop comprehensive active control conditions that mirror the mode (e.g., in person, group sessions, mobile health), intensity (e.g., 12 months, 22 1-h sessions, 42 weeks of mHealth app), and value (e.g. attractiveness, benefit) of the intensive lifestyle intervention being tested."

      "title": "History of intensive lifestyle interventions for diabetes prevention and weight loss",
      "text": "Intensive lifestyle interventions (ILI) are one behavioural approach to diabetes and obesity prevention that include behaviour therapy, physical activity promotion, and decreased caloric intake  (2, 3) . ILIs typically include group or individualized coaching for people who are overweight or obese to help them positively change their diet and physical activity behaviours. People enrolled in an ILI may have a weight-loss goal (e.g., 7% weight loss) that they will work to meet over the duration of the program (recommended to be greater than 6 months and include > 14 in-person sessions). They learn and then practice behavioural strategies, including goal setting, overcoming barriers to healthy behaviours, engaging social support, and calorie counting  (3) . The ILI is generally delivered by an interventionist with a background as a health professional (e.g., dietician, nurse, counsellor), who has undergone ILI delivery training. Notably, in their guidelines for the management of obesity, the American Heart Association and American College of Cardiology emphasize that limited research on ILIs is a significant gap in the weight-loss research literature(3). Further, the role of technology in behavioural approaches and how it can be used to complement in-person coaching is important to explore. Existing evidence suggests that internet and smartphone-based ILIs are feasible to deliver, but that weight loss is typically lower than in-person interventions  (4) . Due to the \"intensive\" nature of ILIs, designing rigorous active control conditions is particularly challenging."

      "title": "Designing active control conditions for intensive lifestyle interventions",
      "text": "Prior to selecting or designing the content of a control condition, researchers first need to identify the most appropriate study design. The two most common designs, historically, are waitlist control and treatment as usual or usual care. Though a waitlist control design is convenient and may address ethical concerns related to providing no intervention, it is still considered a weak design because it is not concurrent with the active intervention  (5) . Specific to nutrition and weight-loss interventions, two systematic reviews found that roughly onethird to one-half of studies had no control or an inactive control condition (including waitlist control)  (6, 7) . The other most common control condition, considered to be a passive control condition, is usual care (5-7). However, usual care is often a nebulous concept with few studies providing an adequate description of what is involved  (6, 7) . In a review of weight-loss studies, usual care made up 44% of control conditions and, when described, typically involved dissemination of print materials about healthy behaviours or, less frequently, brief education sessions to promote healthy behaviours  (7) .\n\nThe strongest design includes an active control condition to account for the nature and frequency of attention participants receive in behavioural interventions  (5) . These active control conditions should be concurrent, to account for any historical or maturation effects, and equivalent with regard to time, the extent of activities, and the nature of engagement (e.g., nature of activities, attention, support from staff)  (5, 6, 8) . The active control condition should also be equally attractive to participants; that is, though qualitatively different, it should be perceived to have equal value  (5, 6) . Providing an intervention of equal, if different, value also ensures that participants in the control condition are not wasting their time engaging in meaningless activities, addressing the ethical principles of respect for persons and justice  (5, 8) . Active control conditions should confer potential benefit to the participant, though that benefit should be independent of the primary study outcome (i.e., the benefit of the primary intervention being tested)  (8) . Following a comparative effectiveness research framework, Aycock and colleagues (2018) laid out nine essential considerations for behavioural intervention studies with active control conditions including: (1) the \"active components\" of the control intervention are not associated with the primary outcome of interest;\n\n(2) there is no contamination between intervention groups; (3) the active control is comparable (as described above) to the primary intervention; (4) there is adequate and comparable training for both conditions; (5) the control condition is interesting and acceptable to the target population; (6) both interventions are evaluated, both with regard to fidelity and to study outcomes;  (7)  consideration is given to the resources required for intervention delivery and implementation; (8) the effects of both intervention conditions are quantifiable and measured;  (9)  consideration is given to ethical issues  (8) ."

      "text": "In 2012, Waters and colleagues published a systematic review and meta-analysis of control conditions in weight-loss intervention studies published in English between 2005 and 2010  (7) . Of the 85 randomized control trials included, 39% (n = 33) had no control intervention, 16% (n = 14) had a waitlist control condition, and 44% (n = 38) had \"usual care\" as a control condition  (7) . Usual care was not always described, but when it was, the nature, content, and duration varied across studies  (7) . They also noted that 13 of the included studies did not capture weight as an outcome for the control group  (7) . Byrd-Bredbenner and colleagues conducted a systematic review of control conditions in nutrition education interventions that they published in 2017. Of the 43 included studies, roughly one-third (n = 15) had an inactive control condition (no condition or waitlist control) and two-thirds (n = 28) had some form of concurrent control condition  (6) . Of the control conditions mentioned, a quarter included \"usual\" or \"standard\" care (a passive control), just under half (n = 12) included an alternative treatment (including some that met criteria for attention control), and just under a quarter (n = 9) included a dismantling or additive component (that is a version of the primary intervention with specific \"active ingredients\" either removed or added to test their unique effect)  (6) . As previously noted  (5) , there was limited reporting on standardization of the control condition, with only half addressing fidelity and few providing adequate rational or behavioural theory behind selection of the control condition  (6) ."

      "text": "Traumatic brain injury (TBI), particularly moderate to severe injury, is now widely recognized as a chronic condition requiring lifelong management  (9, 10) . Other chronic conditions, such as diabetes, heart disease, and sleep disorders, if present, can contribute to and magnify the long-term consequences of TBI. These secondary chronic conditions are often preventable -and often reversible -after TBI through ILI  (11) . Though many modifiable risk factors for secondary chronic conditions exist, weight gain after TBI is particularly common and a result of metabolic changes, medication side effects, neurological impairments, and participation restrictions after injury  (11) . Despite this, few ILIs that promote physical activity and healthy eating have been adapted and tested in chronic moderate-severe TBI. Driver and colleagues previously described the adaptation of an evidence-based diabetes prevention program for community-dwelling adults with moderate-severe TBI  (12)  and the early efficacy for this program in a singlegroup pilot intervention study  (13) . Testing the efficacy of this ILI in a rigorous randomized controlled trial would require a comprehensive active control condition that was interesting and acceptable and had perceived value to individuals with chronic TBI  (14) ."

      "text": "Education-based interventions are good candidates for active control conditions; they have inherent value, they can be modified to be comparable with regard to time and attention, and their content can be selected to be relevant or not to the study outcomes, as appropriate to the study design. Hart and colleagues conducted a scoping review of the literature (published up to October 2016) on education interventions after TBI, which included 54 articles addressing moderate to severe TBI in adults  (15) . Half of those articles reported education interventions delivered to caregivers, nine targeted individuals with TBI themselves, and 18 were for both. The majority (80%) occurred in outpatient or community settings, and most (65%) included education as one component of the intervention; for the 19 studies including education as the sole intervention, ten had education as a control condition. However, the dosage, mode of delivery, and other intervention components varied considerably across studies, and the design of these control conditions was deemed poor  (15) . Very few studies examined the specific effects of education alone on outcomes or were directed to the individual with a TBI  (15) . The absence of evidence-based education interventions to serve as a strong active control condition for ILI in chronic TBI limits our ability to test the efficacy of ILI in clinical trials."

      "text": "Mobile technologies to support clinical intervention by promoting self-management, delivering education, and monitoring health indicators, are developing rapidly  (16) . Smartphones are increasingly available (17) and present unique opportunities to capitalize on technology-enhanced active learning  (18, 19)  to enhance and support maintenance of the effects of an intervention after formal training is complete. A metaanalysis on using mobile technology to support weight-loss concluded that use of mobile technology in addition to other methods of intervention delivery was associated with greater weight reduction  (20) , supporting the adjunct use of mobile technology -like smartphone apps -in the context of established behavioural interventions. A recent literature review on mobile health interventions after TBI supported the potential efficacy of mobile technology to support self-management tasks, with proper consideration given to the unique cognitive, sensory, and social challenges individuals with TBI might face  (21) . Supplementing behavioural interventions with a smartphone app, however, introduces a new active intervention component that would need to be mirrored, following all the same recommendations noted previously to ensure equivalence, in an active control condition (or perhaps tested specifically in a dismantling/additive control condition)."

Herein, we describe the content and development of an active control condition (Brain Health Group) for an evidence-based ILI for weight-loss after TBI -the Group Lifestyle Balance intervention (GLB-TBI)  (12, 14) . The overall structure of the GLB-TBI and Brain Health (control condition) interventions were previously published  (14) . The current paper describes each condition in detail, to address the need to provide more detailed characterization of control conditions to accurately interpret the effects of behavioural interventions and to provide an exemplar of an active control condition for a group-based ILI intervention with a mHealth component for use in future studies of groupbased interventions in chronic TBI."

      "title": "Group lifestyle balance (GLB)",
      "text": "The Group Lifestyle Balance (GLB) is a twelve-month, twentytwo session, group-based comprehensive lifestyle intervention developed by the Diabetes Prevention Support Center (DPSC) at the University of Pittsburgh  (22, 23) . The GLB is a direct adaptation of the Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP), a large, multi-centre randomized controlled trial. Results of the DPP revealed that one-on-one lifestyle intervention produced significantly greater weight loss and reduced risk of developing Type 2 diabetes mellitus than metformin (an oral diabetes prevention drug) and placebo  (24) . The one-on-one DPP format was translated into the group-based GLB for broader community reach and has been successfully delivered in community settings such as community centres, churches, worksites, and healthcare settings  (25) (26) (27) (28) (29) (30) . Researchers used a community-based participatory research approach to modify the existing GLB curriculum to meet the unique needs of people with TBI. An advisory board of ten members including clinicians, researchers, former patients and care partners, and community representatives worked collaboratively to appropriately adapt the group-based GLB format to the TBI population  (12) . The modifications, which are described elsewhere  (12) , were successfully piloted in 2016 and expanded into a large randomized controlled trial in 2017  (13, 14) .\n\nThe GLB is grounded theoretically in the Social Cognitive Theory and Health Belief model. It takes a behavioural approach to the lifestyle change that emphasizes selfmanagement, self-efficacy, and observational learning. Goals of the GLB are for participants to: (1) achieve 7% weight loss and (2) safely engage in 150 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity each week. The program follows recommendations and guidelines from the American College of Sports Medicine, American Heart Association, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture. Sessions over the 12 months are divided into 12 weekly sessions (core phase), then four biweekly sessions (transition phase), then six monthly sessions (support phase). Participants achieve goals through a focus on healthy food choices, self-monitoring of weight, calorie and fat intake, physical activity and relapse prevention. Session topics include: (1) calorie and fat counting; (2) physical activity recommendations; (3) tipping the calorie balance; (4) mindful eating and mindful movement; (5) managing slips and selfdefeating thoughts;  (6)  resistance training;  (7)  sitting less for your health; (8) heart health; (9) motivation; and (10) stress management and sleep. Throughout the sessions, participants set and monitor calorie, fat, and activity goals using materials provided by the GLB team or publicly available mobile applications such as My Fitness Pal \u2122 ."

      "text": "Longitudinal results and participant feedback from the GLB for TBI pilot study indicated that maintaining engagement and participation in the GLB intervention became challenging as the inperson group session frequency began to taper after week twelve  (13) . To address this, the North Texas TBI Model System team developed a consumer-informed mHealth application to support ongoing participation in the GLB intervention  (31) . Our Community Advisory Board, including 7 TBI survivors, 6 caregivers, and 12 researchers/clinicians with TBI expertise, informed the content, timing, and format of the GLB app. Participants begin using the GLB-TBI app at week ten, which allowed participants to try the app, learning to use it independently, and problem-solve any issues with the GLB team while sessions were still occurring weekly. Content of the GLB-TBI app came directly from the content of the GLB sessions, repeating and reinforcing the information learned during the group sessions. Participants receive daily notifications, pushed directly to their smartphone. If a participant did not own a smartphone, the GLB team provided a tablet to the participant. Every day, participants report if they met their daily nutrition goal and daily activity goal. They then read a \"daily tip\", which is a brief fact or strategy previously learned during group sessions. Each day presents a unique daily tip. Finally, they rate their general health on a 5-point ordinal scale. Once per week, participants also record their weight through the app, report if they followed their action plan to achieve their goals, and indicate the supports and barriers they experienced that week related to their weight-loss goals. They can also indicate through the app if they want a GLB coach to contact them. Finally, once per month participants complete a longer quality of life assessment."

      "text": "The Brain Health Group (BHG) is a twelve-month, twenty-two session, group-based educational support group for adults living with TBI developed within the North Texas TBI Model System as an active control intervention for the GLB. The BHG is concurrent and equivalent, in terms of content, time, and attractiveness, to GLB, with differences limited only to the components of the GLB that are specific to weight loss. The focus of the BHG is to provide education regarding TBI and overall brain health through instructional sessions, group discussion, and structured tasks. Like the GLB, the BHG is theoretically grounded in the Social Cognitive Theory and Health Belief model, also emphasizing self-management, self-efficacy, social support, and observational learning. However, unlike GLB, the content of the BHG does not focus on weight, nutrition, or physical activity. Rather, the goal of the BHG is to improve mental well-being and quality of life by increasing participants' knowledge of brain health as it relates to chronic TBI, learning strategies to cope with the stresses of life after TBI, and encouraging community support and engagement.\n\nTo parallel the time and structure of the GLB, BHG sessions over the 12 months are divided into 12 weekly sessions, then four bi-weekly sessions, then six monthly sessions. Topics and content are taken from the Model Systems Knowledge Translation Center factsheets ( https://msktc.org/tbi/factsheets ) and topics suggested by our 25-member Community Advisory Panel. They include: (1) understanding TBI and recovery; (2) setting achievable goals for recovery; (3) dealing with anxiety, depression, and fatigue; (4) improving brain health; (5) cognitive changes; (6) return to work and community re-integration; (7) role changes; (8) gratitude; (9) identifying purpose post-TBI; and (10) communication, intimacy, and relationships. Throughout, participants are encouraged to develop short and long-term goals and to make regular entries in a gratitude journal provided by the BHG team."

First, the recruitment approach was tailored to address the potential effect that participants knowing the study aims could have on their behaviours during the trial  (5) . When recruiting, study staff informed potential participants that the study's purpose was to test the effects of a \"healthy lifestyle program.\" Participants were not told what the primary outcomes of interest are for the study, though the consent form is required to list the outcomes measures, including questions about weight history, activities and exercise, and food preparation and diet and measures of blood pressure, weight, walking ability, and body measurements. Second, investigators measured all outcomes, including weight loss, in both groups and administered an exit survey at study completion to assess helpfulness of intervention components and elicit qualitative feedback. This information will assist in program evaluation and determine if the BHG group is indeed equivalent with regard to participant satisfaction (i.e., would they recommend the program to a friend), attractiveness, \u2022 Group sessions lasted 1 hour each and mHealth app content included brief daily messages and slightly longer weekly messages."

Derived from Model Systems Knowledge Translation Center factsheets and topics recommended by Consumer advisory panel, ensuring relevance to TBI. Promotes mental well- being and quality of life, also grounded in Social Cognitive Theory and Health Belief Model emphasizing self- management, self-efficacy, social support, and observational learning. Generalization supported through a mHealth app that included direct content from the BHG group sessions. Two groups per wave: one in the afternoon and one in the evening each week, with no overlap with GLB (taught in separate buildings on the same medical center campus) GLB-TBI Component Content specific to weight-loss (primary outcome), nutrition, and physical activity: Direct adaptation of the Diabetes Prevention Program, an Intensive Lifestyle Intervention developed for weight-loss and Type 2 diabetes mellitus risk- reduction. Focus is on healthy nutrition, self-monitoring weight, and physical activity, promoted through a behavioral approach based in Social Cognitive Theory and the Health Belief Model. Generalization supported through a mHealth app that included direct content from the GLB group sessions. Two groups per wave: one in the afternoon and one in the evening each week, with no overlap with BHG (taught in separate buildings on the same medical center campus) \u2022 Occurred in two \"waves\", beginning in January 2019 (wave 1) and January 2020 (wave 2) \u2022 12-month, 22-session, 42 weeks of daily mHealth app con- tent.

Recommendation* \"Active components\" of BHG are not associated with weight-loss No contamination between groups BHG is comparable to GLB-TBI for: \u2022 History/maturation (i.e. concurrent) \u2022 Time \u2022 Extent of activities \u2022 Nature of engagement (e.g. nature of activities, atten- tion, support from staff) \u2022 Attractiveness (i.e. equal value)"

Frequency and length of sessions of BHG mirrored the GLB-TBI, but content was developed through community-based participatory research with a consumer advisory panel. In-person group sessions, daily mHealth notifications and content, and staff available during meetings and via email/ text/app as needed. Attractiveness of content and goals vetted through com- munity-based participatory research with a community advisory panel made up of TBI survivors and their care partners. Will collect participant feedback on satisfaction with the intervention during clinical trial to confirm equal attractiveness and perceived value. \u2022 \u2022"
