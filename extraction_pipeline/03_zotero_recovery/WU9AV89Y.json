  "title": "Activating Relatives to Get Involved in Care After Surgery: Protocol for a Prospective Cohort Study",
  "abstract": "Background: Postoperative complications and readmissions to hospital are factors known to negatively influence the shortand long-term quality of life of patients with gastrointestinal cancer. Active family involvement in activities, such as fundamental care activities, has the potential to improve the quality of health care. However, there is a lack of evidence regarding the relationship between active family involvement and outcomes in patients with gastrointestinal cancer after surgery. Objective: This protocol aims to evaluate the effect of a family involvement program (FIP) on unplanned readmissions of adult patients undergoing surgery for malignant gastrointestinal tumors. Furthermore, the study aims to evaluate the effect of the FIP on family caregiver (FC) burden and their well-being and the fidelity of the FIP. Methods: This cohort study will be conducted in 2 academic hospitals in the Netherlands. The FIP will be offered to adult patients and their FCs. Patients are scheduled for oncological gastrointestinal surgery and have an expected hospital stay of at least 5 days after surgery. FCs must be willing to participate in fundamental care activities during hospitalization and after discharge. Consenting patients and their families will choose to either participate in the FIP or be included in the usual care group. According to the power calculation, we will recruit 150 patients and families in the FIP group and 150 in the usual care group. The intervention group will receive the FIP that consists of information, shared goal setting, task-oriented training, participation in fundamental care, presence of FCs during ward rounds, and rooming-in for at least 8 hours a day. Patients in the comparison group will receive usual postoperative care. The primary outcome measure is the number of unplanned readmissions up to 30 days after surgery. Several secondary outcomes will be collected, that is, total number of complications (sensitive to fundamental care activities) at 30 and 90 days after surgery, emergency department visits, intensive care unit admissions up to 30 and 90 days after surgery, hospital length of stay, patients' quality of life, and the amount of home care needed after discharge. FC outcomes are caregiver burden and well-being up to 90 days after participating in the FIP. To evaluate fidelity, we will check whether the FIP is executed as intended. Univariable regression and multivariable regression analyses will be conducted.",

      "text": "Postoperative complications and hospital readmissions are known to negatively influence the short-and long-term quality of life (QoL) of patients  [1] . In addition, complications and readmissions also increase health care demands and costs  [2, 3] . Readmission rates after gastrointestinal surgery increase up to 30%  [4]  and are higher compared with general surgery in that these rates range from approximately 4% to 11%  [5, 6] . In addition, complication rates after gastrointestinal surgery are 34%  [7] , which is approximately 3 to 8 times higher compared with general surgery  [8, 9] . Frequent complications in this patient population include delirium, pneumonia, and wound infections  [7] . Reducing these readmissions and postoperative complications in patients undergoing oncological gastrointestinal surgery is a priority. Some postoperative complications are potentially preventable  [10] . Several studies have shown that optimizing basic care by executing fundamental care activities prevents postoperative complications, such as pneumonia, urinary tract infections, and delirium  [10] [11] [12] . Fundamental care activities include early mobilization, breathing exercises, dental hygiene, orientation in time and place, and eating together  [13] . Although fundamental care seems simple, it is prone to be missed care  [13, 14] .\n\nThe authors of a systematic review of 18 studies concluded that up to 75% of nurses omitted some kind of fundamental care tasks  [15] . In a recently published meta-review of 7 systematic reviews, the following categories of missed nursing care were identified: (1) fundamental physical care; (2) communication and information sharing with patients and families; (3) self-management, autonomy, and education of patients and families, including care planning, discharge planning, and decisions; and (4) emotional and psychological care, including spiritual support  [14] . Poorly executed or missing aspects of this care threaten patients' QoL and satisfaction, resulting in higher numbers of adverse outcomes and poor care experiences  [13, 14] .\n\nAfter hospital discharge, family caregivers often play an important role in the delivery of fundamental care activities to patients with cancer  [16] . However, family caregivers often feel unprepared to deliver proper care of their loved ones after discharge, and they also feel that they lack the necessary skills and knowledge  [17] . This might be because family caregivers are often considered visitors during patients' hospital stay and are sidetracked  [18] . Thus, family caregivers are not normally actively involved in postoperative care during hospitalization.\n\nDespite the uncertainty that family caregivers experience, in the past few decades, family-centered care (FCC) has been shown to potentially improve the quality of health care  [13, [19] [20] [21] . Family caregivers have become important care partners who are able to participate in all aspects of care delivery  [22, 23] . For instance, studies in which family caregivers were actively involved in performing fundamental care activities during hospital admission have shown a reduction in postoperative complications such as delirium and pneumonia  [12, 24] . The authors of a review of systematic reviews concluded that FCC could be an effective approach for improving the quality of health care, but there was a lack of high-quality studies investigating the effectiveness of FCC  [25] .\n\nFamily caregivers might be better prepared to deliver adequate care to their loved ones after discharge if they are involved in fundamental care during hospitalization, which could also lead to improved adherence to these care activities. Therefore, the incidence of complications and related readmissions might decrease. To promote active family involvement, we developed a multicomponent family involvement program (FIP) in which family caregivers could be actively involved in caring for their loved ones during hospitalization after oncological gastrointestinal surgery  [26] . In a pilot study, our FIP was shown to be feasible for patients, family caregivers, and health care professionals  [16, 27] . In addition, family caregivers had a better understanding and knowledge of their loved one's recovery process  [27] ."

Therefore, the main objective of this study is to evaluate whether FIP for adult patients undergoing oncological gastrointestinal surgery reduces the number of unplanned readmissions compared with usual care. The secondary aims are to evaluate the effect of the FIP on family caregivers by assessing caregiver burden and family caregivers' well-being and to assess the fidelity of the FIP. Here, we describe the study design and summarize the study protocol, which may also provide practical tools for health care professionals to adopt a more family-centered approach."

The average number of patients undergoing oncological gastrointestinal surgery as treatment for malignant pancreatic, gastric, esophageal, liver, colorectal, or peritoneal tumors in Amsterdam UMC is 415 per year and in UMCG 330 per year. Each participating surgical ward has 25 to 30 beds with a nursing:patient ratio of either 1:4 or 1:5. The participating wards were chosen because health care professionals expressed a willingness to adopt a more family-centered approach to their care."

Furthermore, patients will have to be able to read and write the Dutch language and will be included after providing written consent. Patients will be excluded if they remain in the intensive care unit (ICU) for >72 hours directly after surgery, as family caregivers do not have the opportunity to be involved in care in the first 5 days after the operation. In addition, patients will be excluded if the tumor is considered unresectable during surgery, as these patients do not receive the intended surgery and are discharged after one day."

Secondary outcomes include the total number of complications at 30 and 90 days after surgery and the number of complications sensitive to fundamental care activities (eg, pneumonia, urinary tract infection, wound infection, deep vein thrombosis, malnutrition, and delirium) at 30 and 90 days after surgery. These data will be collected from patient records, and complications will be classified according to the revised version of the Clavien-Dindo classification system  [37] . Secondary outcomes also include emergency department visits, ICU admissions up to 30 and 90 days after surgery, and hospital length of stay. Furthermore, patients' QoL will be measured using the EQ-5D-5L  [38] , and the level of anxiety and depression in patients will be measured using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS; Table  1 )  [39, 40] . Patient satisfaction with care and sleep quality will be measured using the numeric rating scale (NRS) ranging from 0 to 10, with higher scores indicating higher satisfaction or sleep quality (Table  1 ). Sleep quality will be assessed once a day, from the first day after surgery until 5 days after the operation.\n\nIn addition, the amount of home care (in hours per week) after discharge will be measured (Table  1 ). The risk screening scores routinely measured during hospital admission will be collected, ie, the Short Nutritional Assessment Questionnaire score (SNAQ)  [41] , the Delirium Observation Scale score (DOS)  [42] , the Braden scale  [43] , the Amsterdam UMC Extension of the John Hopkins Highest Level of Mobility scale score (AMEXO)  [44]  and the John Hopkins Fall Risk Assessment (JHFRAT; Table  1 )  [45] .\n\nIn addition to the effect of the FIP on patient outcomes, we measured the effect of the FIP on family caregiver outcomes, including caregiver burden and well-being up to 90 days after participating in the FIP (Table  1 ). The Valuation of Informal Care Questionnaire (iVICQ) measures objective burden using the following items: duration and intensity of informal care, patient health, need for permanent surveillance, patients' living situations, and use of professional care  [46] . Subjective burden will be measured using the Caregiver Strain Index plus (CSI+)  [47] , self-rated burden scale  [48] , and perseverance time  [49] .\n\nThe well-being of family caregivers will be measured using the Care-related Quality of Life instrument (CarerQoL-7D) and Care-related Quality of Life-Visual Analog Scale (CarerQoL-VAS; Table  1 )  [50] . Finally, the costs of the FIP will also be measured using the iVICQ  [46] .\n\nTo measure adherence, which is considered a bottom-line measurement of intervention fidelity  [51] , we will record how many patients are offered the FIP and how many patients decline, including the reasons if they want to disclose. We will use the data recorded by family caregivers to assess the fidelity of the intervention. Up to 5 days after surgery, family caregivers will be asked to record the fundamental and optional care activities they have carried out in the app, and if not completed, to add a reason. The family caregiver registers the activity on the registration form of the app. If multiple family caregivers participate in the FIP, they will all be asked to record the executed activities. Rooming-in of the family caregivers during admission will be checked by ward nurses and researchers (SM, SK, and HWH)."

The FIP starts <72 hours after surgery when patients are transferred from the postanesthesia care unit to the participating surgical wards. Depending on the ward capacity and patient preferences, the program can be continued until discharge. During the follow-up period (ie, 30 and 90 days after surgery), the patient and family caregiver will be contacted by telephone by SM, SK, or HWH and asked to complete the questionnaires.

By using this patient preference study design, we might introduce contamination between the intervention and comparison groups, as patients in the comparison group might learn about fundamental care activities and adopt them themselves or receive informal care without the program. Nevertheless, this study design was selected deliberately because no clear signs of contamination were observed between the study groups in the pilot study  [16] . To minimize the risk of between-group contamination, the information for patients and their families before inclusion will not include detailed information about the fundamental care activities that comprise the program."

To detect a 15% reduction in readmission rates at a 5% significance level (\u03b1) and a power of 80% (1 -\u03b2), a sample size of 136 patients per group is necessary, using a continuity-corrected chi-square test. We assume a 10% to 20% loss to follow-up (ie, not completing the questionnaires), and to compensate for this, the total sample size per group will be at least 150. Loss to follow-up is expected owing to the use of repeated questionnaires, which may burden patients. Recruitment ends as soon as both the groups have included 150 patients. To minimize attrition, we will collect detailed contact information and offer patients alternative data collection methods such as paper-based questionnaires if patients do not have an email address  [52] ."

The participation identification log will be kept separate from the patient data and will be safeguarded by the principal investigator. For the participating centers, a separate site-specific subject identification log will be kept at each study site.\n\nThe integrity of both patients' and family caregivers' data will be protected through a variety of mechanisms. Valid rules, range checks, and consistency checks against stored data will be supported. Access to the study data will be restricted, and a password will be used to control access. For the online database, 2-faced authentication is needed for access. Access to the app for family caregivers is password protected, which prevents the user data from being revealed if the device is stolen. Castor data will be stored on certified servers (ISO 27001, ISO 9001, and NEN 7510) as well as app data (ISO 27001 and NEN 7510). Data will also be stored locally in the department's computer system drive. All hard-copy original study forms will be stored in a secure and accessible place.

      "title": "Principal Findings",
      "text": "Currently, FCC is becoming more widespread in hospital environments  [25] . However, there is still a lack of rigorous evidence regarding the effects of FCC interventions and programs  [19] . This multicenter cohort study allows us to evaluate the effect and process of an evidence-based multicomponent FIP in comparison with the usual postoperative care in patients undergoing oncological gastrointestinal surgery. We hypothesize that the number of unplanned readmissions and complications could be reduced by the FIP without increasing caregiver burden.\n\nBefore we planned this substantial evaluation of the FIP, we followed a stepwise approach guided by the Medical Research Council framework, as the FIP can be considered a complex intervention  [61] . The development phase of the FIP began in 2015. First, we developed an evidence-based and theoretically grounded program  [26] . This phase was followed by testing program feasibility in a pilot study, which gave us input about the required sample size  [16] . In addition, we evaluated the experiences of family caregivers who participated in the FIP in a qualitative study  [27] . The results of the second phase were used to develop the intervention study in which we aimed to assess the effectiveness of the FIP. We initiated a randomized controlled trial (RCT; Dutch Trial Register: NL66712.018.18). However, after consenting, many patients and families mentioned a strong preference and withdrew from both groups directly after randomization, stating in their reasoning that they either be involved as participating family caregiver or not.\n\nContinuing the trial would have probably led to high dropout rates and, therefore, decreased the generalizability of results to clinical practice  [62] .\n\nTo deal with the strong preferences of patients and their families, we considered changing the design to a patient preference trial. These trials have been introduced to give patients the opportunity to participate in the study arm they prefer  [63, 64]  and have the main advantage of a lower risk of bias, especially in subjective outcome measures, and a decrease in dropout rates  [64] . A consequence of choosing this study design is that it requires a very large sample size when a considerable number of patients have a preference for one particular study arm  [64]  and that it still needs a group of patients (and families) without preferences who want to be randomized, which appeared not to be the case in our study. Therefore, the best available option was to change the design to a patient preference observational cohort study, which is considered a valuable alternative when an RCT does not meet patients' preferences  [65] .\n\nNevertheless, we realize that this patient preference study design still influences the external validity. Eligible patients without an available family caregiver cannot participate in the FIP, and most probably, a substantial number of patients need to decline this opportunity. On the basis of our previous work, we expect that this will be the case in approximately 20% of the patients and another 15% of the family caregivers are expected to decline participation  [16] . Therefore, it is essential to compare as many prognostic variables as possible between the 2 groups to assess baseline comparability, including patients' perceived social isolation and living status  [66] ."

      "title": "Implementation of FIP",
      "text": "By conducting this study, we will gain a better understanding of the behaviors of patients, families, and health care professionals that need to be changed and which implementation strategies are valuable to achieve this change. This input is needed to implement the results after finishing our cohort study and to guide other organizations also in implementing the FIP.\n\nIn the pilot study, we developed an implementation plan using Grol and Wensing model  [67]  that facilitates changes in health care using a stepwise approach. On the basis of the implementation recommendations derived from our pilot study, we implemented our FIP in this cohort study. A summary of our implementation recommendations and lessons learned were published in the article by Schreuder et al  [16] . An understanding of how the FIP was implemented by assessing the adherence to the FIP, the bottom-line measurement of intervention fidelity  [51] , will provide valuable insights when interpreting the effects of the FIP  [51] .\n\nA potential challenge for implementing the FIP is that it requires health care professionals to accept an FCC approach  [21] . This is considered a challenge because some health care professionals may not yet regularly engage patients' family caregivers in their daily practice  [21] . Therefore, training and coaching health care professionals in the FCC is an essential component of FIP.\n\nBased on our pilot study, acceptable levels of time investment by doctors and nurses were found, and for most nurses, the workload was reduced to some extent  [16] . Furthermore, most doctors value the presence of family caregivers during medical ward rounds  [16] . Because of the positive experiences of health care professionals during the pilot phase of the study, we did not investigate their experiences again in this study. Nevertheless, one should be aware that work role conflicts because of having family caregivers involved in care are associated with nurses' distress and impaired quality of care  [68] . In addition, one should be aware that some patients and health care professionals might view the FIP as an economical solution, replacing nurses with family caregivers rather than trying to improve health care  [69, 70] ."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "In conclusion, this study will provide health care professionals important information about the relationship between a multicomponent FIP and outcomes in a broad group of patients with cancer undergoing surgery and their family caregivers.\n\nThe FIP, which consists of evidence-based fundamental care activities for family caregivers, will provide practical tools for health care professionals to adopt a more family-centered approach. Future research should focus on the implementation strategies of FCC, choosing study designs that deal with patient preferences in complex interventions and involving patients when designing studies."
