      "text": "Over 1 billion people worldwide suffer from hypertension. It is the third leading cause of death globally, with over 7.5 people dying from it each year. Managing and preventing hypertension requires adopting a healthy lifestyle  (Jalali et al., 2022) . The Transtheoretical Model (TTM) is commonly used to understand how individuals progress toward adopting and maintaining healthy behaviors, including physical activity (PA)  (Spencer et al., 2006) . Interactive digital interventions (IDIs) can take advantage of the TTM and provide lifestyle behavioral intervention cost-effectively on a large scale  (McLean et al., 2016) . Spencer et al. (2006)  provide an overview of the TTM and its constructs as they apply to PA:\n\n1. Stages of change (SoC) are five stages individuals typically move through when changing behavior, with the more advanced stages correlating to higher PA levels. 4. Self-efficacy (SE) is an individual's confidence in performing specific behaviors in specific situations. Individuals with higher SE are likelier to maintain or increase their PA level. 5. Temptation refers to the barriers that can prevent an individual from being physically active  (Sharma, 2022, p.94) . Nolan et al. (2012)  aim to evaluate the effectiveness of internet-based lifestyle counseling as an intervention for patients with hypertension as a viable alternative or complement to traditional in-person management. The research employed a randomized controlled trial (RCT) design. Participants with diagnosed hypertension were recruited and randomly assigned to either the intervention group or a control group that received standard care. The participants were requested to choose between diet, exercise, and smoke-free lifestyle modifications. They received a series of emails over four months tailored to their self-reported SoC. The intervention also included educational material and self-help tips for lifestyle change.\n\nThe study found that the intervention group significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure compared to the control group at the 6-month follow-up. Additionally, participants in the intervention group reported higher adherence to dietary and PA guidelines. The online format was associated with high patient satisfaction and engagement. This research highlights the potential of IDIs in chronic disease management and supports further exploration of internet-based approaches for hypertension care. The TTM offers a structured approach to interventions by outlining different SoCs. However, one of its main limitations is the assumption that individuals progress through these stages linearly and within specific timeframes. In reality, people may skip stages, move back and forth between them, or progress at their own pace. This oversimplified approach may lead to rigid intervention designs. Jelali et al. (  2022 ) had all participants start at the same SoC. Nolan et al. (2012)  checked each participant's SoC and provided tailored intervention. However, in both cases, the intervention progressed at a predetermined order and pace once the intervention started.\n\nThe dynamic nature of IDIs can help to overcome the rigid nature and the predetermined pace of TTM based intervention. At the beginning of each session, the IDI can assess the participant's SoC, SE, PC, DB, and PA levels using a shortened version of the questionnaires used by  Jelali et al. (2022)  or similar. Based on the answer, the IDI can decide if the participant is ready to progress to the next step, repeat the previous one, move back, or skip some of the PC or PA educational content steps.\n\nEach SoC intervention step will have one full version and two short versions. The first time a participant does a step, they will do the extended version. They will be able to repeat each step up to three times. If a participant needs to repeat a step for the fourth time, then IDI will assume the participant has a more significant challenge and refer them to receive additional help. The IDI will also have PA education that will gradually reach at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity PA per week.\n\nAn overview of the TTM constructs and educational content (Table  1 .): The TTM provides a practical theoretical framework for developing PA IDI to manage and prevent hypertension  (Jellali et al., 2022; Nolan et al., 2012) . However, the effectiveness of these implementations are limited by the rigid structure of the TTM. Researchers should utilize the interactive and dynamic nature of IDIs to its fullest extent and provide interventions tailored to the individual's specific needs. As the prevalence of chronic disease increases, strains the healthcare and communities, and deepens socioeconomic disparities, it is crucial to explore innovative approaches  (Benavidez et al.,"

The study used a quasi-experimental design, with participants divided into intervention and control groups. The participants were evaluated before the intervention and six months after using a valid and reliable researcher-made questionnaire about their SoC, SE, PC, DB, and PA levels. All the participants were in the precontemplation and contemplation SoCs before the intervention. The intervention consisted of six training sessions, each containing 15 minutes of PC-based training and a PA training program with gradual progression. The PA training was designed so the participant could gradually reach at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity PA per week. Participants who used this IDI regularly for over 100 minutes showed significant changes in the TTM constructs and the PA minutes."
