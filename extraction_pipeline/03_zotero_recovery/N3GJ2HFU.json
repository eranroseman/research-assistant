  "title": "Effect of providing at-home opioid disposal kits at discharge after an orthopaedic surgery",
  "abstract": "Prescription opioids after surgery may pose a risk if left unused. However, prescribers rely on their best judgement in determining how much their patients need, often resulting in over-prescription of these medications. Opioid disposal is a strategy to reduce the risk of persistent use or misuse of opioids. At-home disposal kits allow patients to safely dispose of leftover opioids. In this study, we assess the impact of opioid disposal kits on disposal rates after orthopedic surgery. In a difference-in-differences study of 1,321 eligible patients, disposal kits were associated with a 10.6 percentage point increase (95% CI: -3.5% to 24.7%) in disposal rates as well as a 10.5 percentage point increase (95% CI: 0.2% to 20.9%) in the fraction of opioids disposed. We build on prior research and identify that providing surgery patients with an opioid disposal kit at the time of discharge increases their selfdisposal rates.",

      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "Opioid tablets following surgery are often left unused and pose a risk to individuals and communities.  1 Short-term opioid use is linked to new persistent use or misuse.  2  It is challenging to prescribe exactly to patients' needs, with providers having to use their best estimates. Although physicians have overall decreased the volume of opioids they are prescribing, they continue to prescribe more than patients need.  3 Motivating opioid disposal provides a strategy to reduce risk, and at-home opioid disposal kits continue to gain popularity.  4 What remains unknown is the effectiveness of routinely providing kits at scale. The objective of this study was to investigate whether discharging orthopaedic surgery patients with opioid disposal kits would improve their disposal rates."

      "title": "METHODS",
      "text": "This was a difference-in-differences study of self-reported opioid disposal rates approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board. A baseline period of usual care, or no kit provided, from May to July 2022 was compared with a treatment period where opioid disposal kits were provided from July to September 2022. The kits enabled patients to easily render pills unusable by mixing them with water and a powdered polymer gel, then disposing of them in the garbage. Outcomes were collected via an existing internal text message-based platform to collect patient-reported data, previously described.  5 dults undergoing hip or knee arthroplasty, prescribed an opioid, and discharged with a disposal kit were included and compared with patients undergoing similar orthopaedic surgeries at two other system hospitals where no kit was provided. The intervention site was within a large, academic hospital system with a consistent volume of orthopaedic surgeries where no previous opioid prescribing work was ongoing. The control sites were two other hospitals within the same system where the planning of opioid disposal methods was being considered by pharmacy stakeholders, but no active intervention was in place during the study period. The primary outcome was self-reported opioid disposal. Secondary outcomes were the quantity of pills disposed and patientreported pain intensity and opioid use. Data were abstracted from the electronic health record. Statistical analyses were performed through \u03c7 2 tests, two-sided t-tests and Wilcoxon rank-sum tests, with an alpha level of 0.05, using R V. 4"

      "text": "There were 1321 patients over the study period with a median age of 65 (IQR 58-72) years; 744 (56.3%) participants were female, 1078 (81.6%) were white and 995 (76.9%) were opioid na\u00efve. There were 786 (59.5%) patients in the usual care group (control), 678 (86.3%) participants Open access during baseline and 108 (13.7%) during treatment period. Baseline patients were younger (63 vs 65.5, p=0.02) and a lower proportion female (54.7% women vs 57.4%, p<0.01). There were 535 (40.5%) patients in the intervention, with 463 (86.5%) patients during baseline and 72 (13.5%) during treatment (table  1 ).\n\nThe proportion of patients who were given a kit and reported disposal rose from 20.8% to 28.4%, and the proportion of pills disposed increased from 16.1% to 20.2% (table  2 ). The absolute difference in opioid disposal among patients with a kit was 10.6% points higher (95% CI -3.5% to 24.7%). Patients with a kit disposed a greater fraction of their opioids, 10.5% points more (95% CI 0.2% to 20.9%), relative to control."

      "text": "Open access relatively low cost as each kit is valued under $2.00 USD. Moreover, as these kits are easy to deliver to patients, this is a sustainable intervention for providers to offer. These findings provide early evidence that providing a disposal kit at the point of discharge following surgery can increase disposal rates.\n\nLimitations include selection bias of those individuals opting in to report patient-reported outcomes, nonresponse bias, and a study limited to one health system. While we are unable to measure whether all patients received disposal kits, this provides a pragmatic estimate of the programme.\n\nOverall, these results show the effectiveness of opioid disposal kits at discharge and inform strategies to broadly reduce risks related to opioid prescribing."
