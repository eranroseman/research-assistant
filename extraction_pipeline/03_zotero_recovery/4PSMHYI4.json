  "title": "Assessing the Effectiveness of eHealth Interventions to Manage Multiple Lifestyle Risk Behaviors Among Older Adults: Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
  "abstract": "Background: Developing adverse lifestyle behaviors increases the risk of a variety of chronic age-related diseases, including cardiovascular disease, obesity, and Alzheimer disease. There is limited evidence regarding the effectiveness of eHealth-based multiple health behavior change (MHBC) interventions to manage lifestyle risk behaviors. \n Objective: The purpose of this systematic evaluation was to assess the effectiveness of eHealth MHBC interventions in changing \u22652 major lifestyle risk behaviors in people aged \u226550 years. \n Methods: The literature search was conducted in 6 electronic databases-PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, and SPORTDiscus-from inception to May 1, 2024. Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials of eHealth interventions targeting \u22652 of 6 behaviors of interest: alcohol use, smoking, diet, physical activity (PA), sedentary behavior, and sleep. Results: A total of 34 articles with 35 studies were included. eHealth-based MHBC interventions significantly increased smoking cessation rates (odds ratio 2.09, 95% CI 1.62-2.70; P<.001), fruit intake (standardized mean difference [SMD] 0.18, 95% CI 0.04-0.32; P=.01), vegetable intake (SMD 0.17, 95% CI 0.05-0.28; P=.003), self-reported total PA (SMD 0.22, 95% CI 0.02-0.43; P=.03), and objectively measured moderate to vigorous PA (SMD 0.25, 95% CI 0.09-0.41; P=.002); in addition, the interventions decreased fat intake (SMD -0.23, 95% CI -0.33 to -0.13; P<.001). No effects were observed for alcohol use, sedentary behavior, or sleep. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to test the robustness of the pooled results. Moreover, the certainty of evidence was evaluated using the GRADE (Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation) framework. Conclusions: eHealth-based MHBC interventions may be a promising strategy to increase PA, improve diet, and reduce smoking among older adults. However, the effect sizes were small. Further high-quality, older adult-oriented research is needed to develop eHealth interventions that can change multiple behaviors.",

      "text": "The aging population and the rise in chronic diseases will significantly increase health care expenditures; in the United States, for example, it is estimated that 80% of older adults have 1 chronic disease and 50% have at least 2  [1] . Up to 80% of global cases of heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes, as well as >30% of cancers, could be prevented by reducing tobacco and harmful alcohol use and improving diet and physical activity (PA)  [2] . Key indicators of health risk behaviors in older adults include physical inactivity, eating <5 portions of fruits and vegetables per day, obesity, and current tobacco use. The American Heart Association's recently published Life's Essential 8 metrics include healthy sleep as an indicator of cardiovascular health on top of a healthy diet, participation in PA, and avoidance of nicotine  [3] . Similarly, many health guidelines now integrate recommendations for PA, sleep, and sedentary behavior (SB)  [4, 5] . Overall, there is a clear link between these risk factors and poor health outcomes and quality of life  [6, 7] . Lifestyle behaviors, as important factors in health, provide scientists with valuable and interesting areas of research  [8, 9] .\n\nEngaging in multiple risk behaviors can negatively impact health by increasing the risk of, for example, chronic disease and mortality  [10] ; moreover, risk behaviors often occur simultaneously. A previous study reported a prevalence rate of approximately 50% for the co-occurrence of unhealthy diet and physical inactivity in adults  [11] . Compared to those who do not engage in any of the 4 lifestyle risk behaviors, those who do so face an elevated mortality risk equal to an additional 14 years of aging in both healthy populations  [12]  and populations with disease  [13, 14] . This suggests that it may be beneficial to use a holistic intervention approach to collectively change multiple health behaviors rather than individually change a single behavior. Multiple health behavior change (MHBC) interventions have attracted increased attention of late  [15, 16] . Growing evidence suggests that lifestyle interventions targeting MHBC may have a greater impact on public health than interventions targeting single health behavior change (SHBC)  [17, 18] . The advantages of MHBC interventions include maximizing health benefits and greater reduction in medical costs  [19] ; in addition, successfully modifying 1 behavior may increase confidence or motivation to change other health behaviors  [16] . Existing systematic reviews have examined the effectiveness of behavioral interventions on multiple health risk behaviors  [20] .\n\neHealth refers to the use of information and communication technologies in health and health-related fields to enhance health care services; health surveillance; health literature; and health education, knowledge, and research  [21] . There are several advantages over traditional face-to-face interventions  [22] . An eHealth intervention can be delivered over long distances; is cost-effective, efficient, and highly accessible; and allows for easy data collection  [22, 23] . This makes eHealth interventions potentially powerful and scalable tools and enables eHealth-based MHBC interventions to improve ongoing adherence to chronic disease management. However, only a few systematic reviews have specifically examined the effectiveness of eHealth-based MHBC interventions in adult populations; for example, the review by Norman et al  [24]  focused on dietary behavior change and PA interventions, while Oosterveen et al  [25]  examined interventions targeting smoking, nutrition, alcohol use, and PA. Overall, previous reviews have included a limited number of health behaviors (<4), focusing primarily on PA and diet."

      "title": "Objectives",
      "text": "Although studies on eHealth-based MHBC interventions aimed at promoting lifestyle changes in adolescents  [26]  and adults have been published, to the best of our knowledge, there are no knowledge reviews of such interventions designed for the older population. Older adults have limited access to programs and services that promote healthy lifestyles (eg, gyms) compared to younger adults  [27] . eHealth interventions may be the solution to help individuals adopt and maintain a healthy lifestyle. Therefore, it is urgent to investigate whether eHealth can be used to implement evidence-based lifestyle changes. In this review, we targeted studies involving adults aged \u226550 years because this age is often associated with retirement, providing more time and energy to focus on health, and improved quality of life is critical for older adults. A previous systematic review found significant effects of eHealth interventions on PA in older adults; however, lifestyle risk behaviors other than PA were not part of the inclusion criteria, and the findings were inconclusive due to an insufficient number of studies  [28] . Engaging in multiple lifestyle risk behaviors increases the risk of chronic disease and all-cause mortality more than the cumulative effect of a single behavior  [29, 30] . Therefore, we aimed to systematically review the effectiveness of eHealth interventions for risk behavior change in older adults, targeting \u22652 of 6 behaviors of interest: alcohol use, smoking, diet, PA, SB, and sleep."

For continuous outcomes, the corresponding variance was calculated using the preintervention and postintervention means and SDs; and for dichotomous outcomes, we extracted the preintervention and postintervention change values and sample sizes. However, if some studies had changes in baseline and postintervention data or if there were significant differences in their baseline data, we used the within-group difference in means and SDs for the intervention and control groups to calculate the effect size. Review Manager (version 5.3; The Cochrane Collaboration) was used to conduct the meta-analysis. We report continuous outcomes using standardized mean differences (SMDs) and dichotomous outcomes using odds ratios (ORs). We present these results using forest plots for each outcome of interest, with the weight (in percentage) indicating the influence of an individual study on the pooled result. The overall effect difference was considered statistically significant if the 2-tailed P value was <.05. In addition, we assessed the statistical heterogeneity of the included studies using the I 2 statistic and P value. Data were pooled and analyzed with a fixed effects model if I 2 \u226450% and P>.10; if these values were not met, which meant high heterogeneity among the studies, we used a random effects model to obtain more conservative estimates. We also conducted a sensitivity analysis using the leave-1-study-out method to test the robustness and reliability of the pooled results."

The measurement tools used for the different outcomes are shown in Multimedia Appendix 3.\n\nThe end points of self-reported total PA (TPA), objectively measured TPA, self-reported moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA), objectively measured MVPA, daily steps, regular exercise, and inactive PA were used to describe PA behavior. More than 10 different questionnaires were used to assess participants' self-reported PA levels and SB levels, the most common of which was the International Physical Activity Questionnaire. Objective measurements of TPA and MVPA were obtained from accelerometer measurements, and a pedometer was used to measure daily steps. Regular exercise was defined as accumulating >30 minutes of moderate exercise performed \u22655 days per week. PA was categorized into active and inactive on the basis of established recommendations regarding the total level: \u2265600 and <600 metabolic equivalent of task minutes per week, respectively. Eight indicators were selected to describe diet behavior: energy intake as well as intake of fruits, vegetables, fruits and vegetables (together), fats, proteins, sugars, and fiber. Of the 35 studies, 17 (49%) used various versions of the Food Frequency Questionnaire and dietary records or recall from different periods to evaluate the dietary indicators. In addition, the Dutch Standard Questionnaire on Food Consumption was used in the study by Kanera et al  [52] . The 3 studies involving sleep used 3 measuring tools, namely the 5-item validated Women's Health Initiative Insomnia Rating Scale, the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index, and an accelerometer. The prevalence of alcohol and tobacco use was collected through interviews or questionnaires."

Discussion Overview This systematic review is the first study to systematically examine the effectiveness of eHealth interventions targeting \u22652 of the following behaviors in a population of older adults (aged \u226550 y): PA, diet, smoking, alcohol consumption, sleep, and SB. A total of 35 studies with 12,931 older adults aged \u226550 years met the eligibility criteria for this review. The majority (6009/12,931, 46.47%) of the participants were female, with a mean age ranging from 50.0 (SD 11.2) years to 73.3 (SD 6.6) years. The overall methodological quality was moderate, according to the GRADE framework. Compared to usual care or waitlist, eHealth-based MHBC interventions significantly changed diet, SB, and smoking but had little effect on PA, alcohol consumption, and sleep."

    },
    {
      "title": "PA Assessment",
      "text": "Our data suggest that eHealth-based MHBC interventions may improve PA levels and daily steps in older adults. Previous meta-analyses also revealed that eHealth-based MHBC interventions significantly promoted PA among people with noncommunicable diseases and adults compared to the control conditions  [22, 68] . It is worth noting that the PA referred to in both studies was a synthetic size of multiple effect sizes within a particular scope of outcomes (eg, energy expenditure, steps, and time spent in PA or MVPA). We conducted a separate meta-analysis of PA-related metrics. First, the eHealth-based MHBC intervention significantly improved older adults' self-reported TPA compared with the control group. This is consistent with a previous meta-analysis  [28] , which found a mean increase in TPA of 90.7 minutes per week according to questionnaires in the eHealth-based MHBC intervention group compared to the control group. Another review involving people aged \u226550 years found that interventions containing smart technology significantly increased self-reported TPA compared to face-to-face interventions (SMD 0.17, 95% CI 0.02-0.32) [69] , which is broadly comparable to our effect size. Second, although we also found that the eHealth-based MHBC intervention significantly increased the time spent in MVPA in older adults, this result needs to be interpreted with caution because 4 (80%) of the 5 data points are from the same article. Interestingly, this review found very different results for self-reported and objectively measured TPA or MVPA. Another review reported similar results, with eHealth interventions significantly increasing objectively measured MVPA but not self-reported MVPA  [69] . This may be because the MHBC intervention intervened on a larger number of target behaviors than the SHBC intervention, and the intervention effect was unstable  [70, 71] . Another reason may be that the effect of eHealth interventions on the PA time measured by ActiGraph devices and that measured by questionnaires was quite different  [72] . Third, this review also showed that participants in the eHealth intervention group walked more than those in the control group (mean difference 597 steps/d). This is a conclusion we believe to be quite credible  [28, 69] . Earlier studies have shown that older people commonly cite inconvenience and a lack of access to a PA program as reasons for avoiding performing PA  [73] . Walking is the most commonly targeted PA for older people because it does not require access to specific programs and can be practiced anywhere  [74] . Finally, we also meta-analyzed changes in the prevalence of regular exercise as well as inactive PA and found a positive effect of an eHealth-based MHBC intervention. With up to 40% of people in industrialized countries not engaging in any regular PA  [75] , increasing PA rates by the rate produced by these interventions would have an important impact on health outcomes."

      "title": "Diet",
      "text": "Our review found that all MHBC interventions involving dietary interventions in older adults were performed together with PA, with a combination of both of them being the most common (8/35, 23%). This combination was also found by previous authors to be the most common combination in adolescent and adult MHBC interventions  [26, 68] . The results of our study suggest that eHealth-based MHBC interventions can significantly improve the diet of older adults. Specifically, there was an increase in fruit or vegetable intake. This finding aligns with previous research demonstrating that both the eHealth-based SHBC intervention and the eHealth-based MHBC intervention significantly boosted fruit or vegetable intake in the intervention group  [26, 53, 76] . Furthermore, we also found significant reductions in fat intake and energy intake in this population. eHealth interventions similarly significantly reduced dietary fat intake in adults but not in adolescents  [26, 76] . This may be because the health benefits of reducing fat intake are greater for middle-aged and older adults; therefore, they have greater motivational self-efficacy  [77] . eHealth interventions have an impact not only on dietary intake (33%-35%) but also on diet-related cognitive variables (69%-79%)  [78] . In addition, we found no evidence that eHealth interventions can change the dietary intake of sugar and fiber in older people. Although other studies have shown that it is possible to reduce children's consumption of sugary beverages, reducing unhealthy eating behaviors is often considered more difficult than starting new healthy behaviors  [79, 80] . The contents of eHealth interventions that are communicated to participants about behavior change and the feedback they receive can also influence changes in participants' behavior. Further research is needed to examine intervention contents regarding these dietary outcomes to increase the size and sustainability of the effects of MHBC interventions, particularly among older adults."

      "title": "Smoking and Alcohol Use",
      "text": "The effectiveness of eHealth-based MHBC interventions for stopping drinking is generally weak; however, promising results were seen for smoking cessation. The quality of evidence for alcohol use was deemed to be very low because the review only included 4 RCTs with relatively small sample sizes, which might have affected the pooled effect. In general, the longer the duration of the drinking and smoking interventions, the more effective they are  [81] . In this review, we included studies with intervention durations of 3 months as well as 6 months, in addition to the 12-month intervention duration. Due to the limited number of studies, we did not conduct further analyses. Indeed, the evidence for the effectiveness of eHealth-based smoking and alcohol cessation interventions is currently controversial  [82, 83] . There is also evidence that eHealth interventions may have similar effects in reducing drinking and smoking when compared to face-to-face treatment or no support  [84, 85] . Moreover, SMS text messaging may be particularly powerful for smoking behaviors such as abstinence and reduction of use, particularly automated reminders and motivating messages that can be sent during times of cravings  [86] . Thus, further work is needed to detect specific moderators of interventions such as follow-up length and message frequency."

      "title": "SB Assessment",
      "text": "The lack of a significant reduction in either self-reported sedentary time (P=.08) or objectively measured sedentary time (P=.06) was an unexpected finding, leaving ample room for improvement. Champion et al  [26]  found that eHealth-based MHBC interventions led to decreased sedentary time compared to controls (SMD -0.09, 95% CI -0.17 to -0.01). Although in the same direction and a similar effect size to our result, their result was statistically significant. Previous literature suggests that eHealth interventions can improve sedentary time within, but not between, groups of older adults. The review by Yerrakalva et al  [87]  showed that mobile health app interventions had the potential to reduce SB and increase PA in older adults. The MHBC studies for SB included in this review are all combined with PA, and most of the comments received by participants in the eHealth interventions (via SMS text messaging and telephone) supported their focus on PA and the step goals rather than on SB. In addition, research suggests that given the automaticity of SB, different and more effortful strategies are required to break existing habits compared to forming new habits  [88, 89] . This hints that future interventions regarding MHBC interventions could use multiple intervention strategies to reduce sedentary time  [90] ."

      "title": "Sleep",
      "text": "Sleep duration is a commonly used indicator for assessing sleep quality, and suboptimal sleep duration has been associated with increased morbidity and mortality  [91] , with short sleep durations in particular being detrimental to health  [92] . We found that eHealth-based MHBC interventions may not significantly improve sleep duration in older adults. Of the 3 studies on sleep that we included, 2 (67%) found significant improvements in sleep quality. However, the third study did not find that the eHealth intervention did not improve sleep duration. This may be because, in this study, sleep was used as a secondary outcome, and the intervention only set specific PA goals for the participants without any recommendations for sleep. In contrast to our findings, Howarth et al  [93]  evaluated the impact of a workplace digital health intervention on health-related outcomes and found that it could improve participants' sleep quality. Inconsistencies in conclusions may be due to possible differences in the effects of eHealth interventions on various indicators of sleep. In addition to objectively measured sleep duration, a range of subjectively measured sleep outcomes (nocturnal sleep quality, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep latency, and sleep medication use) are equally important in older adults with insomnia or insomnia symptoms  [94] . PA resulted in significant improvements in overall sleep quality, sleep quality, and sleep latency but not in sleep duration, efficiency, or disturbance  [95] . According to the American National Sleep Foundation, nonpharmacological treatment options are the preferred first choice of treatment for sleep problems  [96] . Therefore, the doubt whether MHBC interventions can improve sleep problems in older adults is important and needs to be explored in more RCTs."

      "title": "Strengths and Limitations",
      "text": "The strengths of this study include the focus on a variety of lifestyle behaviors associated with adverse health outcomes and our rigorous methodology.\n\nHowever, our study has several limitations. First, despite our best efforts to conduct a thorough literature search in a limited number of databases, the diversity of outcome indicator descriptions may still have resulted in the omission of appropriate topics or relevant studies. Second, this review included some participants aged 50 to 60 years because some of the trials were designed to recruit older adults, but they did not specifically exclude people aged <60 years. Future research should explicitly target older adults (aged \u226560 y) for RCTs of eHealth interventions. Third, although all included studies used eHealth interventions, there was still considerable variation in terms of participants (eg, cultural background, age, and health status), intervention characteristics (eg, intervention channel, content, and duration), and outcome measures, and the small number of studies may lead to cautious interpretations of the pooled results. In particular, SHBC interventions differ from MHBC interventions in terms of effectiveness. Finally, because we only searched for articles published in English, the results of the meta-analysis may be affected by language bias."

      "title": "Implications",
      "text": "This paper highlights important directions for future research. First, there is a lack of qualified interventions to address sleep problems, although many older adults report sleep deprivation or sleep problems  [97] , and there is a growing recognition that exercise behaviors (such as PA), SB, and sleep are interdependent. Second, there is a general lack of follow-up analyses in intervention designs. Most of the included studies measured outcomes twice (before the intervention and after the intervention). Thus, the long-term and maintenance effects of eHealth interventions on multiple risk behavior changes in older adults have not been validated. As advocated  [6, 13] , the next phase of this study is to explore how and under what conditions these initial changes can be maintained by adding a longer follow-up design. Finally, the intervention components included in the study focused primarily on health behavior education and counseling, with a lack of substantive behavioral coaching; this may be due to the limitations of current eHealth intervention channels. A commonly used intervention paradigm is to select a specific health behavior change theory (eg, behavior change theory, social cognitive theory, or self-regulation theory) as a framework and further promote a theory of choice for effective elements (eg, motivation, planning, and self-regulation). As the results of previous reviews have confirmed the effectiveness of this intervention paradigm, to further improve intervention effectiveness, it may be prudent to use dual-process approaches (ie, focusing on conscious and unconscious processes of behavior change)  [54, 56]  alongside socioecological approaches (ie, involving policy dimensions, environment, and individual factors)  [59, 64] .\n\nIn addition, we need to pay extra attention to the synergistic or transfer effects involved in MHBC interventions. Accordingly, lessons, skills, and knowledge learned concerning 1 behavior apply to another, thereby improving multiple behaviors. In addition, success in changing \u22651 lifestyle behaviors may also increase confidence or self-efficacy to improve risky behaviors in individuals who are less motivated to change  [22] . In addition to potentially greater efficacy and impact on health, MHBC interventions have greater real-world applicability and provide information about the effective treatment of co-occurring behaviors  [23] . This is particularly true among older adults, who are more likely to have co-occurring health conditions than younger adults. Future research should seek to explore this effect in trials of MHBC interventions."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "A wide range of eHealth-based MHBC interventions were effective in improving diet, aiding smoking cessation, and increasing daily step counts. However, effect sizes were small, and the overall quality of the evidence was low. Further high-quality research is needed to develop eHealth interventions that are effective in simultaneously modifying multiple risk factors for chronic disease, including substance use and sleep outcomes. It is recommended that eHealth-based MHBC interventions be included in the guidelines to improve the quality of life of older persons and reduce the risk of chronic diseases in later life."
