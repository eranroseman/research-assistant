  "abstract": "A systematic review may encompass both odds ratios and mean di erences in continuous outcomes. A separate meta-analysis of each type of outcome results in loss of information and may be misleading. It is shown that a ln(odds ratio) can be converted to e ect size by dividing by 1.81. The validity of e ect size, the estimate of interest divided by the residual standard deviation, depends on comparable variation across studies. If researchers routinely report residual standard deviation, any subsequent review can combine both odds ratios and e ect sizes in a single meta-analysis when this is justi\u00ffed.",

      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "Meta-analysis is now used extensively in reviews of randomized controlled trials and observational studies, but the problems include how to compare non-identical outcomes  [1] . A review of guidelines for systematic reviews of randomized trials recommended 'identi\u00ffcation of a common set of de\u00ffnitions of outcome'.\n\nOne form of lack of common de\u00ffnition is the use of a continuous outcome by some authors, and a dichotomous outcome by others. This can lead to reviewers performing two separate meta-analyses  [2; 3] . This problem has already been tackled in a systematic review of the prophylactic use of oxytocics on postpartum blood loss in the third stage of labour  [4] . The authors considered that postpartum haemorrhage, de\u00ffned as the loss of 500 ml or more, was the outcome of interest, but some trials summarized blood loss by mean and standard deviation. A method of estimating the log-odds ratio for the latter trials was presented, under the assumption of a Normal distribution.\n\nHowever in many situations there is no natural dichotomy, and reviewers will wish to retain the greater power generally provided by continuous outcome measures. Continuous outcome measures on di erent scales can be combined using 'e ect size', the estimate of interest, which may be a di erence in means or a regression coe cient, divided by the residual standard deviation  [1] . The simple approximate method for converting an odds ratio to e ect size presented here enables reviewers to maximize the information available."

      "title": "THE EQUIVALENCE OF ODDS RATIOS AND EFFECT SIZE",
      "text": "Logistic regression with results reported as odds ratios, or a close equivalent, is unavoidable for truly dichotomous outcome variables. However some continuous outcomes, such as blood pressure  [5] , are frequently dichotomized. The odds of a subject being hypertensive depend on the mean and variation of the underlying distribution of blood pressure. The odds ratio for one risk factor group compared to another is invariant to choice of cut-o point if the logit of the proportion with hypertension plotted against blood pressure is parallel for the two risk factor groups. It is a su cient, but not necessary, condition for the underlying distribution of blood pressure in the two groups to be logistic with equal variances.\n\nMost analyses of continuous outcomes proceed on the assumption that the distribution is Normal, often after transformation of the data. However it is known that the logistic and Normal distributions di er little, except in the tails of the distributions  [6] . This is illustrated in Figure  1 , where the logit of a proportion is plotted against the Normal equivalent deviate (NED). The standard logistic distribution  [7]  has variance 2 =3; so a di erence in ln(odds) can be converted to an approximate di erence in NED by dividing by = \u221a 3, which is 1.81 to 2 decimal places. As a di erence in NED is the e ect size  [1] , a meta-analysis of ln(odds) is equivalent, albeit with loss of power, to one of e ect size except for the scaling factor of 1.81.\n\nIn order to convert a di erence in NED to a di erence on the underlying scale, a standard deviation is required. Hence conversion of an odds ratio to an absolute di erence is possible if the standard deviation is known. It follows from this that studies reporting odds ratios are truly comparable in absolute terms if and only if the underlying standard deviation is the same for each study. Table I.

      "title": "AN EXAMPLE",
      "text": "The example is a review of house dust mite control measures in the management of asthma  [2] . Twelve studies were included, of which \u00ffve reported the odds ratio for an improvement in symptoms in the treated group relative to the control group, and seven reported a standardized mean di erence in symptoms, that is, e ect size. The estimate and associated 95 per cent con\u00ffdence interval, and number of subjects, were reported for each individual study. In order to convert the odds ratios to e ect size each odds ratio and associated con\u00ffdence interval was ln-transformed, and the standard error calculated as the width of the con\u00ffdence interval divided by 2 \u00d7 1:96. Each ln(odds ratio) and associated standard error were then converted to e ect size and its standard error by dividing by 1.81. The standard error of each reported e ect size was calculated from the width of the con\u00ffdence interval divided by 2 \u00d7 t df ;0:05 . The two separate meta-analyses in the paper were repeated, as di erent software was used, and then one estimate of e ect size was combined in a single random e ects meta-analysis. Stata 5.0 was used  [8] , which provides the moment estimator of DerSimonian and Laird  [9] , with a random e ects analysis as the authors reported using this if heterogeneity was detected  [2] .\n\nThe results are shown in Table  I . As a positive e ect size represented more symptoms in the treated group, the e ect sizes for studies 6 to 12 have been reversed in sign for the single analysis so that they were comparable with the e ect size derived from the odds ratio for improvement in the treated compared to the control group. Neither of the published separate meta-analyses gave much support to an e ect of house dust mite control measures, but con\u00ffdence intervals were wide. The re-analysis of all 12 studies together provides a narrower con\u00ffdence interval than the seven study e ect size analysis, and con\u00ffrms the conclusion.\n\nCopyright ? 2000 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "This paper does not advocate the use of e ect size. If all outcomes are continuous on the same scale then that is how they should be analysed. Greenland has warned against the use of standardized regression coe cients in meta-analysis  [10; 11] , and although it appears that it is standardizing the explanatory variable that is at the root of most of the problems he reports, caution should also be exercised over e ect size. However, in some cases reviewers have no alternative. It has been shown here that a meta-analysis of odds ratios is equivalent to a meta-analysis of e ect size when there is an underlying continuous distribution, albeit with some loss of power. This also lends some justi\u00ffcation to the combination of odds ratios from studies with di erent outcome variables, or from studies using di erent cut-o points of a continuous distribution.\n\nIf combining e ect size is justi\u00ffed, then meta-analysis of odds ratios is also warranted. From the viewpoint of Greenland's criticism of e ect size this can be reversed; if a meta-analysis of e ect size is rejected then so should one of odds ratios even if the exposure variables are all on the same scale.\n\nWhile neither e ect size nor odds ratio is ideal when the outcome is truly continuous, use of two separate meta-analyses of dichotomous and continuous outcomes can lead to a number of problems. First, neither will have as much power as the combined analysis, and an erroneous conclusion may be reached, a problem also identi\u00ffed by Whitehead et al.  [4] . Secondly, results of the two analyses could con ict. Thirdly, information from one study may be used in both analyses, so the seemingly con\u00ffrmatory results may be little more than a repetition in disguise. Combining the two forces the reviewer to choose one of the estimates from each study, that of direct e ect size to be preferred on grounds of power over e ect size derived from an odds ratio. The estimates from dichotomous and binary outcomes, but not the standard errors, will be of comparable size. This was noted by Whitehead et al. for studies that report both when Normal distributions with common variance are assumed  [4]  and found when the method here presented was applied to the estimates in the study of Hazell et al.  [3] . Fourthly, the studies reporting odds ratios and a continuous outcome may di er in size, and examination of funnel plots  [12]  may erroneously conclude that there is publication bias, or such bias may be undetected because of the reduced number of studies in each analysis. Fifthly, heterogeneity may be undetected, or possibly erroneously reported. Possible causes of heterogeneity should be investigated  [13]  and the more studies that are included the more feasible this becomes.\n\nIn the example it was possible to combine estimates only because e ect sizes were reported directly. Unless e ect size, or a residual standard deviation allowing e ect size to be calculated, is published for each eligible study, reviewers will be unable to carry out a single metaanalysis, and the above problems will continue. The method of Whitehead et al. also requires an estimate of standard deviation from each study  [4] .\n\nBoth methods assume an underlying Normal distribution, although Whitehead et al. also provide for estimation of ln(odds ratio) if the distribution is assumed log-Normal. E ect size assumes a common variance, and Whitehead et al. recommend using this assumption when plausible. The method given here for dichotomous and continuous outcomes is complementary to and simpler than that of Whitehead et al., and should be more powerful in that all the information is retained. The factor of 1.81 for converting ln(odds ratio) to e ect size is an approximation, but a good one over the likely range of use.\n\nNo researcher should assume that results from a single study will be accepted without attempts at replication. To meet Greenland's objections  [10; 11] , provided the continuous outcome variables are on the same scale, a subanalysis of these alone should also be presented on the scale of measurement. If the residual standard deviations are very di erent then this is an indication of heterogeneity that needs to be investigated as much as that in the estimates themselves. The recommendation to report residual standard deviation needs to be incorporated in guidelines for publication by medical journals with an explanation of why this is required."
