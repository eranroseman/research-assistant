  "title": "A Meta-Analysis of the Health Action Process Approach",
  "abstract": "Objective: The health action process approach (HAPA) is a social-cognitive model specifying motivational and volitional determinants of health behavior. A meta-analysis of studies applying the HAPA in health behavior contexts was conducted to estimate the size and variability of correlations among model constructs, test model predictions, and test effects of past behavior and moderators (behavior type, sample type, measurement lag, study quality) on model relations. Method: A literature search identified 95 studies meeting inclusion criteria with 108 independent samples. Averaged corrected correlations among HAPA constructs and multivariate tests of model predictions were computed using conventional meta-analysis and meta-analytic structural equation modeling, with separate models estimated in each moderator group. Results: Action and maintenance self-efficacy and outcome expectancies had smallto-medium sized effects on health behavior, with effects of outcome expectancies and action self-efficacy mediated by intentions, and action and coping planning. Effects of risk perceptions and recovery self-efficacy were small by comparison. Past behavior attenuated the intention-behavior relationship. Few variations in model effects were observed across moderator groups. Effects of action self-efficacy on intentions and behavior were larger in studies on physical activity compared with studies on dietary behaviors, whereas effects of volitional self-efficacy on behavior were larger in studies on dietary behaviors. Conclusions: Findings highlight the importance of self-efficacy in predicting health behavior in motivational and volitional action phases. The analysis is expected to catalyze future research including experimental studies targeting change in individual HAPA constructs, and longitudinal research to examine change and reciprocal effects among constructs in the model.",

      "text": "conceptualized as the most proximal predictor of future behavior. The model differentiates between two distinct stages or phases each comprising sets of constructs and processes that determine behavioral enactment: a motivational phase and a volitional phase. The motivational phase encompasses three sets of social-cognitive constructs implicated in intention formation: outcome expectancies, action self-efficacy, and risk perceptions. Outcome expectancies reflect beliefs about whether engaging in the behavior will result in desired outcomes, action self-efficacy represents beliefs in capacity to perform the behavior, and risk perceptions are beliefs regarding personal risk or susceptibility to particular conditions or outcomes. Research has identified positive relations between these factors and intentions, particularly outcome expectancies and action self-efficacy (e.g.,  Bierbauer et al., 2017; Hattar, Pal, & Hagger, 2016; Maher & Conroy, 2016) .\n\nHowever, research has consistently demonstrated modest intention-behavior relations, suggesting that a substantive proportion of individuals who form intentions fail to enact them  (Orbell & Sheeran, 1998) . Accordingly, the HAPA incorporates two components that operate in the volitional phase involved in the enactment of intentions: self-efficacy and planning. Maintenance or coping self-efficacy reflects an individual's beliefs in their capability to cope with barriers that might derail the intended action. Similarly, recovery self-efficacy reflects an individual's capacity to overcome setbacks and recover from failed attempts to enact the target behavior. Maintenance and recovery self-efficacy are proposed to have direct effects on behavior, and are also expected to be related to each other, and to action self-efficacy. The forms of self-efficacy in the HAPA are, therefore, phase-specific, with action self-efficacy relevant to intention formation, and maintenance and recovery self-efficacy implicated in the enactment and maintenance of behavior.\n\nIndividuals also need to furnish their intentions with preparatory strategies that assist in their implementation. An important strategy that determines intention enactment is planning. The HAPA identifies two forms of planning relevant to behavioral enactment: action and coping planning. Action planning assists individuals in identifying salient cues that lead to action. Consistent with previous theory and research (e.g.,  Heckhausen & Gollwitzer, 1987) , identifying salient cues relating to the situation (when, where) and sequence of actions (how) will lead to more effective recall of intentions, and more efficient, automatic behavioral enactment.\n\nCoping planning entails identification of barriers that might derail intended actions, and generation of plans to manage or overcome them. Action and coping planning are proposed to mediate the intention-behavior relationship in the HAPA; individuals enact their intentions by identifying cues to action and managing contingencies that may derail actions.\n\nResearch has supported the predicted pattern of relations among the HAPA constructs across multiple health behaviors  (Schwarzer & Luszczynska, 2015; Schwarzer et al., 2007) . In terms of the motivational phase, action self-efficacy and outcome expectancies are consistently related to intentions with small-to-medium effect sizes, while risk perceptions have smaller effects. With respect to the volitional phase, maintenance and recovery self-efficacy, and action and coping planning, are consistently related to behavioral enactment, alongside intentions. Further, planning constructs have been shown to mediate the intention-behavior relationship across multiple behaviors (e.g.,  Teng & Mak, 2011; Zhou et al., 2015) . In addition, the HAPA has been used to guide behavioral interventions aimed at changing individual (e.g.,  Lippke, Schwarzer, Ziegelmann, Scholz, & Sch\u00fcz, 2010; Payaprom, Bennett, Alabaster, & Tantipong, 2011)  or multiple (e.g.,  Duan, Wienert, Hu, Si, & Lippke, 2017; Lhakhang, Lippke, Knoll, & Schwarzer, 2015)  constructs from the HAPA, and their effectiveness is supported in randomized controlled trials.\n\nAlthough the extant research has generally supported the predicted effects among HAPA constructs, substantive variability in the effect sizes across studies has been identified (e.g.,  Teng & Mak, 2011; Yeager, Shoji, Luszczynska, & Benight, 2018) , and null effects observed for some of the predicted effects (e.g.,  Barg et al., 2012; Hattar et al., 2016; Maher & Conroy, 2016) . Although observed variations could reflect true variability in model effects, it could also be attributed to methodological artifacts. The aim of the current study was to synthesize effects among HAPA constructs, and their variability, in studies applying the model in health behavior research using meta-analytic techniques to correct for bias. The present study also aimed to test model predictions using meta-analytic structural equation modeling  (Cheung & Hong, 2017; Hagger, Polet, & Lintunen, 2018) . In addition, the extent to which past behavior attenuated model effects was also examined, consistent with previous research  (Hagger, Chan, Protogerou, & Chatzisarantis, 2016) . Effects of five candidate moderators on model relations were also tested: type of behavior, type of sample (student vs. nonstudent and clinical vs. nonclinical), time lag between measures of HAPA constructs and behavior, and study quality. Effects among HAPA constructs and behavior were expected to be attenuated in studies with longer time lag, as longer This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\n\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\n\nlag increases the likelihood that new information will arise that affects model relations. Effects among HAPA constructs were expected to be larger in student samples, because such samples reflect a homogenous group. No specific predictions were made for the moderation of model effects in studies on samples from clinical and nonclinical populations. Finally, model effects were expected to be larger in studies of acceptable quality due to increased precision and lower measurement error."

Five electronic databases (PsycINFO, Medline, EMBASE via Ovid, Web of Science, and Scopus) were systematically searched to identify studies published from 1992 to August 2016. The search terms were developed by the authors based on four key variables of the HAPA (self-efficacy, intention, planning, and behavior). The following search strings were used: health action process approach \u202b\u0621\u202c , OR self-efficacy \u202b\u0621\u202c AND intention \u202b\u0621\u202c AND planning \u202b\u0621\u202c , OR Schwarzer \u202b\u0621\u202c . Additional studies were identified by manually searching reference lists of published reviews of the HAPA and through direct contact with research groups currently conducting, or known to have previously conducted, research on the HAPA."

      "text": "Studies were included if they measured at least four of the key variables that characterize the HAPA: self-efficacy, intention, planning, and health behaviors. Specifically, only studies that measured at least one type of self-efficacy (action, maintenance, or recovery self-efficacy), one type of planning (action or coping planning), intention, and health behavior were included in the analysis. These inclusion criteria were applied to studies regardless of whether the study identified the HAPA as a theoretical basis. In line with  McEachan and colleagues (2016) , health behavior was defined as \"behaviors which impact or have the potential to impact upon the health of an individual in a positive or negative way \" (p. 593). Articles identified in the initial search after removal of duplicates (k \u03ed 3,775) were subjected to a title and abstract screen for eligibility by two members of the research team. The resulting subset of studies was then subjected to full-text review against inclusion criteria to produce a final set of included studies (k \u03ed 95). A PRISMA flow diagram  (Moher, Liberati, Tetzlaff, Altman, & the PRISMA Group, 2009)  of the study search, screening, and selection process is presented in Appendix A in the online supplemental material. Studies using the same data set were consolidated (see Appendix B in the online supplemental material). In addition, some studies used multiple data sets and were treated as separate studies resulting in a final sample of 108 studies (see Appendix B in the online supplemental material). A full list of included studies is available in Appendix C in the online supplemental material."

      "text": "Studies were coded according to the candidate moderator variables: type of behavior, sample type, lag between measures of HAPA constructs and health behavior, and study quality (moderator coding is summarized in the study characteristics table in Appendix D in the online supplemental material). With respect to the behavior type moderator, only two behaviors were the target outcome behavior with sufficient frequency across studies to conduct a moderator analysis (k \u0546 10): physical activity and dietary behaviors. Studies consistently targeting other behaviors numbered relatively few by comparison with insufficient numbers to define moderator groups. Studies were also coded according to the population from which they drew their sample, with samples coded as student and nonstudent, and clinical and nonclinical. Student samples were defined as studies drawing their sample exclusively or predominantly from high school, undergraduate, or postgraduate student populations. Nonstudent samples comprised samples from clinical and general populations. Clinical samples were defined as studies on samples of participants with clinically diagnosed conditions (e.g., diabetes, obesity, cardiac). Nonclinical samples comprised samples from nonclinical populations. Time lag was defined as time, in weeks, between measures of the HAPA constructs and follow-up measures of behavior. Consistent with previous research, studies with a time lag of four weeks or fewer were classified as proximal, and studies with a lag greater than 4 weeks were classified as distal  (McEachan et al., 2016) . This dichotomized variable was used in subsequent moderator analyses.\n\nStudy quality was assessed using a 16-item checklist developed for correlational research  (Hagger, Koch, Chatzisarantis, & Orbell, 2017) . Studies meeting stipulated quality standards on each item were assigned a score of 1 and those not meeting standards, or provided insufficient information for evaluation, were assigned a score of 0. Studies attaining a quality score of 9 or greater were considered of \"acceptable\" quality, whereas studies attaining scores less than 9 were considered of \"questionable\" quality. The dichotomous study quality variable was used in the moderator analysis. The checklist criteria, item descriptions, and scoring method are presented in Appendix E in the online supplemental This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\n\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\n\nmaterial and quality scores for each study are presented in Appendix F in the online supplemental material. Effects of study design (experimental vs. correlational) and type of behavioral measure (self-report vs. objective) were also candidate moderators, but there were too few studies adopting factorial designs to test the isolated effects of an experimental manipulation on individual HAPA constructs, and too few studies adopted non-self-report measures of behavior to compute meaningful moderator groups. In addition, coding other sample characteristics such as age or ethnicity into moderator variables was not possible due to high variability in the characteristic across studies or insufficient data."

      "title": "Data Analysis",
      "text": "Relations among constructs in model tests were estimated using meta-analytic structural equation modeling using the MASEM package (Cheung & Hong, 2017) in R. Meta-analytic structural equation modeling is a two-stage approach to testing a network of structural relations in a proposed model using synthesized correlations from meta-analysis. In the first stage, correlation matrices among constructs of the proposed model from each study included in the analysis are transformed to account for study-specific random effects, enabling them to be analyzed as covariance matrices in a structural equation model. Parameter estimates (intercepts) produced in the first stage represent the zero-order bias-corrected correlations among constructs across studies with 95% confidence intervals. The analysis also yields statistical tests to evaluate homogeneity in each model parameter:  Cochran's (1952)  Q, the 2 statistic, and I 2 statistic and its 95% confidence interval. Statistically significant Q and 2 values with I 2 values exceeding 25% with wide confidence intervals are considered indicative of substantive heterogeneity. Conventional fixed-and random-effects meta-analytic estimates and homogeneity statistics for each correlation were also computed using the metafor packag in R for comparison.\n\nIn the second stage of the analysis, a model representing predicted relations among study variables is fitted to the covariance matrix from the first stage. The proposed process model specified effects among past behavior, motivational self-efficacy, volitional self-efficacy, intention, action planning, coping planning, and health behavior according to the HAPA (see Figure  1 ). For comparison, a model testing the predictions of the HAPA excluding past behavior was also estimated. As goodness-of-fit chi-square values for models in large sample sizes are likely to be statistically significant, model fit was evaluated using multiple goodness-of-fit indices: the comparative fit index (CFI), the Tucker-Lewis index (TLI), the standardized root mean square of the residuals (SRMSR), and the root mean error of approximation (RMSEA). A nonsignificant chi-square value, CFI and TLI values that approach or exceed .90, a SRMSR value of less than .08, and a RMSEA value of .05 or less indicate good fit of the model with the data  (Hu & Bentler, 1999) . Effects among model constructs were evaluated based on the likelihood-based confidence intervals about model parameter estimates. Differences in the effect sizes of the parameter estimates across the models including and excluding past behavior were tested using 95% confidence intervals of the difference in the parameter estimates across the models  (Schenker & Gentleman, 2001) . To the extent that the interval does not include zero, a statistically significant difference in the parameter estimates across models is confirmed. A formal test of difference is also provided using Welch's t test. Both tests require the use of Wald confidence intervals based on symmetric standard errors.\n\nEffects of candidate moderator variables on the proposed relations among constructs in the HAPA were tested by estimating of the model separately in each moderator group. As before, multiple goodness-of-fit indices were adopted to evaluate the adequacy of the model in each moderator group. Differences in model parameter estimates across moderator groups were tested using  Schenker and Gentleman's (2001)  standard method and Welch's t test.\n\nAssessment of bias. The potential effect of selective reporting bias on relations among model constructs in the current sample of studies was evaluated using regression analyses based on funnel plots of effect size on estimates of precision  (Egger, Davey Smith, Schneider, & Minder, 1997) . Two methods are used: the precision effect test (PET) and the precision effect estimate with standard error (PEESE). PET and PEESE estimates for each effect size were computed, with accompanying t tests for bias and significance tests of the corrected effect from zero, using the PETPEESE function in R  (Carter, Schonbrodt, Gervais, & Hilgard, 2017) . Raw data, analysis scripts, and output for all analyses are available on the project website (see  https://osf.io/5nfqs/ )."

Estimates were statistically significant with moderate-to-high levels of heterogeneity. The only exceptions were effects for risk perceptions, for which confidence intervals about the effect size included the value of zero for relations with past behavior, behavior, action self-efficacy, and recovery self-efficacy. Constructs with largest bias-corrected averaged correlations with intentions were action self-efficacy (r \u03ed .418), action planning (r \u03ed .398), and outcome expectancies (r \u03ed .349). Intention (r \u03ed .304), action planning (r \u03ed .305), and, unsurprisingly, past behavior (r \u03ed .447) had the largest correlations with health behavior. Results of conventional fixed-and random-effects meta-analyses and bias statistics using funnel plot-based regression techniques are presented in Appendix G in the online supplemental material. A majority of the effect sizes exhibited statistically significant bias statistics. Given that PET estimates for all effect sizes were statistically significant, the PEESE estimate was taken as the bias-adjusted effect size, consistent with the PET-PEESE approach  (Stanley & Doucouliagos, 2014) . Although the bias-adjusted PEESE estimates generally yielded smaller effect size estimates, they did not alter conclusions with respect the overall effect sizes or difference from zero. Furthermore, precision of the bias estimates may be affected by substantive levels of heterogeneity  (Carter et al., 2017) . These estimates should be indicative of potential bias rather than providing conclusive evidence for small study bias."

Specifically, a model testing HAPA predictions illustrated in Figure  1  was estimated. In addition, a model that included past behavior as a predictor of all constructs in the model was estimated, based on recommendations from previous research to account for potential habitual or nonconscious effects (e.g.,  Hagger, 2019; Hagger, Chan et al., 2016) . Goodness-of-fit and overall homogeneity statistics for the models are presented in Table  2 . Both models exhibited acceptable model fit according to the multiple criteria adopted. Homogeneity statistics indicated substantial overall heterogeneity in model parameters with estimates from the first stage of the analysis. Standardized parameter estimates and confidence intervals for the direct and indirect effects of the proposed models are presented in Table  3  with test statistics comparing differences in parameters for the models that included and excluded past behavior.\n\nFocusing on direct effects in model excluding past behavior, action self-efficacy, outcome expectancies, and risk perceptions were statistically significant predictors of intention, although effect sizes for action self-efficacy and outcome expectancies were substantially larger. Action self-efficacy was a significant predictor of maintenance self-efficacy. Intention significantly predicted action planning, coping planning, and behavior, although effects of the planning constructs were small by comparison. Maintenance selfefficacy also significantly predicted action and coping planning.\n\nMaintenance self-efficacy was a predictor of behavior, but recovery self-efficacy was not.\n\nFocusing on the indirect effects, there were significant indirect effects of intention and maintenance self-efficacy on health behavior mediated by action and coping planning. Action self-efficacy also predicted health behavior through intentions, planning, and maintenance self-efficacy. A substantive proportion of the effect of action self-efficacy on behavior was through maintenance selfefficacy. Specifically, the mediation proportion statistic, which provides ratio of the total effect to a mediated effect, indicated that just over half of the total effect of action self-efficacy on behavior could be attributed to the indirect effect through maintenance self-efficacy (P M \u03ed .620). By contrast, the indirect effects of intention on behavior through the planning constructs was relatively modest compared with the direct effect (P M \u03ed .226). There were also indirect effects of outcome expectancies and risk perceptions on health behavior. Overall the model accounted for a significant nonzero proportion of the variance in intentions (R 2 \u03ed .261) and behavior (R 2 \u03ed .175).\n\nTurning to the model including past behavior, past behavior was a statistically significant predictor of all model variables, risk perceptions excepted. Inclusion of past behavior resulted in a significant attenuation of the direct effects of intentions on behavior, and maintenance self-efficacy on recovery self-efficacy.

There was no further attenuation of HAPA effects in the model as a result of the inclusion of past behavior, although it should be noted that the confidence intervals for the effects of action and coping planning on intentions encompassed zero when past behavior was included in the model. Inclusion of past behavior resulted in modest increases in explained variance in intentions (R 2 \u03ed .284) and behavior (R 2 \u03ed .278)."

      "title": "Truncated Model and Moderator Analyses",
      "text": "Truncated model. The large number of constructs in the full model of the HAPA tested in the current study increased the probability that few or no tests of model effects would be available in some groups of studies defined by the moderator variables precluding comparisons. As a consequence, a truncated model was estimated in which the number of constructs in the HAPA was reduced without compromising its integrity and predictive validity. Given the relatively modest contribution of the risk perceptions construct in predicting intentions and behavior observed in the test of the full model, as well as observations from primary research, risk perceptions was dropped from the truncated model. In addition, given the strong correlations observed between the maintenance and recovery self-efficacy constructs and their joint role in the volitional phase of the model, these constructs were consolidated into a single volitional self-efficacy construct. Maintenance self-efficacy was prioritized in cases where studies measured both variables. The truncated model is illustrated in Figure  2 .\n\nModel fit and parameter estimates from the analysis of the truncated model were consistent with those from the full model. Goodness-of-fit indexes indicated good fit of the model with the data across studies for the model that excluded and the model that included past behavior (see Table  2 ). Model parameter estimates and comparisons are presented in Appendix H in the online supplemental material. In terms of direct effects, action self-efficacy and outcome expectancies predicted intentions. Intentions predicted health behavior, and action and coping planning, with the latter effects small in size. Action self-efficacy predicted volitional self-efficacy, and volitional self-efficacy predicted health behavior, and action and coping planning. With respect to indirect effects, there were indirect effects of intention and volitional self-efficacy on behavior though action and coping planning. Action self-efficacy also predicted behavior through volitional selfefficacy, intentions, and planning. Outcome expectancies also predicted behavior through intention and planning. A substantive proportion of the indirect effect of action self-efficacy on health behavior operated through volitional self-efficacy (P M \u03ed .538), whereas the effect of intentions on health behavior through the planning constructs accounted for a relatively modest proportion of the total effect (P M \u03ed .242). Overall, the model explained significant variance in intentions (R 2 \u03ed .271) and health behavior (R 2 \u03ed .171). Inclusion of past behavior in the model resulted in significant attenuation of intention-behavior relationship, as well as indirect effects of action self-efficacy on behavior, and total effects of volitional self-efficacy and intention on behavior. Explained variance was only slightly higher for intentions (R 2 \u03ed .283), but much greater for behavior (R 2 \u03ed .281).\n\nModerator analyses. Effects of moderators were tested by estimating the truncated model in groups of studies defined by levels of the behavior type, measurement lag, sample type, and study quality moderator variables.

Estimation of the model in groups of studies with dietary behavior and physical activity as the target behavior yielded few differences in effects. Effects of action self-efficacy on intentions were larger in the physical activity sample relative to the dietary behavior sample, while effects of volitional self-efficacy on behavior were larger in the dietary sample (see Table  I1  of Appendix I in the online supplemental material). This translated to larger indirect effects of action self-efficacy on behavior via intention and action and coping planning in studies on physical activity, whereas the total effect of volitional self-efficacy on behavior was larger in the dietary behavior group. Time lag between measures of HAPA constructs and behavior was also tested as a moderator. Measurement lag was expected to attenuate model effects with increasing lag. However, results revealed no statistically significant differences in effects with time lag (see Table  I2  of Appendix I in the online supplemental material). Findings indicate relative consistency in the size of the model effects regardless of whether the behavior is proximal or distal to the measures of model constructs.\n\nFinally, two further methodological moderators of model effects were evaluated: sample type and study quality (see Tables  I3  through I5  of Appendix I in the online supplemental material). Effects of action self-efficacy and outcome expectancies on intention, and volitional self-efficacy on coping planning, were larger in studies on nonstudent samples. However, these effects did not translate into larger indirect and total effects of action selfefficacy, volitional self-efficacy, and outcome expectancies on behavior. Effects of action self-efficacy on intentions, and of intentions on coping planning, were larger in studies on clinical samples compared with studies on nonclinical samples. In contrast, effects of action self-efficacy on volitional self-efficacy, and of intention on behavior, were smaller in studies on clinical samples compared with nonclinical samples. However, these differences were not reflected in the indirect effects of intentions or action self-efficacy on behavior. Larger effects of action self-efficacy on intentions, and of intentions on coping planning, were observed in the analysis on studies adjudged to be of acceptable quality. However, the effect of volitional self-efficacy on coping planning was larger in studies classified as having questionable quality. This translated into larger indirect effects of action self-efficacy on behavior, although the total effect of volitional self-efficacy on behavior did not differ across groups."

      "text": "Results of the present meta-analysis revealed positive, nonzero bias-corrected correlations among HAPA constructs and past behavior across studies with small-to-medium effect sizes. Effects of the risk perceptions and recovery self-efficacy constructs were the only exceptions, with small effect sizes and confidence intervals encompassing zero. Most of the corrected correlations exhibited substantive heterogeneity. Meta-analytic structural equation modeling revealed that action self-efficacy had the largest effects on health behavior through intentions and maintenance self-efficacy. Action and coping planning predicted behavior and mediated effects of intentions and maintenance self-efficacy on behavior, although the direct effect of intentions and maintenance selfefficacy were substantively larger than the planning-mediated effects. Outcome expectancies also predicted behavior through intentions, while effects of risk perceptions were small. The effect of recovery self-efficacy on behavior was also small and encompassed zero. Inclusion of past behavior resulted in significant attenuation of the intention-behavior relationship and the indirect effect of action self-efficacy on behavior. Examination of moderators revealed that effects of action self-efficacy on intentions and behavior were larger in samples with physical activity as the target behavior, while effects of volitional self-efficacy were larger in samples focusing on dietary behavior. Analysis of effects of study quality and sample type did not lead to meaningful differences in the prediction of behavior. Measurement lag did not moderate any model effects.\n\nCurrent research provides support for both the motivational and volitional components of the HAPA, particularly the stage-specific self-efficacy constructs, on health behavior. Results corroborate primary research applying the model in multiple health behaviors  (Schwarzer & Luszczynska, 2015) . Importantly, findings indicate that action self-efficacy, individuals' judgments of their capacity to perform the future behavior, and overcome potential barriers to do so, has a pervasive effect on health behavior. Findings also illustrate that alignment of intentions with these beliefs is a key mechanism by which action self-efficacy predicts health behavior, consistent with the motivational phase. In addition, that maintenance self-efficacy was identified to have a large direct effect on health behavior highlights the importance of volitional components to behavioral enactment.\n\nBy comparison, effects of recovery self-efficacy were modest. However, it must be stressed that recovery self-efficacy is only This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\n\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\n\nlikely to be relevant in situations where individuals experience a behavioral lapse from which they need to recover. Future research comparing the role of recovery self-efficacy in determining behavior in specific contexts where behavioral lapses are likely (e.g., situations where there is high opportunity to participate in rewarding, counter-intentional behavioral options) may demonstrate the context-specific value of this construct. Taken together, results support the segregation of self-efficacy into phase-specific types, particularly action and maintenance self-efficacy, a key feature of the HAPA. Findings also indicate interplay between the selfefficacy components of the motivational and volitional phases. Action self-efficacy was a consistent predictor of maintenance self-efficacy, and maintenance self-efficacy mediated action selfefficacy effects on behavior, illustrating that individuals' estimates of their capacity to engage in health behavior in future align closely with their estimates to maintain that behavior. However, it is important to note that few studies tested effects of these constructs on behavioral maintenance. Future research should examine effects of the self-efficacy constructs, particularly the volitional components, on long-term persistence.\n\nAlthough action and coping planning predicted behavior, and mediated effects of intentions and maintenance self-efficacy on health behavior, findings indicated that these effects tended to be relatively small across studies relative to the direct effects of intentions and maintenance self-efficacy. This was particularly the case when accounting for the effects of past behavior. These findings are consistent with previous HAPA research that did not support the planning-mediated path (e.g.,  Barg et al., 2012; Ernsting, Gellert, Schneider, & Lippke, 2013a) . Although effective planning seems to be implicated in the mechanism by which intentions relate to behavior, effects are modest and other processes may be involved. One possibility is that individuals may not need to consciously form plans in order to enact their behavior, and that the motivational orientation captured by intentions is sufficient to initiate previously developed behavioral schema or scripts for action.\n\nAnother possibility is that planning is a condition under which intentions are converted into action, consistent with theory and research that suggests plans serve to moderate the intentionbehavior relationship  (Hagger, Luszczynska, et al., 2016; Heckhausen & Gollwitzer, 1987) . Finally, a recent perspective is that the indirect effect of intentions on behavior via planning is a function of self-efficacy in the volitional phase  (Yeager et al., 2018) . These alternative pathways were not tested in the current analysis. Systematic tests of these moderation and mediation effects across populations and behaviors are needed to develop an evidence base for these proposed mechanisms. In addition, the potential for constructs representing the presence of existing behavioral 'scripts', developed through previous experience with the behavior, to mediate the effect of intentions on behavior as an alternative to the planning-mediated path should be explored. Constructs such as implicit attitudes and motives may represent these constructs and have been shown to predict intentions and behavior in health contexts (e.g.,  Hagger, Trost, Keech, Chan, & Hamilton, 2017)  but have not, to date, been tested as mediators of the intention-behavior relationship alongside planning.\n\nA further important finding in the current research is the substantially smaller effects of risk perceptions on intentions and, indirectly, on behavior across studies applying the HAPA. These findings suggest that risk perceptions play only a relatively minor role in determining health-related behavior. This is consistent with previous research suggesting that beliefs relating to participation in the behavior itself, such as attitudes, outcome expectancies, and self-efficacy, are more pervasive determinants of health behavior than risk perceptions  (Hagger, Hardcastle, et al., 2016; Hattar et al., 2016) . One important potential moderator may be type of behavior. Risk perceptions are unlikely to have a pervasive influence on health-related behavior unless the behavior has a clear, explicit, and proximal link to reduced risk (e.g., taking prophylactic medication, safety behaviors, vaccination) or are pertinent to an 'at risk' population (e.g., cardiac rehabilitation patients). Such a link may be less apparent for behaviors such as healthy eating or physical activity in healthy populations. Given the preponderance of studies on diet and physical activity in the current sample, the small effects of risk perceptions are unsurprising. In addition, given research suggesting that effects of risk perceptions on intentions and behavior are dependent on individuals' self-efficacy to act to minimize risk  (Kok, Peters, Kessels, Ten Hoor, & Ruiter, 2018) , testing the interactive effects of self-efficacy and risk perceptions on health behavior may provide further insight into the process by which risk perceptions determine action.\n\nThe current analysis identified relatively few effects of moderator variables on relations among the HAPA constructs. Most pervasive was the effect of behavior type, with larger effects of action self-efficacy on intentions and, indirectly, behavior in studies with physical activity as the target behavior, and larger effects of volitional self-efficacy on behavior in studies with dietary behaviors as the target behavior. These findings indicate variation in the factors that contribute to enacting these behaviors. Physical activity tends to be a behavior that is predominantly enacted on the basis of motivational factors and intentions, whereas dietary behaviors, particularly those requiring individuals to avoid tempting, palatable foods, are also likely to be subject to desires and affective responses. This is consistent with research demonstrating direct effects of affective attitudes for dietary behaviors compared with physical activity  (Lawton, Conner, & McEachan, 2009) . Volitional self-efficacy, as the capacity to overcome barriers and manage contingencies that may derail behavior is, therefore, more likely to be an important correlate of these behaviors. In contrast, behaviors like physical activity are less subject to impulse-related desires that draw attention away from the goal-directed behavior.\n\nAnother moderator effect of note was the smaller effect of intentions on behavior in clinical samples relative to nonclinical samples. This finding suggests that individuals with clinical conditions have greater difficulty in enacting their intentions. Although this was not corroborated by differences in the contribution of volitional constructs to behavior, it may be that the differences in intentions across the samples may be due to the moderating effects of perceived behavioral control and volitional constructs in the model such as action planning and volitional self-efficacy. For example, the smaller effects of intentions in clinical samples may be due to lower perceived behavioral control over behavior among patients. Similarly, patients in clinical samples with better plans or higher volitional self-efficacy may have larger intention-behavior effects than those with poorer plans and lower self-efficacy. Exploring these interaction effects is an important avenue for future research.\n\nPast behavior had a number of salient effects in the current analysis. Past behavior predicted all constructs and attenuated the size of the intention-behavior effect. Research has suggested that past behavior models habits and previous decision making. For example, research adopting social-cognitive models has demonstrated that measures of habit mediate past behavior effects  (van Bree et al., 2015) , and it has been suggested that social-cognitive variables mediate effects of past behavior on subsequent behavior  (Ajzen, 2002) . Mediation of past behavior effects on future behavior by constructs from social-cognitive approaches like the HAPA represent the extent to which individuals have formed those beliefs and act on them. The mediation of past behavior also illustrates how well the model functions as a means to explain behavioral stability over time. Considering that past behavior is often a substantive predictor of future behavior  (Hagger, Chan, et al., 2016) , the absence of mediation of past behavior on subsequent behavior by model constructs may render a model redundant as an effective means to explain behavior, and as a means to guide interventions that may be effective in changing behavior. Current findings support the relevance of the HAPA in this regard as there were substantive nonzero indirect effects of past behavior in subsequent behavior through the HAPA constructs.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that the substantive residual effect of past behavior means that it remains an important predictor of future behavior, and that the overall variance in behavior accounted for by the model is relatively modest. Nevertheless, it is also important to consider that past behavior is also a function of the social-cognitive constructs identified in the HAPA, so there is a need to account for those determinants in order to assess the unique effects of past behavior on subsequent behavior. There is also a need to identify potential mediators that explain the residual effect of past behavior on future behavior in the HAPA. Likely candidates may be self-reports of habit and measures of implicit beliefs, which represent the automatic, nonconscious processes that lead to behavior independent of the more conscious, deliberative processes represented by the belief-based constructs  (Hagger, Chan, et al., 2016; Hamilton, Kirkpatrick, Rebar, & Hagger, 2017; van Bree et al., 2015) .\n\nWhat practical recommendations arise from current findings? Results point to the value of self-efficacy as an influential correlate of intentions and health behavior. Two forms of self-efficacy had pervasive effects on behavior in the current analysis: action and maintenance self-efficacy. Interventions may, therefore, seek to apply strategies that target change in these constructs self-efficacy. Strategies such as providing opportunities to experience, or reflect on, past success with the behavior, developing skills to effectively set appropriate goals and monitor goal progress, provision of appropriate feedback on progress, enhancing skills to manage setbacks, and providing appropriate actual or self models to provide vicarious experience of success with the behavior, such as through imagery, would be appropriate self-efficacy enhancing strategies  (Bandura, 2004; Conroy & Hagger, 2018) . These suggestions come with the caveat that effects of these constructs on behavior in the current analysis were relatively modest, and that the current study focused on behavioral prediction rather than behavior change. In addition, although the current analysis indicates that interventions based on planning and risk perceptions may not have desired effects in promoting health behavior, we did not test the potential interactive effects of planning and intention, and risk perceptions and self-efficacy, on health behavior. Ruling out these constructs as potential intervention targets may be premature.\n\nStrengths of the current analysis include application of a rigorous hypothesis-testing framework to estimate the size and variability of relations among HAPA constructs, and test its predictions, across multiple studies in health contexts, the use of appropriate synthesis and model testing analytic procedures, and the testing of salient moderator variables. However, several limitations should be noted. First, all data from the current sample of studies were treated as correlational in design. Although a number of data sets included in the present analysis adopted experimental or intervention designs, the manipulations or intervention conditions targeted change in multiple constructs within the model. Very few studies reported experimental or intervention conditions that targeted change in isolated constructs within the HAPA  (Lippke et al., 2010; Luszczynska et al., 2016) , which precluded generation of effect sizes among HAPA constructs derived from experimental or intervention designs. This clearly points to the imperative of future experimental or intervention studies adopting factorial designs, which apply strategies that target change in individual components of the HAPA. It indicates that inference of causal relations among HAPA constructs cannot be inferred from the current analysis, and that the direction of the paths tested in the current models are inferred from theory rather than the data.\n\nCurrent findings are based on data focusing on prediction rather than change. Even though inclusion of past behavior provides useful information on the effectiveness of the HAPA in accounting for behavior stability, future research should adopt cross-lagged panel designs, which would permit the modeling of change in behavior as a function of change in HAPA constructs (cf.,  Jacobs, Hagger, Streukens, De Bourdeaudhuij, & Claes, 2011; Scholz, Nagy, G\u00f6hner, Luszczynska, & Kliegel, 2009) . It would also allow for the testing of specific directional and reciprocal effects among study variables.\n\nAlthough the current analysis tested a model comprising the core components of the HAPA, few studies included measures of action control. Action control is a further volitional construct included in the extended model, which reflects individuals' use of self-regulatory skills such as self-monitoring to regulate their behavior. Although researchers are increasingly including action control as a determinant of behavior in HAPA tests, very few of the included studies comprised measures of the construct (k \u03ed 10), and the number of studies reporting relations between action control and some of the other HAPA constructs was small, and in some cases zero, precluding the inclusion of this construct in the model test. As research incorporating this construct accumulates, sufficient data might be available in the future to include this construct in meta-analytic tests of the model.\n\nIt is important to note that substantial heterogeneity was observed in the parameter estimates of the models across studies. Although these estimates provide evidence of nonzero effect sizes, they are not highly precise as estimates of the true effect size. In addition, current moderator analyses did not resolve the heterogeneity. As the body of research testing the HAPA in health contexts expands, future research syntheses may be able to test effects of additional moderators on model relations. For example, intentions may be an important moderator of model effects. Higher intentions may lead to larger effects of motivational constructs on behavior, This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\n\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\n\nwhereas lower intentions may lead to larger effects of volitional constructs. Similarly, planning may moderate the effects of intentions on health behavior, and risk perceptions may moderate effects of self-efficacy on health behavior. However, high withinstudy variability in these continuous moderators, and the use of different measures of these constructs across studies, precluded precise coding of moderator groups. In addition, few studies reported tests of interaction effects among continuous moderators in the model, and those that did neglected to report the necessary effect size data to test the interactions. As more studies testing interactions using continuous moderators become available, future syntheses of moderator effects using continuous variables will become feasible.\n\nThat the literature search in the current review was restricted to English-language items is a further limitation. Such a restriction may constitute a further source of bias in the findings. However, there is evidence to suggest that such restrictions do not pose a threat to the validity of conclusions drawn  (Morrison et al., 2012) . Nevertheless, we acknowledge this as a potential limitation and suggest that future research syntheses adopt search strategies without language restriction.\n\nThe current study is the first to provide comprehensive cumulative estimates of the effect sizes and variability among constructs of the HAPA in studies in health contexts. The current analysis makes a unique contribution to knowledge by testing model predictions using synthesized relations among model constructs and examining effects of past behavior and candidate moderators on relations in the model. Findings provide important information on the HAPA constructs that most reliably predict intentions and behavior across health behaviors, and the processes involved. For example, results indicate that action and maintenance self-efficacy have pervasive effects on health behavior, and that effects of action self-efficacy are indirect through intentions and planning. Current findings have utility in that they provide researchers with information on the key processes to target when applying the model to predict health behavior and contribute to the evidence base of constructs that may be targets in behavior change interventions. The current analysis is also expected to set the agenda for future research to address gaps in knowledge in the application of the HAPA to health behaviors. Future research should test causal effects among model constructs by targeting change in individual HAPA components, adopt panel designs to model change and reciprocal effects, and test additional mechanisms such as the interactive effects of risk perceptions and self-efficacy, and planning and intentions, on health behavior."
