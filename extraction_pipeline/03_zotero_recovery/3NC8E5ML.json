  "title": "Changes in Menopausal Risk Factors in Early Postmenopausal Osteopenic Women After 13 Months of High-Intensity Exercise: The Randomized Controlled ACTLIFE-RCT This article was published in the following Dove",
  "abstract": "The menopausal transition is a critical period in women's lives. Exercise might be the most promising non-pharmaceutic intervention to address the large variety of risk factors related to the pronounced estradiol decline during peri-and early-postmenopause. The aim of this study was to determine the effect of an 18-month multipurpose exercise program on risk factors and symptoms related to the menopausal transition. Fifty-four women 1-5 years postmenopause with osteopenia or osteoporosis were randomly assigned 1) to a high impact weight-bearing/high-intensity/velocity resistance training group (EG: n=27) exercising three times a week or 2) to an attendance control group (CG: n=27) that performed low-intensity exercise once a week. Both groups were supplemented with cholecalciferol and calcium. The primary study endpoint was bone mineral density (BMD) at lumbar spine (LS) and total hip, secondary outcomes were lean body mass (LBM), total and abdominal body percentage, metabolic syndrome Z-Score (MetS-Z), menopausal symptoms and muscle strength and power. Due to COVID-19, the study was stopped after 13 months. We observed significant effects for BMD-LS (EG: 0.002\u00b1.018 versus CG: -.009\u00b10.018 mg/cm2, p=0.027) but not for BMD total hip (EG: -0.01\u00b1.016 versus CG: -.009\u00b10.020 mg/cm2, p=0.129). LBM improved significantly in the EG and decreased in the CG (0.39\u00b11.08 vs -0.37\u00b11.34 kg, p=0.026). Total and abdominal body fat improved significantly in the EG and was maintained in the CG (-1.44\u00b11.49 vs -0.02\u00b11.55 kg, p=0.002 and -1.50\u00b12.33 vs 0.08\u00b12.07 kg, p=0.011). Significant effects in favor of the EG were also determined for menopausal symptoms (p=0.029), hip/leg extension strength (p<0.001) and power (p<0.001). However, changes of the MetS-Z did not differ significantly (p=0.149) between EG and CG. In summary, with minor exceptions, we demonstrated the effectiveness of a multipurpose exercise protocol dedicated to early-postmenopausal women on various risk factors and complaints related to the menopausal transition.",

      "text": "The consequences of the menopausal transition considerably affect women's lives. In addition to the psychosocial effects,  1  the pronounced perimenopausal/early postmenopausal decline of estradiol (E2)  2, 3  frequently initiates clinical changes including accelerated bone loss,  4  changes in body composition,  5, 6  functional declines  7, 8  and/or menopausal symptoms.  9 Exercise might be the most promising non-pharmaceutic intervention  [10] [11] [12] [13]  to address the variety of (early) menopausal risk factors and complaints.  [13] [14] 4] [15] [16]  However, considering that exercise protocols are in general specifically aligned to one outcome or condition, the challenge of designing comprehensive exercise programs for (early-) menopausal women is obvious. We addressed the issue of designing a multipurpose exercise protocol for early-menopausal women in two earlier exercise studies;  17, 18  however, in the present ACTLIFE (Physical ACTivity: the tool to improve the quality of LIFE in osteoporosis people) study we additionally (1) set out to condense the exercise program to reduce the time demand and (2) particularly focused on relatively young women with osteopenia and osteoporosis who were not eligible for pharmacologic therapy due to their young age. The time-effective highintensity endurance and resistance exercise approach specifically dedicated to women in their early fifties might be considered as the unique selling point of the ACTLIFE study. Correspondingly, the aim of ACTLIFE was to determine the effect of an 18-month multipurpose exercise program on risk factors and symptoms related to the menopausal transition, with specific regard to changes in BMD.\n\nThe primary hypothesis was that the exercise group (EG) of early postmenopausal women with osteopenia and osteoporosis would show significantly higher effects on a) BMD at the LS and b) total hip compared with an attention control group (CG).\n\nSecondary hypotheses were that the EG would show significantly higher effects on a) soft (bone free) lean body mass, b) total and c) abdominal body fat, d) cardiometabolic risk, e) menopausal symptoms and f) physical fitness compared with an attention CG."

Briefly, using a pool of about 9600 contact data records provided by the municipality, 2500 women aged 48-60 years living independently in the area of Erlangen-N\u00fcrnberg, Germany were randomly selected and contacted by personalized letters that included the most relevant eligibility criteria (eg, menopausal status, exercise). A total of 332 women responded by phone or letter and were further assessed for eligibility by phone calls. Eligible women were then invited to bone densitometry and structured interviews to validate their inclusion. We included women with a) early-menopause status defined as 12-60 months amenorrhea, b) osteopenia or osteoporosis without fractures up to a BMD T-Score of -4 SD at the lumbar spine, femoral neck or total hip. Women with a higher fracture risk (ie, BMD T-Score >4 SD) are entitled to pharmaceutic therapy according to German guidelines  20  and therefore excluded from the study. Women who reported a) medication (ie, Glucocorticoids >5mg/d), conditions and diseases known to affect bone metabolism or contraindicate group exercise or tests; b) high impact or resistance exercise (>45 min/ week) during the last 5 years, ie, exercises with high ground reaction forces like \"running\"; c) secondary osteoporosis or osteoporotic fractures; d) acute or recent history of cancer (last 5 years); e) regular \"high\" alcohol consumption (ie, \u226560 g/d on 5 days/week); f) potential unavailability for more than 6 weeks between January 2019 and September 2020 (ie, during the study period) were excluded (Figure  1 ).

      "text": "In summary, our exercise protocol was tailored to the complex risk factor profile of (early) postmenopausal women and used a multimodal approach. We placed particular emphasis on BMD at LS and hip with a mixture of weight-bearing exercise mainly involving aerobic dance with moderate to high ground reaction forces, jumping and resistance exercise. The latter was designed as singleset exercise training (HIT-RT) with high intensity and effort using intensifying strategies.  21 The intervention was structured in blocks of 10-12 weeks of highintensity/high effort exercise, interspersed with 4-5 weeks of recreational exercise between each phase. During the 10-12 week phases, three supervised group sessions/week (s/w) with 8-10 participants/group were conducted in our lab (Mondays and Wednesday \u224840min) and a dedicated women's gym that offered RT (Friday or Saturday \u224860 min) on devices, while during the recreational phase one supervised session in our lab was replaced by a video-guided individual home session of 15 min involving exercises practiced during the joint sessions. During the first four weeks of exercise, we focused on briefing, familiarization, learning of correct movements and lifting technique, body sensation and the use of the rate of perceived exertion approach.\n\nAerobic sequence. After 5 min of low-impact aerobic dance for warm-up, participants took part in 15 min of high impact aerobic dance with 6-10 varying movements of progressively increasing mechanical intensity (ground reaction forces: GRF: 2.0-3.0 body mass; ground reaction forces of different movements were determined in previous studies with comparable cohorts of early postmenopausal women).  17, 22 In summary, 80-120 high impact movements were conducted during each aerobic dance session. After 4 weeks of moderate-intensity continuous exercise, we applied high-intensity interval training (HIIT) with varying cardiovascular exercise intensity. Once a week, 60 seconds of high-intensity phases (\u224880-85% HRmax) were interspersed with 60 seconds of lower intensity (\u224865-70% HRmax) exercise, the second session Clinical Interventions in Aging 2021:16 submit your manuscript |  www.dovepress.com"

      "text": "applied a corresponding 30s/30s exercise protocol. Exercise intensity was checked by regular analysis of the heart rate monitors provided to the participants. HRmax was determined by a stepwise treadmill test to a voluntary maximum, using steps of 3 min, speed increases of 1 km/h and 1% incline of the treadmill. Apart from high exercise intensity and proper movements, emphasis during the aerobic dance session was on enjoyment and interaction of the participants rather than complicated choreographies.\n\nAfter 6 months, we introduced a dedicated jumping sequence. We applied a jumping course with 7 step boards of varying height that participants jumped over or on. This jump sequence was repeated 8 times with 20s of rest between each repetition. Step-boards were progressively elevated (from 20 to 36cm) over the course of the intervention. Peak GRF for the deep jump from the highest step board averaged at about 4-4.5x body mass.\n\nDynamic resistance exercise training (DRT) can be considered a key component of our exercise protocol. Participants were provided with detailed training logs that prescribed exercises, number of repetitions (gym) or loading duration (circuit), movement velocity and absolute exercise intensity (or \"effort\").\n\nAfter the initial 4-week conditioning phase, we introduced the periodized DRT approach and applied three (intensity-based) linearly periodized 4-week phases, with every fourth week as a recovery week with low effort. During the DRT sequence conducted in our lab, a singleset approach that addressed all the main muscle groups (calf rises, lunges, leg-press, half squat, (half) squats; back extension (roman chair), deadlifts; single side lateral rows, trapezius and latissimus pulldowns, bench dips, incline dumbbell bench press) was applied in a circuit mode. Correspondingly, we did not prescribe the number of reps but the duration of the loading cycles, which varied between 40s, 60s and 80s and the time under tension per repetition (TUT: 2s (concentric) -1s (isometric) -2s (eccentric), = 2-1-2). We consistently applied 30s of rest between the exercises. Thus, the number of repetitions (reps) averaged between 8 (40s) and 16 reps (80s). Exercise intensity during the first 12-week block was prescribed as repetition maximum minus 1-2 reps.  23, 24 uring the second 12-week (phase 2) high-intensity DRT period, we manipulated movement velocity. Applying a TUT that varied between explosive movement (except back extension and deadlift) -1s (isometric) 1s/(isometric) -2s (eccentric) and 4s -0s -4s, the number of repetitions (reps) ranged between 5 and 20 reps per session. Similar to Phase 1, exercise intensity was prescribed using the repetition in reserve (RIR) approach of Zourdos et al,  24  and the set endpoint definition of Steele et al,  23  (nRM; repetition maximum minus 1-2 reps). After 32 weeks of exercise (phase 3), we introduced the repetition maximum approach.  23 Set endpoint was when trainees completed the final repetition possible, but if the next repetition was attempted, they would definitely achieve muscular failure (ie, inability to conduct the rep). Comparable to the previous training period movement velocity and the number of reps/loading cycle was flexibly manipulated; relative intensity varied from 60% 1 RM for 20 reps (80s; 2-0-2) and 80% 1RM for 6 reps (30s; expl. -1s-3s). Of importance, sets conducted with explosive movements were consistently nRM sets. After 4 weeks of low effort exercise, in Phase 4 we introduced the dropset approach, typical for HIT-RT. We manipulated the order of exercises within the circle to address either the same/related muscle groups (eg, lunges-leg press-half squat) or agonist and antagonist (eg, leg press-deadlift) in a row. Two or three exercises were included in a superset sequence. Intermitted by 5 weeks of low effort exercise, we conducted the present follow-up assessment and aimed to start with Phase 5 in March 2020. Phase 5 should focus on work to failure, simplified the inability to (properly) conduct the concentric phase of the current rep.  23 owever, due to COVID-19 lockdown, we had to stop exercising and after 2 months of obligatory break we finally stopped the study initially designed for 18 months.\n\nApart from circuit training in our lab, participants trained on dedicated resistance training machines in a women's gym once a week (Fridays or Saturdays). In general, the exercise training on devices was structured much the same way, the only difference being that the number of reps rather than the time of the loading cycle (circuit) was specified. Women completed a 15-minute warm-up on a cross-trainer (65-70% HRmax), before starting the DRT. The supervised single-set exercise approach of the gym training addressed 13-15 exercises (leg press, -extension, -curls, -adduction, -abduction, latissimus front pulleys, rowing, roman chair, trunk extension, -flexion, inverse fly, bench press, military press, lateral raises, shoulder/triceps press). Similar to the circuit training, we scheduled a linearly periodized exercise protocol with a varying number of repetitions, movement velocity, and varying intensity (nRM to RM; 5-20 reps at nRM -1 rep corresponding to 65-82.5% 1RM  25  ) with a rest between the sets averaging 60 s-120 submit your manuscript |  www.dovepress.com"

Lower and upper calf, hamstring, thigh, gluteal, hip flexors, lower and upper back, abdominal, and pectoralis sites were exercised with one set of stretching routines each with 30 s/ exercise of moderate intensity.

All the tests/assessments were conducted at the same time of day (\u00b190 min), at the same location, using the same calibrated devices, but not always (ie, blood sampling, strength/power assessments) by the same test assistant. Body height was determined using a Holtain stadiometer (Crymych Dyfed., Great Britain), body mass was assessed using the scale function of the direct-segmental, multi-frequency Bio-Impedance-Analysis (DSM-BIA; InBody 770, Seoul, Korea). Total and regional body composition and areal BMD at the lumbar spine (LS) between L1-L4 vertebrae and total hip (TH) were assessed by DXA (QDR 4500a, Discovery-upgrade, Hologic Inc., Bedford, USA). Abdominal body fat was segmented between the lower end of the 12th thoracic vertebra and the upper end of the iliac crest. Segmentation of LS and TH area and regional body composition (ie, abdominal region, thigh region) was conducted using the \"compare mode\", so that baseline area and placement of the baseline assessment could be reproduced exactly during the FU assessments.\n\nBlood was drawn from an antecubital vein after an overnight fast between 7:00 and 9:00 on a different day from the DXA, blood pressure or functional assessments. Serum samples were centrifuged for 20 min at 3000 RPM; glucose, total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol and triglycerides (Olympus Diagnostica GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) were immediately analyzed in the \"Zentrallabor\" of the Medical Department, FAU.\n\nImmediately after 10 min of rest (during DXA assessment), blood pressure (RR) was evaluated in a lying position with an automatic oscillometric device (Bosco, Bosch, Jungingen, Germany). Subjects were requested to arrive at the assessment in a relaxed, non-fasting condition but having refrained from coffee or tea for at least 2 hours prior to testing. We calculated Mean Arterial Pressure (MAP) (diastolic RR + diastolic RR + systolic RR)/3.\n\nWe calculated the MetS-Z-Score using the International Diabetes Federation definition  27  and applying the approach of Johnson et al,  28   We used an isokinetic leg press (CON-TREX LP, Physiomed, Laipersdorf, Germany) to determine maximum isokinetic leg/hip extensor strength. We conducted the test in a sitting, slightly supine position, hip and chest fixed with straps. The participants' feet were positioned on a flexible sliding footplate and also fixed with straps. The range of motion was 30\u00b0 to 90\u00b0 within the knee angle; velocity of the movement was 0.2 m/s. Emphasis was placed on the concentric part of the movement (ie, hip/ leg extension). After familiarization with the testing procedure, the women conducted five reps with maximum effort (\"push as strongly as possible\"). Two minutes of rest were specified between the two trials. The higher value of both trials was included in the data analysis.\n\nWe determined lower extremity power by a countermovement jump (CMJ) with hands on hips (ie, no arm swing) during the trial. We asked participants to \"jump as high as possible\" starting from an upright position. Countermovement depth was not specified. We asked participants to maintain extension in the hip, knee, and ankle joints to prevent any additional flight time by bending their legs. Jumping height (present outcome) and power were determined by a force platform (KMP Newton GmbH, Stein, Germany). The jumping height was calculated automatically by the software provided by the manufacturer based on ground reaction forces.\n\nAll participants had to complete a standardized baseline questionnaire  17  that asked for a) demographic parameters; b) diseases, physical limitations and pharmacologic therapy under special consideration of osteoporosis risk and ability to frequently conduct intensive exercise; c) dietary supplements; d) pain frequency and severity at the lumbar spine region; e) lifestyle, with high emphasis placed on physical activity and exercise;  30  and f) menopausal complaints as per the Menopause Rating Scale (MRS II) provided by Hauser et al.  29, 31  After 7 and 13 months, all participants had to complete a follow-up (FU) questionnaire that particularly focused on changes in parameters (ie, pharmacologic therapy, diseases, operations, lifestyle, diet, exercise) that might have affected the present study outcomes. Strong emphasis was placed on checking questionnaires for consistency, completeness and accuracy together with the participants.\n\nFour-day diet records were completed at baseline and after 7-and 13-month FU.

Corresponding differences between the groups were non-significant (p=0.129, SMD=0.38; Table  2 ). Thus, we reject our primary hypothesis that the EG demonstrated greater effects on BMD at the LS and total hip compared with an attention CG.

However, in order to generate a multipurpose exercise protocol, we included types of exercise (eg, endurance exercise) that also focus on other risk factors related to the menopausal transition. Despite the sophisticated exercise protocol, BMD at the total hip showed no change as a result of the intervention.

One may argue that the early-postmenopausal status of our participants might have contributed to this difference; however, a recent meta-analysis-  16  indicates a somewhat higher (. . . but non-significant) plausible explanation for the rather low effects on BMD might be the careful gradual progression of the exercise intensity in the present intervention. This gradual progression might not have reached a threshold for bone adaption until 5-6 months. With the remaining 7 months of exposure to \"effective\" exercise too short to elicit the full amount of mineralized bone,  41  assuming bone adaptation in adults is triggered predominately by remodeling.  42, 43 lthough the loading intensity triggered by HIT-DRT (up to \u224880% 1RM; corresponding to 5 reps with nRM) and high impact aerobic dance (up to GRF 3.0 body mass) applied after the short conditioning should have stimulated bone metabolism in predominately untrained females, the aforementioned highly effective 8-month study of Watson  40  suggests otherwise. Finally, the \"exerciseinduced\" effects in the attention control group may have confounded our result. However, one session of 45 or 15 min, respectively, of easy floor exercises, flexibility and wellbeing should not relevantly affect BMD changes (Table  2 ) in the CG.  44, 45 Indeed, LS and TH-BMD developments of the CG were inconspicuous considering the average menopausal age (3.7 \u00b1 1.0 yrs) in this group. In this context, it should be considered as a study limitation that we applied a rather broad window of 5 years for the \"early postmenopause\". However, the most prominent bone decline might occur during the 3-year phase of the transmenopause, ie, one year before and two years after the final menstrual period.  36 part from bone, LBM and body fat are also negatively impacted by the menopausal transition.  46, 47 We found significant positive effects on both parameters. However, the effect on LBM was of a much smaller magnitude (0.76; 95% CI: 0.10 to 1.43 kg) than described in provided by a recent meta-analysis  48  of younger (\u226450 years) women (1.45, 0.4-3.3 kg). Nevertheless, applying a similar exercise protocol (EG: 3x 45-60 min/week, intense RT and high impact exercise for 12 months vs CG: low intensity exercise) in our earlier TRACE study on early postmenopausal (1-3 years post) women  18, 22  revealed comparable results (0.54, 0.13 to 0.94 kg). We observed an ongoing LBM effect with a \u224850% higher LBM effect after 13 months compared with 7-month FU (0.52, 0.17-0.88 kg). Effects on total and abdominal body fat were high (SMD: 0.72 and 0.92). Total body mass decreased significantly by about -4% (or -1.15\u00b11.23 kg) in the EG and was maintained in the CG. A parallel, slightly less prominent development was observed for abdominal body fat percentage (Table  3 ). In general, aerobic exercise (AE) is considered more effective for decreasing body fat compared with RT.  49  However, the TRACE study,  18, 22  which applied a \u224850% higher AE volume (with similar exercise intensity up to 80-85% HFmax) compared to ACTLIFE, was unable to demonstrate effects on total and abdominal body fat mass (p\u2265.703, SMD<0.2). Of note, unlike LBM, total and abdominal body fat did not decrease after 7 months. This is surprising, since the literature attributes a considerable proportion of fat reduction to increases in resting metabolic rate induced by muscle mass.  50, 51 ACTLIFE-RCT did not determine significant effects on the MetS-Z-Score (Table  4 ). Considering the positive effects on body composition and their recognized association to cardiometabolic risk factors  [52] [53] [54]  expectations of positive effects on MetS-Z-Score were justified. Few exercise studies have used the MetS-Z as a study outcome, even fewer focus on mixed aerobic/resistance type or dedicated resistancetype exercise.  [55] [56] 6] [57] [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63]  While Bateman et al  55  and Earnest etal  58  did not report positive effects of a 4-or 9-month DRT in people with diabetes mellitus type II or overweight, sedentary people, other studies that applied 3-4 months of RT  56, [60] [61] [62]  or mixed AE/RT protocol  57, 59  have verified significant positive effects on the MetS-Z-Score in male  60, 61  and among predominately postmenopausal female cohorts.  56, 57, 59, 62 The results largely reflect our 4-month study results, even though effort (RM) and intensity (up to 85% 1RM) of the exercise protocol were progressively increased.\n\nWe determined significant positive effects on menopausal symptoms as determined by the MRS II scale.  29 owever, we did not observe significant exercise effects in the three underlying MRS II components, ie, the somatovegetative, psychological and urogenital dimensions. Previous studies reported positive exercise effects on psychological factors  64, 65  and conflicting effects on vasomotor symptoms.  66, 67 This inconsistency in findings may be due to which MRS II components were included under \"somato-vegetative dimension\".\n\nImprovements in maximum hip/leg extensor strength and power (ie, maximum jumping height) averaged 27% (95%-CI: 19-36%) and 18% (95%-CI: 12 to 23%) from submit your manuscript |  www.dovepress.com"

Nevertheless, maximum strength changes were lower compared with other DRT trials in comparable female cohorts (30-85%).  [68] [69] 9] [70] [71] [72] [73]  It is likely that this difference is due to the high baseline values in our cohort and slight improvements in the attention CG.\n\nDue to the unintended termination of the study, some features and limitations of ACTLIFE-RCT have to be addressed. 1) The intended 18-month duration meant that we progressed gradually placing emphasis to a stepwise progression of exercise intensity/effort. However, the premature study termination led to the most intense (. . . and speculative \"effective\") part of the protocol, ie, the last 6 months, being truncated. Although when applying a strictly progressive protocol, one may argue that the majority of the physiological changes occurred during the first year,  74  due to the nature of the remodeling cycle  41  this may be less relevant for changes in BMD.\n\n2) Due to the rapid closing of training and assessment facilities combined with the partial lock-down in Bavaria, we were forced to conduct our retests within three days (ie, Friday to Sunday), moreover with only 1 day advance notice. Due to this narrow window, seven participants were unable to join the tests. Although we applied ITT with the imputation of missing values and thus reached the calculated sample size of 25 participants per group, there is some evidence that we lost power compared with the calculation of a full dataset.  75 3) Unlike pharmaceutic agents, exercise is a comprehensive tool which, if properly designed and applied, might positively address a large variety of biomedical variables. Thus, it is challenging to design and evaluate exercise protocols that aimed to address several aims important for health and performance. Due to necessary compromises and the need  76, 77  for time-effective training protocols, some parameters might not be optimally addressed. As shown by corresponding systematic reviews/meta-analysis, this approach results in lower overall effects; furthermore, the statistical procedures for handling multiplicity are difficult and debatable. 4) We introduced an active (attention) control group to give women in the CG an opportunity to exercise and so, without being too apparent, prevent those women from doing uncontrolled exercise with potentially more bone-specific effects. Considering that a waiting control group is not an option for an 18-month study, we opted for full communication of pros and cons of both groups, which can be considered as the reason why 21 women refused to be randomly assigned to the groups. Despite the low-intensity and low volume exercise protocol of the CG, considering the widely untrained status of our women, the exercise protocol may have affected some of the study endpoints addressed. Thus, we speculate that some changes between groups (eg, performance parameters, menopausal complaint) might be less pronounced compared to an approach with an \"inactive\" CG. 5) Baseline Vitamin D levels of both groups were below the recommended concentration but significantly improved after 13 months of supplementation. As studies have shown a positive effect of vitamin D supplementation on bone density,  78  there is some evidence that Vit-D supplementation might have contributed to our result.\n\nFinally, it is difficult to endorse an exercise protocol that had to be terminated after 13 of the planned 18 months and might therefore not have fully generated its potential effect -particularly on BMD. The advantages of the exercise protocol are its attractiveness, feasibility and safety. In summary, however, we have added further evidence that a multipurpose exercise program positively affects a multitude of risk factors and complaints related to the menopausal transition or increasing age."
