  "abstract": "Objective: To describe the development and application of logic model templates for systematic reviews and health technology assessments (HTA) of complex interventions \n Study design and setting: This study demonstrates the development of a method to conceptualise complexity and make underlying assumptions transparent. Examples from systematic reviews with specific relevance to sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and other low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) illustrate its usefulness. Results: Two distinct templates are presented: the system-based logic model, describing the system in which the interaction between participants, intervention and context takes place; and the process-orientated logic model, which displays the processes and causal pathways that lead from the intervention to multiple outcomes. \n Conclusion: Logic models can help authors of systematic reviews and HTAs to explicitly address and make sense of complexity, adding value by achieving a better understanding of the interactions between the intervention, its implementation and its multiple outcomes among a given population and context. They thus have the potential to help build systematic review capacity -in SSA and other LMICs -at an individual level, by equipping authors with a tool that facilitates the review process; and at a system-level, by improving communication between producers and potential users of research evidence.",

Logic models can help build capacity by equipping authors of systematic reviews and health technology assessments (HTAs) of complex interventions with a tool to develop their own intervention-, question-and context-specific logic model; they can also help improve communication of research evidence between evidence producers and users.\n\n\u2022 The system-based and process-orientated logic model templates described are a valuable tool to guide the entire process of a systematic review or HTA of a complex intervention.

      "text": "Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) is affected by an overwhelming burden of diseases and injuries  [1]  and faces considerable challenges in health service provision. Addressing this burden requires a wellfunctioning health system and a variety of curative and preventive interventions relevant to the African context, many of which can be considered complex. Policy-makers and healthcare practitioners need to consider the evidence about the benefits and harms of these interventions, if they are to make optimal use of limited resources  [2] . Systematic reviews provide the most complete and reliable evidence on intervention effectiveness, whilst taking stock of existing research and critical gaps  [3] . This is crucial to reduce wasting resources on unnecessary research, especially in SSA and other low-and middle income countries (LMICs)  [4, 5] . In these settings, a number of challenges hinder research evidence use, including a paucity of existing systematic reviews relevant to LMICs  [2, 3, 6]  and limited capacity for research synthesis. In a recent situation analysis,  Oliver et al. (2015)  identified a lack of overall systematic review capacity in LMICs, including individual, team, institutional and system capacity. The authors highlight a need to develop methods and build capacity to address complex heath system and health policy questions; a need linked to strengthening the relationship between producers and users of evidence  [7] ."

      "text": "The UK Medical Research Council's guidance on complex interventions  [8]  resulted in wide use of the term. However, the complexity of the intervention itself is only one of many sources of complexity  [9] . In evidence synthesis, complexity can relate to the characteristics of any part of the PICO question, i.e. population, intervention, comparison or outcomes, and to methodological issues inherent in the included primary studies  [10] . Additional complexity can be found in the unique circumstances under which the intervention is delivered and in non-linear pathways and feedback loops between intervention and outcomes, interactions between direct and indirect effects of the intervention, as well as between different intervention components  [11] . Petticrew (2011)  explains that complexity does not have to be an inherent characteristic of an intervention, but rather that interventions can have simple and complex explanations, depending on the perspective adopted and the research question asked  [11] .\n\nA series of six papers published in the Journal of Clinical Epidemiology in 2013, provides the first concerted attempt to address complexity in systematic reviews at each stage of the process from formulating the question  [10] , to synthesizing evidence  [12]  and assessing heterogeneity  [13]  to\n\nreviewing the applicability of findings  [14] . The series concludes with a research agenda, emphasizing methodological areas needing further development and testing  [15] ."

      "text": "Logic models have been defined in various ways  [16]  and can be described, inter alia, as conceptual frameworks, concept maps or influence diagrams. Anderson et al (2011)  argue that logic models \"describe theory of change\", \"promote systems thinking\" and contribute both in a conceptual and analytical way  [17] . This resonates with our understanding of the use of logic models in systematic reviews and health technology assessments (HTA). For the purpose of this paper, we refer to a logic model as \"\u2026 a graphic description of a system \u2026 designed to identify important elements and relationships within that system\"  [17, 18] . Logic models can help conceptualize complexity  [19]  by (i) depicting intervention components and the relationships between them, (ii) making underlying theories of change and assumptions about causal pathways between the intervention and multiple outcomes explicit  [17] , and (iii) displaying interactions between the intervention and the system within which it is implemented. Such a graphic representation is particularly helpful as a mechanism for making transparent assumptions among researchers and other stakeholders, and making results more accessible to a potentially broad range of decision-makers, including clinicians, public health practitioners and policy-makers. In essence, logic models provide a framework to support the entire systematic review or HTA process and help to interpret the results, as well as to identify areas where further evidence is needed.\n\nTwo main approaches to logic modeling can be distinguished: a priori and iterative logic modeling.\n\nWith an a priori approach, the logic model is developed at the protocol stage to refine the research question, identify sources of heterogeneity and subgroups, design the data extraction form and plan data synthesis. This type of logic model is finalized prior to data collection and remains unchanged throughout the systematic review or HTA process  [17, 20] . In an iterative approach, the logic model is conceived as a mechanism to incorporate the results of the systematic review or HTA and is subject to repeated changes during the process of data collection  [21] . While both approaches have their advantages and drawbacks (Booth et al, manuscript in preparation), this paper focuses mainly on a priori logic modeling.\n\nExamples of logic models in systematic reviews and HTAs of public health and healthcare interventions exist, but specific guidance on how to develop an appropriate logic model is lacking.\n\nNoyes et al (2013) highlight the need for a taxonomy of logic models, logic model templates and a better understanding of the impact of the choice of logic model  [15] ."

After removal of duplicates and exclusion of irrelevant studies, we identified 18 published systematic reviews that included a logic model and one HTA that referred to the different phases of a logic model, but did not include a diagram. Thirteen  [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] [33] [34]  of the reviews identified, used logic models at the beginning of the review process (a priori) to describe different aspects in the population, interventions, outcomes and context or pathways linking the intervention to final outcomes. Four of the reviews developed logic models to summarize and synthesize the results of the systematic review  [35] [36] [37] [38] . One review mapped the results of the review to an a priori logic model  [39] .\n\nWe then examined aims and various elements of the logic models identified and, using a snowball technique, reviewed existing guidance for developing logic models in primary research. We particularly looked at the guidance of the Kellogg Foundation  [18]  and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force  [40] , both of which are frequently cited. These shaped our thinking around the distinction between system-based and process-orientated logic models. Drawing on the conceptualization of complexity within the INTEGRATE-HTA project, we developed two draft templates. For the systembased logic model, our starting point was the PICO framework to formulate clear research questions  [41, 42] , represented through a box for each of the elements: participants (P), interventions (I), comparisons (C) and outcomes (O). We then added boxes on context and implementation given their recognized importance for complex interventions. Elements within these \"empty boxes\" were specified based on existing definitions of complex interventions  [8, 9, 11, 43]  and a concept analysis for context and implementation  [44] . For the process-orientated logic model, we started by representing the intervention components with boxes and adding separate boxes for each level of"

This perspective is mostly static: while it recognizes that interactions between different elements of the model take place, these are not investigated in detail. The PICO elements form the core elements of the logic model, supplemented with context and implementation elements. An example of a completed system-based logic model is presented in Figure  2 .\n\nA process-orientated logic model graphically displays the processes and causal pathways that lead from the intervention to its outcomes. Unlike the system-based logic model, it recognizes a temporal sequence of events and aims to explain how an intervention exerts its effect. It can also be described as an analytical framework or theory of change. The process-orientated logic model template is shown in Figure  3 . As the causal pathways will differ between interventions, often combining several linear and non-linear pathways, the template suggests four general pathways. Figure  4  presents an example of a completed process-orientated logic model."

      "text": "These logic model templates may be used in systematic reviews of effectiveness, systematic reviews of broader questions (e.g. regarding values and preferences, implementation or prevalence) and HTAs. While the illustrative examples provided in this paper adhere to an a priori logic modeling approach, the same templates provide the starting point for iterative logic modeling. Importantly, logic model development takes place upon initiation of a systematic review or HTA. With an a priori logic modeling approach, the initial logic model forms part of the protocol and typically does not change once the review or HTA process has started. The templates aim to facilitate the development of an appropriate initial logic model and to guide a research team in considering a broad range of issues that might be of relevance. They are a tool to be adapted to the needs of specific research questions, not a straitjacket. The template elements are thus neither essential nor exhaustive, i.e. elements might be added to or removed as necessary.\n\nWhen applying the templates, a review team needs to start by considering which of the two types of logic model would be most suitable. This primarily depends upon (i) the nature of a given complex intervention and (ii) the specific research question asked. Generally, starting with a system-based logic model affords a holistic perspective, which is especially relevant for broad interventions such as packages or approaches to healthcare management or delivery. A process-orientated logic model may be used in addition to, or in rare circumstances, as stand-alone, where the composition of the intervention is well understood but the focus is on elucidating the details of how the intervention operates. For the logic model on interventions to reduce ambient particulate matter air pollution (Figure  2 ), a system-based logic model helped us to understand the relationship between various interventions, ambient air quality and human health outcomes in their societal and environmental context  [45] . This type of logic model was appropriate, because we wanted to depict the system in which interactions take place rather than the causal pathways that link intervention and outcomes.\n\nThe authors of the Cochrane review on community-level interventions for improving access to food in low-and middle-income countries  [49]  developed a process-orientated logic model (Figure  4 ) to display and understand the pathways from intervention to final outcomes. For the systematic review on evidence-based health care e-learning, we applied both templates  [46] . The system-based logic model was critical for conceptualising the question, unpacking the various e-learning interventions and considering important contextual factors, enabling us to pre-specify subgroup analyses and plan data synthesis (Figure  5 ). The process-orientated logic model was also useful to illustrate how the intervention works, interpret the importance of outcomes and identify gaps in the evidence-base (Figure  6 )."

Decide within the author team whether a system-based or a process-orientated logic model is to be developed. If the main aim of the logic model is to conceptualize the question, the systembased logic model will be appropriate, but if it is more important to explain the pathways from the intervention to the outcomes a process-orientated logic model should be chosen, ideally in addition to the system-based logic model. 3. Populate the logic model template with information obtained through literature searches, discussions within the author team and consultations with content experts. Ensure that the logic model reflects all the factors that can potentially cause heterogeneity between studies. 4. Ask important stakeholders, e.g. members of a stakeholder advisory panel or review advisory group, for input and refine the logic model accordingly. 5.

The logic model is developed for a specific review and therefore does not have to be a perfect reflection of the world but should depict the assumptions contained in the review.\n\nTherefore, the logic model can have a substantial impact on the way a review is conducted.\n\nCommencing with a different logic model, and/or development by another review team, might lead to different results.\n\nSecondly, the process of logic model development might take an extensive amount of time, delaying subsequent stages of the already time-consuming review process. Yet, we found that investing in a logic model is time well spent, as this clarifies inclusion criteria and the search strategy, and lends structure to data extraction and analysis."

      "text": "Systematic reviews that can help provide answers for the vast array of challenges in SSA have become a necessity  [2, 62] . Our logic model templates equip review authors with a tool to address complexity in an explicit manner, thereby mainly building capacity at an individual level. However, they also have the potential to enhance the capacity of the system  [7]  through improved communication between producers and users of evidence. They add value to the review process in terms of achieving a better understanding of the many interactions between the intervention and its multiple health outcomes among a given population. An example of this is the logic model for the review on food security (Figure  4 ). This enables authors to synthesise the results in a meaningful way so that various stakeholders might find them more useful.\n\nAnother key feature of our templates is that they enable an assessment of the context within which the intervention takes place. This is essential for interventions in LMICs, where the context differs considerably from high-income countries. For example, although ambient air pollution is a global problem, its mitigation requires different strategies in different contexts. The system-based logic model on interventions for reducing ambient air pollution depicts the essential contextual factors that need to be taken into consideration when planning the implementation of a particular intervention.\n\nStrengthening research capacity in conducting research synthesis is of utmost importance and has been widely advocated as a means of overcoming the paucity of evidence relevant to SSA and other LMICs  [3, 5, 7, [63] [64] [65] . We envisage that the logic model templates will support novice and experienced review authors by making complexity less daunting.

They also guided protocol development by informing the search strategy, inclusion and exclusion criteria, possible sources of heterogeneity, data analysis plans as well as subgroup and sensitivity analyses. All of the reviews and the HTA are currently ongoing, so the full value of the logic models in the later stages of the reviews is yet to be realized. We anticipate that the logic M A N U S C R I P T A C C E P T E D ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 10 model will provide a framework within which the results can be anchored and assist in the interpretation thereof."
