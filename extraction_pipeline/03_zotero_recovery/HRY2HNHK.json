  "title": "Current Implementation of Digital Health in Chronic Disease Management: Scoping Review",
  "abstract": "Background: Approximately 1 in 3 adults live with multiple chronic diseases. Digital health is being harnessed to improve continuity of care and management of chronic diseases. However, meaningful uptake of digital health for chronic disease management remains low. It is unclear how these innovations have been implemented and evaluated. Objective: This scoping review aims to identify how digital health innovations for chronic disease management have been implemented and evaluated: what implementation frameworks, methods, and strategies were used; how successful these strategies were; key barriers and enablers to implementation; and lessons learned and recommendations shared by study authors. Methods: We used the Joanna Briggs Institute methodology for scoping reviews. Five databases were searched for studies published between January 2015 and March 2023: PubMed, Scopus, CINAHL, PsycINFO, and IEEE Xplore. We included primary studies of any study design with any type of digital health innovations for chronic diseases that benefit patients, caregivers, or health care professionals. We extracted study characteristics; type of digital health innovation; implementation frameworks, strategies, and outcome measures used; barriers and enablers to implementation; lessons learned; and recommendations reported by study authors. We used established taxonomies to synthesize extracted data. Extracted barriers and enablers were grouped into categories for reporting. Descriptive statistics were used to consolidate extracted data. Results: A total of 252 studies were included, comprising mainly mobile health (107/252, 42.5%), eHealth (61/252, 24.2%), and telehealth (97/252, 38.5%), with some studies involving more than 1 innovation. Only 23 studies (23/252, 9.1%) reported using an implementation science theory, model, or framework; the most common were implementation theories, classic theories, and determinant frameworks, with 7 studies each. Of 252 studies, 144 (57.1%) used 2 to 5 implementation strategies. Frequently used strategies were \"obtain and use patient or consumer feedback\" (196/252, 77.8%); \"audit and provide feedback\" (106/252, 42.1%); and piloting before implementation or \"stage implementation scale-up\" (85/252, 33.7%). Commonly measured implementation outcomes were acceptability, feasibility, and adoption of the digital innovation. Of 252 studies, 247 studies (98%) did not measure service outcomes, while patient health outcomes were measured in 89 studies (35.3%). The main method used to assess outcomes was surveys (173/252, 68.7%), followed by interviews (95/252, 37.7%). Key barriers impacting implementation were data privacy concerns and patient preference for in-person consultations. Key enablers were training for health care workers and personalization of digital health features to patient needs.",

      "text": "Chronic diseases are among the biggest health threats, causing approximately 41 million deaths yearly  [1] . Chronic disease management is especially difficult because these diseases do not occur in isolation; approximately 1 in 3 adults have multiple chronic conditions  [2] , and the probability of developing multiple comorbidities increases with age  [3] .\n\nDigital health is a rapidly growing industry that could potentially enhance health outcomes, with its growth accelerated by the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of digital health enabled continuity of care during the COVID-19 pandemic, especially for chronic disease management, when in-person care was limited  [4, 5] . An estimated 20% or US $1.8 trillion of the world's health care spending is wasteful, and digital health has the potential to lower health care spending by tackling this waste  [6] . Despite its benefits, meaningful uptake of digital health for chronic disease management has been relatively low  [7] . Some known barriers to adoption include lack of access and availability of digital health  [8] , poor user interface, suboptimal clinical integration, and lack of transparency about the datasets used for the development of digital health tools  [9] .\n\nThe uptake of health care innovations can be addressed using implementation science. Implementation science is defined as the scientific investigation of ways to increase the adoption of evidence-based practices and research findings into routine clinical use  [10] . It is underpinned by theoretical frameworks collectively known as implementation science theories, models, and frameworks (henceforth, for simplicity, implementation science frameworks). Nilsen's taxonomy of implementation science frameworks shows 5 categories (Textbox 1): process models, determinant frameworks, classic theories, implementation theories, and evaluation frameworks  [11] .\n\nTextbox 1. Descriptions and examples of theories, models, and frameworks used in implementation science."

      "text": "Process models: These models are used to detail and facilitate the process of bridging the gap between research and routine clinical practice.\n\nExamples are the Knowledge To Action framework  [12]  and the Ottawa Model  [13] .\n\n\u2022 Determinant frameworks: These are frameworks that provide a list of factors for analysis that could affect implementation outcomes. Examples are Theoretical Domains Framework  [14]  and Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research  [15] .\n\n\u2022 Classic theories: These are theories used to analyze the factors that shape implementation outcomes, usually drawn from other disciplines, such as psychology and organizational theory  [11] . Examples are the Theory of Planned Behavior  [16] , Social Cognitive Theory  [17] , and Situated Change Theory  [18] .\n\n\u2022 Implementation theories: These are theories generated from implementation research to understand and address elements that shape implementation outcomes. An example is Normalization Process Theory  [19] .\n\n\u2022 Evaluation frameworks: These are frameworks to guide the evaluation of implementation efforts. Examples are the RE-AIM (reach, effectiveness, adoption, implementation, and maintenance) framework  [20]  and the framework for Outcomes in Implementation Research  [21] .\n\nProspective use of implementation science frameworks can aid the development, implementation, and evaluation of digital health innovations  [11] . Retrospective application of implementation science frameworks, although less common, can be used to understand an innovation's success or failure  [22] . Given the plethora of implementation science frameworks available, the choice of framework largely depends on the study aim. For example, if the study aims to prospectively explore potential barriers and enablers to the implementation of an innovation, a determinant framework, such as the Consolidated Framework for Implementation Research, would be appropriate.\n\nThe advantage of underpinning real-world implementation efforts with an appropriate implementation science framework is the ability to generate reliable translation, spread, and scale-up for evidence-based innovations  [23] ."

In light of the current knowledge gaps, this scoping review aimed to identify how digital health innovations for the management of chronic diseases have been implemented.\n\nSpecifically, to understand what implementation frameworks, methods, and strategies were used; how successful these strategies were; what were the key barriers and enablers to implementation; what lessons were learned; and what recommendations were shared by the respective study authors.\n\nFindings will be useful to clinicians and researchers planning to implement digital health innovations."

Acceptability is the impression among stakeholders that the specific innovation is agreeable, adoption is the initial desire to test or use a given innovation, and appropriateness is the perceived suitability of the innovation in a particular context. Cost refers to both the cost of the innovation and the cost of implementation. Feasibility is the extent to which an innovation can be effectively implemented in a specific context, and fidelity is the extent to which the innovation was implemented as intended. Penetration is the integration of the innovation into health care services, and sustainability is the degree to which an innovation and its ensuing benefits can be effectively maintained in a specific context  [21] .\n\nIn Proctor's outcomes for implementation research, various types of stakeholders are recognized; for example, administrators, payers, health care providers, and patients or consumers and their family members, to name a few  [21] .\n\nHence, an implementation outcome, such as \"acceptability,\" would hold different salience for each type of stakeholder  [21] .\n\nFor clarity, in this review, we chose to foreground the perspectives of target users for the implementation outcome \"acceptability.\"\n\nHence, we can group the 8 outcomes proposed by Proctor et al  [21]  into the following three groups: (1) outcomes from a user perspective that are a function of innovation design (acceptability, adoption, appropriateness, and feasibility); (  2 ) the implementation process (fidelity); and (3) outcomes that foreshadow embedment in routine practice from an organizational perspective (cost and cost-effectiveness, penetration, and sustainability)."

Patient preference for in-person consultations  [53, 66, 83, 84, 89, [93] [94] [95]  and their level of comfort with digital health or technology in general  [66, [96] [97] [98] [99]  were common barriers to the implementation of eHealth, mHealth, telehealth, and wearables. The lack of manpower  [63, 80, 85, [100] [101] [102] [103] [104]  and the preference of health care workers for in-person consultations with patients  [43, 60, 78, 85, 90, [105] [106] [107]  were shared barriers for eHealth, mHealth, and telehealth innovations. The lack of integration with electronic medical records  [60, 80, 81, 90, [108] [109] [110] [111] [112] [113]  was a reported barrier for both eHealth and mHealth.

For telehealth, unique barriers included health care workers facing difficulties evaluating patients over the internet  [104]  and the lack of space and equipment for patients and health care workers to attend and conduct telehealth visits, respectively  [63, 83, 98, 104, 105, 115, 116] . Barriers unique to wearables include the presence of discomfort after wearing the item  [41]  and patients' lack of trust in the technology  [65] .

However, health care workers often perceive it as an increase in workload  [110] . For digital health innovations to be successful, it is important for them to be tailored to the patient's needs  [37, 41, 67, 83, 84, 86, 87, 89, 111, 115, 119, 121, 212, [220] [221] [222] [223] [224] [225] [226] [227] ,\n\nto enhance the patient-provider relationship  [90] , and to complement physical appointments  [57, 105, 222, 228] . Effective communication between implementation stakeholders is required  [87, 98, 229] , and ongoing evaluation is needed to ensure that the uptake remains high  [60] . In addition, the benefits of digital health need to be evident to target users  [230] .\n\nTo increase the uptake of digital health, support from relevant authorities is needed [109], along with raising awareness of its benefits  [45, 78]  and embedding it into existing workflows  [60, 90] . Other ways to increase uptake include the provision of resources required for implementation  [98, 225, 231] , the presence of technical support  [37, 60, 225, 231] , and training for target users  [60, 213, 225] . In addition, digital health innovations should be user-friendly  [41, 45, 219, 231, 232] , target users should be included in its development and implementation  [60, 66, 110, 221, 233, 234] , and a transition stage should be included for target users to adapt to the innovation  [60] ."

Study authors recommended conducting a study of a longer duration  [37, 51, 230, [235] [236] [237] [238] [239] [240]  or conducting a larger study  [74, 96, 120, 210, 224, 232, [241] [242] [243] [244]  for future studies. Many authors also recommended using controlled trials for future studies  [54, 97, 110, 112, 113, 207, 208, 211, 230, 231, [245] [246] [247] [248] [249] [250] [251] [252] [253] [254] [255] [256] . Some suggested larger or long-term trials  [97, 110, 112, 113, 207, 211, 245, 246, 248, 250, 253, [255] [256] [257] , while others proposed clinical trials in general  [258, 259]  or having a control group  [46, 56, 96, [260] [261] [262] [263] .\n\nFurthermore, some authors recommended future research in other contexts, such as different countries or cities  [43, 59, 68, 88] , different health care systems  [59, 68]  or settings  [47, 211, [264] [265] [266] , different stakeholder groups involved in the implementation  [43, 80, 96, 267] , different demographics in terms of age  [268]  or socioeconomic status  [222, 269] , more diverse demographics  [89, 91, 104, 107, 110, 232, 243, 257, 258, 264, 266, 270] , different illnesses  [271] [272] [273] [274] , or severity of disease  [99] . In contrast, other authors suggested focusing on patients with similar illness classification  [242, 275] .\n\nOther proposals pertinent to implementation include using different implementation strategies  [76] , monitoring different outcomes  [36, 107, 225, 276] , collecting outcomes more frequently  [277] , or understanding the association between different features of the innovation and their corresponding outcomes  [55, 278, 279] . Other suggestions include personalizing the innovation to individual users  [88, 95, 121, 258, 280] , having more extensive user testing  [115, 273, 281] , or making relevant changes to current features of the innovation based on the research findings  [213, 219, 241, 282, 283] .\n\nMoreover, several authors recommended focusing on efficacy  [43, 45, 49, 70, 217, 247, 256, [284] [285] [286] [287] , validation  [229] , effectiveness  [65, 210, 221, 258, [288] [289] [290] , cost-effectiveness  [45, 96, 115, 247, 281] , clinical applicability  [291] , or usability of the innovation  [292] . Other proposals include using a mixed methods approach for future studies  [43, 45, 218, 248, 293]  or qualitative research methods to understand target users' experiences with digital health  [42, 43, 45, 59, 230] ."

      "title": "Principal Findings",
      "text": "This review bridges a critical gap in the deployment of digital health innovations for the management of chronic diseases by eliciting how such innovations have been implemented and evaluated to date. We conducted the review through the lens of implementation science to generate actionable findings for future real-world implementation of digital health innovations.\n\nFirst, >90% of the 252 studies included in this review did not report using an implementation science framework for planning, guiding, or evaluating the real-world deployment of digital health technologies, despite the availability of many suitable frameworks to guide implementation  [11] . This reportedly low use of implementation science frameworks may be due to implementation science being an emerging field. Hence, awareness and the potential usefulness of such frameworks for implementing digital health technologies are not yet widespread. Of the studies that reported using an implementation science framework, implementation theories, classic theories, and determinant frameworks were the most frequently used. Implementation science frameworks developed specifically for the deployment of digital health technologies were rarely used; for example, only 3 studies used the Normalization Process Theory and none used the Nonadoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability framework  [294] .\n\nOf 252 studies, only 23 (9.1%) leveraged an implementation science framework. Study authors used these frameworks to underpin qualitative data collection, data analysis, or interpretation of findings; to inform the design of behavior change and implementation strategies to enable successful deployment; and for the evaluation of implementation outcomes. Although most included studies (229/252, 90.9%) did not formally use implementation science frameworks to guide implementation, these studies have, nevertheless, addressed or incorporated some elements of these frameworks. For example, 48.8% (123/252) of the studies assessed barriers and enablers affecting implementation. The low use of implementation science frameworks represents missed opportunities to generate reliable translation and scale-up of evidence-based innovations through a deeper understanding of contextual influences and eliciting mechanisms of implementation, as well as productive theorizing of implementation research  [23, 295] .\n\nSecond, of the studies that measured implementation or patient outcomes, most (188/227, 82.8%) reported positive implementation or patient outcomes despite the low use of implementation science frameworks in the deployment of digital health innovations. Target users generally found digital health to be acceptable and feasible, and study authors reported high adoption. Only 6 (2.4%) of the 252 studies included appropriateness and sustainability as outcome measures to evaluate implementation, and the results were mixed. Of the studies that measured patients' health outcomes or quality of life, 77% (64/83) reported improvements, with patients being generally satisfied with digital health. These outcomes were mainly assessed using surveys (173/252, 68.7%); this is unsurprising as surveys are commonly used in health services research  [296] . Most surveys contained at least 1 validated scale to assess outcomes (103/173, 59.5%) or were created by study authors  (85/173, 49.1%) .\n\nThird, the most commonly used implementation strategies were evaluative and iterative strategies as per the ERIC taxonomy  [202] ; this is not surprising, given the relatively higher importance and feasibility of these strategies  [202] . Studies focused on innovation development used a variety of co-design strategies with target users, such as patients and health care professionals. Strategies such as obtaining user feedback and conducting pilots before implementation were necessary, considering that most of the digital health innovations were in the early stages of real-world deployment."

      "title": "Comparison to Prior Work",
      "text": "Overall, the findings from this review are similar to previous scoping reviews in emphasizing the usefulness of digital health innovations, and they are viewed positively by target users  [297] [298] [299] . Willis et al [297]  observed that many included studies found statistically significant improvements in implementation outcomes (eg, adoption and acceptability) and health care performance outcomes (eg, validated health measures), congruent with the findings of our review. Patel et al [298]  highlighted that numerous studies indicated that many participants were willing to use digital health innovations, especially if they are personalized to target users' needs and preferences, which is a key enabler found in our review. Likewise,  Lim et al [299]  argued that most participants found digital health innovations highly acceptable and perceived them to be convenient, user-friendly, and practical. Despite the above, many studies in this review indicated numerous barriers that could affect implementation. Notable barriers include concerns over data privacy  [37, 38, 43, 45, [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92]  and patients' preference for physical consultations  [53, 55, 66, 83, 84, 89, [93] [94] [95] . While it remains to be seen whether the convenience and flexibility of accessing health care via digital modalities would trump patient preference for physical consultations, assuming the quality of care is not compromised, ensuring data privacy is nonnegotiable. Not being able to assure data privacy is arguably the most formidable barrier affecting successful implementation  [300, 301] .\n\nIn our review, two-thirds (171/252, 67.9%) of the included studies examined acceptability as an implementation outcome, followed by feasibility  (38/252, 15.1%) , and adoption (32/252, 12.7%). Other implementation outcomes, such as penetration, sustainability, appropriateness, fidelity, and cost, were infrequently reported (number of studies ranged between 1 and 6 studies). Similarly, a recent scoping review by  Proctor et al [302]  investigating the progress of implementation outcomes research found that 52.5% (210/400) of their included studies examined acceptability  [302] . Fidelity was the next most commonly examined outcome (157/400, 39.3%), followed by feasibility (154/400, 38.5%), adoption (106/400, 26.5%), and appropriateness  (87/400, 21.8%) . Implementation outcomes such as penetration (64/400, 16%), sustainability (63/400, 15.8%), and cost (31/400, 7.8%) were relatively less frequently examined [302], albeit in higher proportions of included studies compared to our review. Our finding that service outcomes were rarely reported (5/252, 2%) contrasts with that reported in the scoping review by  Proctor et al [302] , where a small percentage (22/400, 5.5%) of included studies not only reported service outcomes but also examined the relationship between implementation outcomes and service outcomes."

    {
      "title": "Limitations and Strengths",
      "text": "There are several limitations to this review. First, the identification and classification of implementation strategies and outcomes for included studies were not without challenges, as studies used various terms to describe these constructs. To reduce errors and to ensure consistency in the interpretation of terms for the purposes of data extraction, we piloted the data extraction form and resolved discrepancies before actual extraction.\n\nSecond, we were not able to judge how well implementation strategies were carried out, regardless of whether an implementation science framework was used or not, apart from documenting the outcomes reported by the study authors. We cannot rule out that in some included studies, the outcomes were suboptimal due to poorer execution of implementation strategies rather than the lack of an implementation science framework to underpin the work per se. Third, we did not assess the quality of reporting against the Standards for Reporting Implementation Studies (StaRI)  [303] , as not all included studies explicitly claimed to be an implementation study. StaRI comprises a 27-item checklist spanning both the implementation strategy and the clinical, health care, or public health intervention (the innovation) being implemented. According to StaRI, study authors should describe the scientific background and explain their rationale for selecting the underpinning implementation theory, model, or framework and implementation strategies. Study authors should do the same for the innovation being implemented and include a description of the evidence of its effectiveness  [303] . Adhering to StaRI would also require a description of how the \"selected strategy is expected to achieve its effects\"; for example, a logic model or pathway showing hypothesized mechanisms of action for how each implementation strategy is expected to bring about desired patient outcomes  [303] . The logic model or pathway does not replace the use of an implementation theory, model, or framework to underpin the work of implementation.\n\nFourth, we did not include preprints or unpublished literature, which might have affected our findings. Digital health is a rapidly growing field, and pioneering innovations may have yet to be published in peer-reviewed journals. However, preprints are more likely to capture the development and validation phases of digital health innovations rather than last-mile real-world implementation, which is the scope of this review.\n\nStrengths of this review include a comprehensive search strategy and broad inclusion criteria to ensure that we capture as many relevant studies as possible. The included studies are not limited to a particular geographical region or type of digital health innovation, thus allowing a representative overview to be generated. We categorized the findings on barriers and enablers to understand differences related to patients, health care workers, and external factors across different digital health innovations, which will be useful for planning and designing future implementation studies."
    },
    {
      "title": "Future Directions",
      "text": "This scoping review generated a summary of how digital health in chronic disease management is currently implemented. The benefit of using implementation science frameworks was not unequivocal and was out of the scope of this review. Nevertheless, our findings established a basis for future studies to investigate whether using an implementation science framework (and how well it is used) compared to not using one would yield better or more consistent outcomes. In addition, we agree with  Proctor et al [302]  that future studies testing the relationships between implementation strategies and implementation, service, and patient outcomes are needed.\n\nThe digital health innovation being implemented should not unduly burden target users, whether patients or health care providers. Investing in co-design with target users as early as practicable is a smart way to ensure that the innovation is fit for purpose and to pre-emptively identify user issues. However, as users and contexts continually evolve and change, acceptability of digital health innovation may change with time. Hence, the acceptability of the innovation should be assessed at several time points, and the findings should be used to inform iterative improvements in innovation design.\n\nThe process of deployment is as important as the features of the innovation. Target users require adequate preparation and support throughout the implementation. It should be ensured that process measures and adverse events are monitored consistently and addressed. Planning for and monitoring sustainability should be a key outcome measure, given the not-insignificant investment of resources in digital health."
