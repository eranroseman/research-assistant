  "title": "A systematic review and meta-analysis in the effectiveness of mobile phone interventions used to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy in HIV infection",
  "abstract": "Background: Antiretroviral therapy is effective in preventing the progression of HIV to AIDS, but adherence to HIV medication is lower than ideal. A previous Cochrane review concluded that SMS interventions increased adherence to HIV medication, but more recent trials have reported mixed results. Our review aims to provide an up-to-date synthesis of the effects of interventions delivered by mobile phone on adherence. Methods: We searched Cochrane, Medline, CINAHL, EMBASE and Global Health for randomised control trials (RCTs) of interventions delivered by mobile phones, designed to increase adherence to antiretroviral medication. Risk of bias was assessed using the Cochrane risk of bias tool. We calculated relative risk ratios (RR) or standardised mean difference (SMD) with 95% confidence interval (CI). Trials were analysed depending on delivery mechanism and intervention characteristics. We conducted meta-analysis for primary objective outcome measures. \n Results: We identified 19 trials. No trials were at low risk of bias. Interventions were delivered as follows; nine via text message, five via mobile phone call, one via mobile phone imagery and four via mixed interventions. There was no effect when interventions delivered by text message were pooled in the RR1.25 (CI 0.97 to 1.61) P = 0.08. The SMD 0.42 (0.03 to 0.81) p = 0.04 showed a moderate effect to improve adherence. There was mixed evidence of the effect of text messages delivered daily, weekly, at scheduled or triggered times, however, messages with link to support, interactivity and three or more behavior change techniques (BCTs) all improved adherence. Of the five trials delivered by mobile phone call, one reported a reduction in HIV viral load. One trial using mobile phone imagery reported a reduction in HIV viral load. Three trials that delivered interventions by text message and mobile phone counselling reported improved biological outcomes. \n Conclusion : Specific interventions, of proven effectiveness should be considered for implementation, rather than mobile phone-based interventions in general. Interventions targeting a wider range of barriers to adherence may be more effective than existing interventions. The effects and cost-effectiveness of such interventions should be evaluated in a randomised controlled trial alongside long term objective and clinically important outcomes.",

      "text": "There are currently over 36 million people worldwide living with HIV  [1]  with the majority from middle and low-income countries. Almost 70% of the global HIV disease burden is in Sub-Saharan Africa  [2] . Treatment with antiretroviral therapy (ART) enables people living with HIV (PLWH) to lead healthier and longer lives since the life expectancy of someone who responds to treatment is the same as the general population  [3] . Currently, 59% of PLWH have access to ART  [1] .\n\nHigh adherence to ART is required to suppress viral replication, to slow the progression of HIV, and further reduce transmission  [4] . Poor adherence can also lead to drug resistance  [5] . UNAIDS aims to ensure 73% of PLWH achieve viral suppression which is thought to be 2 to 3 times higher than current levels of viral suppression  [6]  and the World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates that only one-third of the population adhere appropriately  [7] .\n\nFactors influencing adherence include individual factors such as lack of knowledge, misunderstandings about administering medicines, lack of skills in developing regular medicine taking habits (remembering), concerns about side effects, and social support for medicine taking  [8] [9] [10] . Medicine related factors, which affect adherence, include pill burden (number of tablets, intense dosing schedule, meal time restrictions, medicine side effects)  [11] [12] [13] . Service and structural factors also play a role, such as the availability of medicine and cost of training health care providers  [14, 15] .\n\nInterventions that have demonstrated efficacy in increasing adherence to HIV treatment have had multiple components including providing education, counselling, social support, feedback and additional supervision  [11] [12] [13] . However, in most settings these have proven too costly or are unfeasible to deliver in routine service settings.\n\nMobile phones are a potentially useful, low cost, platform for delivering health interventions  [16] . The World Bank estimates that 93 in every 100 people are subscribed to mobile phones  [17]  with low-income countries being the fastest growing sector  [18] . Interventions delivered by mobile phones have the potential to target many of the factors influencing adherence such as knowledge, attitudes, concerns about medicines and difficulties in developing regular medicine taking habits  [8] [9] [10] . They could enhance links to services so participants can obtain support and advice when needed, such as if they are experiencing medicine side effects  [19] . Where mobile phones are owned and used by individuals, privacy can be maintained which is vital for stigmatised diseases like HIV. Mobile phones are carried with people wherever they go, so advice and support can be provided in real time in the patient's environment  [20] . Mobile phones also have the potential to provide support and training to health care providers, allow remote monitoring of medicine taking and monitoring of drug supplies with the potential to reduce drug stock.\n\nA 2011 Cochrane systematic review of trials conducted between 1980 and 2011, included two trials of interventions delivered by mobile phone and concluded weekly messaging is effective in increasing adherence to ART  [19] . Other systematic reviews that have looked at text message also support these findings; Finnitis et al.  [21] , Mayer et al.  [22]  and Thakker et al.  [23]  suggest text messaging improves adherence. Wald et al.  [24]  looked at the difference between one-way and two-way message and found the latter improved adherence.\n\nOur review aims to provide an updated synthesis of RCTs of interventions designed to increase adherence to ART medication delivered to patients via mobile phone. We aim to describe the effectiveness of interventions which employ different delivery mechanism (SMS, voice calls, application software) and different intervention content or frequencies of contact (weekly, daily contact). We will explore if the effects of interventions vary according to if they employ interactivity, links to support or use three or more BCTs."

An improvement in adherence was measured in seven of the 19 objective primary outcomes and two of the seven subjective secondary outcomes. The pooled measures of text message interventions to improve adherence measured as MEMs was RR 1.25 (CI 0.97 to 1.61) P = 0.08, observed heterogeneity I 2 is 74% [31, 32, 34, 37] and SMD 0.42 (CI 0.03 TO 0.81) P = 0.04, I 2 28% [35, 36].\n\nThere was substantial variation in all the text message interventions. The frequency of text messaging was observed in Pop-eleches trial  [32]  which compared weekly and daily messages with the length of the message (long /short). Of these arms, only weekly text messages showed a significant result, which was not consistent in the Mbugbaw trial  [33]  where weekly text messages were also delivered. Three trials looked at daily text messages  [30, 32, 35]  of which two improved adherences  [30, 35] . Some text message interventions were coordinated to their ART regime (scheduled)  [30, 31]  and others used real time monitoring which only sent a text reminder if the participant failed to open the medication device (triggered)  [34, 36, 37] . Haberer  [36]  specifically looked at this function and split participants into scheduled and triggered. In this trial scheduled showed an effect, which was also supported by Hardy  [30] . Triggered interventions showed an effect in two trials  [34, 37] . Some trials only included participants with poor baseline adherence  [30, 34, 35 ] and all of these trials reported that the intervention improved adherence. For biological measures, neither Orrell  [37]  or Haberer  [36]  reported a statistically significant HIV RNA suppression, however the Orrell trial  [37]  did report a statistically significant odds ratio for virological failure which has been asterisked in Table  3 .\n\nInteractivity was identified in 2 trials  [30, 35]  and both reported statistically significant improvements in adherence. Three or more BCTs were identified in 3 trials  [34] [35] [36] , all of which reported an improvement in adherence. Mbuagbaw  [33]  and Ingersoll  [35]  stated a behaviour change model that underpinned the intervention. Link to support was reported in one trial  [33]  which had a statistically significant effect when the adherence threshold was reduced from 95 to 90% for Visual Analogue Scale (VAS)."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "We identified 19 trials that investigated the effect of different mobile phone mechanisms on adherence to HIV medication. This review used a systematic approach, a replicable search strategy and standard systematic review methods  [48]  and is the first to include interventions delivered by mobile phone call. Previous reviews of mobile phone interventions designed to increase ART adherence have grouped all \"mobile phone interventions that used any text messages\" together without differentiating between interventions delivered via text message and mobile phone call, and BCTs used in the interventions were not described.\n\nWe present pooled analyses of objective outcomes and our review is the first to differentiate between objective and subjective adherence measures. Self-reported adherence outcomes may differentially overestimate benefits in the intervention group  [49]  due to lack of participant blinding, recall bias and the desire to please the provider  [7] . We only pooled objective measures of the same outcome as such analyses allow the clinical benefits achieved for patients to be more clearly interpreted.\n\nWe found no effect when interventions delivered by text message were pooled in the RR, however, there was a moderate effect in SMD. There was substantial heterogeneity across the trials and individual trials reported objective improvements in adherence. It was unclear if the delivery mechanism (daily, weekly, scheduled or triggered mechanism in text messages) had an effect since, individually, the results were of mixed statistical significance. Text message interventions described as 'interactive' and using more than three BCTs all showed improvements in adherence. None of the trials had a low risk of bias.\n\nPrevious reviews have found that text messaging is effective in increasing adherence to ART  [19, 22, 23] , Finitsis et al.  [21] , reported a pooled OR of 1.48 (1.09 to Fig. 2 Adherence to HIV medication measured as MEM with interventions delivered by text message SMD\n\n2.01) on any HIV outcome, however, objective and subjective outcomes were pooled across all types of intervention provided they included some text messaging. Although pooling in this way affords greater statistical power, use of subjective outcomes in trials where participants cannot be blinded may have resulted in over-estimated effects and it is difficult to identify which intervention components were effective. A similar methodology was used in Thakkar et al.  [23]  which concluded that mobile phone text message approximately doubles medication adherence in chronic disease. This review included trials  [44, 45]  combining text message with counselling, which may have inflated results  [23] . Mayer et al.  [22]  also reported a larger SMD than the SMD we calculate in our review (SMD 0.87 vs. SMD 0.42), however, the authors included trials with a pre-post study design, converted all outcomes to SMD, and pooled all trials that included any text message.\n\nWe find the effect of text message-delivered daily prompts to take medicines to be inconclusive. This is consistent with the findings of other trials of text message-delivered daily prompts designed to increase adherence to oral contraception, TB medication, malaria prophylaxis or antibiotics, pooled RR 1.0 (CI 0.77-1.3) [31, 33, 50] . Intervention fatigue may explain the ineffectiveness of daily medication prompts.\n\nAll text message interventions with interactivity included in this review improved adherence, however we were unable to pool results (differing outcome measures and Hardy et al.  [30]  used an intervention as the control). This finding supports the conclusions of the Wald et al.  [24]  systematic review which explored the effects of two-way communication and interactivity in mobile phone-delivered interventions targeting adherence to any medication and concluded that interventions involving two-way text messaging improved medication adherence  [24] . Mbuagbaw et al. also showed that interactivity improved adherence to ART  [51]  and Finnitis reports that interventions which include interactivity are more effective  [21] .\n\nIn our review, we distinguish between interactivity and a specific link to support from a person. These characteristics were heterogeneous, which is unsurprising given the nature of interactivity varied e.g. texting back to confirm you have taken medicine rather than texting back if you would like to speak to a health care provider, and the nature of the link to support could require passive or active involvement (a phone call from a health care    [52, 53] . Among the five trials of interventions delivered by mobile phone call included in this review, only one reported a statistically significant reduction in viral load post intervention  [32] . One trial using mobile phone imagery reported a reduction in HIV viral load. It is likely that the effect of interventions delivered by mobile phone call would be similar to the effect of adherence interventions delivered by landline -SMD in pooled behavioural outcomes 0.49 (-1.12 to 2.11) I240%,  [54] . The content of calls in both our review and the Cochrane review of phone calls was generally poorly described and is likely to be variable, resulting in different effects across trials  [54] . In the one trial in our review which reported beneficial effects, the intervention was well described and involved confirming if medications were taken, providing problem-solving support, and referral to services to address adherence barriers if needed  [38] .\n\nOf the mixed trials in our review, one trial delivered by mobile automated phone voice messaging showed no benefit, however, the other three mixed trials reported benefit, either in increasing CD4 count or reducing viral load  [44] [45] [46] . All of the mixed interventions which included a link to support improved adherence, however, the time and costs involved requires clarification.\n\nA wide range of other factors influence adherence to ART but have not been targeted in interventions to date. These factors include information about how medicines work, why they are important and how to take them, how to develop regular medicine taking habits, reassurance regarding common minor side effects and information about side effects for which help should be sought. The interventions in this review contained few BCTs (median 2 and maximum 6). In other areas such as smoking cessation effective behaviour change interventions delivered by text message included 19 BCTs  [55] .\n\nOur review has some important limitations. With no existing gold standard objective measures of adherence  [56, 57] , trials included in this review used 15 different adherence measures limiting our ability to conduct pooled analyses of the same outcomes. There were also too few trials to conduct a meta-regression exploring all the factors which could influence heterogeneity of outcomes including: allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, types of participant (treatment experienced/ naive), factors influencing adherence targeted, BCT employed, mode of delivery, and duration of follow up.\n\nAdherence measures may be at risk of the 'Hawthorne effect' , where participants alter their behaviour due to awareness of being observed, especially if there is considerable contact in mid-trial follow-up points  [58] . Self-reported measures and measures that can be manipulated in the short term such as pill count will be more susceptible to this effect.\n\nIt is also important to consider that in RCT's the control group may have higher adherence levels by virtue of trial participation and increased surveillance, which may reduce the ability to detect true differences in the trial and thus underestimate intervention effects. In pragmatic trials there may be a trade-off between maintaining internal validity by achieving high follow up and achieving generalisability for \"real world\" purposes. We coded the BCTs using an established taxonomy  [25] , however, coding was dependant on the authors' description of the intervention, which often lacked detail. More comprehensive descriptions were requested but responses were limited, especially for transcripts of mobile phone call interventions. It is likely that content of mobile phone calls differed between trials which may influence the outcome of mobile phone counselling interventions.\n\nMany of the trials had small sample sizes and were therefore underpowered to detect changes in the outcomes collected. As mentioned before, we did not pool analyses across different outcomes also resulting in reduced statistical power. The median follow-up time across trials was 4 months which is insufficient to determine the long-term impact of the intervention -some studies suggest that adherence slowly decreases with time due to pill fatigue  [59] .\n\nWHOs current advice is there is high quality evidence for weekly text messages and they are effective to enhance adherence  [60]  . The evidence is more nuanced than this advice suggests, and new recommendations based on the updated evidence can now be made which recommend only specific interventions that have been shown to be effective.\n\nCost-analyses of existing effective interventions is needed prior to considering widespread implementation. Further clarification regarding the aims or content of phone calls would be helpful for services considering implementation. Future trials should include an exploration of the mechanism of action of interventions. The evidence base would be enhanced if a gold standard measure of ART adherence were agreed internationally. Interventions targeting a wider range of factors influencing adherence might have greater effects than existing interventions and should be evaluated by randomised controlled trial."

Such interventions should be evaluated in a randomised controlled trial with long-term objective and clinically important outcomes alongside associated cost-effective analysis."
