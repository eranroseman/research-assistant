  "title": "A digital health psychological intervention (WebMAP Mobile) for children and adolescents with chronic pain: results of a hybrid effectivenessimplementation stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial",
  "abstract": "Although psychological treatments benefit youth with chronic pain, treatment is not accessible in most communities. Digital health interventions offer promise for expanding access and reach to this population. Using a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial design, we evaluated effectiveness and implementation of a digital health delivered psychological intervention for pediatric chronic pain. One hundred forty-three youth, aged 10 to 17 years, with chronic pain and a caregiver were recruited from 8 clinics in the United States. Active intervention included access to the Web-based Management of Adolescent Pain (WebMAP) Mobile app and the WebMAP parent web site to learn pain self-management skills. Effectiveness outcomes included pain intensity, disability, and patient global impression of change, while Reach, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance were implementation outcomes. Results showed that youth in both treatment conditions (WebMAP vs Usual Care) had similar changes over time in pain and disability. Youth in the WebMAP condition perceived greater improvement (patient global impression of change) at post-treatment and follow-up (d's 5 0.54 and 0.44, P , 0.05) compared with youth receiving usual care. Use of the digital health intervention was modest and variable; approximately 30% of youth and parents completed treatment. Greater engagement (number of completed modules) was associated with significantly greater reductions in pain and disability from pre-treatment to follow-up (d's 5 20.57 and 20.38, P , 0.05). Parents, youth, and providers found treatment acceptable; providers had positive attitudes and demonstrated referrals over a maintenance period. Further research is needed to understand how to enhance treatment engagement with digital health interventions and optimize implementation.",

      "title": "1.. Introduction",
      "text": "In the United States alone, 2 to 5 million children experience chronic pain  21, 26  and are at risk of impairments in physical and psychosocial functioning. A robust evidence base demonstrates that psychological treatments have small to moderate effects for reducing pain and disability in children with chronic pain.  15 ecause children with chronic pain are at risk of continued pain,  23, 41  worse educational, vocational, and social outcomes in adulthood,  31  effective intervention during childhood is a key priority to address the overall societal burden of chronic pain. Despite the promise of psychological interventions for chronic pain management, few children have access to them  39  because of numerous barriers including geographic distance  4, 7  and long wait-lists.  35 igital health interventions targeting behavior change (ie, psychological interventions delivered through the Internet and smartphone applications) have the unique potential to bridge this critical gap in service delivery. According to a recent Pew Research Center Internet Survey, 95% of teens in the United States own a smartphone and use the Internet daily.  37 Digital health interventions for pediatric chronic pain are emerging.  13 Our own Internet-delivered program, Web-based Management of Adolescent Pain (WebMAP),  33  has shown excellent patient engagement and small to moderate treatment effects for improving pain-related outcomes in a largescale randomized controlled trial (RCT).  33 lthough positioned to overcome major barriers to access, effectiveness of digital health interventions for pediatric chronic pain in real-world settings-outside the tightly controlled setting of a randomized clinical trial design-has not been widely\n\nSponsorships or competing interests that may be relevant to content are disclosed at the end of this article.\n\nstudied.  15 Furthermore, factors that may hinder or facilitate realworld implementation of digital health interventions in this population are understudied.  3, 30 Systematic reviews have shown that end users do not typically have access to tools developed during research studies; for example, only 13 of 53 tools were found to be publicly available in a review of eHealth tools for pediatric pain management,  19  reducing their real-world impact. Hybrid effectiveness-implementation clinical trials have the potential to address these gaps.  28 To the best of our knowledge, there have not been any previous clinical trials of psychological interventions for youth with chronic pain that have evaluated both treatment effectiveness and implementation in real-world clinical settings.\n\nBuilding on our previous work with WebMAP,  32, 33  the goals of this hybrid effectiveness-implementation clinical trial are to (1)  evaluate the real-world usage and effectiveness of WebMAP for youth with chronic pain and (2) assess implementation of WebMAP in pediatric specialty care and pain clinic settings across the United States. Using a stepped-wedge cluster randomized trial (SW-CRT) design, we hypothesized that youth receiving the WebMAP program would show greater improvements in pain-related disability, pain intensity, and patientreported global impression of change compared with youth receiving usual care. We hypothesized that youth and parents would use the intervention in real-world clinical settings, and that higher engagement in the WebMAP program would be associated with greater treatment benefit. Finally, we expected to find that WebMAP would have adequate reach, adoption, implementation, and maintenance (assessed by the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance [RE-AIM] framework)."

      "text": "To evaluate intervention effectiveness, we used an SW-CRT design where clinic served as the unit of randomization.  18 Given the goals of this hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial, an SW-CRT design provided several advantages over alternatives such as a parallelgroup RCT, including (1) enhanced external validity, and (2) the ability to simultaneously test intervention effectiveness and collect implementation data.  8 This design included unidirectional and random sequential crossover of the clinics from control (\"nonexposure\") phase to intervention (\"exposure\") phase until all clinics were exposed (November 2017-November 2018). There was an initial control period during which none of the clinics were exposed to the intervention and all participants who were referred to the study received usual care alone at their respective clinic. Subsequently, clinics were randomized to 1 of 4 waves (occurring at 2, 4, 6, and 8 months after study commencement) to cross from the control/ nonexposure phase to the intervention/exposure phase, with 2 clinics switching at each wave.\n\nThis was an open cohort study in which patients were recruited throughout the study duration, but patients were not allowed to switch exposure status. Patients referred during their clinic's exposure phase received the active intervention, which included access to the WebMAP Mobile app for teens and WebMAP parent web site to learn pain self-management skills, in addition to receiving usual care at their referring clinic. Participants referred during their clinic's nonexposure phase received usual care at their referring clinic and were not given access to the WebMAP interventions even after the clinic switched to active intervention phase. Thus, all youth in the study received usual care, which was not altered by study participation. All the clinics provided interdisciplinary care and youth received at minimum an initial evaluation visit with treatment recommendations, which could include referrals for other services (psychology, physical therapy, and acupuncture) and clinic followups as needed. Recruitment into the trial ended as planned per our trial protocol in November 2018."

During this 8month period, we collected 2 outcomes: a provider survey and the number of referrals made by providers to the WebMAP Mobile app. We created clinic-specific login codes, so that we could track the number of users from each clinic. At the end of the trial, the WebMAP Mobile app was then made freely available to the public (in Englishspeaking countries) through the iPhone and Android app stores in September 2019."

The randomization schedule was stored in an encrypted document that was only accessible to study staff responsible for intervention procedures; this document was not accessible to study staff involved in recruitment or outcomes assessment. Participants were informed of their assignment to usual care or active intervention after completing the pre-treatment assessment.

This left 186 participants who were contacted and assessed for eligibility by study staff, of which an additional 43 participants were excluded (n 5 23 declined, n 5 15 did not complete pre-treatment assessments or were unable to be reached after screening, and n 5 5 did not meet inclusion criteria). Thus, the final sample consisted of 143 patients and a participating caregiver.\n\nSeventy parent-youth dyads were allocated to the Usual Care only condition because these patients entered the study during the \"nonexposure\" phase at their referring clinic; the remaining 73 parent-youth dyads were allocated to the WebMAP intervention condition (1Usual Care) because their referring clinic had crossed over to the \"exposure\" phase at the time of study entry. Post-treatment assessments were available for 92.3% (N 5 132) of the youth sample (86.3% WebMAP and 98.6% Usual Care); and 3-month follow-up was available for 91.6% (N 5 131) of the sample (86.3% WebMAP and 97.1% Usual Care) (Figure  1 ).

The original, Internet-based version of the WebMAP program delivers treatment to youth and their parents through separate web sites.  32, 33 To facilitate large-scale dissemination of the intervention, we developed a smartphone application for youth called WebMAP Mobile. Youth randomized to the treatment arm received access to WebMAP Mobile, while their parents received access to the WebMAP parent web site to learn pain selfmanagement skills. One champion was identified at each site who served as the point person for training providers on the study procedures and how to refer individual patients. A PowerPoint presentation about the study was shared with each champion, and access to the WebMAP programs was provided to each site with test accounts. Instructions on how to complete and return patient referrals (ie, through email or a secure online referral web site) were sent regularly to each site. Site communication included contact with individual providers by study staff throughout the trial by sending a thank you email each time they made a referral and by sending monthly email newsletters. The newsletters included updates about study progress including recruitment and enrollment. As a site engagement strategy, we also conducted periodic referral contests (eg, number of referrals in a month) and provided clinics with small tokens of appreciation (eg, popcorn)."

Their parents also received access to the web-based version of the WebMAP parent program (evaluated and described in Ref. 33). For this trial, we chose to deliver treatment to youth through a mobile app version of the program rather than a web site to facilitate dissemination of the program to youth in real-world settings. The design and treatment content of both the mobile and web-based versions of WebMAP follow cognitive-behavioral, social learning, and family systems frameworks."

Badge and reward systems were included to encourage engagement and skills practice.\n\nYouth visit different \"places\" (such as the desert, an island paradise, or the northern lights) to learn skills for managing chronic pain. These \"places\" corresponded with 6 core treatment modules and 2 supplementary modules. Core modules included (1) pain education, (2) stress, emotions, and thoughts, (3) relaxation and imagery, (4) lifestyle (including sleep) and school interventions, (5) staying active, and (6) maintenance and relapse prevention. This is a tailored treatment, such that youth can receive 2 supplementary modules for problems with low mood and insomnia. Specifically, when setting up their initial profile within the app, youth completed the Patient Health Questionnaire-2  1  to screen for depressive symptoms; youth scoring 3 or higher were provided the supplementary module to address negative mood. Youth also completed 2 items from the Adolescent Sleep Wake Scale 11 to screen for (1) difficulties with falling asleep and (2) staying asleep, with endorsement of \"quite often\" or greater for either symptom triggering release of a supplementary module targeting insomnia symptoms. To facilitate engagement and skills acquisition, youth review their knowledge at the end of each module with brief quizzes and complete an assignment corresponding with the skills taught in each module (eg, relaxation practice). Upon completion of assignments, youth receive a badge and receive access to the subsequent module. 2766 T.M. Palermo et al. \u2022 161 (2020) 2763-2774 PAIN \u00ae\n\nContent is metered according to a time schedule, requiring youth to spend 5 days on skills practice before an assignment can be completed. This was intended to space out treatment delivery and provide opportunity for skills acquisition. Components of the program can be used daily (eg, check in, skills practice). Total treatment duration is approximately 15 to 20 minutes per week over 6 to 8 weeks depending on the number of supplementary modules assigned.

      "text": "We performed intention-to-treat analysis of all participants according to the exposure status of the clinic from which a participant was referred. All data analyses were conducted using IBM SPSS (Version 25 for Windows). We calculated engagement and implementation outcomes using frequencies and descriptive statistics. We summarized demographic characteristics using descriptive statistics, including frequencies for categorical variables and mean and SD for continuous variables. Our main analysis was based on LME regression models, which allowed us to use all available data from participants. A participant may have missing outcomes values at 1 or more time points, but as long as the participant had at least 1 outcome value at any of the assessment time points, the data were retained and used in the analysis, which can ameliorate selection bias due to drop out. Overall, missing data were minimal on the primary and secondary outcomes, ranging from 0.7% to 1.4% at baseline, 11.2% to 16.1% at post-treatment, and 9.1% to 20.3% at 3-month follow-up.\n\nTo test effectiveness of the intervention, we applied LME regression models to examine the effect of the WebMAP intervention vs usual care only on pain-related disability and pain intensity. These models included a binary intervention group indicator (ie, whether their clinic was in the usual care control/ nonexposure phase or active treatment/exposure phase at the time the participant enrolled in the study; 0 5 control; 1 5 active treatment), a 3-level time indicator representing the outcome assessment time point (baseline, immediate post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up), a 4-level period indicator representing wave at study entry (wave 1, wave 2, wave 3, and wave 4), and the interaction term between intervention group 3 time indicator. Our primary parameter of interest was the intervention group 3 time indicator interaction term, which evaluated whether change in the outcome over time differed between the 2 treatment groups. We report the beta coefficient, P-value, and effect size for each interaction term. Significance tests were based on restricted maximum likelihood estimates and Kenward-Roger degree-offreedom approximation.  25 Because patient-reported global impression of change was measured at only 2 time points (immediate post-treatment and 3-month follow-up), we conducted 1-way analyses of covariance controlling for wave at study entry to determine group differences on this outcome at each time point. We calculated effect sizes (Cohen's d) to elucidate the magnitude of treatment effects. By convention, d 5 0.20, d 5 0.50, and d 5 0.80 are interpreted as small, moderate, and large effects, respectively.  5 ecause engagement in the WebMAP program was expected to be variable in this effectiveness trial, we also examined the effects of treatment engagement on treatment response from pre-treatment to 3-month follow-up for families assigned to the WebMAP condition (n 5 73). For these analyses, we applied LME regression models comprising treatment engagement (number of modules completed by parent-youth dyads), time (baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up), and slopes of improvement (treatment engagement 3 time). To display significant engagement 3 time interaction effects graphically, we calculated parameter estimates at high (11 SD above the mean) and low (21 SD below the mean) values of treatment engagement.  2  This technique uses all the data in the LME model to calculate model predicted parameters for different levels of engagement, allowing for an understanding of the trajectory of disability and pain intensity among individuals with high and low engagement."

      "title": "4.. Discussion",
      "text": "Building on our previous work delivering Internet-based pain selfmanagement to youth with chronic pain,  32, 33  we conducted a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial to facilitate large-scale dissemination of the WebMAP intervention program. In our first phase of work, we devised an implementation approach to target provider referrals to the intervention and converted our webbased intervention into a smartphone application for youth (WebMAP Mobile) to allow it to be more readily disseminated. We trained providers and clinics in making study referrals and implemented procedures to increase provider and clinic engagement. In the second phase of work, we conducted a hybrid effectiveness-implementation trial using a stepped-wedge design to evaluate implementation and effectiveness outcomes and intervention use in real-world clinic settings, without tightly controlled study monitoring to influence patient compliance. In the third phase of work, we released the app to the clinics to use with their patients in a maintenance period, followed by a public release of the app. Our first aim was to evaluate the real-world usage and clinical effectiveness of WebMAP Mobile for youth with chronic pain. Our findings demonstrated that the intervention could be delivered in real-world clinic settings through provider referral in interdisciplinary pain clinics and pediatric specialty clinics. Intervention usage by individual patients and families was variable; most youth downloaded and tried the WebMAP Mobile app and parents logged into the WebMAP parent web site, but only about 30% of parents and youth completed the treatment program. Across the treatment and usual care conditions, pain and disability decreased at a similar rate at post-treatment and follow-up. However, youth in the WebMAP treatment group indicated greater improvements on the PGIC compared with the control group, with small to moderate effect sizes at post-treatment and follow-up. Thus clinical effectiveness at the group level was only weakly demonstrated. However, within the treatment group, higher levels of intervention use/engagement were associated with significantly reduced pain and disability, and these were small to moderate effects, indicating that use of the treatment program was associated with clinical benefit. We used the PGIC in our trial, which, although widely used in adult clinical care and clinical trials, has had very limited use in pediatric chronic pain clinical trials, despite identification of global impression of change as a key outcome domain.  29 For example, in a recent systematic review of design characteristics of trials of chronic and recurrent pain conditions in children and adolescents,  6  none of the 52 included studies reported on global impression of change as an outcome. Future studies are needed to understand the relationship between PGIC and other pain outcomes in pediatric patients with chronic pain and to understand how to integrate the patient's perception of treatment effectiveness.\n\nClinical effectiveness of digital health interventions is interwoven with user engagement since these are often self-administered interventions, which rely on patient motivation to be exposed to treatment and to then make behavioral changes.  38 In our previous tightly controlled RCTs of the WebMAP program, we achieved high levels of engagement with treatment completion around 75% and parent-teen dyads completing 14 of 16 treatment modules on average\"; we also demonstrated efficacy on pain-related disability and multiple secondary outcomes.  33 By contrast, in this effectiveness study where we broadened the inclusion criteria and did not use staff to influence participant adherence to treatment, engagement with the WebMAP program was modest: Parent-teen dyads completed 7.3 of 16 treatment modules on average and about 30% completed treatment. Indeed, systematic reviews have demonstrated relatively low engagement in digital mental health interventions in teens, with most studies reporting completion of less than half of intervention components and high rates of study attrition.  16 he issue of engagement has received a great deal of attention and includes concerns about whether engagement with the digital intervention is too limited to support behavior change and whether there are demographic or clinical characteristics that can be used to prospectively identify individuals at risk of lower engagement with digital health technologies (eg, mental health comorbidity, computer literacy, social/physical environment, etc.).  36 More research is needed to define \"effective engagement\" for the WebMAP program, to develop and test strategies that may enhance engagement, as well as to understand whether the modality (app vs web site) plays any role in treatment effectiveness. Our findings demonstrated a relationship between engagement with treatment and clinical benefit (ie, reductions in pain and disability) supporting the obvious idea that exposure to treatment is needed and that a few periods of engagement may not be sufficient to produce effects that are greater than usual care.\n\nOur second aim was to assess implementation of WebMAP in pediatric specialty care and pain clinic settings through provider referral. We evaluated our implementation approach using the RE-AIM framework  9  because it provides a broad perspective to understand potential public health impact of an intervention. Our findings demonstrated high levels of treatment acceptability as perceived by parents, youth, and providers; moreover, providers had positive attitudes about the helpfulness of a digital health intervention focused on pain self-management and intentions to use the intervention with their patients. During our maintenance period, we demonstrated that 7 of 8 clinics did uptake the intervention with their patients. Our overall costs were mostly on-target with a slight expenditure over budget to ready the WebMAP Mobile app for public release.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, this is the first study using a hybrid effectiveness-implementation design to evaluate a pain management intervention and offers several advantages over a traditional RCT design. Several general concerns have been raised about the parallel-group RCT design including initial sample selection bias and unclear representativeness of samples.  27 Moreover, specific to the psychological treatment literature in chronic pain, significant concerns have been raised regarding the abundance of trials using Higher dyadic treatment engagement is associated with greater reduction in pain-related disability compared to lower treatment engagement. Note. Treatment engagement was defined as the total number of modules completed by youth and their parents (range 5 0-14 across the dyad). Figure  2  displays estimated marginal means of pain-related disability from baseline to 3-month follow-up when (A) dyadic engagement was higher (mean 1 1 SD), and (B) dyadic engagement was lower (mean 2 1 SD). small sample sizes with confirmatory designs and exclusion of patients with common medical and psychological comorbidities.  10, 14 Our trial used broad inclusion criteria, resulting in a more heterogeneous, representative group of youth with medical and mental health comorbidities. Furthermore, there is a lack of studies that have examined organizational/system barriers and facilitators to implementing efficacious psychological interventions for pain management in pediatric settings. Hybrid effectivenessimplementation designs address the limitations inherent in tightly controlled, parallel-group RCTs by promoting external validity and increasing efficiency through a single trial that tests both intervention effectiveness and effectiveness of implementation strategies.  8 e chose to use a stepped-wedge design, which offered several advantages over a more traditional parallel-group design. Because we already had evidence in support of our WebMAP intervention, we could offer a known effective treatment to clinics. Moreover, all clinics could end the recruitment period in an exposure phase to allow for studying maintenance after the close of enrollment. Most typically, stepped-wedge designs are used with routinely collected data (ie, through the electronic medical record) and eliminate the need for individual participant recruitment. However, because we wanted to use best practice for outcomes assessment, we included patient-reported outcome measures and an individual participant recruitment method.\n\nThere are several limitations of the study that should be considered in interpreting the findings. Although our sample reflects the general composition of youth presenting to and specialty clinics for chronic pain, it still represents a predominantly white and female population. Our design was limited to short-term follow-up at 3 months, which may not have been enough time to understand continued use of the WebMAP program, as well as maintenance of treatment effects. The amount or type of care received by the participants at their referring clinics is unknown. However, given that all the participants received usual care, irrespective of the study group, and that participants in both groups were referred by all the 8 clinics, significant differences between groups in care are unlikely. Certain implementation outcomes were difficult to evaluate within\n\nTable 3\n\nSummary of results using the RE-AIM framework."

For example, we attempted to collect information on clinic patient volumes to understand the potential reach of the intervention, but these data were not interpretable across the clinics because of differences in who they serve (pain vs specialty clinic) and availability of data on patient characteristics (age and chronic pain diagnosis). Because our objective was to disseminate our intervention to the public at the end of the study, we developed plans during the trial to facilitate a public release. Previous reviews have shown that very few evidence-based digital health tools become publicly available for pain management after research studies are concluded.  19 We achieved our aim of publicly releasing the app, WebMAP Mobile, which is available for Android and iPhone in English to the following countries: United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, Israel, New Zealand, South Africa, Spain, and the United Kingdom.\n\nData from this trial provide critical information for future development of strategies to disseminate evidence-based digital health interventions in clinical settings serving youth with chronic pain. Future work is needed to enhance user engagement and to further develop and test implementation strategies including targeting direct to consumer uptake as well as provider referral for disseminating digital health interventions for pain management."

    "For pain location, total percentage is greater than 100% because participants were able to endorse more than 1 pain location. Multisite pain was coded as 1 5 yes, 0 5 no if teen endorsed more than 1 pain location. Depression and anxiety were coded as 1 5 yes, 0 5 no if teen's T score was above 60 on the PROMIS scale.
