  "title": "Predicting healthcare professionals' acceptance towards electronic personal health record systems in a resourcelimited setting: using modified technology acceptance model",
  "abstract": "Objectives Personal health record systems allow users to manage their health information in a confidential manner. However, there is little evidence about healthcare providers' intentions to use such technologies in resourcelimited settings. Therefore, this study aimed to assess predicting healthcare providers' acceptance of electronic personal health record systems. Methods An institutional-based cross-sectional study was conducted from 19 July to 23 August 2022 at teaching hospitals in the Amhara regional state of Ethiopia. A total of 638 health professionals participated in the study. Simple random sampling techniques were used to select the study participants. Structural equation modelling analysis was employed using AMOS V.26 software. Result Perceived ease of use had a significant effect on the intention to use electronic personal health records (\u03b2=0. 377, p<0.01), perceived usefulness (\u03b2=0.104, p<0.05) and attitude (\u03b2=0.204, p<0.01); perceived ease of use and information technology experience had a significant effect on perceived usefulness (\u03b2=0.077, p<0.05); and digital literacy (\u03b2=0.087, p<0.05) and attitude had also a strong effect on intention to use electronic personal health records (\u03b2=0.361, p<0.01). The relationship between perceived ease of use and the intention to use was mediated by attitude (\u03b2=0.076, p<0.01). Conclusion Perceived ease of use, attitude and digital literacy had a significant effect on the intention to use electronic personal health records. The perceived ease of use had a greater influence on the intention to use electronic personal health record systems. Thus, capacity building and technical support could enhance health providers' acceptance of using electronic personal health records in Ethiopia.",

      "text": "\u21d2 The findings may alleviate any concerns about the acceptance of personal health records, and because there is limited evidence on the acceptance of personal health records, it serves as a baseline for researchers in a resource-limited setting. Practically, this study offers insights for policymakers, developers, managers and decision-makers in the healthcare industry to improve the use and acceptability of the ePHRs. Protected by copyright, including for uses related to text and data mining, AI training, and similar technologies.\n\nOpen access patient engagement improvements, better medication adherence, good health outcomes (such as blood pressure and glycaemic management) and higher organisational efficiencies.  2 Even though PHRs are intended to be consumer-oriented tools, simply understanding the consumer's perspective is not enough. Although these issues have gotten less attention, consumer PHR use has significant consequences for healthcare providers and delivery systems as well.  3 The value that consumers obtain from using a PHR will probably be directly influenced by the acceptance and behaviours of healthcare professionals and team members within the context of the clinical setting, despite the fact that PHRs have received a lot of attention as tools to help consumers.  4 Although electronic PHRs (ePHRs) have a great deal of potential to enhance healthcare, there are obstacles to their widespread implementation.  5 Despite general agreement on the advantages of ePHRs, healthcare professionals have not been made aware of or receptive to this technology.  6 ccording to preliminary research findings in the literature, patient adoption of a PHR may be influenced by provider endorsement, and continuing physician involvement in patient PHR use may be necessary to achieve and maintain predicted good health outcomes.  7 Providing proper control for patient information disclosure and finding out how to process potentially enormous amounts of self-reported data within the constrained time allotted for the clinical visit are healthcare providers' tasks.  8 n Ethiopia, eHealth has been developing slowly. Technology problems, a lack of government support and budget over-runs are few of the reasons for this slow progress.  9 Given this, ePHRs are not widely used and accessible electronic records are likewise reluctant to catch on. The most significant factors influencing health providers' support for a national patient portal were expected positive influences on their work, the usability of the portal and benefits for the patients, according to a study conducted in Finland with a wide range of health providers (including nurses, pharmacists, health officers, doctors, physical therapists and psychologists).  10 n Ethiopia, there is little evidence about acceptance of healthcare professionals of using PHR system to change the current healthcare system through eHealth technologies. The study may have effects on practice, policy and upcoming researches. Accordingly, this study investigates, introduces and empirically tests a modified theoretical model based on technology acceptance model (TAM) to identify the main factors influencing healthcare professionals' acceptance of using ePHRs."

      "text": "Several models have been used to predict factors associated with the acceptance of health information system technologies.  11 12 The TAM is primarily applied at the individual level (but can also be applied in organisational settings), whereas Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use Technology 2 is primarily applied at the organisational level one of the most used models, and focuses on factors influencing end users' behavioural intentions to use new technologies.  13 14 erceived usefulness (PU) and perceived ease of use (PEU) are considered to be the main factors that either directly or indirectly determine behavioural intentions to use or embrace new technology in TAM.  13 15  In this study, we included information technology and digital literacy components to measure the behavioural intention of health professionals to use ePHRs in low-resource settings. Since the actual use of ePHRs in the setting was unclear, the construct 'actual use' was not used (figure  1 ).\n\nThe following parts provide an explanation of the research question hypotheses that were produced for this study's examination based on our model, which we adopted.\n\nPerceived usefulness PU describes how much users believe the new technology will help them in their jobs, and studies showed that PU influences acceptance of using ePHRs.  15 16 Based on those findings, the following hypotheses were tested.\n\nH1: PU has a positive influence on the user's attitudes towards ePHRs.\n\nH2: PU has a positive influence on intention to use ePHRs.\n\nH3: PU mediates the relationship between PEU and attitude towards ePHRs.\n\nH4: PU mediates the relationship between information technology experience (ITE) and attitude towards ePHRs.\n\nPerceived ease of use PEU is the degree to which a person believes that using technology will be simple and easy, and studies showed that PEU influences acceptance of using ePHRs.  13 15 16 he following hypotheses were tested.\n\nH5: PEU has a positive influence on the perceived usefulness of ePHRs.\n\nH6: PEU has a positive influence on the user's attitudes towards ePHRs.\n\nH7: PEU has a positive influence on intention to use ePHRs.\n\nFigure  1  The original model (blue lines) and the modification proposed in this study (black lines).

      "text": "This study aimed to introduce modified TAM and determine factors influencing health providers' acceptance in Ethiopia. As a result, H5, H6, H7, H8, H10, H13 and H17 were supported. The results showed that PEU had both direct and indirect implications on the desire to accept an ePHR, with favourable direct influences on PU and attitude. This indicated that when healthcare professionals assessed the system's simplicity or ease of use, their perceptions of the system's usefulness, attitude and intention to use it greatly improved. This result is consistent with results from other research conducted in various nations.  13 22 23 his might be the case because the effort required to operate the system has a significant impact on a person's attitude toward and acceptance of using ePHR systems. The effectiveness of the system will increase if it can more easily influence people's inclinations to use ePHRs. To achieve long-term system acceptance, the system should be easy for healthcare practitioners.\n\nTheir tendency to use ePHR systems has been favourably impacted by the attitude of health professionals. This result is consistent with findings from related studies conducted in other settings.  1 24 25 This may be due to the fact that new systems may irritate medical professionals who have a fixed, favourable opinion of ePHR systems. The availability of computers at work, continuing training and support, and knowledge sharing about eHealth technology are examples of actions that might be prioritised in order to change attitudes.\n\nThe intention to employ ePHRs was positively impacted directly by digital literacy. This proves that if healthcare workers were digitally literate, their intention to adopt technology would improve. The outcome is consistent with research done in various nations.  5 9 26 he possible explanation could be due to the potential role of digital literacy in the adoption of digital health technologies being mandatory.

      "text": "Users' perceptions of the use of ePHRs were positively impacted by the ITE of healthcare practitioners. This demonstrates how healthcare professionals' perceptions of the significance of new technology will change when they receive information technology skills and training from actual working environments. This result is consistent with research from other settings.  13 17 The reason can be that experienced users are assured of their technical comprehension of what they need to pursue their hobbies, perform the tasks required to do so and readily realise how to improve their health. As a result, in order for end users to accept new technology and see its value, they must have extensive experience using it in environments with low resources."

The proposed model has a strong ability to predict the hypothesised model because it could explain 68% of the variance in intention. PEU, attitude and digital literacy have a significant effect on the intention to use ePHRs, PU and attitude; healthcare providers' ITE also has a significant effect on PU. PEU had a more significant impact on healthcare providers' acceptance of using ePHR systems. Thus, capacity building and technical support could enhance health providers' acceptance of using ePHRs in Ethiopia."
