  "abstract": "Purpose: Our objective was to investigate rural adolescents' use of firearms and whether they had received firearm training. Methods: 2019 Iowa FFA Leadership Conference attendees were surveyed. Descriptive and comparative analyses were performed. Results: One thousand three hundred and eighty-two FFA members aged 13-18 years participated. The vast majority (85%) had fired a rifle/shotgun; 58% reported firing them >20 times. Of those who had fired rifles/shotguns, 32% had done so before 9 years old; 79% before 13 years. Most had also fired a handgun (62%), with 30% having fired handguns >20 times. Of those who had fired handguns, 34% had done so before 11 years old. The average age for first firing rifles/shotguns was 10.1 (SD 2.9) years, and 11.9 (SD 2.8) years for handguns. Males, older teenagers, and those living on farms or in the country had significantly greater percentages that had fired a rifle/shotgun or a handgun. Greater proportions of males had used firearms >20 times and started firing them at younger ages. Over half (55%) reported having gone hunting. Of those, 24% first hunted before 9 years old; 48% before 11 years. Of those who had used a firearm, 61% had completed a firearm safety training course. For hunters, 80% had taken a course. \n Conclusions: Most participants had used firearms, and many did so at very young ages. Substantial numbers had not received formal training.",

      "text": "Firearm injuries in youth and adolescents are a national health crisis and have become the leading cause of death for those less than 20 years of age.  1  Data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reveal that there were 18,599 nonfatal injuries and 3,230 deaths of youth and adolescents 18 years and under from firearms in 2020.  2  Of these fatalities, about one-third were a result of suicide, almost two-thirds from homicide, and a smaller proportion (4%) from unintentional injuries (eg, accidental discharge of the firearm).  2 Over 40% of US households with children have firearms, and of these homes, more than half store the firearms loaded and/or unlocked.  3 Roughly, 80% of firearm-related suicides occur in the home of the youth or a relative, with an overwhelming majority of cases (90%) involving a firearm owned by either the youth or parent/ caregiver.  4 e use of firearms by youth appears to be increasing as well as the popularity of shooting sports.  5 According to the Scholastic Shooting Sports Foundation, national shooting sports events have had recordbreaking participation numbers year after year with children as young as 5 years old allowed to join the sport.  6 In 2015, there were 15,745 participants on 445 high school teams across 12 states in the USA High School Clay Target League. This number increased to 43,009 participants on 1,466 teams across 34 states in 2021.  7 In addition, a national survey conducted by the US Fish and Wildlife Service estimated that 11.5 million people had gone hunting in 2016 with close to 300,000 being 16 and 17 years old.  8 Many states do not have a law regarding the minimum age for youth to hunt if accompanied by an adult, and 7 states do not have a minimum age requirement for unsupervised hunting.  9 rearm ownership and homes with firearms are significantly greater in rural areas as compared to urban settings.  [10] [11] 1] [12] [13] [14] [15]  Handgun carrying is more prevalent among rural adolescents than urban youth.  16, 17 In addition, studies have consistently shown higher rates of unintentional and suicide-related firearm deaths in rural settings, while rates of homicide firearm deaths are higher in urban areas.  [18] [19] [20]  Although unintentional injuries are the most common cause of firearmrelated hospitalization for both urban and rural US youth under 15 years, the rate of hospitalization due to firearm injuries for this age group is greater in rural areas.  21 th national rates of firearm injuries on the rise, firearm storage and access in the home has been an area of research interest.  3, 22 wever, little has been published regarding the use of firearms by youth. Our study objectives were to determine rural Iowa adolescents' prior experience with firearms, the frequency at which they fired them, and whether they had completed a firearm safety training certification course."

      "text": "A cross-sectional survey was administered to a convenience sample of adolescents 13-18 years of age attending the 2019 Iowa Demographic variables included age, sex, residence type (eg, on a farm), and race/ethnicity. Five individuals noted their sex as \"other\" and were not included in the comparative analysis regarding sex. Due to our lack of diversity in the study population, race/ethnicity was dichotomized to \"non-Hispanic White\" and \"other.\" This resulted in significant heterogeneity within the \"other\" race/ethnicity group but allowed the use of the variable in the study analysis.\n\nIn the survey, participants were asked questions regarding the number of separate occasions they had fired a rifle/shotgun and handgun with response choices \"1-5 times,\" \"6-20 times,\" \">20 times,\" or \"Never.\" They were then asked to indicate what age they had first fired a rifle/shotgun and handgun. Participants were also asked, \"How old were you when you first went hunting with a rifle/shotgun?\" that included the response option, \"Never been hunting with a rifle/shotgun.\" In addition, respondents were questioned about whether or not they had taken a formal/certified hunter or firearm safety training course, and if so, at what age they completed it. In Iowa, hunter/firearm safety training has traditionally been conducted with in-person classroom instruction. However, adolescents may now receive training online and complete the course with a hands-on \"Field Day\" class. We did not ask study participants specifics regarding the type of training they had received.\n\nOther questions used for comparative analysis included the presence of rifles/shotguns and handguns in the home with possible answers being \"Yes\" or \"Not that I know of.\" If the respondent answered \"Yes\" for either the presence of rifles/shotguns or handguns, they were separately asked if these firearms were stored loaded, unlocked, or both loaded and unlocked. Response options for each of these included \"Yes/Always,\" \"Yes/Sometimes,\" \"No,\" and \"Not Sure.\" For analysis purposes, firearms were considered safely stored if they were always stored unloaded and locked."

The authors' Institutional Review Board deemed the study exempt as the research analysis was done on an anonymously collected existing dataset. The data were entered into Qualtrics and then imported into Excel spread sheets. Stata 15.1 (Stat-aCorp) was utilized for descriptive (frequencies), bivariate (chi-square, Fisher's exact test), and multivariable logistic regression analyses. All P values were 2-tailed and a value <.05 was considered statistically significant. Fisher's exact test was used for any comparison in which a cell had a predicted value of <5.

      "text": "Our study showed that the vast majority of rural Iowa adolescent FFA members surveyed had fired both rifles/shotguns and handguns, many firing them frequently (>20 times) and having started at very young ages. Over half reported having gone hunting with three-fourths doing so before the age of 11 years. Demographics with greater experience with firearms included males, older teens, those who lived on farms or in the country, and non-Hispanic Whites. Of those reporting using a firearm, only about 60% had taken a firearm safety certification course. Safe firearm storage in the home (all firearms always locked and unloaded) was not more common among respondents who had taken a firearm safety course than those who had not.\n\nConsistent with prior studies, males had higher odds of having used firearms than females and to have done so more frequently.  24, 25 ill, 71% of females reported firing a rifle/shotgun with half having"

Previous studies found that lower proportions of females had experience with firearms or owned guns.  [26] [27] [28]  However, recent data from the National Sporting Goods Association demonstrate that more females are increasingly experienced with firearms and participating in hunting and firearm-related sports.  29 e National Shooting Sports Foundation reported a 44% increase in female hunters between 2007 and 2017. In addition, as of 2021, 30% of firearm-related sports participants were female, with over 6 mil-lion females participating in target shooting alone.  30 The significant proportion of females in our study who reported firearm experience as compared to previous studies may be partially explained by this increasing prevalence and by the participants being a primarily rural population.  [24] [25] [26] [27] [28]  Study participants who identified as non-Hispanic White had 2.5 times greater odds of having fired a rifle/shotgun and nearly 3.5 times higher odds of having done so before the age of 10 as compared to those of other races/ethnicities. Non-Hispanic Whites also had higher proportions who had taken a safety course than study participants of other races/ethnicities. While considerable data show racial differences among victims of firearm violence, information on the use of firearms by race/ethnicity is limited.  2, [31] [32] 2] [33]  A study of found that White men had significantly greater proportions who owned at least 1 firearm as compared to those of other races/ethnicities (48% vs 24%).  27 rearm experience varied significantly by where the FFA member lived. Those living on farms had a greater odds of having fired both shotguns/rifles and handguns. Hunting likely had a significant impact on this discrepancy, as those who lived on farms also had increased proportions having gone hunting. This mirrors other studies regarding rural and urban differences in firearm experience.  25 American adult firearm ownership is higher in rural areas (46%) as compared to urban settings (19%).  34 The Pew Research Center found that 72% of Americans raised in a rural area had firearms in their home as compared with 39% raised in urban settings.  35 Whereas self-protection is the major reason for owning a firearm in both rural and urban areas, rural residents are far more likely than urban dwellers to cite hunting as a major reason they own a gun (48% vs 27%, respectively).  16 t only did our study participants have high levels of experience with firearms, but they also reported starting at very young ages with an average of 10.1 years for rifles/shotguns and 11.9 years for handguns. In addition, one-third reported having fired a rifle/shotgun before they were 9 years old and one-third before 11 years of age.\n\nThe extremely young ages at which many of the study population were allowed to use firearms raises concerns that their physical and cognitive abilities were unlikely to assure the safe use of a firearm.\n\nOverall, this suggests that educational interventions targeted at parents and guardians as well as firearm safety legislation to promote safer practices may be highly valuable.\n\nOnly about 60% of FFA members who reported using a rifle/shotgun had taken a firearm safety certification course but was higher among study participants who had gone hunting (80%). This was consistent with survey answers from the same group of FFA members wherein 89% agreed that there should be mandatory safety training before obtaining a hunting license.  36 In Iowa, those under 16 years may apply for a license if they can show proof of hunter safety education.  37 A study of unintentional firearm injuries in Iowa demonstrated that about a quarter had occurred while hunting, and other rural trauma centers have found hunting to be a frequent cause of gunshot injuries.  26, 38 With hunting and shooting sports gaining popularity across the United States, there should be an emphasis on firearm safety certification training for all youth before they use firearms.\n\nIn previous reports, we found unsafe storage of firearms in FFA members homes to be very common, with 82% reporting at least 1 firearm being unlocked and/or loaded at least some of the time.  22 rein, we report no significant difference in the safe storage of firearms in the home between study participants who had completed a firearm safety course and those who had not. Similarly, previous studies found that gun owners who reported having taken a gun safety class were no more likely to store their firearms safely than those who had not.  39 In fact, a rural Iowa study found respondents who had completed a gun safety course had more than double the prevalence of having a loaded, unlocked gun.  15 In contrast, firearm owners who received instruction from the National Safety Council were more likely to store their guns unloaded and locked than individuals who took other types of gun safety training programs.  40 However, the report did not discuss if there were significant differences in the safe storage training among these programs. Certainly, firearm safety training programs could play an important role by instructing on and emphasizing the importance of safe firearm storage."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "Our study was limited in that it was conducted in a single Midwestern state with a primarily non-Hispanic White, rural population. Thus, our findings may not be generalizable to other states, urban settings, and areas with greater populations of other races/ethnicities. Additionally, we used a convenience sampling of adolescent FFA members primarily from rural areas. Thus, results may not be representative of the entire state. However, a large majority of Iowa counties were represented.\n\nReported differences by race/ethnicity should be interpreted with caution, as the numbers of participants from other races/ethnicities were very small and diverse. Data were self-reported and may be subject to recall bias and social desirability. Factors decreasing the social desirability effect included the surveys being completed independently and collected anonymously. A number of respondents reported that they were too young to remember when they first used a firearm/went hunting and did not provide an actual age in years. Thus, the actual average age at which study youth first used firearms and went hunting is likely younger than that reported in our results. Finally, the specific content of firearm safety training certification courses completed by study participants was not investigated."

The authors believe that families should be counseled when it is developmentally appropriate to consider introducing youth to firearms and all should take a firearm safety training course before using firearms."

FFA is a national youth organization for students interested in a broad range of agricultural careers and leadership opportunities. In 2019, there were more than 16,000 members in 246 Iowa FFA chapters.23 Conference attendees were recruited to complete an anonymous survey at the University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital injury prevention booth. Participants were provided a modest prize (eg, lip balm, air pod case) as determined by chance via Plinko board as an incentive to complete the survey. Survey The survey was developed by the members of the University of Iowa Stead Family Children's Hospital's Injury Prevention Program in collaboration with other individuals interested in firearm injury prevention at the study institution. For validation purposes, the written survey was administered to 20 youth and adolescents between 11 and 22 years of age. After completion, clarification of responses was requested from the participants if any portion was not easily understood. The written and verbal responses provided were compared for consistency. The final survey design reflected these validation results."
