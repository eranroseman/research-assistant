  "title": "Design and development of a smartphone app for hypertension management: An intervention mapping approach",
  "abstract": "Background: Several research studies have demonstrated the potential of mobile health apps in supporting health management. However, the design and development process of these apps are rarely presented. Objective: We present the design and development of a smartphone-based lifestyle app integrating a wearable device for hypertension management. \n Methods: We used an intervention mapping approach for the development of theory-and evidence-based intervention in hypertension management. This consisted of six fundamental steps: needs assessment, matrices, theoretical methods and practical strategies, program design, adoption and implementation plan, and evaluation plan. To design the contents of the intervention, we performed a literature review to determine the preferences of people with hypertension (Step ) and necessary objectives toward the promotion of selfmanagement behaviors (Step ). Based on these findings, we implemented theoretical and practical strategies in consultation with stakeholders and researchers (Steps ), which was used to identify the functionality and develop an mHealth app (Step ). The adoption (Step ) and evaluation (Step ) of the mHealth app will be conducted in a future study. \n Results: Through the needs analysis, we identified that people with hypertension preferred having education, medication or treatment adherence, lifestyle modification, alcohol and smoking cessation and blood pressure monitoring support. We utilized MoSCoW analysis to consider four key elements, i.e., education, medication or treatment adherence, lifestyle modification and blood pressure support based on past experiences, and its potential benefits in hypertension management. Theoretical models such as (i) the information, motivation, and behavior skills model, and (ii) the patient health engagement model was implemented in the intervention development to ensure positive engagement and health behavior. Our app provides health education to people with hypertension related to their condition, while utilizing wearable devices to promote lifestyle modification and blood pressure management. The app also contains a clinician portal with rules and medication lists titrated by the clinician to ensure treatment adherence, with regular push notifications to prompt behavioral change. In addition, the app data can be reviewed by patients and clinicians as needed. Frontiers in Public Health frontiersin.org Lobo et al. . /fpubh. . Conclusions: This is the first study describing the design and development of an app that integrates a wearable blood pressure device and provides lifestyle support and hypertension management. Our theory-driven intervention for hypertension management is founded on the critical needs of people with hypertension to ensure treatment adherence and supports medication review and titration by clinicians. The intervention will be clinically evaluated in future studies to determine its effectiveness and usability.",

      "text": "Hypertension or high blood pressure (BP) is a leading modifiable risk factor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) (1-3) affecting 4.1 million Australian adults (4), with a total healthcare expenditure estimated to be around AUD$941 million per annum  (5) . Although several treatment options are available for the management of hypertension  (6) , only 21.6% of Australians were treated and controlled, while 17% were treated and uncontrolled, and 61.4% were left untreated (4). The treatment procedures include both pharmacological and non-pharmacological interventions that enable the individual to engage and adhere to long-term self-management behaviors  (7) . However, self-management of high blood pressure can be a complex and time-consuming process as it requires the individual and their caregiver to make day-to-day decisions about activities based on their treatment, symptoms, lifestyle changes, and physical and psychological consequences inherent with living with their health condition  (8) .\n\nEmerging technologies such as mobile health apps have been shown to improve the treatment of hypertension  (9) . Apps have the ability to collect and deliver health information in an accessible, interactive and convenient fashion  (10) . Further, with the inclusion of other sensors and wearable devices (e.g., smartwatches and wristbands), apps can detect health-related data, like heart rate, heart rate variability, blood pressure, sleep quality and physical activity  (11) . All these services and tools can offer individuals with hypertension the ability to self-manage their condition through self-monitoring activities, feedback, tailored information and reminders  (10) . Thus, empowering individuals to take control over their health and ensure greater responsibility for their own healthcare management leads to improved quality of life, reduced hospitalizations and decreased costs  (12) .\n\nWhile several studies have demonstrated the potential of mobile health (mHealth) apps in supporting the hypertension management  (13) (14) (15) (16) , very rarely has the design and development process of these systems been described, which makes replication of research difficult. Moreover, there is lack of apps with a clinician portal to support remote patient management. Best practices guidelines demonstrate that the development of interventions needs to systematically consider evidenceand theory-based approaches to ensure they are effective in everyday practice  (17) . In addition, apps integrated with wearable devices for lifestyle interventions in people with hypertension with clinician portal are not available. Hence, in this paper, we present the design and development of a smartphone app with clinician portal for hypertension management using an intervention mapping approach and wearable devices."

The IMB model conceptualizes determinants to change behavior by providing a general framework that understands and promotes prevention activities across the populations with the behaviors of interest  (46) . This model was considered as it is an effective tool used to promote self-management in several chronic conditions  (47, 48) . For this intervention, (i) information includes relevant knowledge regarding hypertension, its medication and self-management to promote active engagement and improve treatment adherence, (ii) motivation includes both personal and social factors, including the positive and negative attitudes of individuals focusing on selfmanagement activities and individuals perception of support from others to promote treatment adherence and their desire to comply with the direction provided by others, and (iii) behavior focuses on the individuals' ability to perform necessary self-management activities and their perceived self-efficacy to perform the tasks. The design of the intervention considered the moderating factors that may affect adherence, including environmental constraints, living situations and psychological health. Figure  3  provides a conceptual framework that maps the intervention outcomes in Table  2 .\n\nAnother aspect considered in this study toward the development of the intervention was the concept of patient engagement. The concept of patient engagement combines patient activity (i.e., the patients' skills, knowledge, willingness and ability to manage their own healthcare) with the intervention to promote positive health behavior, including exercising and obtaining preventive care, while improving health outcomes, patient care and decreasing costs  (49) . To achieve this aspect, the patient health engagement (PHE) model was implemented, which is expressed in three dimensions: behavioral (the actions that patients consider to manage their health condition), emotional (the feelings that patients experience when adjusting\n\nTABLE Intervention outcomes, performance and change objectives matrix based on the need's assessment in phase .

Therefore, a proper security framework is needed that authenticates, authorizes, deidentifies and encrypts collected data. Moreover, the security framework needs to manage unknown risks associated with large number of mobile devices and endpoints connected to the server. The implemented security elements in this mHealth app include:\n\n\u2022 OAuth: An OAuth2 protocol is implemented within the app to provide authentication and authorization of the app. This protocol utilizes an Access Token for authorization which is acquired by the app by sending a request to the authorization server along with (i) a response type (t), (ii) an identifier assigned during registration (app_id), (iii) scope of requested permission (s), (iv) optional parameters to maintain request and response (p), and (v) redirection URI to which the authorization server would connect and redirect once the access is granted. Upon request of the Access Token, the authorization server would validate the request and present the app with its own local access and storage. Any invalid access would result in the disconnection of the protocol. Once the access is granted the user can authenticate themselves using their own credentials. The Authorization server validates the user credentials and upon confirmation requests the user to indicate the type of access required. Once the user confirms access the authentication server reviews the request and on approval redirects the URI along with the access token to the URI of the app. The app URI allows for the user to access the app services uninterrupted.

This technique also validates the request based on the access token used and the privileges available to the user.\n\n\u2022 Audit trail: The app is designed to log user data collected from a wearable sensor over set periods of time. These logs would be stored within the server along with the resource access date and time (or audit record). These audit records either new or old could be tracked by the system at any given time. Hence, any unauthorized activity that occurs outside the defined period would be considered invalid and would not hamper the normal operations of the system."

REST is a practical approach used in web app development as the system requires easy means to interact with independent systems. It is based on a stateless and resourceoriented architecture that considers everything as a resource. Every request is independent and the server does not store the state of the request  (53) . The type of REST Application Programming Interface (API) used in this app is called RESTful API. The RESTful API is based on a web system that identified resources based on a Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) to perform numerous operations, with the assistance of a Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) access method to acquire desired resources  (54) . The HTTP access methods include the POST method to create new resources, the GET method is used for getting resources, the PUT method focuses on updating the resource, and the DELETE method removes the collection of resources  (53) . The RESTful API was selected for this app as it has a lower barrier for developing apps with limited compatibility issues  (54) ."

      "text": "We present the design and development of an mHealth app for self-management of hypertension for the first time using a wearable cuffless BP device and an Intervention Mapping Approach. The intervention mapping approach is a structured and systematic approach to intervention development, using theorybased development. Lifestyle intervention included education, along with behaviors such as medication or treatment adherence, lifestyle modifications, such as limited smoking, reduced alcohol consumption, proper diet and regular exercise, and BP monitoring. In addition, communication with clinicians and medication management as critical to improving health outcomes for people with hypertension. Hence, an mHealth app was developed to address these aspects, while considering theoretical models to promote behavior changes (i.e., information, motivation, and behavior skills model)  (46)  and engagement (i.e., patient health engagement model)  (50) .\n\nmHealth or mobile health technology ensures that healthcare can be made more accessible and affordable to its users  (55) . Moreover, it has the potential to be implemented along with wearable devices to provide clinical tools for remote patient monitoring and shared decision-making  (56) , which is critical for\n\nTABLE Database groups, sub-groups and data types. Group Sub-group Data type Personal information Name String Email String Birth date Date and time Gender Boolean Address String Password String Medical data Data type String Data value Integer Timestamp Date and time Care plan Test String Test period Integer Maximum value Integer Medication Medication name String Quantity String Period (i.e., morning, afternoon, evening) String Notification Notification type String Timestamp Date and time\n\nimproved self-management  (57) , especially in chronic diseases such as hypertension  (58) . A recent systematic review of 24 studies evaluated the effectiveness of mHealth apps in self-management of hypertension and reported a reduction of systolic and diastolic BP (-3.78 and -1.57 mmHg) in the intervention groups compared to the control group. Further, the review highlighted improved medication adherence in 16 studies in the intervention group, while 8 demonstrate no significant differences  (59) . Overall, demonstrates long-term benefits in the self-management of hypertension  (59, 60)  . While there are several mHealth apps to support hypertension self-management, most of these apps have several limitations. A review of 186 hypertension apps identified from commercially available app stores such as Google Play Store and Apple App Store, demonstrated that most apps lacked a clear theoretical basis, and had absence of evidence related to their effectiveness and usability  (61) . Moreover, most apps did not include clinicians in designing or implementation and did not meet the current standard for the security and privacy  (61) . Furthermore, apps that described accurately measuring BP and heart rate using cuffless techniques did not include lifestyle intervention and clinician support  (13) . Hence, there is an unmet need for mHealth apps to include self-management and receive clinician support for the hypertension management  (13) . Our mHealth prototype app takes into consideration the needs of people with hypertension, providing a clear theoretical basis for the design, with special considerations for security, privacy, and device validation. In future, the app will be evaluated in a pilot trial to determine its effectiveness in self-management support and improving hypertension management."

      "title": "Strengths and limitations",
      "text": "A strength of this study is the use of an intervention mapping approach in the development of the app. We used multiple theoretical frameworks in the design of the app, which is similar to the recommendations provided by the Medical Research Council for the development of complex interventions  (62) . In addition, the intervention allows for the inclusion of remote patient monitoring, which can be used by clinicians to make critical healthcare decisions, while ensuring better self-management for people with hypertension. Furthermore, special consideration was made to ensure data security and privacy within the app, which is expected to improve patient trust and engagement  (63) .\n\nHowever, some limitations need to be addressed. First, the study draws perspectives on improving health outcomes of people with hypertension from the literature. While theoretical models can form a solid foundation in the design of novel interventions, it limits one's ability to determine the users' capabilities in using the system, especially in terms of structure, design and user interaction  (64) . Hence, requiring for the inclusion of users in the future work of the study to improve the overall design of the app and to determine its acceptability. Second, there appeared to be technical difficulties despite our efforts to minimize such issues. For example, there were connection dropouts for the cuffless BP device due to the short Bluetooth range contributing to the loss of data. While we looked to include code that automatically reconnects to the BP device when it is in range and extracts the last cached data -it is possible that the system accuracy could be affected. Therefore, having a negative impact on the outcomes of the project."

      "text": "This paper describes the development of an mHealth app using the intervention mapping approach. The intervention mapping approach was successfully used to translate the critical needs of people with hypertension into a theory-based intervention that can ensure treatment adherence and reduce cardiovascular risk. This was a comprehensive process and involved a multidisciplinary team to develop the theory-based intervention to deliver support for the target stakeholder. However, the app would need to be evaluated to determine its usability and feasibility, which will be performed in the next part of this study."
