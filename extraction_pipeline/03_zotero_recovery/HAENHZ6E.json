      "text": "Comparing insulin detemir with NPH insulin for T1DM showed lower risk of severe hypoglycaemia in favour of insulin detemir (moderatecertainty evidence). However, the 95% prediction interval indicated inconsistency in this finding. Both insulin detemir and insulin glargine compared with NPH insulin did not show benefits or harms for severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia. For all other main outcomes with overall low risk of bias and comparing insulin analogues with each other, there was no true beneficial or harmful effect for any intervention. Data on patient-important outcomes such as QoL, macrovascular and microvascular diabetic complications were sparse or missing. No clinically relevant differences were found between children and adults."

      "title": "Background",
      "text": "Diabetes is a condition that causes a person's blood sugar (glucose) level to become too high. Insulin is a hormone that is released by the pancreas (a small organ behind the stomach) which controls the blood levels of glucose. In people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) the pancreas does not produce any insulin, so the person has to inject insulin to control the glucose levels and keep well. The goal of insulin therapy is to provide insulin that mimics physiologic insulin secretion. Insulin is given by an injection under the skin (subcutaneous) by means of insulin syringes, insulin pens or insulin pumps. In order to control blood glucose levels in periods of fasting, basal or background insulin is needed. Basal insulin can be given by means of daily or twice-daily injections of an intermediate-acting or (ultra-)long-acting insulin. Basal insulin can be given as intermediate-acting human neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) insulin or as (ultra-)long-acting analogue insulin (synthetic insulin). Bolus insulin is taken at mealtime (prandial insulin) to control blood glucose levels following a meal and is given by means of short-acting or rapid-acting insulin. The aim for most people with T1DM is to achieve near-normal blood glucose levels to avoid long-term complications such as kidney and eye disease and to allow flexibility regarding time, type and amount of food intake. The major unwanted effect of insulin therapy is hypoglycaemia (low blood glucose) which can be severe."

Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews B A C K G R O U N D Description of the condition Onset of type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) can occur at any age and accounts for about 5% to 10% of all diabetes mellitus cases (Daneman 2006). It is a metabolic disease caused by an autoimmune destruction of pancreatic \u03b2-cells which results in a deficiency of insulin secretion. What causes the pathological autoimmune response is not yet fully understood but includes genetic susceptibility in combination with an environmental trigger (Field 1997; Maahs 2010; van der Werf 2007). The incidence of T1DM varies geographically, being highest in Northern Europe (Karvonen 1993). Over the years, a worldwide increase in incidence has been observed, the reasons for which are not yet clear (Onkamo 1999; Pitkaniemi 2004)."

      "text": "For people with T1DM, the goal of insulin therapy is to provide insulin that mimics physiologic insulin secretion. The most commonly used administration of insulin is by subcutaneous injection (ADA 2019). Insulin is usually applied through insulin syringes, insulin pens or insulin pumps. In order to control blood glucose levels in periods of fasting and to enable cells to incorporate glucose for production of energy, basal or background insulin is needed, which can be given by means of daily or twice-daily injections of an intermediate-acting or (ultra-)long-acting insulin preparation. Bolus insulin is taken at mealtime (prandial insulin) to control blood glucose levels following a meal and is given by means of short-acting or rapid-acting insulin, usually before meals (ADA 2019). With insulin pump-based treatments, a continuous delivery of rapid-acting insulin is administered through the pump, with the addition of mealtime insulin bolus (basal-bolus regimen). The aim for most people with T1DM is to achieve near-normal glycaemic levels (ADA 2019) and to allow flexibility regarding time, type and amount of food intake which can best be mastered through structured patient-education programmes (Pillay 2015).\n\nSince the early 1920s, people with diabetes were treated with insulin, which was purified from bovine or porcine pancreas (animal insulin). Recombinant 'human' insulin was first produced in Escherichia coli in 1978 by combining the expressed insulin A-and Bchains (Chance 1993). In 1982, the first insulin utilising recombinant deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) technology was marketed. At present, insulin is being produced predominantly in Escherichia coli and yeasts (Chance 1993).\n\nThe choice of basal insulin depends upon patient and prescriber preferences, 'lifestyle' and economic and health system considerations. Historically, intermediate-and longacting insulin preparations were obtained by crystallising either protamine (Neutral Protamin Hagedorn (NPH) type, also known as isophane insulin) or zinc (Lente type). Most insulins have a concentration of 100 units per mL (U100) but more concentrated insulin formulations (U200, U300, U500) are currently available (Heinemann 2019). Soluble human insulin consists of different oligomers (monomers, dimers and hexamers). When administered subcutaneously, insulin monomers and dimers are readily absorbed by blood capillaries. Before dissociation of hexamers into dimers and monomers, the crystalline structures need to dissolve, and this process prolongs the absorption phase and contributes to pharmacokinetic variability between injections. Hence, the rate of insulin absorption is fastest for monomers followed by dimers and hexamers, respectively (Gradel 2018). Treatment with intermediate-acting human insulins has drawbacks: NPH is associated with a pronounced insulin peak following injection, which seems to be associated with variable absorption (Heinemann 2000; Lepore 2000) and an increased risk of hypoglycaemia  (Tricco 2014) .\n\nIn order to achieve the potential benefits of near-normal glycaemic control with a reduced risk of hypoglycaemia, new insulins have been introduced to the market. In an effort to provide insulin with a more suitable physiological time course to persons with diabetes mellitus, insulin analogues have been developed. Insulin analogues are insulin-like molecules, engineered on the basis of the molecular structure of human insulin by changing the amino acid sequence and physiochemical properties. Four main (ultra-)longacting insulin analogues are currently available on the market: two long-acting insulin analogues (insulin detemir and insulin glargine U100), and two ultra-long-acting insulin analogues (insulin degludec and insulin glargine U300). The glargine U300 formulation has a more extended time-action profile than glargine U100 and is thought to achieve a more stable glycaemic control (Yale 2018).\n\nBecause the patent of insulin glargine has expired, biosimilar insulins have become available on the market. Biosimilar insulin glargine is a biological copy of the original insulin glargine which is believed to have comparable quality, efficacy and safety. Biosimilar insulin glargine is cheaper than the original insulin glargine (Soldatov 2019)."

      "title": "Adverse effects of the intervention",
      "text": "The risk of developing hypoglycaemic episodes varies among studies depending on the definition of hypoglycaemia and the desired glycaemic target (Kahler 2014). Due to a more sustainable molecule structure of insulin analogues, studies have indicated a reduced risk of severe hypoglycaemia compared with NPH insulin (Tricco 2014). However, data are conflicting (Laranjeira 2018). Targeting lower glycosylated haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) levels is o en difficult to achieve and leads to a higher incidence of hypoglycaemic events (Kahler 2014). However, targeting nearnormal glucose levels in order to avoid detrimental long-term consequences of hyperglycaemia is currently recommended in most people with type 1 diabetes (ADA 2019).\n\nCompared to human insulin, some insulin analogues have shown higher mitogenic potency and insulin-growth factor binding affinity in in-vitro and animal studies (Grant 1993; Jorgensen 1992; King 1985; Kurtzhals 2000). These effects differ depending on the insulin analogue, but results provided in these studies are unable to clarify their relevance for people with diabetes mellitus. The American and European pharmaceutical registration agencies, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Medicines Agency (EMA), have commented on the mitogenic and carcinogenic potency of long-acting insulin analogues and concluded that there appear to be few detrimental effects  (EMA 2003; EMA 2004; EMA 2012; FDA 2000; FDA 2005) . Observational studies have shown conflicting results regarding cancer risk with insulin analogues compared with human insulin (Hemkens 2009; Ruiter 2012).\n\nThe insulin analogues are usually more expensive than NPH insulin (Ewen 2019).

Although the latter approach offers some solution for adjusting the precision of the comparison, it does not account for correlation arising from inclusion of the same set of participants in multiple comparisons (Higgins 2011).\n\nWe would have re-analysed cluster-RCTs that had not appropriately adjusted for potential clustering of participants within clusters in their analyses. Variance of the intervention effects would have been inflated by a design effect. Calculation of a design effect involves estimation of an intracluster correlation coefficient (ICC). We would have obtained estimates of ICCs by contacting study authors, or by imputing ICC values using either estimates from other included studies that reported ICCs or external estimates from empirical research (e.g. Bell 2013).

A prediction interval requires at least three studies to be calculated and specifies a predicted range for the true treatment effect in an individual study (Riley 2011).

Two studies were unpublished, but clinical study synopses and parts of the CSRs were obtained and provided data for inclusion (NCT00595374; NCT00605137). The remaining included studies were published. For all studies, except two, it was possible to retrieve additional information from clinical trials registers, documents from regulatory agencies, CSRs, clinical study synopses and investigators (Bolli 2009; Porcellati 2004). The number of records per included studies varied from 1 to 21. Thirteen studies are awaiting assessment."

All studies had an open-label design, except for one which was double-blinded (SWITCH 1). The duration of the intervention ranged from 24 weeks to 24 months. Seven studies had an additional extension period (BEGIN Basal-Bolus Type\n\n1; BEGIN Flex T1; BEGIN Young; Davies 2014; Standl 2004; Thalange 2013; Vague 2003). All studies except two were multicentre studies (Porcellati 2004; Urakami 2017). The number of study centres ranged from 1 to 90. Sixteen studies were multinational (Bartley 2008; BEGIN Basal-Bolus Type 1; BEGIN Flex T1; BEGIN Young; Davies 2014; Heller 2009; Home 2005; Pieber 2007; PRESCHOOL; Robertson 2007; Russell-Jones 2004; Schober 2002; Standl 2004; SWITCH 1; Thalange 2013; Vague 2003). None of the studies was performed in low-or middleincome countries. None of the studies was terminated early. Participants Twenty-three studies reported the ethnicity of the participants: 19 studies included mainly white people (Bartley 2008; BEGIN Basal-Bolus Type 1; BEGIN Flex T1; BEGIN Young; Chase 2008; Fulcher 2005; Heller 2009; Home 2005\u00b8 NCT00595374; Pieber 2007; PRESCHOOL; Ratner 2000; Robertson 2007; Russell-Jones 2004; Schober 2002; Standl 2004; SWITCH 1; Thalange 2013; Vague 2003), one study mainly Asian people (Davies 2014) and three studies included Asian people only (Kobayashi 2007; Liu 2016; NCT00605137) (Appendix 9). All studies included both genders. The age of the participants varied from 4.2 to 44 years. The duration of T1DM varied from 2.1 to 23.2 years (Appendix 10). Interventions Nine studies compared insulin detemir with NPH insulin (Bartley 2008; Kobayashi 2007; NCT00595374; NCT00605137; Robertson 2007; Russell-Jones 2004; Standl 2004; Thalange 2013; Vague 2003). Nine studies compared insulin glargine with NPH insulin (Bolli 2009; Chase 2008; Fulcher 2005; Home 2005; Liu 2016; Porcellati 2004; PRESCHOOL; Ratner 2000; Schober 2002). Two studies compared insulin detemir with insulin glargine (Heller 2009; Pieber 2007) and two studies compared insulin degludec with insulin detemir (BEGIN Young; Davies 2014). Finally, four studies compared insulin degludec with insulin glargine (BEGIN Basal-Bolus Type 1; BEGIN Flex T1; SWITCH 1; Urakami 2017).\n\nAll studies except one applied NPH insulin once or two times daily.\n\nPorcellati 2004 applied NPH insulin four times a day.\n\nStudies started insulin administration in different ways: four studies comparing insulin detemir with NPH insulin started with lower doses of insulin detemir compared with NPH insulin (Kobayashi 2007; NCT00605137; Russell-Jones 2004; Standl 2004). One study comparing insulin degludec with insulin glargine stated that if prior basal insulin was taken more than once daily, then the dose of glargine had to be reduced by 20% to 30% and insulin degludec dose was reduced based on the investigators' decision (BEGIN Flex T1). Another study comparing insulin degludec with insulin glargine stated that if more than one daily dose had been taken prior to the study, then the total daily basal dose was calculated and replaced with insulin degludec in a 1:1 ratio and the insulin glargine dose was recommended to be reduced by 20% to 30% (BEGIN Basal-Bolus Type 1). One study comparing insulin detemir with insulin glargine stated that the insulin detemir dose was reduced by 30% in both the morning and evening doses from the previous regimen and insulin glargine was started with a dose of 20% to 30% less than the previous regimen (Pieber 2007).\n\nEleven studies applied insulin aspart as fast-acting insulin  ( Bartley 2008; BEGIN Young; Davies 2014; Heller 2009; Kobayashi 2007; Liu 2016; NCT00595374; Pieber 2007; Robertson 2007; Thalange 2013; Vague 2003); five studies applied insulin lispro (Bolli 2009; Chase 2008; Fulcher 2005; Porcellati 2004; PRESCHOOL); five studies applied human insulin (Home 2005; Ratner 2000; Schober 2002; Russell-Jones 2004; Standl 2004\n\n) and one study did not specify the type of fast-acting insulin applied (NCT00605137)."

One study was unpublished, but data were available from a clinical study synopsis (NCT00605137). Another unpublished study reported no statistically significant differences for severe hypoglycaemia between the intervention groups but did not provide numerical data (NCT00595374\n\n). Five studies reported severe hypoglycaemia as requiring third party assistance (Bartley 2008; Kobayashi 2007; NCT00605137; Robertson 2007; Russell-Jones 2004; Standl 2004). One study added to this definition that blood glucose < 2.8 mmol/L should be recorded or symptom reversal with food, glucose or glucagon (Vague 2003). One study defined severe hypoglycaemia as episodes where the children were semi-conscious, unconscious or in a coma, with or without convulsions (Thalange 2013). Bartley 2008 reported most events: data from the CSR of this study showed that 5/331 participants (1.5%) in the insulin detemir group compared with 6/164 participants (3.7%) in the NPH insulin group experienced a hypoglycaemic coma; 2/331 participants (0.6%) in the insulin detemir group compared with 0/164 participants (0%) in the NPH insulin group experienced hypoglycaemic convulsions; 0/331 participants (0%) in the insulin detemir group compared with 1/164 participants (0.6%) in the NPH insulin group experienced loss of consciousness due to hypoglycaemia. Robertson 2007 reported most events in children: 3/232 children (1.3%) in the insulin detemir group compared with 3/115 children (2.6%) in the NPH insulin group were admitted to hospital due to hypoglycaemia; 4/232 children (1.7%) in the insulin detemir group compared with 4/115 children (3.4%) in the NPH insulin group were unconscious due to hypoglycaemia; 2/332 children (0.6%) in the insulin detemir group compared with 4/115 children (3.4%) in the NPH insulin group experienced hypoglycaemia with convulsions; 4/332 children (1.2%) in the insulin detemir group compared with 2/115 children Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health.\n\nCochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (1.7%) in the NPH insulin group received glucagon treatment. One study stipulated, that the risk of experiencing hypoglycaemia could have been influenced by lack of blinding: \"Investigators and patients in this trial may have been reluctant to aggressively increase the dose of a new basal insulin preparation such as insulin detemir because of the fear of hypoglycemia, especially during the night\" (Vague 2003)."

We included 26 studies with 8784 participants: 2428 participants were randomised to NPH insulin, 2889 participants to insulin detemir, 2095 participants to insulin glargine and 1372 participants to insulin degludec. Eight studies contributing 21% of all participants included children.\n\nThe amount of evidence on patient-important outcomes was limited from full-text publications. However, we could retrieve substantial data on patient-important outcomes from the CSRs. There was moderate-certainty evidence comparing insulin detemir with NPH insulin for T1DM showing a lower risk of severe hypoglycaemia in favour of insulin detemir. However, the 95% prediction interval indicated inconsistency of this result. Insulin detemir or insulin glargine compared with NPH insulin did not show benefits or harms for severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia. For all other main outcomes, with overall low risk of bias and comparing insulin analogues with each other, there were no clear differences. Data on patient-important outcomes such as health-related quality of life, macrovascular and microvascular diabetic complications were sparse or missing.\n\nComparing the insulin analogues detemir and glargine with NPH insulin, we are moderately confident about the results for all-cause mortality, severe (nocturnal) hypoglycaemia, SAEs and HbA1c. We are uncertain about the effects on non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke and health-related quality of life, mainly because data were sparse or there were only a few studies which did not last long enough to investigate these outcomes.\n\nThere was no evidence of a difference in any outcome between children and adults."

We identified two unpublished studies (NCT00595374; NCT00605137). We managed to retrieve additional unpublished information on all studies, except for three studies which were only available as full-text publications (Bolli 2009; Porcellati 2004; Urakami 2017). Two study authors provided personal information on their studies (Home 2005; Urakami 2017), One unpublished study did not have a CSR but some data could be retrieved from a clinical study synopsis (NCT00595374). Two Japanese studies had CSRs, but we were unable to obtain the complete version of these (Kobayashi 2007; NCT00605137). Two studies had a crossover design and not all data could be analysed or were reported before cross-over which we needed because of potential carryover effects (SWITCH 1; Urakami 2017). We looked for additional studies and cross-checked our data with the data from other metaanalyses of relevance\n\n(Laranjeira 2018; Tricco 2014; Tricco 2018). The information obtained from CSRs was clearly the best to establish an adequate 'Risk of bias assessment' and to maximise the yield of information for our prespecified outcomes (Appendix 22; Appendix 23; Appendix 24; Appendix 25; Appendix 26; Appendix 27; Appendix 28; Appendix 29; Appendix 30; Appendix 31; Appendix 32; Appendix 33; Appendix 34; Appendix 35; Appendix 36; Appendix 37; Appendix 38; Appendix 39; Appendix 40; Appendix 41; Appendix 42\n\n). We noticed major differences between reported outcomes in publications and CSRs, e.g. all-cause mortality was documented in 25% of publications compared to 91% in CSRs (Appendix 41). SAEs and non-serious adverse events were documented in 54% of publications compared to 91% in CSRs (Appendix 41). However, the amount of information within the CSRs varied substantially and we probably did not have access to a single full CSR (Appendix 7).\n\nWe investigated a broad spectrum of people with T1DM as both children and adults were included. However, we did not include pregnant women with T1DM, as we anticipated these women would have pronounced fluctuating insulin requirements and a specific hypoglycaemia risk profile. All studies were performed in white or Asian people. Data on people of African origin were lacking. None of the studies was performed in low-or middle-income settings."

The usual primary endpoint was change in HbA1c which does not minimise the reliability of analysing other outcomes such as hypoglycaemia by means of meta-analysis, because with a potential benefit of newer compounds in reducing HbA1c, a benefit of the number of hypoglycaemic episodes could be expected. Adjustments of hypoglycaemic events for HbA1c levels or achievement of certain HbA1c thresholds without hypoglycaemia would provide important information. Unfortunately, only a few of our included studies reported on this combined endpoint, and, if done, no clear differences were recorded.\n\nAll studies except one had an open-label design (SWITCH 1). This could have influenced some of the subjective outcome measures, especially health-related quality of life, non-serious adverse events, mild/moderate hypoglycaemia and some measures of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. Another factor influencing findings could have been investigators being more careful when adjusting the newer insulin analogues due to less clinical experience with these compounds. Also, some participants might have been more prone to measure blood glucose as they might have anticipated experiencing more hypoglycaemic episodes with human insulin preparations, thereby even affecting hypoglycaemia confirmed with blood glucose measurements.\n\nImproving and maintaining glycaemic control in T1DM is a key objective. However, hypoglycaemia is a serious problem affecting health-related quality of life and treatment satisfaction of people with diabetes, making it difficult to achieve near-normal glucose levels in T1DM. Therefore, for any proclaimed benefit of an intervention on hypoglycaemia, it is vital to evaluate the risk of bias in order to establish reliable results. 'Risk of bias' assessment depends considerably on the definition of hypoglycaemia. It appears low if severe hypoglycaemia is also reported as a serious adverse event (SAE) because there is a standard definition of SAEs, or if the combined endpoint of HbA1c levels with severe hypoglycaemia is reported. Unfortunately, no data were available for the combined endpoint HbA1c with severe hypoglycaemia for the comparisons insulin detemir versus NPH insulin and insulin glargine versus NPH insulin. Of note, only about one third of participants being treated with insulin glargine, insulin detemir or insulin degludec achieved an HbA1c < 7% without severe hypoglycaemia. Other definitions of severe hypoglycaemia like hypoglycaemia-induced coma or convulsions, necessity for intubation or intensive-care unit stay also reflect hard clinical endpoints. However, the included studies most o en defined severe hypoglycaemia as a hypoglycaemic event which needed \"third party assistance\". This is prone to bias because third party assistance might encompass a broad range of interventions, e.g. giving food or a drink by a relative or friend, subcutaneous glucagon injection or intravenous glucose administration. Only Thalange 2013 made an effort to define third party assistance in a way that minimised risk of bias (the child had to be semiconscious or unconscious or in coma with or without convulsions and may have required parenteral treatment with glucagon or intravenous glucose). A Cochrane Review associated to this systematic review will establish an in-depth analysis of the definitions and reporting of hypoglycaemia in trials of long-acting insulin analogues in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus (\u00d8rskov Ipsen 2020).\n\nAn overview of the reported definitions of hypoglycaemic episodes in our included studies found no evidence of differences between the various interventions on these outcomes with the exception of insulin detemir compared with NPH insulin, demonstrating a benefit for severe hypoglycaemia, any/mild/symptomatic nocturnal hypoglycaemia and mild/moderate hypoglycaemia (Appendix 42). With the exception of severe hypoglycaemia, we judged the risk of bias as 'some concerns' for measurement of these outcomes. There was no benefit or risk of insulin detemir for hypoglycaemia reported as a SAE or severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia event (Appendix 42).\n\nLong-term complications of diabetes were sparsely reported. Longterm complications of diabetes develop over years, and therefore the duration of the included studies might have been too short to identify if an intervention had beneficial or harmful effects. Data on all-cause mortality were most o en retrieved from CSRs and few deaths were observed in the studies. However, to our knowledge, no data from long-term observational studies indicate that the type of intermediate or (ultra-)long-acting insulin influences the risk of death or macrovascular and microvascular complications of diabetes. However, long-term follow-up from interventional studies has shown that good glycaemic control in people with T1DM is an important factor for preventing complications (DCCT/EDIC 2016).\n\nNo studies reported the direct costs of insulin treatment during the study period. Several studies had co-publications with economic analyses in different country settings based on assumptions derived from the clinical study (Bartley 2008; BEGIN Basal-Bolus Type 1; BEGIN Flex T1; BEGIN Young; Pieber 2007). However, these assumptions do not seem to be supported by our meta-analyses of the clinical trial data. Furthermore, other studies have shown that the direct costs of the long-acting insulin analogues o en are substantially higher than the costs of NPH insulin (Ewen 2019).\n\nOnly one study had not received free drugs or financial funding from the pharmaceutical industry (Porcellati 2004). It is known that studies receiving funding or provision of free drugs or devices from a pharmaceutical company lead to more favourable results and conclusions compared to studies sponsored by other sources (Lundh 2017)."

We tried to explore inconsistency of results and the reasons for it through subgroup and sensitivity analyses. The only factor, comparing insulin detemir with NPH insulin, that indicated an influence on the effect estimate for the sensitivity analysis of one outcome (severe hypoglycaemia) was publication status. This has to be interpreted with caution because the subgroup of studies with unpublished data consisted of two studies only.\n\nWe identified 13 studies as 'awaiting classification'. Data from these studies would have added information on an additional 1194 participants. Most of the studies were listed as completed in trials registers, but data, publications or both were not available. For some of the studies, these data might not yet have been analysed, but other studies were completed years ago and are still not published (Basal Analog Study; EudraCT 2007-004144-74; J-Collection; NCT00564018; UMIN000021046).

Our meta-analyses, when performed, were limited by the inability to use individual participant data to assess whether distinct clinical characteristics may have influenced the effect estimates of the interventions. Many of the included studies were designed and powered to detect changes in HbA1c but, for all studies, we were able to extract most of our predefined outcomes.\n\nSeveral studies were published in more than one publication which, for some studies, made it difficult to separate the primary publication from companion papers (for details, see Included studies).\n\nTwo review authors carried out data extraction. However, the review authors extracting the data were not blinded as to from which study they were extracting data.\n\nWe only included studies with a duration of 24 weeks or more to get some information on patient-relevant outcomes; by not including studies with a shorter duration, we might have underestimated the short-term risks of the interventions.\n\nA potential selection bias exists as more healthy and motivated people may participate in a clinical study. However, a Cochrane Review observed that clinical outcomes in people participating in RCTs are not substantially different to outcomes in comparable individuals outside the RCT context (Vist 2008).\n\nWe requested CSRs and other information from EMA. EMA replied that it \"is currently operating within the fourth phase of its business continuity plan to ensure operational continuity during its relocation to Amsterdam. Whilst every effort is being made to process all requests as soon as possible, you should be aware that due to these exceptional circumstances from October 2019 requests cannot be processed immediately and will be dealt in a chronological order from the time they were received\".

Because we do not know when the last information package of EMA will be available, we plan to make full use of EMA data in a future update of our review. In case of very important EMA data, we will publish an interim updated version of our review as soon as possible."

The most recent systematic review was performed for refinement of the WHO Essential Medicine List (EML), which was an update of a systematic review published in 2014 (Tricco 2018). The review for WHO EML included adults with T1DM, but also included pregnant women with T1DM. We did not chose to include the latter cohort as pregnancy causes considerable changes in insulin sensitivity. Tricco 2018 included studies irrespective of study duration. We required a minimum duration of 24 weeks to get more reliable information on patient-relevant outcome measures. Short-term studies usually evaluate surrogate markers and o en have shorter intervention periods than the titration periods of the longer-term studies. Tricco 2018 analysed insulin glargine and insulin detemir together; we chose to perform separate analyses. Tricco 2018 included 62 RCTs according to the abstract. However, they missed identifying co-publications of primary publications. Therefore, several studies were included more than once and handled as independent studies. Another difference to our review is the lack of identification of unpublished data, especially CSRs which provided substantial information to all our analyses including 'Risk of bias' assessment. Tricco 2018 reported a statistically significant decrease in HbA1c with insulin analogues compared with NPH insulin and a statistically significant lower risk of severe hypoglycaemia, which we could not verify in our analyses. One umbrella review of reviews compared longacting insulin analogues with NPH insulin (Laranjeira 2018). Eleven systematic reviews were identified and a total of 25 RCTs were included irrespective of age of participants or duration of the intervention. The conclusion of this overview, based on data for all systematic reviews, was that long-acting insulin analogues were more effective than NPH insulin concerning lowering HbA1c. No statistically significant differences were found for severe hypoglycaemia (Laranjeira 2018)."

Nine RCTs compared NPH insulin with insulin detemir or insulin glargine, respectively. Two RCTs each compared insulin detemir with insulin glargine or insulin degludec, respectively. Four RCTs compared insulin degludec with insulin glargine. No studies compared insulin degludec with NPH insulin. There was moderate-certainty evidence that insulin detemir reduces severe hypoglycaemia compared with NPH insulin. However, the 95% prediction interval indicated inconsistency which means that if we performed an additional study comparing insulin detemir with NPH insulin there may not be a clear difference in the risk of severe hypoglycaemia for this comparison.\n\nThere were no clear differences for severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia comparing insulin detemir or insulin glargine with NPH insulin. For all other main outcomes, with overall low risk of bias and comparing (ultra-)long-acting insulin analogues with each other, there were also no clear differences.\n\nDefinitions of hypoglycaemia varied substantially among the studies. Health-related quality of life was inconsistently reported and did not show clear benefits or harms for any insulin analogue or NPH insulin. Data on macrovascular and microvascular diabetic complications were sparse or missing.\n\nIt remains unclear whether the risk of hypoglycaemia, especially severe and severe nocturnal hypoglycaemia, is associated with clinically relevant differences regarding the type of (ultra-)longacting or intermediate-acting insulin."
