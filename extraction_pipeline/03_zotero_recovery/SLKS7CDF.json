  "title": "The effectiveness of digital health technologies for patients with diabetes mellitus: A systematic review",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. At the same time, digital health technologies (DHTs), which include mobile health apps (mHealth) have been rapidly gaining popularity in the self-management of chronic diseases, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic. However, while a great variety of DM-specific mHealth apps exist on the market, the evidence supporting their clinical effectiveness is still limited. Methods: A systematic review was performed. A systematic search was conducted in a major electronic database to identify randomized controlled trials (RCTs) of mHealth interventions in DM published between June 2010 and June 2020. The studies were categorized by the type of DM and impact of DMspecific mHealth apps on the management of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) was analysed. Results: In total, 25 studies comprising 3,360 patients were included. The methodological quality of included trials was mixed. Overall, participants diagnosed with T1DM, T2DM and Prediabetes all demonstrated greater improvements in HbA1c as a result of using a DHT compared with those who experienced usual care. The analysis revealed an overall improvement in HbA1c compared with usual care, with a mean difference of -0.56% for T1DM, -0.90% for T2DM and -0.26% for Prediabetes. Conclusion: DM-specific mHealth apps may reduce HbA1c levels in patients with T1DM, T2DM and Prediabetes. The review highlights a need for further research on the wider clinical effectiveness of diabetes-specific mHealth specifically within T1DM and Prediabetes. These should include measures which go beyond HbA1c, capturing outcomes including short-term glycemic variability or hypoglycemic events.",

      "text": "Diabetes is a leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide  (1) (2) (3) . The past three decades have seen a dramatic increase in the number of adults living with diabetes, with the World Health Organisation (WHO) highlighting an increase in prevalence from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014  (4) , and forecasts suggesting this could be as high as 700 million by as early as 2045  (5) . Unfortunately, most people living with diabetes do not meet International Diabetes Federation (IDF) treatment targets of glycemic control, i.e., glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) \u22647% for those with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM)  (6)  and <6.5% for those living with Type 1 diabetes (T1DM)  (7) .\n\nWhen diabetes is poorly managed, it can result in systemic complications such as coronary heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, retinopathy, and foot ulcers  (8) , these complications can further progress to severe disabilities or even death. As such, the WHO estimate diabetes to be the ninth leading cause of death worldwide, with an estimated 1.5 million deaths as a direct result of diabetes  (4) . Additionally, diabetes workforce shortages  (9, 10) , limited public funding, and increasing secondary care backlogs all complicate this picture, often resulting in those with diabetes failing to obtain the right support at the right time  (11) .\n\nWith the prevalence of diabetes only expected to increase, and no clear and scalable solution to solve the supply side issues faced by healthcare systems, there remains an urgent unmet need for cost-effective and widely accessible strategies which can empower and motivate people with diabetes to adhere to bestpractice diabetes self-care behaviours. Over the years, there has been a growing body of evidence to support the role of selfmanagement in treating Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)  (12, 13) .\n\nDigital health technologies (DHTs), which include mobile applications (apps) have been rapidly gaining popularity in the self-management of chronic diseases  (14) , particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic  (15) . Given their widespread availability, minimal barriers to access and often low cost, DHTs have been proposed as cost-effective tools to supplement clinician visits and deliver continuity of care to those who may struggle to access incumbent services. Specifically, the availability of these technologies for purposes including self-management of blood glucose  (16) , insulin dosing and adjustment  (17)  and dietary advice  (18) , has created further opportunities for self-management among patients with diabetes mellitus.\n\nTo date, there have been numerous systematic reviews of DHTs dedicated to the management of either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes which report positive intervention effects  (19) (20) (21) . However, others have been less conclusive, with some reporting on the use of SMS messaging  (22)  and computerbased platforms  (23) , while many were also conducted several years ago  (24, 25) , limiting interpretation given the significant rate of technological change experienced in the past decade. It is therefore clear that differences in study design, intervention group, outcome measures and the specific functions and features of the technologies under consideration have led to widespread variation in the estimation of the impact of DHTs within diabetes.\n\nThe aim of this systematic review is to therefore summarise the available literature concerning the impact of using digital health technologies on laboratory confirmed HbA1c, for individuals diagnosed with T1DM, T2DM and Prediabetes."

Only studies published in the English language were included due to a lack of resources available to conduct reliable translation. Only studies that reported HbA1c as a patient outcome were included for this systematic review as HbA1c is the most widely used and most studied clinical outcome related to technological therapy for DM, including DHTs  (27) .

Studies were diverse with respect to the type of DM, study design, number of participants, and DHT functions and features. Often, different DHT features were combined, or the DHT was used in conjunction with web portals, feedback from HCPs, pedometers or other Bluetooth-enabled devices. Because of that, it was not possible to distinguish a relationship between specific DHT features and health outcomes."

      "title": "Interpretation considering other evidence",
      "text": "Overall, mHealth solutions were generally discussed to be feasible solutions to support the management of diabetes. Improvements in HbA1c in people with T1DM or T2DM observed in this review are consistent with the results of other reviews  (27, 37, (54) (55) (56) (57) (58) .\n\nAlongside a reduction in HbA1c observed in the intervention group of the majority of included trials (as discussed above), a number of included trials also observed varying improvements in other patient outcomes including, but not limited to, fasting blood glucose, blood pressure, hypo and hyper glycemic events, cholesterol, body weight and self-care. Other reviews have analysed the impact on mHealth interventions of a number of these clinical outcomes  (27, 37, 54, 57) , however, unlike HbA1c, no consistent clinical impact has been identified.\n\nA reduction in HbA1c was observed in 19 of the 20 intervention groups for T2DM, with only 1 study observing an increase  (28) , yielding an average reduction of -0.90% across all studies identified. This is similar to recent findings by Eberle et al.  (27) , who identified an average reduction in HbA1c of -1.1% for people with T2DM, however, others have observed Overview of the screening process.\n\nsmaller effects of -0.40%  (54, 57)  and 0.44%  (58)  when focussed on different patient populations and/or less recent publications.\n\nFive of the 25 studies reported dropout rates above 20% before the study was complete  (36, 38, 39, 48, 52) , leading to possible under or overestimation of clinical impact. Observing rates of attrition above 20% in RCT's for app-based interventions is consistent with a recent systematic review and meta-analysis that observed an average dropout rate of 40% in RCT's of app-based interventions for chronic disease (59) compared with lower rates of attrition in trials of non-appbased interventions  (60) (61) (62) . Previous studies have demonstrated that up to 80% of all participants in mHealth interventions may engage in only minimal use of these interventions, defined as logging in to the service less than twice, and only a small fraction of users consistently use the intervention long term  (63, 64) . Low attrition rates characterised by perception of own health as poor (incentivizing the need to change)  (65) , those who wanted to be involved in their own health care  (66)  and those who are younger and have higher levels of health literacy  (65, 67) . Another association with low attrition was with those engaged in multiple interventions. Individuals engaged in internet or phone programs as well as apps were more likely to remain in research studies  (68) . These characteristics are an important consideration for clinicians in understanding those patients who are more likely to engage with DHT and also appreciating the potential for an additive value of DHT technology in complementing existing support, such as that of traditional healthcare.\n\nFurthermore, one explanation for the modest improvements in HbA1c observed could be the experience level of those participating in the studies. Where reported, the average duration of diabetes in the intervention group was 12.49 years and 11.7 years in the control group.\n\nThis \"learning effect\" was captured in the finding that overall, a reduction in HbA1c was observed in 23 intervention groups and 21 control groups across the 25 included trials. Therefore, there is less likelihood of reducing HbA1c if people are already well acquainted with managing their condition. A study with a narrower focus on newly and recently diagnosed patients may yield different results.\n\nFinally, we defined glycemic control as maintaining the blood glucose control within the normal or euglycemic blood glucose levels safely, i.e. no hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Although we observed overall improvements in HbA1c for people with T1DM or T2DM, HbA1c provides only an approximate measure of glucose control and does not address short-term glycemic variability or hypoglycemic events. This means that a raised or decline HbA1c may suggest an increase in hypoglycemic events which are associated with negative patient outcomes, including increased risks of non-fatal stroke, cardiovascular related death, and total mortality  (69) ."

    {
      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "An important limitation of our review is that we excluded all studies that did not report the results of RCTs. Observational studies and non-randomized trials may provide important information useful for understanding the effectiveness of mHealth, as now suggested by regulators, including the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence  (70) .\n\nNevertheless, we opted for excluding these studies as nonrandomized trial designs carry a greater risk of being affected by multiple known and unknown biases  (71) . Another limitation of the review process could have been that the review only reports on literature available at the time of the search and written in English. Although two experienced reviewers assessed the records, we cannot entirely rule out that we missed potentially relevant articles. Many of the primary studies were found to have low methodological quality and level of reporting, often impacted by randomisation, concealment, and blinding between subjects and assessors. However, it should be considered that randomisation, concealment, and blinding between subjects and assessors in digital health-based RCTs is challenging due to the nature of subjects receiving and potentially requiring support to use a digital health technology.\n\nFurthermore, only one study included in this review focused on Prediabetes  (47) , so this result should be treated with caution. Additionally, articles focusing specifically on gestational diabetes were not included in this review. Finally, the effects of mHealth are likely to differ depending on the specific type of intervention, the specific disease, and the specific context. Due to the focus on diabetes-specific mHealth interventions for this review, it is not The mean age in the intervention group was 52.1 years and 52.0 years in the control group. Prior analyses have demonstrated how older age can impact digital proficiency, and therefore a study with a greater proportion of people living with DM, who can be of any age, may yield different results.\n\nFrom the clinical perspective, we defined glycemic control as maintaining the blood glucose control within the normal or euglycemic blood glucose levels safely, i.e. no hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. HbA1c provides only an approximate measure of glucose control and does not address short-term glycemic variability or hypoglycemic events. This means that a raised or decline HbA1c may suggest an increase in hypoglycemic events which are associated with an increased risk of non-fatal stroke, cardiovascular related death, and total mortality  (69) .\n\nFinally, the methodological quality of included trials was mixed. Two studies were considered high quality, seven acceptable and 16 low. Studies reported as low in quality were often associated with issues with generalisability of the findings beyond the patient group under observation, challenges in generalising groups who are less motivated and technologically inclined and challenges to generalisability due to underpowering caused by sample size restrictions or dropout rates."

      "text": "Our review identified 25 studies reporting results of RCTs of mHealth interventions for patients with T1DM, T2DM and Prediabetes. Overall, this review demonstrates that diabetesspecific mHealth interventions may reduce HbA1c levels in patients with T1DM, T2DM and Prediabetes. The review highlights a need for further research on the wider clinical effectiveness of diabetes-specific mHealth specifically within T1DM and Prediabetes. These should include measures which go beyond HbA1c, capturing outcomes including short-term glycemic variability or hypoglycemic events."
