  "title": "Examining First-and Second-Level Digital Divide at the Intersection of Race/Ethnicity, Gender, and Socioeconomic Status: An Analysis of the National Health and Aging Trends Study",
  "abstract": "Background and Objectives: Significant societal and technological changes in the 2010s called for an up-to-date understanding of the digital divide among older adults in the United States. This trend study aimed to examine the effects of race/ethnicity and the intersecting effects of race/ethnicity with other marginalized identities related to gender, income, education, and occupation on the first-and second-level digital divide. \n Research Design and Methods: Utilizing a nationally representative sample of older community dwellers from the National Health and Aging Trends Study, we conducted weighted logistic regressions at 3 time points (2011/2013, 2015, and 2019). The first-level digital divide was measured by access to working phones or computers/laptops; the second-level divide was measured by 7 activities in personal task, social, and health-related Internet use. \n Results: The first-level racial/ethnic digital divide became nonsignificant in 2019, whereas the disparities in all second-level measures persisted. The intersecting effects of race/ethnicity with low education and/or low income became nonsignificant in 2019 for personal-task use. However, the interactions with low education and/or low income became significant for social and health-related use in 2015 and/or 2019. Discussion and Implications: This study highlights the persistence of the second-level racial/ethnic digital divide among older community dwellers in the United States, especially the exacerbated social and health-related digital divide for people of color with low socioeconomic status. By considering intersections of marginalized social identities, policymakers and stakeholders should develop targeted strategies to bridge the digital divide, promote health outcomes, and reduce health disparities.",

      "text": "The 2010s witnessed a spiking increase in Internet use among older adults in the United States, from 46% in 2010  (Perrin and Duggan, 2015)  to 75% in 2021  (Faverio, 2022) . With healthy aging becoming a critical societal issue in recent decades, previous studies indicate that digital technology, including the Internet, may help to mitigate aging challenges  (Lindeman, 2017; Szabo et al., 2019) . Transcending geographic distance, Internet use facilitates older adults' social connections and communication and provides easy access to enormous online resources  (Szabo et al., 2019; Vassli and Farshchian, 2018) . Older community dwellers commonly can use the Internet to meet social (e.g., accessing social networking sites), personal tasks-related (e.g., online shopping and banking), and health-related needs (e.g., online health infor-mation seeking). Growing evidence suggests that Internet use may diversify older community dwellers' social engagement  (Szabo et al., 2019) , increase positive self-perception of aging  (Wang and Gu, 2023) , maintain independence  (Lindeman, 2017; Vassli and Farshchian, 2018) , and promote well-being  (Szabo et al., 2019) ."

      "title": "Race/Ethnicity and the Digital Divide in the United States",
      "text": "Despite the essential increase in Internet use, the digital divide, described as inequalities in digital technology use, mainly from three levels-material access (first-level), capability and skills in use (second-level), and consequences and beneficial outcomes (third-level)-still exists among older community dwellers  (Castells, 2002; Hargittai, 2001) . Marginalized social identities relevant to age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, income, disability status, and urban/rural residency are consistently linked to the digital divide  (Choi and DiNitto, 2013; Scheerder et al., 2017) . Most importantly, reflecting the racialized structural disparities in the United States, older community dwellers who are Black, indigenous, and other people of color (BIPOC) are less likely to access the Internet and use it than their non-Hispanic White counterparts.\n\nPrior research points to the significance of race/ethnicity in explaining the first-level digital divide among older community dwellers in the United States over the past decade. Studies using nationally representative data around the earlier years of the 2010s, such as the 2011 National Health and Aging Trends Study (NHATS;  Choi and DiNitto, 2013)  and 2012 Health and Retirement Study (HRS;  Yu et al., 2016) , and more recent data, such as the 2016 HRS  (Choi et al., 2020; Choi, Kanthawala, et al., 2022) , 2018 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS;  He et al., 2022) , and 2018 NHATS  (Bell et al., 2013) , found that older BIPOC community dwellers were less likely to have access to the Internet than their counterparts of non-Hispanic White.\n\nRegarding the second-level digital divide, consistent evidence over the past decade indicates disparities in healthrelated Internet use between older BIPOC and non-Hispanic White community dwellers. Older BIPOC community dwellers were less likely to use the Internet for health-related purposes in the 2011 NHATS  (Choi and DiNitto, 2013) , 2012 California Health Interview Survey (CHIS;  Yoon et al., 2018) , 2014 HRS  (Liu et al., 2020; Mitchell et al., 2019) , and 2018 NHIS  (He et al., 2022; Hung et al., 2020) . In terms of social and personal task use, contradictory evidence is reported in the literature. Racial/ethnic disparity in the social use of the Internet, favoring older non-Hispanic White community dwellers, was identified in the 2012 HRS  (Yu et al., 2016) , whereas no significant differences were found in the 2016 HRS  (Byrne et al., 2021)  or online convenient samples in the early 2010s  (Bell et al., 2013; Hutto et al., 2015) . As for using the Internet for personal tasks, some studies indicated no racial/ethnic differences in online shopping and banking  (Choi and DiNitto, 2013)  and searching news and other information online  (Li et al., 2021; Tsetsi and Rains, 2017) . Other studies found that older BIPOC dwellers were less likely to use e-shopping  (Li, 2023; Li et al., 2021)  and other personal tasks  (Li et al., 2021) , such as taking classes or webinars, getting directions or traffic information, downloading or purchasing apps, and using a voice-activated assistant. Given the importance of Internet use, these inconsistent findings warrant more future studies to have a better understanding of the racial/ethnic digital divide to promote older community dwellers' health outcomes  (Lindeman, 2017; Shapira et al., 2007)  and reduce health disparities  (Byrne et al., 2021; Du and Xu, 2016) ."

      "text": "In the 2010s in the United States, Internet and smartphone device use increased sharply and pervaded many aspects of people's lives  (Faverio, 2022) . However, household income and wealth inequalities continued a widening trend  (Horowitz et al., 2020) . The incomes of the top 10% of households in 2018 were 12.6 times that of the other 90%, with a steady 10% increase per decade since 1980  (Horowitz et al., 2020) . Reflecting historical and enduring structural racism in the United States, the median wealth gaps based on race/ethnicity have remained large: in 2019, 80% of non-Hispanic Black and Hispanic families had less wealth than the typical White family  (Kent et al., 2019) . The absolute wealth gaps by educational attainment have further enlarged, continuing to favor college-educated families  (Kent et al., 2019) .\n\nGiven changes in societal and technological environments in the past decade, the impact of race/ethnicity on the digital divide needs to be viewed from an evolving perspective. Despite several studies examining trends of the racial/ethnic impact on the digital divide in the 2010s, most focused on Internet access and a health-related digital divide  (Hung et al., 2020; Yoon et al., 2020) . Using data from CHIS between 2011 and 2016, researchers found that Internet users among older White community dwellers increased significantly by more than 9%, while no significant changes were observed among subgroups of BIPOC community dwellers  (Yoon et al., 2020) . Hung et al. (2020)  found that Black, Hispanic, and Asian older adults were consistently less likely to use health information technology than White older adults in the 2009 and 2018 NHIS. To our knowledge, no studies have investigated the trend of racial/ethnic disparities in Internet use for social and personal tasks."

      "title": "Theoretical Background",
      "text": "The digital divide is not just a technological issue but is deeply rooted in social determinants that shape individuals' access to and use of digital technologies. A fundamental factor influencing the digital divide is socioeconomic status (SES), usually encompassing income, education, and occupation. Recent studies have underscored the persistence of income-related disparities, with lower-income individuals facing challenges in acquiring necessary devices and Internet connectivity  (Van Deursen and Helsper, 2015) . Educational attainment remains a critical factor, and research highlights a positive correlation between higher levels of education and digital proficiency  (Leukel et al., 2023) . Occupational roles also contribute significantly, as individuals in certain professions may benefit from greater exposure and familiarity with digital tools  (Hecker et al., 2021) .\n\nHowever, these inequalities in digital access are inextricably associated with race and ethnicity  (Hamilton, 2020; Masullo Chen, 2016 ). The intersectionality framework, developed by  Crenshaw (2013) , highlights the complex interplay between multidimensional and co-occurrence identities, such as race/ ethnicity, gender, and SES, in influencing people's experiences  (Crenshaw, 2017) . In the context of the digital divide, this framework recognizes that older adults occupy multiple social positions simultaneously, and the combination of these positions may affect their digital technology usage  (Suntai and Beltran, 2023; Zheng and Walsham, 2021) . Applying this conceptual framework offers us a powerful lens for understanding the complexities of the digital divide by examining how multiple social identities intersect to shape individuals' access to and use of digital technologies  (Suntai and Beltran, 2023; van Dijk, 2005) . Hence, for BIPOC older adults, racial/ ethnic identity may further interact with other marginalized social identities, causing increased hardships and diminishing opportunities to access and use the Internet  (Nakamura and Chow-White, 2012; Suntai and Beltran, 2023; Zheng and Walsham, 2021) . Accordingly, in the field of digital divide study, it is essential to consider how intersecting phenomena disproportionately affect BIPOC older adults.\n\nFew studies have investigated the effects of race/ethnicity intersecting with other marginalized identities on the digital divide  (Suntai and Beltran, 2022; Yoon et al., 2018) . Using the 2012 CHIS,  Yoon et al. (2018)  found that BIPOC older adults with the lowest levels of SES had reduced odds of using the Internet for health information. Suntai and Beltran (2022)  indicated that compared to non-Hispanic White men, other intersectional groups by race/ethnicity and gender were less likely to have a working cellphone or a working laptop/computer in the 2018 NHATS. Nevertheless, several limitations exist in the current literature. First, most of these studies have focused on one-time point. No studies have investigated the trend of the impact of race/ethnicity intersecting with other marginalized social identities on the digital divide over the past decade. Second, most studies have focused on Internet access or health-related digital divides, with few investigations on a digital divide in social or personal tasks."

(2) What were the trends regarding the intersecting effects of race/ethnicity and other marginalized social identities related to gender, education, income, and occupation on the digital divide? Findings in this study may deepen our understanding of the race/ethnicity-related evolvement of the digital divide and inform future policies to facilitate digital technology use among older BIPOC community dwellers in promoting health and well-being, extending independent living in their communities, and reducing health disparities."

The initial sample was first interviewed in 2011 and replenished in 2015 to maintain national representative. A total of 8,245 older adults participated in the 2011 NHATS. Due to the focus on community dwellers in this study, participants in nursing homes or residential care facilities (n = 1,048) were excluded. Also, participants who may lack the capacity to use the Internet due to physical health or cognitive function limitations were excluded from this study. These included participants utilizing a proxy to answer the questionnaire (n = 517), those with a diagnosis of dementia or Alzheimer's disease (n = 177), and those with possible or probable dementia (n = 1,289;  Kasper et al., 2013) . In all, 5,214 older adults were included in our final analytic sample for 2011. The question relevant to the social use of the Internet was first asked in the 2013 NHATS. Applying the same inclusion and exclusion criteria, 3,469 participants were included in the final analytic sample of the 2013 NHATS. Similarly, the final analytical sample sizes in 2015 and 2019 were 5,543 and 3,242, respectively. The NHATS has been reviewed and approved by the Institutional Review Board at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.

Results showed a significant interaction between survey round, measured yearly, and BIPOC status (OR = 1.04, CI = [1.00, 1.08], p < .05). As shown in Figure  1 , as time passed, the differences in the predicted probability of using the Internet between older BIPOC and non-Hispanic White adults decreased, indicating reduced racial/ethnic disparities with time. To better understand the trend of the racial/ethnic digital divide among the general older community dwellers in the United States, we chose three time points  (2011/2013, 2015, and 2019 ) and applied the sample weights in the analyses. Below are the specific procedures.\n\nFirst, descriptive statistics were calculated to understand participants' characteristics. Then, bivariate analyses were utilized to assess associations between race/ ethnicity and the digital divides in 2011/2013, 2015, and 2019. Next, logistic regression models were conducted to examine the effects of race/ethnicity on the digital divides, with covariates included in the models. Lastly, interactions (BIPOC \u00d7 female; BIPOC \u00d7 low education; BIPOC \u00d7 low income; BIPOC \u00d7 blue-collar jobs) were included in the full models. Sample weights were applied to bivariate and logistic regression analyses to adjust for differential selection probabilities and nonresponse  (Freedman et al., 2020) . Income had significant portions of missing values. To fully use the data, we treated the missing value as a category and compared it to the reference group, medium and high-income category. Given our interest, we focused on comparing the lowincome to the medium-and high-income category. All analyses were performed using Stata 17 software  (StataCorp, 2021; StataCorp LLC, College Station, TX) ."

That is, the racial/ethnic gaps in the probability of online shopping, favoring non-Hispanic White dwellers, were significantly larger at the low education level in 2011 and low-income level in 2015 compared to their respective high levels. The good thing is that the exacerbated racial/ethnic gaps due to low education or income became nonsignificant in 2019.

The first-level digital divide, which pertains to material access, showed a positive trend as the disparities between non-Hispanic White and BIPOC older adults became nonsignificant in 2019, consistent Self-rated health (1-5)\n\nBothered by pain (yes) 52.80%/53.17% 54.90% 58.80% 52.00%/53.38% 53.57% 57.10% # Chronic illnesses\n\nNotes: BIPOC = Black, indigenous, and other people of color.\n\nFor self-rated health, self-rated memory, and number of chronic illnesses, medians, and interquartile ranges were reported. with a recent survey indicating no significant difference in Internet use by race and ethnicity  (Perrin and Atske, 2021) . This indicates progress in bridging the racial/ethnic gap in Internet access among older adults. However, concerning the second-level digital divide, which refers to Internet use for various purposes, racial/ethnic disparities still exist. BIPOC older adults consistently exhibited lower Internet usage than non-Hispanic White older adults for personal tasks, social networking sites, and health-related purposes. This result aligns with prior studies highlighting racial/ethnic disparities in older adults' Internet usage  (Scheerder et al., 2017; Suntai and Beltran, 2022) . By employing a trend study and intersectionality lens, the present research adds nuanced insights to the existing findings.\n\nInteresting trends regarding the intersecting effects of race/ethnicity with other marginalized social identities were revealed in this study. For personal-task Internet use, including shopping, banking, and ordering/refilling prescription online, the interactions with female gender and low SES variables became nonsignificant in 2019 compared to the significant status in 2011 or 2015. This suggests an encouraging trend, indicating that female gender and low SES did not further exacerbate the racial/ethnic disparities in personal-task use of the Internet. This positive change aligns with the notion that as digital technology becomes more widespread and user-friendly  (Vassilakopoulou and Hustad, 2023) , it can effectively bridge the gap between individuals with different socioeconomic backgrounds  (Scheerder et al., 2017) . For instance, technological advancements have improved user interfaces, making it easier for individuals with limited digital literacy to navigate online platforms  (Fisk et al., 2020) . Targeted efforts by governments and organizations to promote digital inclusion and provide digital literacy training to marginalized populations may have contributed to the positive change. Additionally, the growing ubiquity of smartphones and mobile Internet access among older adults might have enhanced accessibility to these Internet activities  (Faverio, 2022) .\n\nHowever, regarding social and health-related Internet use, the interactions with low SES indicators turned significant in 2015 or 2019, indicating racial/ethnic gaps for low SES older Notes: BIPOC = Black, indigenous, and other people of color. Age, living alone or not, self-rated health, self-rated memory, bothered by pain, and number of chronic illnesses were included as covariates. a Income included three categories, that is, low income, income missing, and medium and high income (reference group). Only the comparisons between low income and medium and high income were reported due to our research interest in this study. Regarding significance, * p < .05.\n\n** p < .01. *** p < .001. Downloaded from  https://academic.oup.com/gerontologist/article/64/9/gnae079/7696414  by Toni Tripp-Reimer user on 05 August 2025\n\nadults deepened. Our findings confirmed prior evidence that the intersection of lower income and education level would shape the experience of BIPOC older adults in utilizing the Internet for health management and information-seeking purposes  (Hung et al., 2020; Liu et al., 2020; Mitchell et al., 2019) . While online health management has become more prevalent in recent years  (Choi, DiNitto, et al., 2022) , older community dwellers of color may have educational and economic barriers to access and navigate Internet platforms for health-related purposes due to limited access to education, economic opportunities, and resources earlier in life  (Farrell et al., 2022; Lyles et al., 2023; Zheng and Walsham, 2021) . These challenges may lead to decreased involvement in crucial health-related tasks and hinder the ability to make informed decisions about their health, further creating a cycle of disadvantage and exclusion in the digital realm and enlarged health disparities. Thus, initiatives focusing on enhancing digital literacy, providing targeted training programs, and developing user-friendly health-related Internet platforms may help mitigate the disparities observed in this study  (Busse et al., 2022) . By promoting digital inclusion and equitable access to health information online, policymakers and healthcare providers can improve older adults' overall health and well-being.\n\nThe findings in this study suggest that the gender-related digital divide is less clear  (Hunsaker and Hargittai, 2018) , but the results point to a positive trend. The effects of gender on personal task and health-related Internet activities were not significant 2015 or 2019 in most cases. This is consistent with previous studies suggesting a closing digital divide or movement toward an even more advantaged position for women  (Cotten et al., 2016; Perrin and Atske, 2021) . Regarding visiting social networking sites, female gender was consistently associated with higher odds across the 3 years. Existing research has also found females to be more active users of social media platforms  (Fleming and Agnew-Brune, 2015; Kuss and Griffiths, 2011; Tufekci, 2008) , as they may prioritize maintaining social connections and seeking emotional support through online networks  (Kuss and Griffiths, 2011) .\n\nIt is also worth noting that even after adding the interactions, low SES variables, including low education, low income, and blue-collar jobs were consistently associated with lower odds of accessing the Internet and engaging in most of the seven Internet activities across all 3 years. The findings of this study align with previous research highlighting the significance of income and education as predictors of the digital divide  (Hargittai and Dobransky, 2017)  and a recent Pew Research Center survey indicating the persistent digital divide despite gains in technology adoption among the low-income population  (Vogels, 2021) . More importantly, it also indicates the racial/ethnic disparities in the second-level digital divide may be due to socioeconomic disparities, consistent with racial/ethnic disparities research in other areas, such as health and mental health  (Do et al., 2012; Jackson et al., 2016; Kahng, 2010) , child maltreatment  (Kim and Drake, 2018) , and criminal justice  (Jackson et al., 2016; Stringer and Holland, 2016) . Thus, in reducing racial/ethnic disparities in the digital divide, multisectoral efforts should focus on alleviating the underlying socioeconomic disparities."

      "title": "Theoretical and Practical Implications",
      "text": "In this study, the use of intersectionality provides a powerful framework for examining the digital divide, shedding light on the complex interplay between race, gender, SES, and Internet use. It helps clarify how systemic racism perpetuates disparities and how race-related social constructs influence access and use of digital technology among BIPOC older adults, especially when intersecting with other marginalized social categories and identities  (Crenshaw, 2017 ). It's also worth mentioning that the underrepresentation of diverse voices in technology development can perpetuate digital inequities. When technology and online platforms are designed without considering the specific needs of diverse communities, they may inadvertently create barriers to access and limit digital literacy development  (Fisk et al., 2020) . Lack of inclusivity in the technology sector can hinder the creation of user-friendly platforms that are accessible and relevant to marginalized populations. Without incorporating culturally relevant and specific needs into practice, marginalized communities will likely continue to face barriers and challenges.\n\nDrawing from the intersectionality perspective, we recognize that the digital divide is not simply a matter of individual choices but is deeply rooted in historical and systemic inequalities  (Delgado and Stefancic, 2001; Veenstra, 2011) . Aiming to address the digital divide among older community dwellers, particularly BIPOC older adults, our findings have important implications for policymakers and stakeholders such as industry partners and service organizations. First, to effectively bridge the existing disparities in health-related Internet use, targeted digital literacy initiatives tailored to members of marginalized older groups are crucial. These initiatives should not only provide basic digital skills but also focus on equipping BIPOC older adults with the necessary competencies to confidently use health-related Internet platforms. Additionally, there is a need for collaboration between industry partners, aging service organizations, and healthcare providers to develop Internet platforms that are tailored to the unique needs of this population. Such platforms should be user-friendly and designed with a focus on language inclusivity, cultural relevance, and accessibility, ensuring that they are easily navigable for BIPOC older adults  (Fisk et al., 2020) . Furthermore, a broader approach to improving Internet infrastructure and accessibility is crucial. This includes advocating for equitable access to high-speed Internet and affordable digital devices in marginalized communities. By expanding Internet access and offering cost-effective solutions, we can help level the playing field, allowing older adults from diverse backgrounds to fully engage in the digital world."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "The limitations of the study should also be noted. One limitation is the missing data on income in the original NHATS study, which can potentially introduce uncertainties and bias in the analysis. To mitigate this concern, the study handled missing income values by treating them as a separate category, and we also performed multiple imputations as a sensitivity analysis, and the results showed robustness. Another limitation is the potential impact of the post-COVID era on Internet use among older community dwellers. The COVID-19 pandemic led to a significant shift in Internet usage patterns worldwide, with many individuals, including older adults, relying heavily on digital platforms for various tasks due to lockdowns and social distancing measures  (Choi, DiNitto, et al., 2022) . The study uses data before 2019, which cannot capture the potential changes in Internet use behaviors during and after the pandemic. Future studies should consider incorporating the latest data for a more comprehensive understanding of digital use trends and patterns. Next, many other variables, such as rural/urban residence and neighborhood-/ community-level characteristics, may also affect the digital divide among older adults. However, due to the limitations of archival data from NHATS, we were not able to include these geographic variables in this study. Future studies may consider examining the impact of these variables on older adults' technology use. Lastly, in this study, we selected a relatively healthy sample of older adults living in their communities. Findings from this study may not be generalizable to older adults with different characteristics, such as those living in nursing homes, with cognitive impairment, and others with substantial health challenges. Also, BIPOC older adults are not a homogeneous population. However, due to the small sample size of some racial/ethnic groups, we combined them together. Future studies may examine and compare digital technology use among different racial/ethnic groups."

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "In conclusion, this trend study examines the first-and second-level digital divide among older community dwellers in the United States through an intersectionality framework. The findings highlight persistent disparities in Internet use, particularly among BIPOC older adults with lower education and income. Moreover, interactions with marginalized social identities also influence the digital technology experience. A unique aspect of this study is the expansion of existing research to investigate the trend of the digital divide, with a specific focus on detailed usage purposes. As technological integration becomes increasingly prevalent in society, understanding and actively addressing digital disparities is crucial for promoting equitable access to digital technology among older community dwellers. Attention also needs to be directed toward addressing the second-level digital divide, especially regarding health-related Internet use. To achieve this goal, efforts to enhance digital literacy, develop user-friendly platforms, and improve Internet infrastructure and accessibility are essential. By fostering a more equitable digital landscape, policymakers and stakeholders can contribute to improved health outcomes, enhanced social engagement, and greater overall well-being for older community dwellers of all backgrounds."
