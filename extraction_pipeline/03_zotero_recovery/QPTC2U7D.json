  "title": "Perceptions of Smartphone User-Centered Mobile Health Tracking Apps Across Various Chronic Illness Populations: An Integrative Review",
  "abstract": "Purpose: This integrative review presents a synthesis of the current qualitative research addressing the motivating factors, usability, and experiences of mobile health tracking applications (apps) across various chronic disease populations. Design: Integrative review of the literature. Methods: Databases used to conduct this integrative review included: PubMed Plus, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Google Scholar, Science Direct, and EBSCO megafile. The following search terms were used in all five databases: smartphone apps, apps, mHealth, eHealth, mobile health apps, health tracking apps, user-centered apps, wireless technology, engagement, qualitative, and usability. Findings: The initial literature review yielded 689 results. Once inclusion and exclusion criteria were employed, 11 studies met the criteria set forth for this review. The reviewed studies provided insight into users' perceptions, experiences, and motivations to incorporate smartphone mobile health apps into their daily lives when living with chronic illnesses. Conclusions: This review indicates the growing interest in user-centered mobile health tracking apps, but with little understanding of motivating factors that foster sustained app use. Mobile health tracking apps targeted to users with chronic conditions need to have a high level of usability in order to motivate users to sustain engagement with their mobile health tracking app. Clinical Relevance: User-centered mobile health tracking app technology is being used with increasing frequency to potentially provide individualized support to chronic illness populations.",

      "text": "Due to the ubiquity of smartphone ownership and the changing paradigm toward patient-centered health care, mobile health innovations have engendered the development of mobile health tracking applications (apps). These apps are typically commercially available through app distribution platforms, such as Google Play and Apple App Store, and are commonly downloaded onto smartphones or tablet devices to provide a myriad of functions based on individual health care needs and patient conditions  (Fiordelli, Diviani, & Schulz, 2013; Varshney, 2014) . Currently, over 165,000 mobile health apps are available, with the most common type of health tracking apps targeting dieting and fitness  (Quintiles IMS, 2016 ). Yet, more health tracking apps are being created to target chronic health conditions such as diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and cardiovascular health  (Quintiles IMS, 2016) .\n\nUser-centered mobile health tracking apps have gained widespread popularity by facilitating the maintenance of health and management of chronic conditions  (Sarkar et al., 2016)  and by empowering individuals to contribute to their own well-being and health  (Birkhoff & Moriarty, 2016) . They provide an assortment of information, encouragement, alerts, and interactive tools  (Dennison, Morrison, Conway, & Yardley, 2013) . A user-centered design involves consideration of the user at every stage of the design process  (McCurdie et al., 2012) ; health tracking functions allow users to self-record information in a smart device about their diet, health, or activities by enabling users to input and store information in one convenient, readily available place  (Patel, 2014) .\n\nThe field of mobile health technology is anticipated to become a major force in U.S. health care  (Terry, 2015)  through digital innovation as patients increasingly embrace mobile health apps  (Silva, Rodrigues, de la Torre Diez, Lopez-Coronado, & Saleem, 2015) . According to a Gallup poll in 2014, 34% of all U.S. adults downloaded at least one app to support wellness, and 19% of U.S. adults downloaded and regularly used a mobile health app  (Witters & Agrawal, 2014) . A catalyst in the growth of mobile health apps is the availability of mobile technology, the increased affordability and access, and the inherent convenience offered by these devices  (Varshney, 2014) . As a result, the global mobile health market is expected to exceed $49 billion by the year 2020, and monitoring services delivered through mobile phones are expected to grow 49.7% from 2014 to 2020  (Grand View Research, 2015) . Because of the omnipresence of smartphone ownership, mobile health tracking apps downloaded onto a smart device may support the management of health anytime and anywhere  (Silva et al., 2015) .\n\nThough interest in user-centered mobile health tracking apps is growing, there is minimal understanding of the cognitive and motivational factors that influence use and adoption of such apps  (Cho, Park, & Lee, 2014) . Further, little is known about the usability and user burden for individuals engaging with a user-centered mobile health tracking app. The cognitive factors that drive use of user-centered mobile health tracking apps may be conceptualized into four categories: health consciousness, health information orientation, eHealth literacy, and health app use efficacy  (Cho et al., 2014) . Health consciousness refers to the extent to which individuals take care of themselves on a daily basis  (Jayanti & Burns, 1998) . The more people are interested and involved in taking care of themselves or being health conscious, the more likely they are to use mobile health tracking apps  (Cho et al., 2014) . Health information orientation characterizes health information-seeking behaviors through an app on one's smartphone  (Cho et al., 2014) . For example, in 2012, 52% of smartphone owners used their smartphones to search for health information  (Fox & Duggan, 2012) . eHealth literacy refers to accurate interpretation of health information obtained from an app  (Cho et al., 2014) . Understanding online health information may further encourage use of mobile health tracking apps  (Cho et al., 2014) . Health app use efficacy, the final category of cognitive factors, refers to the cognitive ability of individuals to selectively use certain health tracking apps to meet their needs  (Cho et al., 2014) . To increase health app use efficacy, user-centered mobile health tracking apps need to be easy to use  (Cho et al., 2014) .\n\nHealth app use efficacy directly relates to the balance between ease of use and user burden. Usability is the level of ease or difficulty users experience when operating an app  (Price et al., 2014) . User burden related to use of apps has not been defined in the literature; however, it closely relates to cognitive load, which is defined as the mental resources required to execute a particular task  (Cognitive Load, 2007, p. 189) . User-centered mobile health tracking apps that require a repetitive and complex process to provide accurate information require a large amount of time and mental energy from their users  (Cho et al., 2014) . This requirement may negatively affect users' health tracking app use efficacy by creating a significant user burden, leading to unwillingness to use the app  (Cho et al., 2014) . Therefore, to promote effective use of user-centered mobile health tracking apps, designers need to increase the app's usability and lower its user burden.\n\nAlthough interest in mobile health tracking apps is increasing, there is a dearth of foundational research on factors that influence motivation to use apps  (Dennison et al., 2013) . Sparse research has addressed users' experience with these apps  (Dennison et al., 2013) , including users with chronic diseases. Therefore, the purpose of this integrative review is to address the gap in the literature by reviewing the available published qualitative literature on users' views and experiences with mobile health apps across various chronic disease populations, to identify current knowledge on motivating factors to use apps, and to suggest directions for future research."

      "text": "Databases used to conduct this integrative review included PubMed Plus, Cumulative Index of Nursing and Allied Health Literature (CINAHL), Google Scholar, Science Direct, and EBSCO megafile. In an effort to identify other relevant studies, reference lists of similar studies were manually reviewed for additional articles. The following search terms were used in various combinations in all five databases: smartphone apps, apps, mHealth, eHealth, mobile health apps, health tracking apps, usercentered apps, wireless technology, engagement, qualitative, and usability. Further limits placed on searches included English language publications and publication years from 2007 to 2015. Since mobile health technology, specifically mobile health tracking apps, is still in its infancy, limiting the search dates to recent years excluded non-smartphone app technology.\n\nThe inclusion criteria for this analysis were peerreviewed, qualitative studies that evaluated patient experiences with user-centered mobile health tracking apps across chronic disease populations. These broad parameters were selected because of the current paucity of user-centered mobile health tracking app literature. The exclusion criteria were text messaging/short messaging system (SMS), exercise/dietary apps for healthy populations, abstract only, non-English language, editorials, and quantitative studies."

      "text": "The initial literature search, with the aforementioned combined search terms, yielded 689 results. Once inclusion and exclusion criteria were employed, 22 full-text articles were identified, retrieved, and assessed. The list was further reduced if the study's target population was not individuals with chronic illnesses. As a result, a total of 11 studies met all inclusion criteria located in Table  S1 .\n\nAll but one of the studies included in the review employed qualitative descriptive design. All 11 studies explored some aspect of users' experiences and their perceptions of user-centered mobile health tracking apps that targeted various health issues in different populations with chronic diseases. Five studies did not test a health tracking app; instead, the researchers gathered data about user preferences and recommendations for the development of a proposed app  (Anderson, Burford, & Emmerton, 2016; Goodwin, Cummins, Behan & O'Brien, 2016; Hilliard, Hahn, Ridge, Eakin, & Riekert, 2014; Juarascio, Goldstein, Manasse, Forman, & Butryn, 2015) . Three of the studies were qualitative follow-up studies after larger quantitative studies  (Giroux, Bacon, King, Dulin, & Gonzalez, 2014; Ly et al., 2014; Pludwinski, Ahmad, Wayne, & Ritvo, 2016) . The reviewed studies used predetermined or semistructured questions in individual interviews or focus groups to collect data. Content or thematic analysis was applied to the data. Purposive and criterion sampling strategies were used in these studies to recruit participants with specific chronic illnesses."

      "title": "Usability and Engagement",
      "text": "Usability of and engagement with health tracking apps were a recurring theme noted throughout many reviewed studies. A high level of usability of health tracking apps is an essential component to ensure successful engagement with these types of apps  (Birkhoff & Moriarty, 2016) . Anderson and colleagues (2016)  explored consumers' experiences with their own personal mobile health tracking apps to manage various chronic health conditions. Participants reported that the features and functionality of their own personal mobile health tracking apps were of paramount importance to maintain their engagement with a health tracking app. This study noted the importance of the constant stimulation needed for users to continuously engage with a health tracking app designed for self-management of chronic conditions because of changing user health and wellness needs. Giroux et al. (2014)  explored the experiences of participants who had trialed a Location-Based Monitoring and Intervention for Alcohol Use Disorders (LBMI-A) app for 6 weeks. The emerging themes addressed the perceived helpfulness, and usability of the app reinforced clinically relevant means to support individuals with alcoholism through mobile health tracking technology. Juarascio et al. (2015)  assessed the feasibility of a conceptualized binge eating app prototype; participants did not use an app. This study highlighted the importance of developing a nimble product to increase usability and decrease user burden, as well as creating features that continuously engage users with a user-centered health tracking app."

      "title": "Personalization of Features",
      "text": "The desire of participants to personalize and tailor health tracking apps to their particular needs was noted in many findings. Goodwin and colleagues (2016)  explored the viewpoints of mental health service users to inform future development of a user-centered mobile health tracking app. Thematic analysis of participants' interview responses revealed that tracking of mental health behaviors and personalizing the app to meet specific needs of users were of principal interest. The researchers concluded that involving end users in the design of a mental health directed app is critical and emphasized the importance of a partnership with them when creating a useful app. Hilliard et al. (2014)  identified user preferences and design recommendations for a self-management cystic fibrosis (CF) health tracking app; however, in this study, participants did not use and evaluate an app. All the themes resulting from analysis of participants' responses related to the desired design features of a future health tracking app that would provide support for their chronic disease state. A critical point identified by  Hilliard et al.  was the importance of having individuals with CF collaborate with designers in all stages of app development in order to construct a product that suits their needs. Scheibe, Reichelt, Bellmann, and Kirch (2015)  explored factors associated with acceptance of two briefly tested diabetes health tracking apps for 32 people aged 50 and older with type 1 or 2 diabetes. Perceived benefit and perceived ease of use emerged as primary factors in use of a diabetes health tracking app. The findings suggested that health tracking apps developed for this age group need to be adaptable and tailored to individual skill level to ensure successful usability and engagement."

      "title": "Accessibility of Health Tracking Apps",
      "text": "Having health tracking apps present and accessible at all times through smart devices emerged as an important theme throughout various studies. Ly et al. (2014)  explored the experiences of participants who had trialed a health tracking app developed for people with depression. Thematic analysis of participants' responses identified commitment, treatment, and lack of goals as major themes with several secondary themes. A unique finding of this study was that the participants described the depression app as always present and accessible to them in their everyday life, leading to a sense of security.\n\nWhitehead, Ale, Vickers-Douglas, Tiede, and Dammann (2014) studied the experiences of two pediatric patients who used a user-centered health tracking app, Anxiety Coach, to enhance treatment of obsessivecompulsive disorder. The researchers concluded that participants had positive experiences using the app and found the app helpful in managing their symptoms between therapy sessions. The results underscored the important role the app may have in extending therapy into patients' daily lives where symptoms naturally occur."

      "title": "Support Provided by Health Tracking Apps",
      "text": "Having health and wellness supported by a health tracking app in one's own environment emerged as an important theme in numerous studies. Pludwinski et al. (2016)  explored experiences of individuals who participated in a Healthy Coach type 2 diabetes randomized control trial with smartphone app support. The themes that emerged from the analysis of the data related to the experience of the trial and the difficulty in managing a chronic condition on one's own. This study highlighted the importance of support needed to manage chronic illnesses.\n\nWang and colleagues (2016) evaluated a newly designed mobile health tracking app directed at supporting caregivers of children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The researchers reported that the mobile health tracking app was well liked by caregivers and provided support to them during the chemotherapy treatment regimen.\n\nWilliams, Price, Hardinge, Tarassenko, and Farmer (2014) explored patients' expectations and experiences using a user-centered mobile health tracking app and their perceptions of the impact of its use on their wellbeing and ability to manage their chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The user-centered mobile health tracking app was well received by the participants, provided a sense of continuity of care, and increased their awareness of symptom variability. The researchers concluded that mobile health apps have the potential to support rather than replace clinical care and that patients need encouragement in order to obtain intended benefits of apps."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "The reviewed studies provided insight into users' perceptions, experiences, and motivations to incorporate smartphone mobile health apps into their daily lives when living with chronic illnesses. A critical interconnected theme in the reviewed articles was the ease of use of apps as a key factor motivating users to maintain engagement. Mobile health apps that were designed to be simple, self-explanatory, and visually appealing had favorable usability feedback  (Goodwin et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016)  regardless of users' age or previous experience with apps  (Williams et al., 2014) . Thus, health tracking apps need to be intuitive with understandable menu guidance and easy navigation  (Scheibe et al., 2015)  to increase cognitive and motivational factors to sustain engagement with health tracking apps. Establishing clear benefits that only a mobile health app can deliver compared to standard therapy may further motivate individuals to use an app  (Hilliard et al., 2014; Scheibe et al., 2015) . Moreover, visualization of behavioral progress through graphs and achieved goals as part of the app could enhance motivation to use a health tracking app  (Giroux et al., 2014; Hilliard et al., 2014; Juarascio et al., 2015; Scheibe et al., 2015)  by promoting health consciousness. Yet, with the potential wealth of data being collected by a health tracking app, the most effective userfriendly way to provide feedback to both the user and clinician remains unclear  (Hilliard et al., 2014) .\n\nUsing mobile health tracking apps may provide a sense of empowerment and control of chronic health conditions. Whiteside et al. (2014)  found that their Anxiety Coach app provided a source of coping mechanisms for pediatric patients to use; participants reported feeling empowered to independently manage symptoms in their daily lives. Williams and colleagues (2014) concluded that increased awareness of changing baseline health status through tracking of symptoms enables participants to make informed decisions about when to call their health provider. Furthermore,  Ly et al. (2014)  found that users reported the near constant proximity of their smartphone to track health issues provided a sense of security. Accordingly, user-centered mobile health tracking apps may be useful adjunct tools to face-to-face therapy  (Whiteside et al., 2014) . Still, users may be unlikely to remain motivated to use a health tracking app without the support from a clinician  (Juarascio et al., 2015) . Similarly,  Ly et al. (2014)  found that their health tracking app was not motivating or effective without the help of a clinician, most likely because the reminders and feedback from a clinician reinforced the psychological tracking features of the app. Williams et al. (2014)  emphasized that mobile health tracking apps have a supporting role in selfmanagement rather than replacing current care. Therefore, user-centered mobile health tracking apps may be effective not as stand-alone therapies, but rather as adjunct treatments.\n\nThe ability to track progress is an important feature of many health tracking apps  (Ly et al., 2014)  and may be beneficial for many health behaviors  (Hilliard et al., 2014) . The ability to track one's behaviors may lead to a higher level of awareness of and increased accountability for those behaviors  (Giroux et al., 2014) . For example,  Giroux et al. (2014)  found that tracking daily alcohol intake through a self-monitoring app provided personalized feedback of users' drinking patterns, raised their awareness of drinking triggers, and aided in the recognition of and motivation to curb their alcohol intake. Similarly,  Juarascio et al. (2015)  found that self-monitoring of behaviors with a health tracking app may have facilitated a reduction in binge eating, leading to a better quality of life. Thus, tracking behaviors of interest may provide a visual picture of trends and patterns of activities to promote healthy behavior changes.\n\nMobile health tracking apps may be initially appealing and frequently used; however, interest and use may wane over time, defeating the goal of improved health outcomes  (Hilliard et al., 2014; Juarascio et al., 2015; Scheibe et al., 2015) . Anderson and colleagues (2016)  found that self-monitoring of a chronic condition through a mobile health tracking app requires constant stimulation to accommodate changing needs in the health and well-being of its users. A reinforcement strategy could be in a form of a game built into the app; however, participants in  Juarascio et al.'s (2015)  study voiced doubt that game playing would be a strong reinforcement approach. Participants tended to use their health tracking app less when they reached their goals or when no new self-management techniques were offered  (Anderson et al., 2016) .\n\nHaving a customizable app to increase the level of usability and decrease user burden is recommended to foster a relationship between the user and the app. Allowing users to select and track their activities to suit their needs appears to be essential to sustain health tracking app use and decrease user burden  (Giroux et al., 2014; Goodwin et al., 2016; Juarascio et al., 2015; Scheibe et al., 2015) . Customization may include personalized reminders and alerts tailored to a user's specific needs and medical conditions  (Hilliard et al., 2014) . Furthermore, the potential for customization of a health tracking app may support a clinician's efforts to tailor the treatment to the needs of the patient  (Ly et al., 2014) . Having the ability to specify the type and quantity of information to be entered or omitted, as well as the frequency of reminders sent to app users, may promote continued use of the health tracking app  (Juarascio et al., 2015) . A low level of user burden may lead to increased engagement by the user with targeted apps  (Dennison et al., 2013) . For example,  Whiteside et al. (2014)  stated that their app, Anxiety Coach, decreased user burden because its use actually contributed positively to participants' treatment experience. Similarly,  Hilliard et al. (2014)  found that health tracking apps that eased the burden of daily disease management may facilitate healthy behavior patterns. If health tracking apps fail to meet the expectations of users, they will likely be discarded  (Dennison et al., 2013) .\n\nThe reviewed studies identified many factors needed to encourage use of user-centered mobile health tracking apps. However, these studies had several limitations. The most common weakness of the reviewed studies was the lack of applicability of the experiences, views, and motivations among different chronic condition groups incorporating mobile health tracking apps into their daily lives. Because user-centered health tracking apps are tailored to the needs of people living with certain chronic illnesses, results of the studies may not apply to populations with different diseases or to other health tracking apps  (Anderson et al., 2016; Giroux et al., 2014; Hilliard et al., 2014; Juarascio et al., 2015; Ly et al., 2014; Scheibe et al., 2015; Whiteside et al., 2014) . Many of the researchers recognized that their samples were small and self-selected, further limiting the generalizability of their findings  (Giroux et al., 2014; Goodwin et al., 2016; Hilliard et al., 2014; Juarascio et al., 2015; Ly et al., 2014; Scheibe et al., 2015; Whiteside et al., 2014)  and possibly introducing bias into their findings. Ly et al. (2014)  handselected 12 of the 81 participants from their quantitative study due to time limitations, perhaps introducing bias. Furthermore, because the sample sizes were small and the entire chronic disease population is large and heterogeneous, it would be impossible to address all the needs of diverse populations adequately with one app  (Scheibe et al., 2015) . The heterogeneity of chronic illness mobile health tracking app users suggests that these health tracking apps need to be customizable to users' needs and preferences  (Scheibe et al., 2015) . On the other hand,  Hilliard et al. (2014)  speculated that even though the key themes identified in their study focused on individuals with CF, those themes may be relevant to other people with chronic medical conditions and burdensome treatment regimens. Further research is needed to determine if specific therapeutic features of user-centered mobile health tracking apps are applicable across various chronic illness populations.\n\nAnother important limitation was the lack of actual app testing in five of the reviewed studies  (Anderson et al., 2016; Goodwin et al., 2016; Hilliard et al., 2014; Juarascio et al., 2015) , as well as very limited testing in  Scheibe et al.'s (2015)  study. For example,  Juarascio et al. (2015)  provided mock screen shots of a prototype of a proposed binge-eating app to gather perspectives of potential users and clinicians who treat binge-eating behaviors. Hilliard et al. (2014)  focused their study on design recommendations of a proposed CF app. Scheibe et al. (2015)  presented two diabetes apps at the end of an interview session for the participants' brief use, but the study was designed to glean their perspectives of and attitudes about app use in general and not a specific diabetes app. Although, it is important to involve potential users in the development of an app, the limited exposure to the app limits the usefulness of those users' insights. Furthermore, the fact that the participants in Scheibe et al.'s study did not use or test the health tracking app limits the validity of participants' perspectives about the feasibility and utility of the proposed app to support the management of their chronic disease. Therefore, further qualitative studies are needed early in the development of user-centered mobile health tracking apps to obtain better insight into the usefulness of these apps by different populations.\n\nThe type and timing of the interviews conducted in these qualitative studies are potential limitations. Giroux et al. (2014)  asked very specific, pre-determined questions, which may have prevented a broader view of the participants' perspectives while trialing the LBMI-A app to curb their alcohol intake. Additionally,  Ly et al. (2014)  and  Hilliard et al. (2014)  conducted phone interviews in their study to gather participants' viewpoints, limiting available data because body language and demeanor could not be observed. Lastly,  Ly et al. (2014)  conducted their phone interviews 6 months after participants trialed the depression app. Participants' recall of the utility of their health tracking app after this length of time may have affected the participants' memory of use of the app.\n\nEven with the aforementioned limitations, the studies represent a first step in learning about factors that influence and motivate users to engage with mobile health tracking apps  (Ly et al., 2014) . Juarascio et al. (2015)  were the first to examine a future prototype app that may provide real-time interventions for a sample of people identified as binge eaters, and  Giroux et al. (2014)  were the first to investigate the perspectives of participants who trialed the alcohol intake-curbing prototype app. Ultimately, all the reviewed studies added to the body of knowledge related to user-centered mobile health tracking apps and provide a foundation for future research efforts. Because of the early state of the science on usercentered mobile health tracking apps and the nature of pilot studies, limitations of the studies indicate the need for further investigation as this technology grows and becomes part of the fabric of our everyday lives."

      "title": "Future Research",
      "text": "The research on use of user-centered mobile health tracking apps and their effect on health is clearly still in an early stage, resulting in a dearth of literature on participants' experiences with such apps  (Ly et al., 2014) . In an effort to learn about motivations of individuals with chronic health issues to use health tracking apps and to promote sustained engagement, future research could explore the growing range of functions of and time spent using user-centered mobile health tracking apps  (Cho et al., 2014)  and users' ability to integrate such apps seamlessly into their daily lives  (Giroux et al., 2014) .\n\nBecause of the novelty of user-centered mobile health tracking apps, limited data exist on the economic impact of these types of apps. A systematic review of economic evaluations of mobile health interventions conducted by  Iribarren, Cato, Falzon, and Stone (2017)  found there is a growing body of evidence supporting cost effectiveness of mobile health interventions; however, most of the interventions evaluated were non-health tracking app interventions. Therefore, more research is needed to evaluate economic cost and benefits of utilizing user-centered mobile health tracking apps in various patient populations in an effort to learn the true value of these types of apps.\n\nTo enhance users' motivation to continue use of a health tracking app, periodic surveys asking about the usefulness of app features may be beneficial  (Juarascio et al., 2015) . Testing the use of graphs, providing visual feedback, and incorporating games into the app's functions may also promote continued motivation of individuals with chronic illnesses to use a health tracking app  (Giroux et al., 2014; Juarascio et al., 2015) . However, it will be important to avoid burdening the users with too much feedback, which could dampen their enthusiasm for health tracking apps.\n\nBecause a large amount of data can be collected through the use of health tracking apps and little is known about how the data will be used by app users and their clinicians  (Hilliard et al., 2014) , it is imperative that these two separate issues be addressed early in the development, testing, and dissemination of user-centered mobile health tracking apps. App users, healthcare providers, and other stakeholders must be involved in the design of apps to determine the most effective and ethical uses of health tracking apps for chronic disease management  (Hilliard et al., 2014) .\n\nQualitative studies can provide rich data and feedback needed to design and refine new or existing usercentered mobile health tracking apps. After completion of qualitative studies and the health tracking apps are operational, randomized controlled trials (RCTs) are an essential next step to examine the effect these apps have on management of chronic conditions with sustained engagement  (Anderson et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2016) . At this point it is unknown if user-centered mobile health tracking apps affect health behaviors and clinical outcomes over a period of time. RCTs are needed to evaluate specific targeted outcomes among various chronic illness populations.\n\nLimited information is available depicting who are and who are not mobile health tracking app users. Specific app download statistics available from various app stores do not provide detailed information such as demographics, reasons for download, and consistency of use  (Krebs & Duncan, 2015) . Previous studies have found health app users tended to be younger, and have higher education and income levels  (Fox & Duggan, 2012; Krebs & Duncan, 2015) . However, little else is known about non-health app users. Therefore, future studies could examine the differences between health tracking app users and non-users, and what factors influence users' adoption and use of these types of apps.\n\nIn summary, the results of this review of qualitative studies underscore the importance of carefully evaluating user-centered mobile health tracking apps to influence health behaviors to achieve desired outcomes. The studies' findings suggest that health tracking apps provide a promising opportunity to transform health care; however, research is needed to examine their potential and their limitations in supporting chronic medical conditions."

      "text": "User-centered mobile health tracking apps have demonstrated small-scale feasibility among users with chronic medical conditions. Yet, data on the views, perceptions, and experiences with apps of populations with chronic conditions are limited, leaving a significant gap in the literature. New mobile health tracking apps are continually being constructed; however, qualitative studies on motivation to use health tracking apps and the ease of their use are few in number. As a result, the current state of the science is weak because of the novelty of the user-centered mobile health tracking apps. Nevertheless, with increased smartphone use integrated into people's daily lives, this technological innovation is likely to spur future research studies to address the gap in knowledge  (Birkhoff & Moriarty, 2016) ."

      "text": "Due to the novelty of user-centered mobile health tracking apps, there is a dearth of clinically focused mobile health websites. To find national and global statistics related to mobile health apps,  http://www.  pewinternet.org might be used. To find the latest information technology news, which includes mobile health app news,  http://www.healthcareitnews.com  may be used. Until user-centered mobile health tracking apps become more commonplace in health care, there will be limited clinical websites."
