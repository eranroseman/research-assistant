      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "Health risk behaviors, or modifiable unhealthy behaviors, are leading contributors to morbidity and premature mortality associated with chronic diseases  [1] . To prevent chronic diseases, health risk behaviors, such as physical inactivity, unhealthy eating, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption can be modified using behavior change strategies  [2] . The prevalence and cost of chronic diseases attributed to these modifiable behaviors place a tremendous burden on health care resources. As such, public health strategies that change these health risk behaviors and lessen the rates of chronic diseases are needed.\n\nA social-ecological approach to public health recognizes that individuals are members of the society and environments within which they live  [3, 4] . Accordingly, an individual's health may be influenced by intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional, or community factors, as well as public policy. In practice, it has been difficult for behavior change interventions to take into account the full range of social-ecological factors over time. Additionally, former studies have been cross-sectional or longitudinal with few measurement points, giving only snapshots and static views of human behavior  [5] .\n\nFew health care providers are trained to deliver effective behavior change strategies for preventing or managing diseases, and significantly increasing the number of skilled providers would be costly  [2] . In any case, many opportunities for supporting behavior change occur outside of the typical scenarios in which patients and providers typically interact. Fortunately, the proliferation of digital health technology, including mobile health (mHealth) applications (apps), text messaging, the Internet of Things (IoT) (e.g., fitness wearables and ambient sensors), internet-based platforms, and health information technology exchanges, presents an opportunity to support health behavior change across a broad spectrum of settings. These technologies have improved the recording of intrapersonal, interpersonal, and environmental factors at scale (e.g., observing large populations over long and continuous periods of time)  [6]  and provided digital longitudinal records  [7] . As a result, efforts such as the \"All of Us\" research program, an initiative launched by the National Institutes of Health in 2016, are able to capture longitudinal data about lifestyle, environment, and biological makeup from millions of people, including data collected from mHealth technologies  [8] . Such data collection efforts are needed to mature the understanding of behavioral dynamics and the social-ecological system and to support the development of data-driven approaches in behavior interventions that leverage insights gained from such a data collection.\n\nDigital behavior change interventions (DBCIs) employ digital health technologies for behavior modification for the maintenance and improvement of health  [9] . Smartphone sensors, wearable devices, and other IoT devices connected to internet-based platforms provide opportunities to understand the dynamics of behavior through the continual collection of real-time data in an unobtrusive manner. Health behavior change research is shifting its focus to study the design and use of context-aware DBCIs that are individualized, are predictive, and provide real-time feedback.\n\nContext-aware DBCIs have the potential to improve population health management from primary prevention efforts to the effective management of chronic diseases. Context-aware DBCIs are responsive to dynamic contextual factors that could influence the user's behavior and tailor aspects of the intervention based on these contextual factors  [10] . Importantly, in context-aware DBCIs, one should identify such \"tailoring variables\" (i.e., contextual factors used to decide when and how to intervene) based on evidence that the variable is useful for making intervention decisions. Measurement of the tailoring variables can be aided by digital technologies by enabling users to easily enter relevant contextual information at any time or by using a combination of sensors and algorithms to automatically infer the relevant information. For example, data from the global positioning systems and accelerometers in users' phones are combined with algorithms for inferring the class of physical activity (e.g., sedentary, walking, and running) that is being performed and the general context for the activity (e.g., walking home from work)  [11] . \"Decision rules\" can be used to link the tailoring variables to the available intervention options. These decisions can be triggered and executed automatically using a variety of computational methods, including analytics and artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe primary objective was to identify studies using context-aware digital health technologies to automate behavior change interventions. Secondary objectives included identifying the extent to which these digital health technologies may employ analytics-based and AI-based methods for automation, the extent to which they apply known behavior change techniques  [12] , and their effectiveness for behavior change."

Behavior change techniques employed different \"doses\" or modes of delivery within and across the studies (e.g., fixed or changing goals). Although these techniques performed various functions, all interventions provided an educational function and all performed more than one function. These functions were categorized according to the Behaviour Change Wheel framework (Fig.  3 ) across the capability, opportunity, motivation, and behavior theory change model: persuasion (18 studies, 55%), education (16, 48%), enablement (15, 45%), incentivization (5, 15%), modeling (4, 12%), and environmental restructuring (4, 12%)  [47, 48] .

      "title": "Methodologies utilized in DBCIs",
      "text": "Analytics-and AI-based methods for enhancing DBCIs were used in association with four frequent groupings of behavior change techniques (feedback and monitoring, shaping knowledge, associations, and goals and planning; Fig.  2 ) and intervention functions that were primarily persuasion, education, and enablement (Fig.  3 ). The combination of real-time context detection and automated decision rules enables a digital intervention to provide individualized information to the user.\n\nTo evaluate the analytics-and AI-based methods used in DBCIs, the studies were organized into one or more of three descriptive categories related to technology: real-time access to data for monitoring purposes, adaptive analytics for automated feedback and recommendations, and symbolic reasoning for dialogue systems. DBCIs may collect data continuously and interact with users in real time. With real-time monitoring, users can be made aware of their behavior, if needed, in a timely manner.\n\nAdditionally, feedback and recommendations can be based on the monitored behaviors to help motivate and coach users on how to modify their goals and behaviors. Lastly, communication with the user can be facilitated by a virtual dialogue system.\n\nReal-time monitoring was implemented in 21 studies  [11, 15, 16, 21-24, 29-31, 34, 35, 37-39, 42-46]  and required an appropriate level of temporal access to data to capture relevant events. These studies used behavior change techniques in the associations, shaping knowledge, natural consequences, goals and planning, and feedback and monitoring groupings within the DBCI. Ten studies of real-time monitoring as an essential component of app-based DBCIs were found to increase physical activity and/or decrease sedentary time  [22, 31, 34, 37, 42] , improve some sun protection practices  [23, 24] , and enhance medication adherence  [25, 30, 35] . One medication adherence app used computer vision and machine learning via neural networks to confirm medication ingestion  [35] . Two studies incorporated a wearable device with a digitally enhanced behavior change strategy to monitor health data as a key component of the intervention; it integrated a glucose sensor with a specially designed mobile app to target self-care behaviors addressing glucose variability  [30, 44] . The adaptive goal-setting interventions mentioned above relied on the supplementary technique of real-time monitoring by the participant and/or by the use of IoT devices (e.g., wearable devices) to obtain data needed for setting new goals  [11, 15, 16, 21, 22, 25, 29-31, 34, 37-39, 42, 43, 45, 46] .\n\nTwenty-two studies (reported in 24 articles) provided adaptive feedback and recommendations with a subgroup utilizing adaptive goal setting  [11, 15, 16, 21, 22, 25-34, 36-40, 42, 43, 45, 46] . Six of the above real-time monitoring studies used adaptive goal setting to improve physical activity and/ or dietary behavior  [11, 15, 16, 29, 38, 46] . These studies used behavior change techniques in the goals and planning, feedback and monitoring, and shaping knowledge groupings in the DBCIs. Of these, three used machine learning, designed to progressively improve its performance over time, to produce tailored, adaptive goals and recommendations based on the real-world behaviors of the participants  [11, 29, 46] . The other three studies relied upon simpler, analytics-based approaches (e.g., rank-order percentile) to generate adaptive daily goals  [15, 16, 38] . These algorithms required continuous and repeated measurement of physical activity behavior and used the data to create new goals based on the past activity of the user. Additionally, these simpler analytics-based DBCIs added reward and threat, associations, and/or scheduled consequences behavior change techniques to the intervention for adaptive goal setting.

Dialogue systems, also known as conversational agents, are autonomous and intelligent software entities that are virtually represented for communication with a user. While some of the studies used embodied conversational agents (ECAs)  [17, 18] , others used simpler interfaces (e.g., simple chatbot interface  [41]  or interactive voice response  [19, 20] ).\n\nOnly two studies explicitly stated that the dialogue system was a rules-based form of symbolic reasoning  [17, 18] , and the others did not specify if an AI-based methodology was used. No trends could be identified regarding the observed changes in various target behaviors across these studies with the use of a dialogue system. Assessing efficacy with direct comparisons could not be done due to the heterogeneity in interventions and comparators across studies. In addition, even when studies assessed the same target behavior (e.g., physical activity or exercise), the studies used different measures for the outcomes (e.g., predicted mean steps/day and active minutes/day) or reported findings as betweengroup differences with different comparisons from study to study."

Weight loss was most commonly reported; weight loss varied, with a range of mean weight loss (1.44-3 kg) reported across six studies  [17, 19, 29, 40, 41, 44] . Three studies in prediabetic or diabetic patients reported a range of decreased hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) (-0.5% to -0.1%) at endpoint as a measure of glucose control  [19, 29, 44] . After 6 months, a culturally tailored mHealth program to monitor medication adherence and manage Hispanic hypertension resulted in controlled systolic blood pressure (<140 mmHg)  [25] . Only one study noted extensive results on health outcomes  [29] . In 6 months, compared with the control group, the intervention group achieved both clinically and statistically significantly greater mean reductions in fasting glucose, HbA1c, and body weight.

      "text": "This systematic review identified 30 studies (33 publications), investigating interventions that utilized mHealth applications, IoT devices, and/or internet-based platforms to improve health behavior outcomes to deliver context-aware, automated DBCIs. All DBCIs provided automated feedback based on the dynamic and individualized context of the user. DBCI methodologies were generally underdescribed by authors. Common intervention functions included persuasion, education, and enablement to provide communication to induce feelings to stimulate action, increase knowledge or understanding, and reduce barriers to increase capability for change, respectively  [48] . Within these interventions, the frequent behavior change technique groupings included feedback and monitoring, shaping knowledge, associations, and goals and planning to primarily increase physical activity for weight loss and/or promote healthy diets and enhance disease prevention and/or self-management behaviors. Only one DBCI met our inclusion criteria to examine an aspect of smoking cessation  [26] , but none examined alcohol behavior modification, which is amongst the top contributors to modifiable mortality and morbidity  [49] . These behaviors should be targeted by context-aware DBCIs as they impose significant economic and utilization burdens on the health care system."

      "title": "Advantages of context-aware DBCIs",
      "text": "Based on the evidence, an integral design component for context-aware DBCIs includes immediate feedback based upon the user's real-world behavior. Requiring a \"human\" physician, counselor, or coach to deliver this type of feedback is not feasible or possible in practice. However, context-aware DBCIs that continuously analyze data, acquired both passively from sensors and actively from user input entered into mobile apps, can overcome the limitations of cost, scale, and responsiveness that are often associated with human-delivered interventions.\n\nThe data suggest that context-aware DBCIs can be supplemented by analytics-and AI-based methodologies to improve user individualization of interventions. For instance, the behavior change technique of goal setting can be made adaptive via algorithms that make dynamic goal recommendations based on the users' behavioral data  [11, 15, 16, 29, 38, 46] . Only four studies applied machine learning, a subset of AI algorithms designed to improve their own performance over time, to positively impact outcomes  [11, 29, 35, 46] . However, algorithms can automatically detect relevant events from sensor data, reducing the burden of self-reporting, and provide users with an awareness of their behavior and/or health risk. For example, context-aware DBCIs were used to track and inform users of behaviors, such as medication ingestion  [35] , prevention of sunburns  [23] , and glucose management  [44] . Finally, communication of health information by shaping knowledge can be more accessible using AI-enabled ECAs and other conversational agents (e.g., chatbots), which provide a more \"natural\" interface for implementing virtual coaching/counseling  [17, 18, 41] , and personalized advice  [11, 23] ."

      "title": "Opportunities for advanced analytics and AI in digital health technologies",
      "text": "Explicit analytic methods in DBCIs to drive behavior change were identified in this systematic review. Moreover, AI in the form of machine learning effectively facilitated behavior change to positively impact both health behavior and clinical outcomes  [11, 29, 35, 46] . Machine learning algorithms can create behavioral profiles of end users derived from the raw data obtained from wearables (e.g., physical trackers) or sensors via their smartphones as part of the IoT. Device interconnection by the IoT creates new data sources that can be leveraged and analyzed. There is potential for these methods to glean insights from these new data sources to influence real-time behavior change by generating personalized feedback, promoting user awareness, and providing context for recommendations  [11, 29] . Figure  4  describes approaches for best practices to leverage access to data, analytics, and AI for the improvement and sustainability of health outcomes when designing DBCIs.\n\nDuring the screening process, only 5% of DBCIs screened for eligibility met our inclusion criteria. Most excluded studies lacked context awareness, whereby automated interventions were not informed by user input, activity, or location. Other excluded studies did not target a specific health behavior for their intervention. Furthermore, some studies only reported health outcomes rather than specific behavioral outcomes (e.g., pre-post DBCI behavior change data) resulting from their intervention. Despite many promising studies providing DBCIs, particularly from the engineering community, often the evaluations focused on implementation outcomes (e.g., usability) rather than behavior change. Cross-functional teams should work together in the future to design appropriate interventions and behavior evaluation studies."

      "title": "Use of dialogue systems to enhance communication in digital health technologies",
      "text": "Automated dialogue systems using symbolic reasoning to mimic human interaction were used in several of the studied DBCIs  [17] [18] [19] [20] 41] . Two studies (three reports) were of DBCIs that used software agents  [17, 18, 41] , including AI-enabled ECAs using avatars  [17, 18] , to bolster motivational interviewing (MI) and thereby promote behavior change. These virtual anthropomorphic representations were capable of limited conversations with the human user using both verbal and nonverbal (e.g., body language) communication in a multimodal interface. ECA-based avatar 3D computer graphics in dialogue systems have wide acceptance by their users and can demonstrate empathy, a key part of MI  [50] . Users in ECA-based interventions have reportedly favored the computer interviewer to human counselors in some cases  [51] ; the subjects did not fear embarrassment nor judgment, more easily reported risky behaviors (e.g., excessive drinking and unsafe sex), and fewer barriers for counseling exist with a computer interviewer. Using automated dialogue systems is consistent with the perspective that simulated face-to-face conversations make DBCIs more accessible to individuals who have low reading or functional health literacy  [52] ."

      "text": "Consumer-based DBCIs can be integrated into clinical practice settings. Two medication adherence studies noted the integration of health care provider monitoring with the intervention  [25, 35] . These DBCIs were supported by oversight from the clinical care team to ensure that proper messaging was transmitted to the patient when a noncompliance event was automatically detected. In this case, because of the potential immediate health impact of medication nonadherence, an appropriate degree of involvement of the provider was important for ensuring patient safety and necessary follow-up, if required. Additionally, three studies provided risk score or risk estimates for cardiovascular disease  [26, 33]  and hypertension  [25] ; of these, one study examined an electronic health (eHealth) application that was integrated into select parts of a primary care eHealth record."

      "title": "Policy implications of context-aware DBCIs for public health",
      "text": "Advances in mHealth and the ubiquity of smart devices, including phones and tablets, and other personal tracking devices provide consumers with greater autonomy in managing their health. Additionally, policy review has surmised that mHealth platforms will be more effective than other eHealth platforms because of increased mobile phone utilization  [53] , and the uptake and usage of smartphones is unprecedented in low-, middle-, and high-income countries  [54] . For example, the Be He@lthy, Be Mobile joint initiative run by the World Health Organization and the International Telecommunication Union is advancing attention to mHealth services globally, including innovation in the areas of AI and wearables to support public health  [55] . As such, public health organizations will be essential to enable the creation and maintenance of infrastructure and services for mHealth platforms. ), which combines data-and technology-driven approaches to improve and sustain health outcomes. Access regards the acquisition of data and consideration of the precision and clarity of data sources, such as their temporality (i.e., frequency of refreshing and/or updating), granularity (e.g., individual-versus population-level data and geographic context), interoperability (i.e., how data sources can be aggregated), and completeness (i.e., gaps in what was expected to be collected vs. actual collection). Additional considerations may include the level of data transparency and consumer-mediated data exchange, which may be related to blockchain and other key technologies. Analytics is a broad classification of applied mathematics that analyzes acquired data and draws conclusions based on that information. Categories of analytics include descriptive (e.g., data summarization of historical trends), predictive (e.g., techniques to infer trends), and prescriptive (e.g., specification of actions that can be taken to meet relevant objectives) analytics. AI includes methods that are designed to emulate various aspects of human intelligence, including the ability to learn and/or reason. AI may be separated into two categories: machine learning and symbolic reasoning. Machine learning is the method of data analysis that makes decisions with limited human intervention after the system learns from the data and identified patterns; it includes the methods of natural language processing and simple or complex (e.g., deep learning) neural network modeling. Implementation of symbolic reasoning methods follow logical rules to produce new knowledge in expert systems, such as rules-based dialogue systems.\n\nDownloaded from  https://academic.oup.com/tbm/article/11/5/1037/5934751  by guest on 14 August 2025\n\nThe policy also cautiously recommends large-scale deployment of digital health technologies with the advisement to consider the effects of the digital divide, whereby disparities may be exacerbated in vulnerable populations where individuals lack mobile phones and/or internet access or where literacy for health and/or technology is limited  [56] . In support of this advisement, the DBCIs identified in this review required internet access, and literacy of technology was typically not assessed. ECAs were well received amongst users and promoted increased and more open communication of health information by its users. Technologies that support more \"human-like\" interactions could potentially help address some concerns regarding technology literacy.\n\nFinally, real-time monitoring for disease management (e.g., glucose management, blood pressure control, and medication ingestion) was identified with positive impacts on health behaviors. Recently, pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) have evolved to support a standalone digital health formulary (e.g., Express Scripts and Caremark) to integrate DBCIs into public health practices  [57, 58] . These value-based PBMs are being designed to reduce barriers and improve medication adherence for chronic diseases. Additionally, the provision of appropriate reimbursements, incentives, and education to practitioners can help promote such a cultural shift. User engagement with DBCIs will also be an important consideration. As such, researchers should continue to confirm the identification of safe, effective, and scalable interventions with real-time supportive components using evidence-based approaches."

      "title": "Strengths and limitations",
      "text": "This systematic review has several strengths. First, this is a novel review. Many systematic reviews have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of mHealth and eHealth interventions in improving health; however, no previous reviews to our knowledge have focused specifically on context-aware DBCIs to provide individualized interventions to the user. Second, an exhaustive literature search was conducted, including gray literature evaluation that prioritized sensitivity over specificity. Third, the limited evidence from the subset of literature identified gaps in adequately designed and reported studies to examine context-aware DBCIs; limited collaboration and integration exists between the domains of public health, behavioral science, computer science, and health care.\n\nOur results should be interpreted in the context of a few limitations  [59] . The findings are of limited generalizability due to the relatively small number of identified studies, most of which were of moderate study quality and performed in the USA. Quality limitations included study sample sizes lacking power and diversity and insufficient follow-up durations to assess long-term changes in health-related outcomes. The interventions were heterogenous; they used multicomponent interventions that combined a number of different techniques, which minimizes the possibility of valid head-to-head comparisons of the efficacy of the interventions across studies. Lack of complete reporting regarding interventions and methodologies are additional limitations. These issues make it difficult to isolate the component (or particular combination of components) associated with intervention effects  [59] . Another limitation stems from the nature of measuring and reporting the types of outcomes measured in these studies. Baseline assessments were poorly performed or not well characterized. Additionally, some studies relied entirely on participant reporting (particularly for dietary behavior outcomes), which is not always reliable and may be biased. However, for some outcomes, patient (or participant) report is the only reasonable way to measure the outcome. Future studies should use validated instruments for collecting outcome data and, when possible, include associated objectively measured health outcomes. Furthermore, many DBCIs exist on the market but were not eligible for our study due to their general lack of peer-review. Therefore, the included studies are not necessarily a reflection of the state-of-the-art for DBCIs, but the available evidence regarding the effectiveness of context-aware DBCIs is limited at this point in time."
