      "text": "Primary Objective: Review the operational definitions of health and wellness coaching as published in the peer-reviewed medical literature. Background: As global rates of preventable chronic diseases have reached epidemic proportions, there has been an increased focus on strategies to improve health behaviors and associated outcomes. One such strategy, health and wellness coaching, has been inconsistently defined and shown mixed results. Methods: A Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA)-guided systematic review of the medical literature on health and wellness coaching allowed for compilation of data on specific features of the coaching interventions and background and training of coaches. Results: Eight hundred abstracts were initially identified through PubMed, with 284 full-text articles ultimately included. The majority (76%) were empirical articles. The literature operationalized health and wellness coaching as a process that is fully or partially patient-centered (86% of articles), included patientdetermined goals (71%), incorporated self-discovery and active learning processes (63%) (vs more passive receipt of advice), encouraged accountability for behaviors (86%), and provided some type of education to patients along with using coaching processes (91%). Additionally, 78% of articles indicated that the coaching occurs in the context of a consistent, ongoing relationship with a human coach who is trained in specific behavior change, communication, and motivational skills. Conclusions: Despite disparities in how health and wellness coaching have been operationalized previously, this systematic review observes an emerging consensus in what is referred to as health and wellness coaching; namely, a patient-centered process that is based upon behavior change theory and is delivered by health professionals with diverse backgrounds. The actual coaching process entails goalsetting determined by the patient, encourages self-discovery in addition to content education, and incorporates mechanisms for developing accountability in health behaviors. With a clear definition for health and wellness coaching, robust research can more accurately assess the effectiveness of the approach in bringing about changes in health behaviors, health outcomes and associated costs that are targeted to reduce the global burden of chronic disease."

      "text": "The global prevalence of preventable chronic diseases associated with unhealthy behaviors has reached epidemic proportions and negatively affects healthcare systems and economies worldwide.  [1] [2] 2] [3]  Given the strain of chronic illness, public health, disease management, clinical practice, and employee wellness models are evolving to help individuals change their health behaviors to prevent and better manage chronic disease.  [4] [5] 5] [6] [7]  One rapidly emerging strategy to help individuals successfully change their health behaviors is health or wellness coaching. Health and wellness coaching has been defined in varying ways over the past decade. In 2003, Palmer et al defined health coaching as the practice of health education and health promotion within a coaching context, to enhance the wellbeing of individuals and to facilitate the achievement of their health-related goals.  8  2006, Butterworth, Linden, McClay, and Leo defined health coaching as a service in which providers facilitate participants in changing lifestyle-related behaviors for improved health and quality of life, or establishing and attaining health promoting goals.  9, 10 re recently, the National Consortium for Credentialing Health and Wellness Coaches (NCCHWC) proposed the following definition of health and wellness coaches, which delineates core elements of the practice of coaching:\n\nHealth and wellness coaches are professionals from diverse backgrounds and education who work with individuals and groups in a client-centered process to facilitate and empower the client to achieve self-determined goals related to health and wellness. Successful coaching takes place when coaches apply clearly defined knowledge and skills so that clients mobilize internal strengths and external resources for sustainable change.  11 though these definitions share some similar components, there is no agreement on what exactly health coaching entails (eg, practices, strategies, delivery methods), what the role of the coach actually is (eg, educator, navigator, facilitator, partner),  9, 12  and what background and training enable the coach to provide health coaching competently.\n\nAs use of the terms health coaching and wellness coaching proliferate without a clear and consistent definition of this intervention, additionally concerning is the increasing rate at which peer-reviewed journals are m\u00e9dica revisada por pares. Fundamentaci\u00f3n: Dado que que las tasas mundiales de enfermedades cr\u00f3nicas evitables han alcanzado proporciones epid\u00e9micas, se ha hecho cada vez m\u00e1s hincapi\u00e9 en las estrategias para mejorar las conductas sanitarias y los resultados asociados. Una de estas estrategias, la formaci\u00f3n de salud y bienestar, se ha definido de forma inconsistente y ha mostrado resultados mixtos. M\u00e9todos: Una revisi\u00f3n sistem\u00e1tica, guiada por los elementos de informaci\u00f3n preferidos para las revisiones sistem\u00e1ticas y el metan\u00e1lisis (PRIMSA, Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses), de la literatura m\u00e9dica sobre la formaci\u00f3n de salud y bienestar permiti\u00f3 la recopilaci\u00f3n de datos sobre las caracter\u00edsticas espec\u00edficas de las intervenciones de formaci\u00f3n, y sobre la procedencia y la formaci\u00f3n de los formadores. Resultados: se identificaron inicialmente ochocientos res\u00famenes a trav\u00e9s de PubMed y, en \u00faltima instancia, se incluyeron 284 art\u00edculos con texto completo. La mayor\u00eda (76 %) eran art\u00edculos emp\u00edricos. La literatura aport\u00f3 una definici\u00f3n operativa de la formaci\u00f3n de salud y bienestar como un proceso que est\u00e1 total o parcialmente centrado en el paciente (86 % de los art\u00edculos), que incluye metas determinadas por los pacientes (71 %), incorpora procesos de aprendizaje activo y descubrimiento personal (63 %) -en comparaci\u00f3n con una recepci\u00f3n m\u00e1s pasiva de asesoramiento-, alienta la responsabilidad por las conductas (86 %) e imparte alg\u00fan tipo de educaci\u00f3n a pacientes junto con el uso de procesos de formaci\u00f3n (91 %). Adem\u00e1s, el 78 % de los art\u00edculos indic\u00f3 que la formaci\u00f3n se presenta en el contexto de una relaci\u00f3n continua y coherente con un formador humano que est\u00e1 capacitado en aptitudes motivacionales, comunicativas y de cambios conductuales espec\u00edficos. Conclusiones: A pesar de las divergencias en la forma en que la formaci\u00f3n de salud y bienestar se ha puesto en marcha con anterioridad, esta revisi\u00f3n sistem\u00e1tica se\u00f1ala un consenso emergente en lo que se refiere a la formaci\u00f3n de salud y bienestar, es decir, un proceso centrado en el paciente que se basa en la teor\u00eda del cambio conductual y que se administra por parte de profesionales sanitarios con diversas experiencias en el pasado. El proceso real de formaci\u00f3n implica el establecimiento de objetivos determinado por el paciente, estimula el descubrimiento personal, adem\u00e1s de la formaci\u00f3n en contenidos, e incorpora mecanismos para desarrollar la responsabilidad en las conductas de salud. Con una definici\u00f3n clara de la formaci\u00f3n de salud y bienestar, la investigaci\u00f3n s\u00f3lida puede evaluar de una forma m\u00e1s precisa la eficacia de la estrategia en la consecuci\u00f3n de los cambios en las conductas de salud, los resultados sanitarios y los costos asociados dirigidos a reducir la carga mundial de la enfermedad cr\u00f3nica."

      "text": "publishing research results that claim to evaluate \"health coaching,\" but use widely varying definitions,  12  thereby confusing the value of coaching results. Indeed, numerous studies have used the term health coaching to address chronic disease care in various settings and with mixed results. For example, Wennberg et al found that a targeted care-management program with telephonic health coaching for individuals insured by a large health plan reduced medical costs and hospitalizations.  13 Similarly, studies of health coaching for patients with diabetes,  [14] [15] [16] [17]  obesity,  18, 19  cancer,  20  and risk of  21  or diagnosed cardiovascular disease  22, 23  demonstrate a positive effect on health behaviors or health outcomes. However, review of the literature reveals other evaluations of coaching that find non-significant benefits for health outcomes.  [24] [25] ] [26] [27]  Likely, one major reason for the variability in findings on the effectiveness of health coaching is that highly disparate interventions are being investigated under the umbrella term of health or wellness coaching. When we consider the interventions carefully, we find a broad range in the following: (1) the techniques used during the coaching process; (2) the theoretical underpinnings of the approach; (3) the frequency and duration of the coaching process; (4) the extent of human contact provided; (5) the degree to which content education is included in the intervention; and (6) the professional background and training of the coaches. At one end of the continuum are well-described and theoretically based interventions delivered through one-onone relationships that develop over months or years with a highly trained professional who employs welldeveloped and articulated processes and strategies to help individuals initiate and sustain behavior changes over time.  9, 17, 19, 28 At the other end of the continuum are interventions that require no human contact,  [29] [30] [31]  that appear to be purely content education rather than skills-based training,  32, 33  and/or have no stated theoretical backing. This lack of standardization in both the definition and the operationalization of health coaching makes it difficult, if not impossible, to determine whether health coaching is indeed an effective approach to improving health behaviors and reducing the global burden of chronic disease.\n\nThe purpose of the present study was to establish a consensus definition of health and wellness coaching through a systematic review of the related literature. The intention is threefold. First, we intend to answer repeated calls in the literature for evidence-based identification of conceptual and interventional components of health and wellness coaching.  28, 34, 35 Second, with a standardized definition, components of this approach can be used as targets to clarify the professional skills needed to appropriately train health and wellness coaches.  12, 34, 36 Finally, with a standardized definition, we can more rigorously evaluate both the efficacy and the effectiveness of health and wellness coaching.  12 To these ends, we conducted a comprehensive, systematic review of the peer-reviewed medical literature to determine how health and wellness coaching is operationalized. Using an adapted population, intervention, comparison, outcome (PICO) format, our primary research question was, \"How are interventions described as health or wellness coaching defined and operationalized in the peer-reviewed medical literature?\" This review will serve as the foundation for future effectiveness research and identification of best practices in health and wellness coaching that may be widely disseminated to mitigate the negative consequences of the global chronic disease epidemic."

What type of literature has been published on health and wellness coaching? Given this early stage of clarifying the definition of \"health and wellness coaching,\" we chose to describe all peerreviewed medical literature rather than only empirical trials. We surmised that articles written by clinicians describing ongoing practices were as useful as randomized controlled trials for understanding key concepts emerging in the field. Once a standardized definition has emerged, review of empirical data will be essential to ascertain the effectiveness of health and wellness coaching and to establish standards for practice guidelines. In answering question 1, we categorized articles as one of four types:\n\n1. a research study wherein data were systematically collected; 2. a protocol description for an intended (and often funded) study where there is a plan to systematically collect data; 3. description of an existing practice or process, labeled as health or wellness coaching, that has already been operationalized and implemented-this category included those practices that SYSTEMATIC REVIEW OF THE LITERATURE ON HEALTH AND WELLNESS COACHING had retrospectively culled and reviewed data that were not prospectively and systematically collected; and 4. a conceptual piece that describes ideas about health and wellness coaching in research or clinical practice but presented no associated data.\n\nAs can be seen in the tables, we separated the results by article type in order to assess potential publication bias. We were concerned that the conceptual elements that did not resemble fully operationalized practices might reflect ideas that had not been tried.\n\n2. What approaches, practices, strategies, and methodologies constitute health coaching as described? After initial full-text review of 66 articles, five investigators (DD, EB, LAS, MES, RQW) developed a consensus on which specific practices were repeatedly mentioned and thus should be quantified to describe the evolving practice of health and wellness coaching. Categorical questions were answered with Yes, No, Partially, Not described, and Not applicable. These included the following: 2.1 Was the coaching patient-centered?\n\nTo determine the answer, we drew from the definition as put forth by the Institute of Medicine.  40 Specifically, was the coaching respectful of and responsive to individual patient preferences, needs and values? Did it appear to ensure that patient values guided all clinical decisions? Was it based on effective communication, shared information, and shared decision-making between clinician and patient? In practice, coding \"yes\" for 2.1 indicated that the coaching practice was tailored to the individual and allowed some autonomy on the part of the patient."

Following along the lines of coaching as a patient-centered process and consistent with several definitions of health and wellness coaching, we evaluated the degree to which articles described a practice wherein patients were able to set their own goals, or whether the goals were predetermined by the intervention, coach, or medical provider(s). If patients were able to set their own goals, this was coded \"yes.\" If patients had preset goals, this was coded \"no.\" Interventions that described a procedure where there was a predetermined primary goal (eg, blood pressure control, weight loss) but the patient was able to develop some personal goals that might facilitate the primary goal were coded as \"partially.\"\n\n2.3 Was a self-discovery process used to find solutions vs advice-giving? We assessed each article to evaluate whether or not an active learning process was encouraged for the participant through self-exploration and problem solving vs being advised or instructed by the coach. In practice, if the patient appeared to have any involvement in finding or generating solutions for themselves, we coded \"Yes.\" This was in contrast to an approach that was strictly content education or simply telling the patient what s/ he needs to do, which was coded as \"No.\""

      "text": "A professional librarian ran a search on PubMed, which encompassed MEDLINE, life science journals, and online books from the fields of biomedicine and health covering portions of the life sciences, behavioral sciences, chemical sciences, and bioengineering. The librarian used no start date and included all articles with MeSH term \"human,\" written in English or Spanish, which had been loaded through January 2013. Search index terms included all forms of the words health or wellness and coach. The search included other potential subterms for coach such as educator, mentor, navigator and teacher as well as subterms for \"coaching\" such as training, feedback, and mentoring. For the full search index list, see Table  1 .\n\nEight hundred abstracts were initially identified through the literature search. An additional 55 articles were added through two separate means. First, articles previously collected by the authors that did not appear in the literature search were contributed for review. Second, three review articles obtained through the PubMed search  28, 34, 35  were combed for additional references. To be eligible for inclusion in the review, articles had to be published in a peer-reviewed journal, written in English or Spanish, and discuss coaching in the context of improving patient health and/or wellness. Articles on coaching for the purpose of professional development (eg, supporting a physician or nurse to improve their skills) and coaching in athletics were excluded. One investigator (RQW) reviewed each title and abstract to ensure general relevance. A second researcher (EB) reviewed abstracts for which the first investigator was unclear about its relevance to the current review. As illustrated in Figure  1 , the 800 abstracts were reduced to 349 full-text articles for review. Fulltext reviews then resulted in an additional 65 exclusions; specific reasons for exclusion are displayed in Figure  1 . As noted above, no exclusions were made based on type of article (eg, research report, protocol description, operating clinical practice, conceptual piece). We also noted when a single study was described by multiple articles (eg, at varying time points or on varying measures) or when a group of investigators or clinicians produced multiple articles on the same approach. Following a series of team discussions, however, we decided to include all such articles for this systematic review (vs one representative paper from a single study or group of investigators or clinicians) so we could report on the \"emerging thinking\" in both the clinical and research literature. For future reviews that evaluate the quality of the evidence and outcomes, multiple articles on a single study may be counted only once. We are well aware of the potential for descriptive or conceptual pieces (eg, commentaries) to influence the literature-and thus practice-even when they do not include descriptions of operating clinical practices or data. Hence, we also summarize pertinent sections of the literature (such as the descriptions of the actual coaching processes) without these concept articles and assess for potential bias.\n\nPairs of investigators from our team of 10 were assigned full-text articles to independently review and enter pertinent data on a standardized grid. For all fulltext articles, the following data were evaluated and abstracted if available:\n\n1. type of article (empirical, protocol waiting for data collection, existing practice, conceptual); 2. characteristics of the reported coaching process, including techniques used, degree of patient-centeredness, patient role in goal-setting and self-discovery processes, use of accountability strategies to encourage self-monitoring, provision of content education, frequency and duration of the coaching, and use of the same coach or different coaches over time; and 3. characteristics of the coaches themselves, including type of professional, background, and breadth and scope of reported training obtained to serve in the coaching role.\n\nA third reviewer resolved any disagreements between the two assigned reviewers on the abstracted data. Third reviews were required for 96 articles, and a fourth review was required for three. Four investigators (DD, MK, GS, and RQW) summarized data by compiling answers to each sub-question above and calculating summary statistics (proportions and ranges) for each question.

      "text": "Was the coaching patient-centered, ie, were coaching strategies and processes tailored to the individual's specific needs, concerns, circumstances, or readiness to change, or was the coaching instead applied uniformly without regard to individual differences? Twenty percent of articles did not provide sufficient detail to judge whether the coaching was patient-centered. Of those articles which gave sufficient detail to allow judgment, 61% described a coaching process that was patient-centered and an additional 25% described a coaching process that was partially patient-centered (Table  2 ). For example, Hendren et al (2010) tested a coaching intervention that appeared to be fully patient-centered, tailored in both intensity and content to patients' assessed barriers to obtaining care.  41 Others used partially patient-centered processes, including some strategies that were individualized in combination with some standardized processes. Aoun et  al (2009), for example, used the patient-centered approach of motivational interviewing in combination with standardized guidelines for weight loss and physical activity. Fewer than one out of six articles (14%) described a process that was classified as not at all patient-centered as evidenced by every participant receiving the same intervention without any tailoring or interventions that involved non-individualized instruction or prompting. For example, in one wellness program, coaching for weight loss was provided via highly scripted responses to patient statements.  43 In another intervention, the coaching content involved instructions from pharmacists in the correct use of medications without apparent variation according to the individual's situation.  44 2 Patient-determined goals. Did patients choose their own change goals as a target of the coaching, or were their goals preset or created by a professional? Twenty-four percent of articles did not provide sufficient detail to judge whether goals were set by the coaching patients themselves or by others. Of those articles that did allow us to judge, 45% described coaching processes in which patients determined their own goals and 26% reported that patients partially determined their coaching goals (Table  3 ). Examples of interventions with patient-determined goals include Hanks et al's (1995) study of weekly coaching sessions to support patients' capabilities as new mothers. In this intervention, coaches explored and clarified patients' values, provided information as needed, and encouraged design and commitment to achievable goals while constructing a plan sheet. 45  Examples of programs in which patients partially determined their coaching goals include a primary care-based intervention designed to help older adults adhere to medication for hypertension. Although the overall objective was medication adherence, coaches helped participants choose the barriers and habits they wished to change, set their own specific goals around them, and defined action steps to achieve them. 46  Similarly, a program that had the overall intention of improving participants' exercise persistence supported participants in setting individualized exercise plans. 27  Almost 30% of the literature described a coaching process in which goals were set externally without input from the patients. In Elbers et al's (2011) study of personal injury victims, health coaches executed a physician-driven care plan. 47  Likewise, in Allen et al (2008), all patients were given the goal of preparing for their physician visit. While the intervention was patient-centered, the goals themselves were not self-determined. 48  2.3 Use of self-discovery process. Was there a process of discovery, or active learning, included in the coaching process, or was the coaching instead instructional? Thirty-four percent of articles did not provide sufficient detail to judge whether or not self-discovery was involved in the coaching. Of those that did, 42% of the articles reviewed described a self-discovery process, and an additional 21% described a process that was mixed, ie, partly self-discovery and partly instructional or advice-giving (Table  4 ). Saleh et al's (2010) study of a rural workplace wellness program engaged patients as active learners through goal setting, action planning, self-monitoring, review of results, and conclusions about persisting with the action plan. 49  Another example is Ottaviano et al's (2010) proposed intervention to promote self-efficacy in patients with coronary heart disease. Here the coach continuously helps the patient assess their readiness to make lifestyle changes. 50  Thirty-seven percent of the articles did not include self-discovery processes as part of the definition of coaching. Examples where study participants did not engage in self-discovery or active   51  In this program, patients were instructed in the importance of blood pressure control and medication adherence without the opportunity to learn about themselves by exploring the relationship of their hypertension to their own overall health, well-being, or key values and drawing conclusions. Similarly, Ovbiosa et al (2012) described a workplace wellness program for weight reduction where participants received instructions on how to increase their physical activity to a preset target, including general educational handouts and calorie-counting books. 43  2.4 Accountability. Coaching that involves patient accountability is coaching in which it is possible for patients to self-monitor in order to observe their progress (or lack of it) toward their goal using some type of data and that encourages reflection on progress. Th ty-one percent of articles did not provide sufficient detail to judge whether the coaching being evaluated encouraged patient accountability.\n\nOf those that did, the vast majority of articles (81%) described a coaching process in which accountability of some form was built in, as shown in Table  5 . In these programs, patients actively monitored their efforts, observed results, either reported them or discussed them with their coach, and drew conclusions. Data collection formats ranged from qualitative self-report using coaching preparation forms  17, 52  to sophisticated web-programs  31, 52  and innovative mobile apps.  31 For example, in a study reported by Debar et al (2006), adolescent girls' recordings of their diet and exercise goals and achievements were regularly shared with their peer group and their coach.  53 In another study reported by Wennberg et al (2010), participants in a telephone-based care management intervention signed a behavioral contract with their wellness coaches, and had access to a computer program that tracked progress toward goals through the intervention.  54 n additional 5% of articles described coaching in which accountability was partially built in. Conversely, 14% of articles described a coaching process where there was no opportunity for patients to be accountable to either themselves (eg, through self-monitoring or observation of change against target) or to their coach (eg, through regular-ly providing information on progress toward goals and getting feedback). Coaching approaches where the coach and patient met once fell into this category since there is no opportunity for support of behavior change over time. For example, Brook et al (2003,  2005) reported on a program in which pharmacists instructed new users of anti-depressant medication about potential side effects in a one-time visit.  44, 55 5 Content education. Content education refers to providing expert information to the patient to facilitate knowledge and understanding of a specific health condition for which behavior change is desirable (eg, disease information, standardized guidelines for clinical markers, consensus recommendations for behavior change, professional opinions on target goals). Eighteen percent (51 of 284) of articles did not provide sufficient information to determine whether or not content education was provided to coaching participants. Of those that did, 91% documented provision of content education. In terms of the type of education provided to participants, 40% of the interventions provided disease-specific information, while 22% more generically defined their content education as lifestyle or health education or specified teaching about nutrition (19%) or physical activity (18%). Only 8% provided the participants with content education on behavior change processes, such as goal setting and the importance of self-monitoring (Table  6 ).\n\nThe depth of content and mode of delivery varied substantially. Common delivery modes for content education included provision of written material (eg, notebooks, pamphlets), static and interactive websites, and in-person visits and classes. Many programs used multiple tactics. For example, one disease management program described mailing quarterly newsletters and disease-specific educational pamphlets to participants with diabetes who were also involved in coaching.  56 6 Coaching \"dose.\" In the majority of articles reviewed, it was not possible to calculate the \"dose\" of coaching that was being evaluated in terms of length of individual coaching sessions, number of coaching sessions, or duration of the coaching intervention. Overall, 75% (212 of 284) of the peerreviewed articles did not specify the length of each individual coaching session, 52% (148 of 284) did not specify the total number of coaching sessions used, and 64% (181 of 284) did not specify the duration of the coaching process. Of those that did specify the session length, sessions lasted for an average of 35.8 minutes, ranging from 5 minutes  57, 58  to 2.5 hours. 59  Of those that specified the number of coaching sessions, the average reported was 10.1 sessions, ranging from 1 to 90, 60 median = 6. For those articles that reported the length and number of coaching sessions (n = 68), the average contact hours with a coach was 6.2, ranging from 15 minutes 61 to 135 hours, 60 median = 3 hours. A wide range was also observed in the duration of the entire coaching intervention. As depicted in Table  7 , coaching ranged from a single session to 6 years. For interventions that had a consistent coaching schedule, frequency of coaching ranged from biannual sessions to access to a coach twice per week, with the majority reporting weekly sessions. Coaching frequency appeared to be related to length of the intervention, with shorter programs employing more weekly coaching whereas longer interventions were more likely to use monthly coaching."

Sixty-one percent (87 of 143) of articles in which training content was described reported training coaches in behavior change methods (eg, goal setting, action planning, problem solving, navigating obstacles/barriers to goals, finding resources, selfmonitoring, and building self-efficacy) based on multiple theories, including the following: Health Beliefs Model,  65  Social Cognitive Theory,  66, 67  Theory of Planned Behavior,  68, 69  the Trans theoretical Model,  [70] [71] [72]  Self-Determination Theory,  [73] [74] [75]  Self-Perception Theory,  76  and Mo ti vational En hance ment.

Note that 42% of articles that documented the content of the coaches' training specifically referred to training in \"a communication method\" called motivational interviewing (MI).  [78] [79] 9] [80]  Training in MI typically includes education in five key skill sets that reflect the \"four guiding principles\" of MI: expressing empathy, developing discrepancy, rolling with resistance, and supporting self-efficacy. The five key skill sets include (1) use of open-ended questions, (2) affirmations, (3) reflections, (4) summaries that highlight both sides of ambivalence, and (5) reinforcement of the patients use of \"change talk.\" (For a greater understanding, see the article by Simmons and Wolever in this issue. 80 ) Because MI covers both types of communication strategies coded in our study, we also credited articles that explicitly reported MI training with both types of communication training. In addition to the 42% that reported training in MI, training in other motivational approaches was mentioned by 14% of the articles and an additional 4% specifically noted the use of whole-person approaches. Other motivational techniques included additional aspects of Motivation Enhancement Therapy, patient activation, visioning, and exploration of personal values. Finally, 13% reported training coaches in cognitive behavioral skills (CBT)\n\nfor working with patients' specific health conditions, including reframing, cognitive restructuring, and CBT-based self-management skills."

To move the field forward, we must first clarify what the intervention is. With an evidence-based, consensus definition, stronger efficacy and effectiveness studies can ensue, and professional training can be improved.

      "text": "a patient-centered approach wherein patients at least partially determine their goals, use self-discovery or active learning processes together with content education to work toward their goals, and self-monitor behaviors to increase accountability, all within the context of an interpersonal relationship with a coach. The coach is a healthcare professional trained in behavior change theory, motivational strategies, and communication techniques, which are used to assist patients to develop intrinsic motivation and obtain skills to create sustainable change for improved health and well-being.\n\nSpecifically, 86% of the articles describe health and wellness coaching as a process that is patient-centered. Seventy-one percent describe coaching as an intervention that supports patients' pursuit of selfidentified goals (rather than goals prescribed by the provider). Sixty-three percent define coaching as a process in which the patient is an active learner whose own self-discovery process is supported to resolve problems, overcome challenges, and negotiate barriers to goals. Eighty-six percent of articles describe specific mechanisms to support patient accountability for behavior change through various self-monitoring techniques and reporting back to their coach. Seventy-eight percent of articles describe coaching that occurs in the context of a consistent ongoing relationship with a human coach designated to play a defined role.\n\nThe definition of health coaching emerging from the peer-reviewed literature is consistent with the evolving science of human motivation and the psychosocial underpinnings of sustainable behavioral change. There is evidence that behavior change and learning occur most reliably when there is a helping relationship that (1) acknowledges the individual, (  2 ) is collab-orative, and (3) encourages active learning. (See Dill and Gumpert for review.  81 ) Reaching back to the theoretical roots of Adler,  82, 83  Jung,  84, 85  and Rogers,  86  health and wellness coaching conceptualizes patients as lifelong learners whose individual personal values and innate internal resources can be cultivated in the context of a supportive relationship to guide them toward their own desired vision of health.  87, 88 his systematic review takes the field an important step forward, yet we need to further upgrade the science to better evaluate health and wellness coaching. It is concerning that up to a third of the articles did not describe the actual coaching methods used, making it impossible to fully evaluate or replicate specific processes. Further, only a small minority of articles provided information that allows for calculation of a coaching \"dose\" (25% reported length of each individual coaching session, 48% reported the number of coaching sessions delivered, 36% reported the duration of the coaching process, and very few reported all three.) Going forward and until there is a well-accepted international standard to determine competency in health and wellness coaching, it is imperative that publications report the theories on which interventions are based and fully describe the processes, techniques, and intensity of the intervention being investigated. To move the field ahead, empirical articles must describe the approaches they are evaluating in a way that allows replication. With a consensus definition of health and wellness coaching in place, we will be able to understand what components of coaching are essential to affect health outcomes and health behavior change in general. For example, it will be of great interest to revisit the issue of whether health coaching will be consistently effective at promoting health change if health coaching is defined, as by this consensus, as patient-centered and incorporating patient-determined goals, self-discovery processes, accountability mechanisms, and content information, in the context of an ongoing helping relationship. We also will be able to understand what components, at what \"dose,\" can be adapted in what way, to affect health outcomes and health behavior change for specific patient populations and specific illnesses or conditions. We have statistical capability to evaluate the impact of individual components of heterogeneous interventions. For example, Michie (2009) found strong evidence for the efficacy of the following specific interventions in the behavioral change literature on dietary intake and physical activity: self-monitoring of behavior, prompting intention formation, prompting specific goal setting, providing feedback on performance, and participants to review behavioral goals.  89 lso, Olsen and Nesbitt (2010) found evidence that four specific interventions were the effective components of health coaching programs: (1) goal setting, (2) selected components of motivational interviewing, (3) collaborations with healthcare providers, and (  4 ) program durations of 6 to 12 months.  34 In the near future, we look forward to being able to define best practices in health and wellness coaching applied to specific populations and specific targets for health outcomes and health behavior change."

      "title": "Who delivers Health Coaching?",
      "text": "While the specific professional background of health and wellness coaches is diverse, there is an emerging consensus in the literature that coaching be provided by health professionals (currently a diverse range is represented) who, further, have specific training in coaching processes and not only expertise in the knowledge base of their profession. Coaches' training, when described, fell in the general categories of behavior change skills, health information briefing, and job training. However, it is of significant concern that only half of the articles provided descriptions of the content of coaches' training for the specific study, and only 22% of articles reported on the extent of training received by the coaches. As previously stated, if we are to move the field of health coaching forward, empirical articles must describe the approaches they are evaluating in a way that allows replication; this includes concrete descriptions of content and intensity of training provided and/or evidence by replicable standards that coaches had achieved a level of competence relevant for the coaching they delivered. However, if we refer to the emerging consensus definition of what health and wellness coaching is, we can extrapolate coaches' necessary core competencies with the caveat that their effect on health outcomes remains to be determined.\n\nFirst, coaches must have training in a model of change that is patient-centered, and based on facilitating the patient's personal change process, rather than dictating it. Coaches must also have the interpersonal skills to understand the unique values, motivations, resources, and obstacles that the patient brings to the change process and the ability to express their understanding effectively. Second, and along similar lines, the coach must be able to help patients identify their own goals for change that are personally important and achievable. Third, coaches must be trained in the use of a self-discovery process that facilitates patients working toward their goals through exploration and an active learning process rather than by dictating what should be done. Fourth, coaches must understand how to help patients be accountable to themselves and monitor their progress. Finally, coaches must have the relevant content knowledge to help their patients with the above four processes in the arena of change. Coaches also must have the interpersonal skill to integrate the content information into the patient's change process rather than dictating it. These competencies require not only use of multiple communication skills and empowerment strategies, but also require a consistent stance on the part of the coach to simultaneously hold the patient's agenda, convey that the patient is resourceful and a lifelong learner, and guide them toward sound health decisions without advising, all the while respecting patients as the best experts on what may work best in their individual lives.\n\nIt is critical to note that this paradigm is distinct from that of conventional medicine.  87 As well-explicated in Linden, Butterworth, and Prochaska (2010), typical disease management interventions often employ healthcare professionals who do not necessarily value patient empowerment, who may not have exposure to or adequate training in the science of behavioral change, and who may not have the complex interpersonal skills to facilitate behavior change effectively.  90 his leaves those trained in the conventional medical model vulnerable to using approaches that are expertdriven, authoritarian, and advice-giving as opposed to taking stances that are supported by the latest research in behavior change models.  87, 91, 92 Thus, we conclude that specific training in these core competencies and credentialing will be necessary if coaches are to deliver health and wellness coaching as described in this consensus definition."

We also will be able to understand what components of health and wellness coaching, at what \"doses,\" can be adapted in what way to best promote health outcomes and health behavior change for specific patient populations and specific illnesses or conditions. Several other areas within health and wellness coaching merit more rigorous study, including the role of the coach, individualized vs protocol-driven coaching, and the integration of technology into coaching.\n\nRole of the coach. One issue for future investigation is the role of the coach and specifically whether one coach can play multiple roles effectively. Of the literature that provided sufficient information to determine the presence of content education for participants, 91% included content education as a key addition to the coaching process. It was not uncommon to see coaching provided as an adjunct to educational modules, as well as to observe education components provided to a primarily coaching intervention. As multiple authors have distinguished between educating and coaching,  28, 87, 91  it is undoubtedly important to differentiate the processes. When the health coach is providing information within the context of coaching, plainly defined processes need to be outlined. For example, one component of motivational interviewing, an approach that can be used within the coaching process,  89  emphasizes the importance of obtaining permission to present information.  78 ndeed, asking permission has also been found empirically to benefit the coaching process and serves to empower the patient.  92  second option identified as a way to provide education in the context of coaching is that of presenting information as tentative and for consideration of possibilities rather than as directive knowledge.  92 This distinction highlights the import of training coaches in skills designed to incorporate educational information so that the process remains patient-centered. Relatedly, there is a stark lack of clarity in the literature regarding the role of health coaches as educators and whether the same person can effectively serve in both roles simultaneously while still ensuring the coaching process is patient-centered. For example, if a healthcare provider is both coaching and educating, a patient may defer to this person's expertise and assume that the education provided is what \"should\" be done, even if it conflicts with the individual's values, readiness, or desires around the behavior. This raises the need for a clear division of roles with commensurate professional training. Whether the psychological (eg, building self-efficacy) and behavioral (eg, setting goals that are consistent with values) strategies used in health coaching complement or conflict with simultaneous delivery of content information is an intriguing question. It seems that both can be used to the benefit of the patient, however, the best mechanism for delivering these strategies is yet to be determined. Assessing whether, and if so how, the health coach provides content information will be critical to defining health or wellness coaching best practices.\n\nSimilarly, in a setting where the provider is serving a dual role as clinician and coach, further investigation into what constitutes the coaching segment of a visit and how that looks different from the clinical care component of the visit will be essential to understanding how such a brief encounter might work. At least 13 articles alluded to the role of the coach as someone to help patients navigate some aspect of the health system. This role presents yet another potential conflict for patient-centered guidance wherein the coach supports, but does not \"do for\" the patient. Each of these approaches will look different, emphasize different skills, and needs to be carefully considered to ensure that coaches receive the appropriate training to differentiate roles and protect patients. Moreover, there likely will need to be a patient-education component of this approach, where patients learn how coaching is being integrated into a clinical visit, what their \"job\" or \"role\" is in this encounter, and how that looks different from when they are receiving information about their health."

      "title": "Individualized vs protocol-driven coaching.",
      "text": "Another area for further investigation is the delicate balance between conducting patient-centric, highly individualized approaches and using more standardized, protocol-based approaches to health and wellness coaching. Of the articles that provided descriptions of the actual coaching processes, a number of them included a more generalized approach with set protocols and prompts that were disease-specific in some cases but not based on the individual needs or values of the participant. Some might argue that such a standardized approach is easier to describe, disseminate, measure, and ultimately compare. However, our review indicates that there are examples of individualized processes that can be standardized with the same effect. For example, although only emerging in the past decade, one brand of integrative health coaching has been well described, standardized within a framework that allows for individual tailoring,  87, 88  and shown to be effective.  17, 21, 93, 94 Perhaps the best example of standardization of individually tailored processes is seen in motivational interviewing; the MI processes have been well described, standardized within a framework, widely disseminated, and demonstrated to be effective in many settings.  9, 78, 79, 90, [95] [96] 6] [97]  Moreover, motivational interviewing has the advantage of several psychometrically sound program evaluation measures (eg, Motivational Interviewing Skills Code,  98  Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity  99  ) that can be used to ensure intervention integrity and assess intervention outcomes for common threats to validity.  9 While motivational interviewing uses only a subset of skills needed in health or wellness coaching,  80  it serves as an excellent example of how general processes that are used in highly individualized ways can be thoroughly described and well-validated.\n\nIntegrating technology into coaching. Some articles used the term coaching to describe interventions in which there are actually no human providers. Instead, technology (eg, computer programs, algorithm-driven text messages) was used to drive the behavior change process. While there is no doubt that technology provides myriad potential advantages, close to four in five articles posit coaching as a relationship-based approach. We propose that technology has a definite role in supporting individuals in the process of behavior change, particularly in facilitating the process of self-monitoring, the most strongly supported behavior change technique studied at least for eating and physical activity.  89 Many practices described the use of technology including text-based messaging, mobile applications, websites, and even sensor technology (eg, ear buds, wristbands) to facilitate accumulation and tracking of data on behaviors of interest. For example, in the Davis et al study, a TriFit machine was the primary means for tracking data.  100 Despite the important contribution of technology to self-monitoring, three-quarters of the articles stated or implied (78%) that participants were matched with the same coach over multiple sessions whereas a consistent relationship was not developed with a coach about a fifth of the time. Though multiple theorists describe the health and wellness coaching process as building on the critical foundation of a human relationship, further research is needed to determine the degree to which the relationship itself is seminal in facilitating personal learning. The value of human connection to facilitate deep learning is well-described in other evidence bases.  101 In the health and wellness coaching literature, qualitative studies have noted the power of interpersonal support in building courage to try new behaviors, 102 in strengthening a sense of accountability toward the other person (coach),  103, 104  and in developing a sense of empowerment.  92 Additionally, interpersonal interactions may be necessary for participants to move from cognitive understanding of ambivalence, motivators, and barriers to change to a deeper, \"felt sense\" understanding more likely to sustain behavior.  81, 101 The potential role of relationship in this emerging approach remains an important area for further exploration."

      "title": "CONCLUSIONS",
      "text": "This study is not without its limitations. Indeed, for each of the domains for which we abstracted data, there were data missing because the authors did not provide the information in their report. First, we included all studies of health coaching, even when there were multiple reports of the same intervention. This may have inflated certain counts of the various domains of coaching reported. Second, although two to three investigators reviewed each study, there were many instances in which the team made judgment calls regarding a particular domain of the coaching based on limited descriptions in the articles that may or may not have been what was actually implemented. Thus, our review may have mischaracterized some of the coaching interventions in the literature. Third, and relatedly, for several of the review questions for which we abstracted data, anywhere from 11% to 78% of articles did not describe the pertinent domain in sufficient detail to allow us to code them. Finally, our methods included only articles in the PubMed database. Though we expect the vast majority of health and wellness coaching articles to be indexed within PubMed, we are aware that some relevant articles may exist outside this database. Thus, the picture presented here likely does not fully reflect all of the coaching models in the literature. Similarly, health coach training paradigms and programs that are not reflected in PubMed are also not reflected in this systematic review.\n\nDespite these limitations, our systematic review of health and wellness coaching is the first in the literature to characterize this growing field in healthcare. Variation in approaches and practices that have been defined and operationalized as health or wellness coaching makes it difficult to compare approaches and identify those that are most effective for chronic disease prevention and management. Indeed, our findings point to the critical need for future systematic investigations of the effectiveness of various health and wellness coaching approaches in order to identify the best practices in the field, further refine the definition, and iteratively operationalize health or wellness coaching in research and practice. These \"best practices\" should include both the coach's minimum necessary skills and the coaching processes that facilitate a patientcentric approach to behavioral change. Moreover, future reports of coaching interventions should aim to describe in as much detail as possible the coaching intervention, including a thorough description of the individuals providing coaching with professional background and coaching-specific training, and the breadth and depth of the skills and processes used. These detailed descriptions will enable robust comparison of approaches across disease states and populations, so that a compendium of coaching models that have proven most effective can be generated and disseminated. These efforts will help to ensure that health and wellness coaching is an evidence-based practice that can make a demonstrable difference in the prevention and management of chronic disease in healthcare systems worldwide."
