  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: Mobile Health technology for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation is unknown. METHODS: The simple mobile AF (mAF) App was designed to incorporate clinical decision-support tools (CHA2DS2-VASc [Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age \u226575 years, Diabetes Mellitus, Prior Stroke or TIA, Vascular disease, Age 65-74 years, Sex category], HAS-BLED [Hypertension, Abnormal renal/ liver function, Stroke, Bleeding history or predisposition, Labile INR, Elderly, Drugs/alcohol concomitantly], SAMe-TT2R2 [Sex, Age <60 years, Medical history, Treatment, Tobacco use, Race] scores), educational materials, and patient involvement strategies with self-care protocols and structured follow-up. Patients with atrial fibrillation were randomized into 2 groups (mAF App vs usual care) in a cluster randomized design pilot study. Patients' knowledge, quality of life, drug adherence, and anticoagulation satisfaction were evaluated at baseline, 1 month, and 3 months. Usability, feasibility, and acceptability of the mAF App were assessed at 1 month. RESULTS: A total of 113 patients were randomized to mAF App intervention (mean age, 67.4 years; 57.5% were male; mean follow-up, 69 days), and 96 patients were randomized to usual care (mean age, 70.9 years; 55.2% were male; mean follow-up, 95 days). More than 90% of patients reported that the mAF App was easy, user-friendly, helpful, and associated with significant improvements in knowledge compared with the usual care arm (P values for trend <.05). Drug adherence and anticoagulant satisfaction were significantly better with the mAF App versus usual care (all P < .05). Quality of life scores were significantly increased in the mAF App arm versus usual care, with anxiety and depression reduced (all P < .05). \n CONCLUSIONS: The pilot mAFA Trial is the first prospective randomized trial of Mobile Health technology in patients with atrial fibrillation, demonstrating that the mAF App, integrating clinical decision support,",

      "text": "Atrial fibrillation is the most common cardiac arrhythmia, with a global health burden of approximately 33.5 million individuals with atrial fibrillation worldwide.  1 The lifetime risk for developing atrial fibrillation is 21% to 23% in women and 17% to 26% in men.  [2] [3] 3] [4]  In the past 5 decades, age-adjusted atrial fibrillation prevalence globally has increased 5-fold  5  and is expected to double by 2050.  1  Atrial fibrillation-related stroke is devastating, which has been described as an \"atrial fibrillation-related stroke tsunami\" without proper treatment with oral anticoagulants.  6 he underuse or inappropriate use of oral anticoagulants is common in the population with atrial fibrillation, particularly so in many Asian countries.  7 Even in the new era of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants,  5  many patients remain undertreated.  8 Also, 28% of high-risk patients (defined as a CHA2DS2-VASc [Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age \u226575 years, Diabetes Mellitus, Prior Stroke or TIA, Vascular disease, Age 65-74 years, Sex category] score \u22652) are not anticoagulated, whereas 51% of very lowrisk patients are inappropriately anticoagulated.  9 onadherence to atrial fibrillation guidelines is common across all risk strata, ranging from 33% to 68% among the high-risk population.  10 On the other hand, patients' preferences are another important reason for nonadherence to therapy.  11 Thus, efforts to streamline decision-making for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation and to improve patients' knowledge are important in the era of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants.  12 ovel strategies that incorporate eHealth or Mobile Health encompass the use of information and communication technologies in the management of disease, providing innovative solutions to the problem of long-term management after discharge.  13, 14 However, there are limited data on the implementation of Mobile Health technology for the management of patients with atrial fibrillation, particularly in relation to its feasibility, efficacy, and safety."

The mAF App could record atrial fibrillation features, patient medical history, laboratory tests, atrial fibrillation treatments, antithrombotic drugs, and other pharmacologic treatments at baseline. Patients were recommended to upload their laboratory tests (eg, hemoglobin, platelet count, liver/renal function tests, blood lipids), electrocardiogram, and echocardiogram (if available) at 1 month and 3 months after their initial consultation. Clinical Decision Support. The mAF App automatically calculates CHA2DS2-VASc, HAS-BLED, and SAMe-TT2R2 scores after the patient's Personal Health Record is completed (Supplementary Figure 2, available online).\n\nPatients with a low stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc score 0 in men, 1 in women) were recommended no antithrombotic treatment. Patients at moderate stroke risk (1 stroke risk factor) were suggested to consider oral anticoagulants balancing against bleeding risk, and those at high stroke risk (CHA2DS2-VASc \u22652) were recommended oral anticoagulants. Patients with HAS-BLED \u22653 were flagged for followup, and modifiable bleeding risk factors were proactively addressed. Because non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants are \"self-pay\" drugs and not reimbursed in China, if the patients had a SAMe-TT2R2 score 0 to 2, they were considered to receive warfarin treatment. If the SAMe-TT2R2 score was >2, the patients would have additional education/ counseling about warfarin and more regular review/ international normalized ratio checks, or to use a nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "To our knowledge, the mAFA Trial is the first prospective randomized trial of Mobile Health technology in patients with atrial fibrillation, demonstrating that the mAF App, integrating clinical decision support, education, and patient-involvement strategies, significantly improved knowledge, drug adherence, quality of life, and anticoagulation satisfaction.\n\nClinical decision support provided by the mAF App streamlined guideline-based decision-making for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation and was easily handled by doctors and understood by patients. The clinical decision support tools in the mAF App automatically assessed stroke and bleeding risk, and stratified the patients with high-risk stroke/thromboembolism to anticoagulant treatment, while balancing the bleeding risk. Bleeding risk factors were labeled and could be reviewed by doctors and patients. Personalized choice of oral anticoagulants would be advised on the basis of the SAMe-TT2R2 score, resulting in rational decisionmaking on anticoagulant management options.\n\nSuboptimal thromboprophylaxis in patients with atrial fibrillation is highly prevalent, contributed to by an inappropriate evaluation of the risks versus benefits of oral anticoagulants, despite various guidelines on atrial fibrillation management.  18, 19 Indeed, guideline-adherent antithrombotic management is associated with significantly better outcomes.  20 ne barrier to adherence to guideline-optimized therapy could be the challenges of a \"real-world\" busy clinical practice, and the clinical decision-making tool in the mAF App could make the process of guideline implementation easier.\n\nTo help access to guidelines for the clinician, a pocket guideline App for European guidelines has been developed. The CATCH-ME treatment manager is integrated into the atrial fibrillation section, but has yet to be prospectively tested or evaluated.  21 Another option is the Atrial Fibrillation Decision Support Tool, which is a patient-specific decision analytic model composed of a 29-state Markov simulation, using information from the Electronic Health Record to integrate patient-specific risk factors for stroke and hemorrhage in its calculations.  22 However, the intervention with the Atrial Fibrillation Decision Support Tool did not result in significant improvements in discordant antithrombotic therapy in a population with atrial fibrillation.  23 Other Apps have been developed to provide stroke and bleeding risk calculations; for example, the Computerised Antithrombotic Risk Assessment Tool Version 2 could calculate the CHADS2 (Congestive heart failure, Hypertension, Age over 75 years, Diabetes Mellitus, Stroke), CHA2DS2-VASc, HAS-BLED, and HEMORR2-HAGES (Hepatic or renal disease, Ethanol abuse, Malignancy, Older age, Reduced platelet count or function, Rebleeding risk, Hypertension, Anemia, Genetic factors, Excessive fall risk, Stroke) scores.  24 Another clinical decision support tool, which could calculate the CHA2DS2-VASc score and alter the clinician prescription of oral anticoagulants therapy, is being studied.  25 However, these Apps/tools are focused on doctors and not the follow-up and day-to-day management of patients with atrial fibrillation.\n\nThe mAF App not only calculates the clinical risk scores but also automatically makes a follow-up plan, permitting the patient's self-monitoring and timely feedback. We also show that the mAF App-based self-monitoring and feedback enhanced compliance and adherence to drug therapy and   Clinical follow-up ensures effective and safe anticoagulant therapy in patients with atrial fibrillation. A systematic review of drug adherence, thromboembolism, bleeding events, any adverse effects, renal or hepatic function, and so forth, is recommended for non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants,  26, 27  although anticoagulation tests are not needed. In one study, approximately two thirds of practitioners adhered to recommendations on clinical and blood test (creatinine and hemoglobin) follow-ups.  28 Clinical risk monitoring is important, particularly for bleeding risk management after discharge/prescription of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, and the mAF App allows a practical tool to monitor the patient's clinical risk profile in \"real time\" allowing a dynamic assessment (and reassessment) of patient risks and changes over time. Moreover, the educational programs provided by the mAF App improved atrial fibrillationrelated knowledge and patient's quality of life. Patient anxiety and depression also were attenuated.\n\nContemporary atrial fibrillation clinical guidelines advocate incorporation of patient preferences for treatment and support, as well as patient engagement in management decisions.  21, 29 Nonetheless, patient beliefs and misconceptions about their treatment and atrial fibrillation could affect their ability and willingness to adhere to treatment recommendations.  29 A prior study  *Compared with the patients with usual care, P < .05. The Anti-Clot Treatment Scale was adapted to evaluate the satisfaction of patients with anticoagulant therapy in this Chinese population with atrial fibrillation. The adapted Anti-Clot Treatment Scale included a 15-item questionnaire, comprising 11 burden items and 4 benefit items. For every question, there are 5 item responses: \"1, not at all\" was calculated as 1 points; \"2, a little\" was calculated as 2 points; \"3, moderately\" was calculated as 3 points; \"4, quite a bit\" was calculated as 4 points; and \"5, extremely\" was calculated as 5 points.\n\nhas confirmed that a bespoke education intervention significantly improved anticoagulation control of warfarin.  30 A higher patient education level has been associated with nonvitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant selection.  31 The mAF App provides the specific educational components, in terms of warfarin, non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants, and specific conditions, that may help patients with self-management."

      "title": "Study Limitations",
      "text": "Some limitations of this study need to be addressed. This was a clustered randomized study, and a selection bias could exist; however, the distribution of comorbidities between the mAF App and the usual care arms were not significantly different. Moreover, the clinician's preference for oral anticoagulants may have contributed to a higher rate of non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulant use in the mAF App group. The educational program could have made the patients more aware and thus be more likely to receive non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants. Finally, the impact on the clinical outcomes (stroke, death, bleeds) of the mAF App needs to be ascertained in a long-term prospective study with clinical outcome data, which was not the principal objective of the present study.\n\nDespite these limitations, the present study still shows that the clinical decision support, evidence-based clinical followup, and patients' involvement in self-care can help clinical management for the population with atrial fibrillation, highlighting for the first time an effective Mobile Healthsupport management strategy in such patients."
