  "title": "Feasibility and outcomes from using a commitment device and text message reminders to increase adherence to time-restricted eating: A randomized trial",
  "abstract": "Background Obesity is strongly associated with cardiovascular disease, particularly through its effects on blood pressure. Though maintaining a negative caloric balance leads to weight loss, many patients struggle to adhere to low calorie diets over the long term. Time-restricted eating, a subtype of intermittent fasting (IF), may be an easier dietary pattern for patients to initiate and maintain. We tested the feasibility of a bidirectional texting strategy to help patients with obesity and hypertension initiate and maintain time-restricted eating, and whether a commitment device, a pledge to behave in a certain way in the future while making nonadherence costlier, would increase adherence beyond bidirectional texting. \n Methods Patients with obesity and hypertension seen in cardiology clinics were provided education on time-restricted eating and randomized to a commitment device versus attention control. Attention control consisted of daily bidirectional text messages asking whether patients adhered to IF and weekly text messages asking participants to send their weight and blood pressure. The commitment device involved the same text messages as attention control, plus a commitment contract, setting of implementation intentions with respect to details of time-restricted eating, and involvement of a suppor t par tner who received weekly updates on the participant's adherence to time-restricted eating. The intervention lasted 12 weeks, followed by a 6-week follow-up period. The primary outcome was days per week adherent to time-restricted eating over the 18-week study period, measured by daily self-report. We also compared change from baseline weight and blood pressure between randomized groups.",

Adding a commitment device to bidirectional texting did not increase adherence to time-restricted eating compared with attention control, nor were there significant between group changes in blood pressure or weight, but these comparisons were underpowered. A larger randomized trial of the effect of this scalable intervention, compared with usual care, on blood pressure and weight among patients with obesity and hypertension is warranted.\n\nClinical trials registration clinicaltrials.gov; unique identifier: NCT04836312.

      "text": "Excess body weight is a major risk factor for the development of cardiovascular disease, including coronary ar tery disease, atr ial fibr illation, and stroke.  1  Obesity is a major cause of hypertension: There is a linear association between weight and blood pressure, and studies indicate that weight loss improves blood pressure in most hypertensive individuals.  2 There is strong evidence from randomized controlled trials that reducing dietary intakeregardless of the specific dietary pattern by which this is achieved-leads to weight loss; however, weight is commonly regained as adherence to the caloric restriction declines, and most individuals are unable to maintain weight loss over long-term follow-up.  3 n contrast to dietary approaches that seek to restrict calories and/or change the types of foods eaten, intermittent fasting (IF) is a dietary pattern that emphasizes temporal restriction of caloric intake.  4 The simplest and most popular variation of IF involves restr icting calor ic intake to an 8-hour period each day, and consuming no calories for the other 16 hours (so-called 16:8 timerestricted feeding).  5 In uncontrolled studies, IF is associated with a reduction in systolic blood pressure by 5 to 10 mm Hg and weight by \u223c3 kg  [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]  ; though the 2 largest randomized controlled trials of time-restricted eating reported no significant difference in weight loss compared with caloric restriction over 90-day follow-up.  12 , 13 owever, IF has theoretical advantages over more complex dietary patterns: Changing one's eating patterns to a new diet is a cognitively intense process that requires active consideration of complex information multiple times per day, leading to cognitive overload and impaired decision-making.  [14] [15] 5] [16]  By contrast, IF, especially time-restricted feeding, is cognitively simpler, and some patients report that IF is easier to maintain than other dietary patterns.  17 ommitment devices are instruments, based on concepts from behavioral economic theory,  18 , 19  that can be used to help motivate individuals to initiate and maintain behavior change. They are centered in theoretical research that posits a planner-doer framework, wherein an individual can be conceptualized as dual subselves: The planner, who cares about long-term well-being; and the doer, who cares only for the present and pr ior itizes immediate payoffs.  20 Conflict between the motivations and pr ior ities of the planner and the doer subselves results in failure to follow-through with a plan when the moment to act arrives.  18 Commitment devices are mechanisms by which the planner subself constrains the actions of their future doer subself by making certain choices more costly.  19 When using a commitment device, an individual pledges to behave a certain way in the future while simultaneously making nonadherence to that behavior more costly. For example, an individual seeking to quit smoking may put a sum of money into an account controlled by a friend with a vow that the money will only be returned if they have stopped smoking 6 months later.  21 owever, monetary losses may not be attractive to many people, and commitment devices that impose a psychological penalty for failure to follow through with behavior change (so-called \"soft\" commitment devices) may be more appealing.  19 In this randomized controlled trial enrolling adults with obesity and hypertension, we tested the feasibility of bidirectional texting for the initiation and maintenance of IF, and the effectiveness beyond bidirectional texting of a soft commitment device that leveraged intra-and interpersonal commitments."

The trial protocol (see Supplement) was approved by the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board, and the study was overseen by an independent Safety Officer.

Eligible participants were mailed blood pressure cuffs and scales, which they used to measure blood pressure and weight weekly during the study period and were able to keep at the end of the study. Fasting behavior was self-reported by participants to investiga-tors each day via bidirectional text message, and weight and blood pressure were self-repor ted by par ticipants in weekly bidirectional text messages."

The y then watched a 4-minute educational video about IF, including its definition, potential health benefits, and expectations about the exper ience. The y were specifically instructed on 16:8 time-restricted eating, a variant of IF that involves fasting for 16 consecutive hours out of each 24 and eating during the other 8 hours. They were instructed that during fasting hours, they were allowed to drink water and calorie-free beverages (including black coffee or tea) but were not to consume anything with calor ies; dur ing eating hours, the y had no restr ictions on what or how much they ate. Following education about IF and time-restricted eating, patients were mailed a scale and blood pressure cuff (G.LAB MD2222). Upon receipt of the blood pressure cuff and scale, participants were prompted by automated text message to obtain a baseline weight and blood pressure and report the values by return text. These values served as participants' baseline weight and blood pressure during the study. Participants were then randomized via the Way to Health platform to either a soft commitment device intervention or attention control. Randomization was stratified based on BMI ( \u2264 and > 40 kg/m 2 ) and systolic blood pressure ( \u2264 and > 160 mm Hg on last in-office blood pressure measurement), using blocks of 6 patients.\n\nPatients randomized to attention control ( n = 20) were instructed via text message and email to fast at least 16 hours per day every day. For the next 16 weeks, they received an automated daily text message via the Way to Health platform asking if they had fasted for at least 16 hours over the past 24 hours. If they failed to respond, 2 automated reminder text messages were sent, and if they failed to respond for 3 days, study staff called the patient to check in. Once per week, they received an automated text message asking them to weigh themselves and check their blood pressure, and reply with the results via text message.\n\nPatients randomized to the intervention arm ( n = 17) received a soft commitment device that incorporated several inter-and intrapersonal commitments. First, they identified a support person, a family member or friend to whom they speak regularly and who was invested in their health, to receive weekly updates on their adherence to time-restricted eating. This interpersonal commitment device leveraged the participants' social network, which added external accountability.  27 This component of the commitment device was based on data from studies of patients with obesity and diabetes, in which involvement of social networks have successfully increased physical activity and improved control of weight and blood glucose.  [28] [29] 9] [30] [31]  Participants also made a series of intrapersonal commitments. First, they completed a series of questions intended to create implementation intentions,  32  which have been shown to be useful in helping individuals follow through on completing healthy behaviors.  33 , 34 Specifically, they picked a time for their fast to begin each 24-hour period and a time for their fast to end, and they developed strategies to deal with hunger arising during a fast period. After completing this activity, participants signed a contract pledging to adhere to the 16:8 time-restricted feeding dietary pattern, and acknowledging that their support person will receive a copy of the contract and weekly updates about their adherence to the regimen. This contract was displayed each time they logged into the Way to Health website during the study. For the next 12 weeks, participants received reminder text messages 2 times daily via Way to Health: Once at the start of their fast period and once during the meal that they skipped during the fast period. Each week, par ticipants and their suppor t par tner also received a text message noting how many days in the previous week they successfully fasted for at least 16 hours. As in the attention control arm, once per week, participants received a text message asking them to weigh themselves and check their blood pressure, and reply with the results via text message. After the 12-week intervention, participants in the intervention arm received the same daily and weekly text messages as the attention control arm for an additional 6 weeks.\n\nAt the end of the 18-week study period, all participants were alerted by the Way to Health platform to return to the website to complete an end-of-study questionnaire including validated surveys as well as questions about their experience with time-restricted eating."

For the analyses of adherence to time-restricted eating, data could be missing for any day if the participant did not self-report time-restricted eating status. We assumed days for which patients did not report adherence with daily fasting were nonadherent days, and compared days fasted as a proportion of total follow-up days between attention control and commitment device arms over the 12-week intervention period, the 6-week follow-up period, and the entire 18-week study period using t tests. For analyses of blood pressure and weight, data could be missing for any day if the participant did not self-report weight or blood pressure. We used only collected data, excluding weeks for which a participant did not report weight or blood pressure. Only blood pressures and weights measured by patients at home and reported via text message were used for analysis; in-office values were used only to determine eligibility. To compare change from baseline in blood pressure and weight between arms, we used a linear mixed effects regression models adjusting for each participant's baseline measure, time using calendar month fixed effects, participant random effects, and accounting for repeated measures.

P values were derived from paired t tests.\n\ndomized to both arms, with two-thirds of participants adher ing to time-restr icted eating at least 5 days per week. Over the course of the study period, adherence with time-restricted eating declined in both arms, but the mean patient was adherent to time-restricted eating > 60% of days even at the end of the 18-week study period. Consistent with the similar dietary patterns of study participants in the 2 arms, there was not a significant difference between the 2 arms in change from baseline weight or blood pressure. However, in this diverse population of older adults with multiple cardiovascular comorbidities, time-restricted eating was well-tolerated with no serious adverse events, and the majority of participants intended to continue time-restricted eating after the completion of the study period. Soft commitment devices impose a psychological, rather than financial, penalty for failing to follow through with a behavior change, and therefore may be more attractive than commitment devices involving potential financial losses. In this study, we developed a program by which individuals would face a psychological penalty if they did not adhere to time-restricted eating, holding each individual accountable to his or herself (via a commitment contract, bolstered by the development of implementation intentions and a daily text message reminding them to skip a meal) and to members of their social network (via weekly emails to a social suppor t par tner). These commitments to oneself and members of one's social network have previously been effective in contributing to behavior change.  28-31 , 33 , 34 hough we did not find that this soft commitment device significantly increased adherence to time-restricted eating, participants in the intervention arm had numerically greater adherence over the duration of the study. The trial was powered to detect a 1-day difference in number of days fasted per week, assuming a standard deviation of 1.0. Ultimately, there was greater variability than anticipated in days fasted per week, reducing statistical power to find a difference. In addition, a large proportion of individuals in both arms were highly adherent to time-restricted eating. Moreover, participants in the attention control arm received and were expected to respond to daily text messages, combatting present bias, or the tendency to overvalue immediate rewards and punishments,  39  and diluting the effect of the intervention.\n\nImportantly, this study does demonstrate the feasibility of bidirectional texting to encourage time-restricted eating in a population of older adults with cardiovascular comorbidities for several reasons: (1) There were no significant adverse events related to time-restricted eating in this population of patients with significant cardiovascular comorbidities; (2) Participants successfully selfreported daily time-restricted eating status and weekly blood pressure and weight through text messages; (3) There was substantial interest in study participation, with nearly 15% of potential participants receiving an unsolicited email regarding the study navigating to the study website to learn more, and > 50% of these individuals ultimately participating; and (4) Nearly all participants completed the trial, with more than half reporting continued interest in time-restricted eating.\n\nWith respect to the association between timerestricted eating and changes in weight and blood pressure, it is not surprising that our study failed to find a difference in these metabolic parameters by study arm since there were no significant differences in fasting behavior between arms. We did find a mean 7 mm Hg decrease in blood pressure among all par ticipants from the star t of the study to the end of the study, similar to the decrease from adding a single antihypertensive agent.  40 , 41 Though this change may be explained to some extent by regression to the mean, baseline blood pressures in this study were those captured by patients using the blood pressure cuff mailed to them, and not the clinic-based blood pressures used to determine eligibility for the study. Therefore, patients' baseline blood pressures in this study do not represent a \"peak\" blood pressure, but a more accurate representation of average blood pressure prior to starting time-restricted eating. Though we cannot determine if time-restricted eating caused this decline in blood pressure, it does appear that participants in both arms made lifestyle changes that reduced blood pressure. Though time-restricted eating does not increase weight loss or improve metabolic parameters compared with calor ic restr iction,  12 , 13  it has not been compared with a \"usual care\" control group. Our study suggests that patients with obesity and hypertension are able to adhere to time-restricted eating over inter mediate-ter m followup, and that the majority found it appealing and wanted to continue after the study ended. Time-restricted eating's advantages with respect to simplicity and ease of adherence may offer benefits in a more pragmatic clinical trial setting."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "First, though the trial was appropriately powered for its primary outcome based on a pr ior i assumptions about the likely variance in adherence to IF, the variance was higher in the actual trial, so the trial was underpowered to detect a difference in our primary outcome. Second, this study did not compare time-restricted eating versus a standard dietary pattern, but rather the utility of a soft commitment device to increase adherence to timerestricted eating. Because dietary patterns were so similar between groups, conclusions regarding associations between IF and metabolic parameters are limited; overall, however, participants in both arms had a reduction in blood pressure similar to a single antihypertensive medication. Third, we assumed that any patient who did not repor t whether the y adhered to time-restricted eating on a given day was nonadherent. Though this is the most conservative assumption, it may or may not be true for a given patient. Lastly, though we approached a broad sample of unselected patients with hypertension and obesity seen in cardiovascular clinics, patients that enroll in clinical trials differ from those that do not enroll, and adherence to time-restricted eating may be lower in unselected cohorts of patients with cardiovascular disease."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "A bidirectional texting strategy was feasible for helping patients with obesity and hypertension initiate and adhere to time-restricted eating. Adding a commitment device to bidirectional texting did not increase adherence to time-restricted eating compared with attention control, nor were there significant between group changes in blood pressure or weight, but these comparisons were underpowered. Time-restricted eating was welltolerated, and a majority of patients planned to continue IF after the trial ended. A larger randomized trial of the effect of this scalable intervention, compared with usual care, on blood pressure and weight among patients with obesity and hypertension is warranted."
