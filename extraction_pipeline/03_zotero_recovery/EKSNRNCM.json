  "title": "Effect of Offering Care Management or Online Dialectical Behavior Therapy Skills Training vs Usual Care on Self-harm Among Adult Outpatients With Suicidal Ideation A Randomized Clinical Trial",
  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE People at risk of self-harm or suicidal behavior can be accurately identified, but effective prevention will require effective scalable interventions. OBJECTIVE To compare 2 low-intensity outreach programs with usual care for prevention of suicidal behavior among outpatients who report recent frequent suicidal thoughts. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Pragmatic randomized clinical trial including outpatients reporting frequent suicidal thoughts identified using routine Patient Health Questionnaire depression screening at 4 US integrated health systems. A total of 18 882 patients were randomized between March 2015 and September 2018, and ascertainment of outcomes continued through March 2020. INTERVENTIONS Patients were randomized to a care management intervention (n = 6230) that included systematic outreach and care, a skills training intervention (n = 6227) that introduced 4 dialectical behavior therapy skills (mindfulness, mindfulness of current emotion, opposite action, and paced breathing), or usual care (n = 6187). Interventions, lasting up to 12 months, were delivered primarily through electronic health record online messaging and were intended to supplement ongoing mental health care. \n MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was time to first nonfatal or fatal self-harm. Nonfatal self-harm was ascertained from health system records, and fatal self-harm was ascertained from state mortality data. Secondary outcomes included more severe self-harm (leading to death or hospitalization) and a broader definition of self-harm (selected injuries and poisonings not originally coded as self-harm). RESULTS A total of 18 644 patients (9009 [48%] aged 45 years or older; 12 543 [67%] female; 9222 [50%] from mental health specialty clinics and the remainder from primary care) contributed at least 1 day of follow-up data and were included in analyses. Thirty-one percent of participants offered care management and 39% offered skills training actively engaged in intervention programs. A total of 540 participants had a self-harm event (including 45 deaths attributed to self-harm and 495 nonfatal self-harm events) over 18 months following randomization: 172 (3.27%) in care management, 206 (3.92%) in skills training, and 162 (3.27%) in usual care. Risk of fatal or nonfatal self-harm over 18 months did not differ significantly between the care management and usual care groups (hazard ratio [HR], 1.07; 97.5% CI, 0.84-1.37) but was significantly higher in the skills training group than in usual care (HR, 1.29; 97.5% CI, 1.02-1.64). For severe self-harm, care management vs usual care had an HR of 1.03 (97.5% CI, 0.71-1.51); skills training vs usual care had an HR of 1.34 (97.5% CI, 0.94-1.91). For the broader self-harm definition, care management vs usual care had an HR of 1.10 (97.5% CI, 0.92-1.33); skills training vs usual care had an HR of 1.17 (97.5% CI, 0.97-1.41). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Among adult outpatients with frequent suicidal ideation, offering care management did not significantly reduce risk of self-harm, and offering brief dialectical behavior therapy skills training significantly increased risk of self-harm, compared with usual care. These findings do not support implementation of the programs tested in this study.",

The Joint Commission 5 and the National Action Alliance for Suicide Prevention 6 have recommended systematic identification of suicide risk among people receiving mental health care.\n\nPrevention of suicidal behavior will require effective interventions scalable to the large population of people at risk. Structured psychotherapies such as dialectical behavior therapy (DBT)  7, 8  and cognitive behavior therapy  9  have reduced suicide attempts in people accepting treatment after recent self-harm or hospitalization. Collaborative care and care management interventions may be associated with improved treatment adherence and symptom outcomes in people initiating treatment for specific mood and anxiety disorders.  10 However, these effective clinical interventions have not been tested in broader populations, including those less likely to seek or accept treatment. Interventions limited to recent survivors of suicide attempt or others at highest risk cannot reach most people who attempt or die by suicide.  1, 2 Broad population-based suicide prevention programs are supported by before-after comparisons  11, 12  but not by randomized trials. Early trials found that caring contacts or brief supportive outreach reduced risk of suicide attempt among people refusing or discontinuing followup care after a crisis,  13  but subsequent trials have yielded mixed results.  14, 15 his pragmatic randomized trial evaluated whether either of 2 low-intensity outreach programs, incorporating selected elements of effective clinical interventions, could reduce risk of self-harm or suicidal behavior across the population of outpatients reporting frequent suicidal ideation on routine depression questionnaires."

Between March 2015 and September 2018, adults reporting thoughts of death or self-harm \"more than half the days\" or \"nearly every day\" during the past 2 weeks (ie, score of 2 or 3 on item 9) were identified from EHR data and enrolled in the trial, subject to the following exclusion criteria: not currently insured by the health system, no prior use of EHR patient portal messaging, recorded diagnosis of dementia or developmental disability, or an EHR indicator of needing an interpreter. Previous research in these health systems found that approximately 6% of completed PHQ-9 questionnaires had scores of 2 or 3 on item 9, 3 and approximately 65% of those patients used EHR portal messaging.  20 Data regarding established predictors of self-harm, 4 including sex, age, race and ethnicity, prior mental health diagnoses, and prior mental health service use, were extracted from health system records. Race and ethnicity in health system records were reported by patients at the time of outpatient visits using standard categories for race (American Indian, Asian, Black, Native Hawaiian or Other Pacific Islander, White) and ethnicity (Hispanic or non-Hispanic)."

      "text": "Both interventions began with a series of invitation messages from a study clinician. Initial invitations were sent through the EHR patient portal,  20, 23  followed by reminder messages and/or telephone calls for those not responding (see eAppendix 2 in Supplement 2 for details). Each invitation included a brief message of support based on caring message interventions,  13, 24, 25  a description of the extra services offered, and abbreviated informed consent information (notification that extra services were part of research and that patients could decline or withdraw at any time). Those not responding to the initial invitation received up to 2 additional cycles of invitation and reminder (including caring message content) 4 and 8 weeks later. Those who actively declined or did not respond to 3 cycles of invitation were not contacted again but could accept extra services for up to 12 months. Those accepting the invitation received specific additional services as described below.\n\nThe care management intervention, modeled after collaborative care programs  26  and the Henry Ford Health System Perfect Depression Care program,  11  included regular outreach for assessment of suicide risk using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS),  27  leading to guidelinebased recommendations regarding outpatient follow-up. Intervals between outreach contacts varied according to C-SSRS risk level at last contact, ranging from 1 week or less for participants reporting suicidal intent with a specific plan to 2 months or more for participants reporting no recent suicidal ideation. Care managers' follow-up messages included both motivational enhancement and care navigation to promote recommended outpatient care. Care managers regularly communicated risk assessment results and follow-up recommendations to treating outpatient clinicians who were responsible for all decisions regarding specific treatments. Study care managers were master's degree-level mental health clinicians who received 14 hours of interventionspecific training followed by twice-monthly supervision teleconferences with investigators.\n\nThe skills training program, drawing from skills training in traditional DBT, 7,28 included an interactive online program supported by a skills coach. The online program included video instruction introducing and demonstrating 4 specific DBT skills: mindfulness, mindfulness of current emotion, opposite action, and paced breathing. Skills coaches did not provide psychotherapy but sent EHR portal messages to reinforce each visit to the online program and encourage practice of specific skills as well as outreach messages to participants without recent visits. Frequency of outreach depended on each participant's level of involvement but was at least monthly during the initial 6 months. All skills coaches had completed mental health bachelor's degree coursework and received 14 hours of initial interventionspecific training followed by twice-monthly supervision teleconferences with investigators.\n\nBoth outreach programs were supplements to usual care, and participants assigned to either intervention group were free to receive any nonstudy mental health or general medical services normally available. Intervention services were offered for up to 12 months after randomization. Addi-tional details regarding both intervention programs are described elsewhere,  16  and detailed intervention manuals are available at  https://www.github.com/MHResearchNetwork/  SPOT_Study . People with lived experience of suicidal ideation and suicide attempts collaborated in design of invitation materials, outreach messages, and content of the online skills training program.\n\nParticipants randomized to continued usual care were not contacted by study staff and were free to receive any nonstudy mental health or general medical services normally available. Standard care in each participating health system included routine use of the PHQ-9 at mental health visits, routine use of structured risk assessments (typically including the C-SSRS), creation of safety plans for those at high risk, and psychotherapy or pharmacotherapy to address specific mental health diagnoses."

The care management and skills training groups were not directly compared. Kaplan-Meier curves were plotted and times to first fatal or nonfatal self-harm were compared by Cox proportional hazards regression with adjustment for sex, age group, race and ethnicity, baseline PHQ-9 item 9 score, study site, and year of randomization. The proportionality assumption was tested by examination of log-log plots. Alternative analyses used log-rank tests,  29, 30  stratifying for study site and PHQ-9 item 9 score at randomization. Follow-up time was censored at disenrollment from the health system (when insurance claims data to ascertain nonfatal self-harm would be missing) or death from causes other than self-harm.\n\nSecondary outcome analyses included comparison of the intervention groups with usual care using narrower and broader definitions of self-harm events by proportional hazards regression, description of uptake and adherence for each of the intervention programs, and comparison of intervention groups with usual care in use of nonstudy mental health care. Monthly utilization was modeled as a function of time using generalized estimating equations. Twelve-month utilization was calculated by summing coefficient estimates; the Delta method was used to calculate standard errors. A t statistic was used to compare 12-month utilization in each of the intervention groups vs usual care.\n\nAdditional post hoc analyses included subgroup analyses of primary outcome comparisons with testing for interaction effects, comparison of participant baseline characteristics across different levels of intervention program participation, and comparison of self-harm rates across different levels of intervention program participation.\n\nGiven the potential for type I error due to multiple comparisons, secondary analyses and post hoc analyses are exploratory.\n\nAnalyses were performed using Stata version 15.1 (StataCorp)."

That attenuation could explain the null finding regarding care management but would not explain the significantly higher rate of self-harm in the skills training group.\n\nBetween 30% and 40% of people invited actively engaged in either intervention, consistent with pilot testing of similar outreach interventions.  31 These participation rates are lower than seen in traditional clinical trials, 7,9,32 reflecting expected participation when offered under everyday practice conditions and 0.030 0.035 0.025 0.020 0.015 0.010 0.005 0.05 0.04 0.03 0.02 0.25 0.20 0.15 1.2 1.0 0.8 0.6 0.4 Visits per person per month, mean Months following randomization Mental health specialty outpatient visits A Skills training Care management Usual care 1 3 6 9 12 0.10 Visits per person per month, mean Months following randomization Primary care outpatient visits with mental health diagnoses B 1 3 6 9 12 0.01 Visits per person per month, mean Months following randomization Emergency department visits with mental health diagnoses C 1 3 6 9 12 Admissions per person per month, mean Months following randomization Inpatient admissions with mental health diagnoses D 1 3 6 9 12\n\nThe panels show adjusted mean number of visits or admissions per month, with error bars indicating 97.5% CIs, according to initial randomization. Monthly utilization was modeled as a function of time using generalized estimating equations.\n\nTwelve-month utilization was calculated by summing coefficient estimates; the Delta method was used to calculate standard errors. A t statistic was used to compare 12-month utilization in each of the intervention groups with usual care. Mean visits/admissions per person over 12 months were as follows: for mental health specialty outpatient visits (panel A), 7.50 (97.5% CI, 7.05-7.96; P = .63 vs usual care) for care management, 7.65 (97.5% CI, 7.65-8.1; P = .88 vs usual care) for skills training, and 7.62 (97.5% CI, 7.15-8.08) for usual care; for primary care outpatient visits with mental health diagnoses (panel B), 1.35 (97.5% CI, 1.23-1.46; P = .22 vs usual care) for care management, 1.41 (97.5% CI, 1.29-1.52; P = .65 vs usual care) for skills training, and 1.44 (97.5% CI, 1.31-1.57) for usual care; for emergency department visits with mental health diagnoses (panel C), 0.31 (97.5% CI, 0.27-0.35; P = .15 vs usual care) for care management, 0.33 (97.5% CI, 0.28-0.39; P = .02 vs usual care) for skills training; and 0.28 (97.5% CI, 0.24-0.32) for usual care; and for inpatient admissions with mental health diagnoses (panel D), 0.19 (97.5% CI, 0.16-0.21; P = .09 vs usual care) for care management, 0.19 (97.5% CI, 0.16-0.21; P = .05 vs usual care) for skills training, and 0.17 (97.5% CI, 0.14-0.19) for usual care.\n\nsupported by modest outreach. Consequently, trial results reflect expected outcomes across the full spectrum of patients reporting recent suicidal ideation, including those unlikely to accept extra services. All participants randomized to either of the outreach programs received a series of outreach messages, including expressions of caring and support, an intervention found effective in some previous trials.  13, 24, 25 Outcomes among patients accepting or remaining engaged in interventions cannot be compared with outcomes in the entire usual care group, since it is not possible to identify usual care patients who would have accepted or remained engaged in interventions. These findings do not imply that mental health or primary care clinicians should ignore patients' reports of suicidal ideation. For each participant in this trial, treating health system clinicians were aware of suicidal ideation and were expected to both conduct additional assessment and arrange appropriate ongoing care. These findings indicate that neither intervention program reduced risk of self-harm when added to usual care in these health systems.\n\nThese findings contrast with previous research supporting the effectiveness of caring message interventions,  13, 24, 25  traditional DBT programs, 7,8,32 and care management or collaborative care interventions.  10, 33 Those contrasts could reflect differences in study populations, intervention content, and intervention delivery.\n\nParticipants in this trial represented a wider range of risk and willingness to accept suicide prevention services compared with populations in other studies. While the 4% rate of self-harm in this sample was higher than expected in the general population (estimated at 0.25% 2 ), it was markedly lower than the rates of 40% to 50% in previous DBT trials.  7, 8, 32 Participants in this trial did not consent in advance to any specific treatment, and only 30% to 40% actively participated in the extra services offered.\n\nThe intervention content and caring message outreach tested in this trial included expressions of caring and support modeled after effective interventions.  13, 24, 25 Messages in this trial, however, also included specific requests to engage in extra services. Those requests may have interfered with any benefit of caring messages.\n\nThe care management intervention tested in this trial was a low-intensity program delivered by online messaging with rare telephone contact and no in-person visits. In contrast to effective collaborative care interventions, 10,33 this intervention did not focus on improving a specific pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy. More intensive outreach or more focused care navigation to increase access to and engagement in treatment could reduce risk of self-harm, but additional research is needed to address that question.\n\nIn this study, online DBT skills training was associated with increased risk of self-harm, in contrast with previous randomized trials that supported the effectiveness of traditional DBT.  7, 8, 32 The skills training intervention offered in this trial differed from traditional DBT in several ways, including limitation to 4 specific skills presented in brief online format, no in-person visits or group therapy, and support limited to reminder and encouragement methods delivered via the EHR patient portal. Alternative approaches will be needed to de-liver DBT to the large numbers of people at risk of self-harm or suicidal behavior. This pragmatic trial design cannot identify specific reasons for increased risk of self-harm in those offered skills training. Post hoc analyses found increased risk in those who only briefly engaged in either intervention (eFigure 2 in Supplement 2), suggesting that some patients may have been dissatisfied with these limited interventions and become more discouraged.\n\nThese findings do not argue against systematic efforts to identify and address suicide risk in health care settings. Instead, they indicate that the low-intensity adaptations of care management and DBT skills training tested in this trial have no benefit over usual care in these health systems, especially when offered to the broad population reporting frequent suicidal ideation."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "This study has several limitations. First, health system records could not identify self-harm events if patients did not seek care or if clinicians did not recognize or record self-harm intent. Second, use of those records to identify self-harm could introduce bias if interventions influenced either likelihood of seeking care following self-harm or likelihood that self-harm intent would be detected. Regarding the first possibility, secondary analyses examined self-harm events leading to death or hospitalization, for which seeking care would be less discretionary. Results were qualitatively similar to primary analyses. Regarding the second possibility, secondary analyses examined all injuries or poisonings representing plausible mechanisms of self-harm, regardless of diagnosed intent. Results were similar, with some attenuation of the increased risk in the skills training group. Third, some injuries and poisonings coded as self-harm or identified by chart review may not reflect suicidal intent but instead indicate nonsuicidal self-injury. Fourth, these findings might not apply to other patient populations or health systems. Although this study sample included large numbers of patients insured by Medicaid and large numbers from traditionally underserved racial or ethnic groups, the majority were non-Hispanic White and covered by employersponsored insurance. All participants had access to primary care and specialty mental health services, and participants were identified because these health systems routinely assess symptoms of depression and suicidal ideation. Fifth, sample size calculations were based on consultation with leaders of these health systems regarding meaningful differences in risk of self-harm, and other health system leaders or policy makers might use higher or lower thresholds."
