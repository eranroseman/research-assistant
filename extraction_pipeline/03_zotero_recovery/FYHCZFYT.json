  "title": "Persuasive Technologies and Social Interactions in Professional Environments: Embedded Qualitative Case Study",
  "abstract": "Background: Although previous studies have highlighted the impact of interactions on the web in the context of patient-health care professional (HCP) dyads, this paper extends that context to a triad that includes the role of employers and associated settings with social groups. Objective: This study aims to evaluate how the interactions between individuals and the social use of the platform affect individuals' use of persuasive technology and, in turn, their work environment actions and responses, by implementing a persuasive technology health and wellness platform in a work environment. Methods: For 8 months, we deployed a persuasive technology platform with different combinations of health-related features and content in 1 embedded case design with 8 fire stations for a small Canadian city (total number of participant firefighters, n=141) assigned to 1 of 2 treatments-interactive or static webpages. We used text-based content analysis techniques for outcome measures, drawn from a total of 29 participant exit interviews. In addition, medical assessments were conducted at baseline, midpoint, and end point by 7 HCPs and 1 researcher (BM), who also served as the data steward and managed the study. \n Results: Our results reveal that group, social, and work influences introduce new elements to the use of persuasive technology, which interact to foster higher levels of individual success. The platform in our study served as part of a larger social system, providing information that facilitated new behaviors at work and home. The 8-month group programs centered on exercise, nutrition, and smoking cessation. Groups of participants coached by certified professionals showed significant increases in sodium awareness, levels of actual exercise, and consistency of activities. As a result of the study, of 141 people, 15 (10.6%) were notified of serious medical health issues and 29 (20.6%) underwent blood work assessments and a privacy shield (protected by federal law) was enacted to protect employees from losing their employment based on any health concerns disclosed. \n Conclusions: The persuasive technology platform, in combination with self-management and professional management and social interactions, significantly altered work management behaviors. Interactions among individual outcomes, group influences, and social situations strongly influenced individuals' behaviors in their work and home environments. Three things further improved the positive results that we observed: privacy shields (which allowed employees to reveal health concerns without fear of professional consequences), individual private activities aligned with group activities, and integration between HCP work with localized, organizational work roles.",

      "title": "Background",
      "text": "A wide array of health initiatives rely on the use of information technology to improve health outcomes  [1] [2] [3] [4] . One area where these technologies show continued promise is facilitating self-monitoring and feedback at work and home with the use of social systems.\n\nAlthough individual use of persuasive technology platforms has been extensively explored in a health care setting and well summarized in a recent exemplar study  [1] , far less is known about the use of persuasive technology (1) within a broader work context and (2) in integration with social and professional medical care teams  [1, [5] [6] [7] [8] .\n\nPersuasive systems and technologies are generally designed to aid and motivate people to adopt good behaviors  [5] , while avoiding behaviors that are detrimental to themselves or their community  [6] . Other related work can be seen in a recent literature review  [9]  where many define persuasive systems and technologies as the set of \"information technology systems and services developed to change [these] users' attitudes and behaviours or both\"  [10]  for people to use better in organizations. In order for persuasive technology  [9]  to be most effective and foster healthy lifestyles, users must be in the right mood, time, and place to receive feedback  [11] .\n\nIn outlining underlying principles of their framework for designing persuasive systems, Oinas-Kukkonen and Harjumaa  [10]  introduced a social component, as well as individual use elements that organizations implement in practice. Similar to Oinas-Kukkonen and Harjumaa  [10] , we suggest that groups and social interactions play a key role in creating this ideal context for persuasive systems within work practices  [12, 13] .\n\nHowever, research continues and still focuses mainly on the individual  [1] . Accordingly, we aim to address this gap in the literature by expanding the underexplored social aspect of persuasive technology. To do so, we rely on social cognitive theory  [14, 15]  and a sociotechnical perspective to discuss the interconnections between social and technical aspects of improving users' health with persuasive technology in organizational practice  [11, 16] .\n\nA recent publication with experiences from the field of practice  [17]  notes that people generally perceive benefits and costs when setting specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound (SMART) goals in the context of home, work, and social influences. People equate individual level with better health outcomes, where some goals get aligned, and some goals do not. According to Burton-Jones and Grange  [18] , using a tool or system effectively requires cycling through the concepts of actions, consequences, disturbances, perceptions, goals, comparisons, and feedback, which is consistent with SMART goals; however, it provides more concepts in the iterations to help explain different patterns  [19] .\n\nPrevious research has primarily considered dyads of technology-mediated interactions within practice settings between patients and health care professionals (HCPs)  [1] . There are other relevant interactions at play beyond the traditional patient-HCP dyad, notably when a platform is introduced within work environments. In such a context, the patient is interacting not only with HCPs but also with a range of other stakeholders, including insurers, supervisors, colleagues, family, friends, and mentors, where, arguably, platform use can influence all these interactions. We know that information technology can change how people interact at work  [20] , and when everyone in a work environment can access the same persuasive technology platform  [9] , it can generate conversations beyond the traditional dyads. The influence of these interactions can either reinforce or discourage system use in practice. We anticipate that these work-related factors will be especially salient when good health is an employment requirement."

      "title": "Setting",
      "text": "A prime example of a work environment that prioritizes good health is a fire station, which is a practical setting. We use this environment as our research setting for several reasons. First, firefighting requires good physical and mental health, and one might assume that firefighters are generally in excellent health to meet these demands of the work. Firefighters' individual perceptions of benefits and effective use are well described in the literature  [18] . However, cardiac deaths account for the largest proportion of deaths of firefighters each year  [21] , and rates of mental health problems are elevated for Canadian firefighters  [22] . Moreover, although fitness and wellness standards have been recommended, only 30% of the US fire departments implement programs targeting these standards. Within a Canadian context, firefighters have higher than average body strength but are comparable with the general population in terms of aerobic capacity  [23] . As such, firefighters would likely benefit significantly from using a health platform to improve their aerobic capacity. Perhaps most startling is the fact that firefighters have a 50% chance of developing cancer in their lifetime, possibly because of compounds within the smoke they breathe  [19] . Thus, within these work environments, there is a strong need to focus on wellness that is integrated with medical care, family, work, and social systems, which we do in this paper."

      "text": "We collected data using an embedded qualitative case study design. The embedded case study facilitates the simultaneous consideration for multiple subunits of analysis, which for our purposes were the individual, group, and organizational. Specifically, we considered 8 fire station organizations, each composed of groups and individuals. Stations were randomly assigned to 2 treatment groups of either interactive webpages or static webpages  [24, 25] . Data consisted of document review and interview data presented with quotes  [24, 25] . We gained participation from 94.6% (141/149) of the firefighters.\n\nFirefighters from a small Canadian city were selected because, in an initial meeting, they confirmed their need for increased physical activity and general health improvements, would participate in the study, and would help tailor content to their firefighter terminology; these met our selection criteria. Participation in the study required completion of wellness interventions at various points, willingness to use the platform, and openness to exploring collaborative relationships between leaders (eg, fire chiefs, human resource (HR) managers, union representatives, and mentors) and workers using the persuasive technology platform."

Fire stations received different combinations of nutrition, exercise, lifestyle, and medical goal-setting and advice on the persuasive technology platform over the 8-month study period.

      "title": "Timeline and Procedures",
      "text": "The entire study period of 8 months was divided as follows. First, the phase I setup took 4 months, and phase II rollout proceeded over 4 months. It was followed by a maintenance (phase III) for 2 years after the study. As shown in Figure  1 , the phase I setup had adaptable planning and approval for clinical practice guidelines that occurred in training and rehearsal of the framework proposed by Oinas-Kukkonen and Harjumaa  [10] . The nature of firefighters' tasks allowed us to apply the design principles identified by Oinas-Kukkonen and Harjumaa  [10]  to the professionals' tasks in professional roles, which included HCPs, organizational HR professional, firefighters' health expert, firefighters exercise expert, privacy officer, and stop smoking expert. The reduction of concepts (principle 1) fit because professional judgments were reduced to key points and directions based on pretesting, then the tunneling of points was strengthened to focus on ignoring other messages and tunneling to messages that professionals gave (principle 2), and the tailoring (principle 3) and personalization (principle 4) of messages for patients allowed professionals the freedom to be responsible for their decisions, to adapt the content and to create draft program page or pages, documents for weekly issue management, and frequently asked question help sheets in development  [10] . The research team participated in pretesting of instruments in a formal rehearsal and reviewed the stations assigned to experimental study combinations. The kickoff event for firefighters and HCPs had a 94.6% (141/149 firefighters participated) participation rate and engaged all participants from all 8 fire stations to follow at least one of the persuasive technology platform activities.\n\nMedical assessments generally involved the physician overseeing the nurse capturing medical baselines for all participants, the other HCPs interacting with the firefighters, and the technology team (3/8, 38% to 3/15, 20%) answering questions and getting firefighters signed into their platform accounts.\n\nTo conduct the study, in addition to recruiting research participants, we recruited a 25-to 36-person study team that included 7 HCPs: 1 emergency room physician, 1 heart program nurse, 2 dietitians, 2 certified personal trainers, and 1 lifestyle mentor. Some of the other professional roles on the study team fell under an organization team (N=10-14), which included 1 union representative, 1 HR representative, and 8 to 12 organizational governance authorities, depending on the volume of activities with firefighters. The study team further included   E ,  F ,  G , and  H ). In the interactive rollout, goals followed the SMART guidelines (ie, they were specific, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound)  [22]  that were designed to increase behavior change for both individuals and groups. Nutrition information was based on either the reduced-sodium Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet for hypertension  [26] [27] [28]  or the Canada Food Guide. The DASH diet is popular for sodium awareness given by the dietitian and heart disease advice given by the nurse. The static basic pages had general messages to stay healthy and eat well. Figure  2  illustrates the order of activities in the study. All participants (N=141 at the beginning of the study and N=110 at the end of the study, using the webpages) were also offered possible group goals for group exercise step challenges, group exercise bike challenges, general nutrition (eg, reducing sugary drink intake), group sodium awareness, dietitian-recommended meal plans, weight management, and smoking cessation programs. The HCPs and organizational professionals helped firefighters establish overall group goal targets and group weekly wellness tasks via ongoing monitoring and blogging on webpages."

      "title": "Analysis Framework",
      "text": "We used qualitative case-based analysis  [24, 25] , which included simple tallies in addition to thematic analysis. The data analysis generated evidence about complex interactions among individuals, groups, and work and social settings alongside HCPs, systems experts, and health measures using fun activities.\n\nThematic coding was implemented using NVivo software (QSR International)  [29]  to develop themes and identify patterns. The qualitative analysis involved multiple iterations of coding and comparing and compiling results. We created tallies and tables to demonstrate changes. Coding was done by 1 systems researcher and then checked by the technology and organization teams.\n\nUltimately, we compiled transcribed notes, compared patterns, and determined how many participants had succeeded (or failed) in reaching goals. We used the 11 factors identified by Orji and Moffatt  [6]  in their persuasive technology classification and analysis coding scheme to structure analysis, as shown in Table  2 . Other persuasive technology studies presented these types of evidence. Given that this research study relied on health assessments (taken by health professionals) and interview data from participants, we used appropriate methods to analyze the data, notably the qualitative data  [30] . Specifically, we used analytic induction, reflexivity, triangulation, and member checks to convey aspects of trustworthiness of the research in terms of dependability, credibility, confirmability, and transferability as ways to assess the quality of qualitative research  [31] . As shown in Figure  3 , the dependability of the study is based on the logical, traceable, and documented nature of the embedded case design. The credibility of the research is based on using a multidisciplinary research team, drawing on multiple data sources and methods to triangulate the findings, while reaching theoretical saturation for our key themes. We also used member checks with participants to reflect our interpretations of the situation and whether they were reasonable assessments of what happened. The conformability is an indication of the link between the findings and interpretations to the data, which we have synthesized in Tables  3 4 5 6 , whereby researcher reflexivity was used to identify themes and relationships among the themes and demonstrate better design principles and practices in persuasive systems and technology, adding to a growing body of related work. The transferability is illustrated by demonstrating similarities and differences between this study and previous work and theoretical and practical contributions made. Table  3 .

For example, it cannot be considered a positive move if someone stops smoking at work only to take up drinking to manage the stress of quitting cigarettes. Thus, we sought to capture combinations that accounted for such possibilities. In order to convey those fast and flexible combinations, we mapped the 28 design principles identified by Oinas-Kukkonen and Harjumaa  [10]  onto our constructs, as shown in Tables  3 4 5 6 .\n\nAmong these various user journeys, several achieved better patterns using interactive webpages but also showed that integrated change compared with the design principles needs to be made carefully with much adaptability to local situations (N=141 at the beginning of the study and N=110 at the end of the study, using the webpages). Qualitative case evidence shown in Tables 3-6 provide data to support these claims that demonstrate the better practices seen under interactive webpages (ie, stations A, B, C, and D), which were absent when compared with patterns under static webpages (ie, stations E, F, G, and H). The evidence data are exemplars of better design principles; they are not exhaustive. Overall, our results showed that systems and platforms yield far better results when integrated with support from society, families, colleagues, social settings, and organizations, which begins some evidence of this integration.\n\nIn the user journeys, evaluation of platform use patterns (along the principles described in Tables  3 4 5 6 ) are presented along with outcome evaluations by professionals. All evaluations were performed on a none, poor, fair, good, great, or excellent scale.

      "text": "One person that the persuasive technology platform helped was Tom, a firefighter in his mid-40s, paid by the city, who had been dealing with some physical ailments that created challenges with exercise. Tom was a prime example of a user who set vague wellness objectives, not as specific as other firefighters who set SMART goals and who achieved higher outcomes. Tom had high computer skills but did not push himself very hard to improve. Sleep apnea was preventing him from getting the proper rest he needed to fuel his 2-job lifestyle (he had a second job in construction on weekends). Time was also a barrier for exercise; however, he remained active at least three days a week. Tom used his pedometer to diligently track and record his own steps, deliberately challenging himself. He watched the group challenge, without actively participating, by logging in to the system as a spectator but was hesitant to join the actual activities. Tom needed new orthotics, and to him, that was a substantial barrier to lower body training and his exercise goal of gaining muscle; this made it impossible for him to track strength training efforts. Because exercise caused joint discomfort, he only walked each day, missing much of the moderate exercise asked of him. He reviewed program software pages and read educational material but did not engage much further when others began to adopt new behaviors. Tom zeroed in on general nutrition information in the software and got a push in the right direction, managing to lose 10 lbs. The biggest barriers for Tom were lack of time and complex physical and medical barriers. Orthotics were ordered in the hope that this would address his lack of exercise at the moderate levels asked by the HCPs.\n\nWe coded the user journey of Tom as poor according to the primary task support principles (principles 1 to 7) identified by Oinas-Kukkonen and Harjumaa  [10]  because he did not reduce the concepts well, had little pathway tunneling, had little tailoring (general vague wellness objectives, not specific as SMART goals suggest), had little personalization (focused on broader, general program pages), had some self-monitoring for his own steps but little else (eg, step challenge, sodium reduction, and strength exercises), had no simulation or trying new things, and had little rehearsal with others in the group  [10] . Hence, overall, Tom underperformed, even though any positive change could be viewed as a success and was celebrated with him, when comparing across patterns, he missed these many behaviors that others adopted to reach higher or better outcomes as seen in the next journeys."

These emergent groups could then challenge other groups and join other groups.\n\nSimilar to many other participants, Harvey had a great general nutrition and exercise regime, wanted to get blood work done, and addressed a previous high cholesterol issue. His nutrition had improved before the program when a family member discovered they were hypertensive and was maintained in the average range throughout the program. He was concerned about family wellness and lack of time.\n\nHarvey followed the bike challenge by monitoring the group results on the program page but did not participate. However, he reported not being able to find his medical results, which were on the same program page. Harvey was also looking for additional ways to destress. He had a good grasp on his balanced lifestyle but wanted new ways to incrementally improve his approach. He achieved this by making a small shift in his nutrition, exercise, and sodium awareness, hence leading to minor improvements. He confirmed that his cholesterol levels had shifted within the normal range. We coded the user journey of Harvey overall as fair according to the primary task support principles (principles 1 to 7) around broader, general wellness goals identified by Oinas-Kukkonen and Harjumaa  [10]  because he was only watching the social activities, not participating in or performing the other behaviors, which was principle 22 (social learning), and was mostly not well engaged in activities such as the others were."

Allen did the many group activities described here, as the exemplar excellent group participant. He liked to access HCPs' chats and blogs, which were well received (Table  5 ; principles expertise and surface credibility). The group challenges were appreciated because they delivered integrated engaging social, group pages, while allowing individualized medical advice to be seen only on individual private screens (Table  3 , primary task [all]; Table  4 , rewards; Table  5 , real-world feel, not a demo; and Table  6 , normative influence and recognition). The personalized individual timing (Table  3 ; personalization) kept pace with public and fun group activities (Table  3 ; tailoring)  [9] .\n\nThe overall results reveal an immediate change in shopping behaviors and a 73% change in sodium awareness (N=29), as well as a 59% change in overall nutrition awareness which Allen achieved. Actual nutrition intake improved by 22% on average (N=29 interviewed of 94.6% (141/149) using webpages at the beginning and 73.8% (110/149) using webpages at the end. We purposely combined individual, group, and social concepts that fit the setting to capture the complex work and home interactions that existed.\n\nThe program further motivated firefighters such as Allen with a fun kickoff event game called guess the salt, which included access to content and features on the persuasive technology platform through direct knowledge from experts and appealing interactive pages. This approach was used to manage the user patterns systematically without too much drill-down that becomes fatiguing for HCPs. The firefighters indicated in the final interviews (N=29) that the game's well-designed graphics helped them change their behaviors and achieve their excellent results. After the kickoff event, the program in parallel conducted tailored and personalized baseline assessments for individuals (Table  3 ; tailoring and personalization)  [33, 34]  in a private setting close to work activities (N=141 at the beginning of the study and N=110 at the end of the study, using the webpages). This approach helped employees, employers, and professionals improve more easily  [7, 9] .\n\nGroup programs  [35]  were offered around achievable social challenges  [3, 14, 16]  chosen by firefighters such as Allen, who showed excellent platform use patterns (eg, exercise, nutrition, sodium awareness, and smoking cessation and led by certified professionals). These groups combined two or more people in to (1) engage the power of group check-in and persuasion, (2) identify a wellness challenge goal or objective that all group members wanted to meet  [32] [33] [34] 36] , and (3) pick specific measures  [33, 36]  that participants could record on paper and in the persuasive technology platform, which was then converted into the shared effort on the platform.\n\nThe program also had weekly behaviors  [35]  that firefighters, including Allen, recorded for weekly group results charting, chatting between people or leader competitions. It set end points 6-8 weeks from the start to give closure and motivation. End celebrations  [36]  included digital rewards or physical prizes from the organization. The maintenance phase III continued for 2 years to identify sustainable behaviors for life  [10, 17]  beyond the typical 2-month falling-off point when participants stop good behaviors and go back to their starting point. In parallel and in an integrated manner, the program managed professional oversight dashboards  [6]  to deliver program information  [5]  and identify when an intervention was needed to the few exceptions by the professionals' known patterns of participation.\n\nGroup nutrition behaviors were shaped by program design options such as the fun sodium and nutrition challenges, which involved all of the participants attending a dietitian-led interactive sodium awareness lecture that Allen enjoyed (N=149), followed by discussion, label reading introduction, and 2 months with features on the persuasive technology platform (N=141 at the beginning of the study and N=110 at the end of the study, using the webpages). The dietitians advised compliance with the Canada Food Guide (69/141, 48.9%) and Dietary Approach to Stop Hypertension low-sodium diet (72/141, 51.1%; numbers provided by a dietitian) with identified actionable behaviors such as your next trip to the grocery store and immediate ways to remove unwanted sodium.\n\nIn general, group exercise awareness increased by 55% (average 5.5/10 ratings for 19/29, 63%), and the most frequent comment from participants such as Allen was that they were \"more consistent in filling the periods of inactivity with exercise\" (quote from the interview). Among those who participated in the group step and bike challenges, 65% (19/29) of the individuals reported results from their participation  [23] .\n\nWe observed evidence of exercise avoidance among the moderate to low exercisers who did investigate exercise and nutrition information via the platform but did not push themselves hard or consistently. We defined low to moderate exercisers as those who exercised, on average, 3 days a week, for 1.10 hours at a time, at a 4.46 intensity level (lower), and within more general workouts. These are much lower than the intense exercisers, who we defined as those who exercised, on average, 4.23 days per week, for 1.09 hours at a time, and at a 7.32 intensity level (high). Our findings suggest that persuasive technology platforms should offer a wide variety of choices to sway moderate to low exercisers."

The persuasive technology wellness challenge was licensed at approximately CAD $12,000 (US $9480) in the first year to operate the challenge and avoided CAD $17,613 (US $13,914.27) in other general wellness and disease costs for this small municipal local government organization.

We suggest that a repeatable persuasive technology platform with sustainable programs, deployed in an organizational work setting, produced these combined health improvements. The platform changed work behaviors, which station mentors observed as higher numbers of participants discussing exercise around the stations and asking more specific wellness questions. Work discussions with friends, coworkers, and HCPs increased greatly but had to fit within the organizational workplace certification requirements and be adapted to meet union guidelines. In some settings, peer and supervisor influences can prevent technology use if they do not like that technology. Given that firefighters eat together while on the job, there was much discussion with dietitians about how to change station group meals. Firefighters developed a stronger understanding of their own health through talking directly to dietitians at work.\n\nThe studied organizational work environment-such as any work environment-was not neutral, and this hindered participation. There was a level of distrust between the employer and employees in this organization and certain information that employees did not want shared with their employer. The smoking cessation program revealed the need for a secure privacy shield for these in-depth organizational health and wellness programs to succeed. The fact that some behaviors or conditions could eventually be made visible to the employer was a significant concern for participants.\n\nAt the same time, as there are many common elements in the individual participants' conditions, the organizational work environment could be very well suited to offer support and well-targeted interventions by HCPs. In our study, professional assessments were adjusted to consider the unique features of the professional work environment. The study helped align multiple health care protocols and checked for possible work-related diseases. For some participants, significant medical issues were uncovered that would not have been detected as early without the program and without the persuasive technology platform in the organizational work setting (29/53, 55% of the prescriptions were out of range, where 15/29, 52% were serious medical issues). Firefighters were not visiting their physicians regularly, and this was made visible by the persuasive technology platform.\n\nIt is puzzling that even in an organizational work environment where poor health could lead to loss of employment, we still found that participants struggled to develop healthy behaviors and observed unproductive workplace wellness messages. In this sense, firefighters represent a critical case, and the observations from this environment can serve as important examples for other organizations."

This motivation was especially salient with the exercise, sodium reduction, and smoking components. Ultimately, the study's comprehensive program achieved many outcomes around exercise improvements, smoking cessation, management of serious medical issues, and improvements in general nutrition (N=29 final interviews; N=141 at the beginning of the study and N=110 at the end of the study, using webpages).\n\nIn this way, group influence went beyond the motivational component to embed in individuals' tasks and organizational work processes. Discussions with work colleagues around health are likely to contribute to a better understanding of the data presented in a persuasive system and of the expected consequences of actions. This increased understanding is likely to lead to appropriate action  [18] . Evidence from the discussions among the participants supports this pattern.

These participants acknowledged that they could not have figured out the design or executed it at the high level that was achieved in the study.\n\nPlatform use helped users gain control over their health conditions throughout iterations, leading to improved health and wellness after several weeks. The persuasive technology platform made efforts visible to the group and reminded individuals that their respective efforts were contributing to a larger group or social goal. Seeing the progression of results helped participants persevere toward their goals with the added motivation, as noted, of not disappointing their peers. This result is consistent with research in other contexts where interfaces provided feedback about performance and led to increased group performance through social reinforcement  [35] .\n\nThe repeatable persuasive technology platform gave participants integrated, personalized medical advice and personalized intervention oversight on a large, systematic scale.

      "text": "This paper argues that health and wellness improvements occurred in this study because the organization and participants involved used a persuasive technology platform that was designed to reflect its use in work, group, home, and social systems beyond initial interactions. The persuasive technology platform enabled employees to reveal behaviors such as smoking, drinking, or reckless driving behind a privacy shield, which probably would not have occurred without this protection, and then change those behaviors. In alignment with the 28 principles identified by Oinas-Kukkonen and Harjumaa  [10]  for designing persuasive systems, we allowed people to disclose sensitive data to subsequently improve their situation. Tables 3-6 provide a useful illustration of how the features of an implementation reflect 96% (27/28) of the design principles  [10] .\n\nWe present a vision for personal health record platforms that considers the wider improvements that could be made in understanding health decisions, addressing participants' motivation, and facilitating meaningful use of the technology in the individual users' local work setting. These persuasive technology platforms fundamentally offer a different approach to encourage new social interaction through work and home environments beyond the initial interactions. Given that a significant portion of the provincial government budgets in Canada already pay for the health system and many people still lack primary health care  [37] [38] [39] , these holistic platforms and team-based HCP care at a reasonable cost should be embedded in many organizational work settings."

      "text": "The fact that our data were drawn from 1 Canadian city limits our ability to directly compare our context with others with different characteristics. For instance, large urban areas may make it harder to create strong groups if the social fabric is not as tightly woven as it is in smaller communities. Because of data aggregation, we are unable to provide findings by smaller groupings, which limits our results. Furthermore, we intentionally conducted this study in a context where good health is an essential job requirement.\n\nHowever, it would be interesting to see whether these results are replicated in the same manner in settings where health is not seen as essential for the work performed; this could be a boundary condition for the findings observed. Our findings illustrate that workplace health and wellness are inextricably linked with what happens with the individual and the group both on and off the job. Any sustainable persuasive technology that links workers with professional care teams must navigate the work versus personal life combined with individual versus group dynamics."
