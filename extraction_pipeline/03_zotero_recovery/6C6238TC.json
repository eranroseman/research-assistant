  "title": "Psychodynamic Technique and Therapeutic Alliance in Prediction of Outcome in Psychodynamic Child Psychotherapy",
  "abstract": "Objective: This study is the first to investigate the effect of psychodynamic technique (PT), therapeutic alliance, and their interactions with outcome in psychodynamic child psychotherapy. Method: The sample comprised 79 Turkish children (mean age = 6.86 years, 38% girls) with discrete internalizing (22%), discrete externalizing (11%) and comorbid internalizing and externalizing (67%) problems. Independent raters coded 359 sessions from different phases of treatment using the Child Psychotherapy Process Q-Sort for PT and Therapy Process Observational Coding System-Alliance Scale. Problem-assessment measures were collected at intake and every 10th session in treatment using the Children's Behavior Checklist and Brief Problem Monitor. Results: Multilevel modeling analyses indicated that the PT and therapeutic alliance interacted such that more use of the PT in the context of high therapeutic alliance predicted less problem behaviors, whereas in the context of low therapeutic alliance PT predicted more problem behaviors. This relationship was moderated by problem comorbidity such that for children with comorbid problems, though a strong therapeutic alliance was indicated, an increase in PT use did not have a significant effect. Conclusion: Findings suggest that the use of psychodynamic interventions is indicated in the context of a strong therapeutic alliance, especially for children with noncomorbid problems. Psychodynamic interventions may have an adverse effect if a therapeutic alliance is not established. For children with comorbid problems, keeping the relationship strong is important. \n Public Health Significance Statement This was the first study to suggest that psychodynamic interventions are associated with less problems in the context of a strong therapeutic relationship in psychodynamic child psychotherapy. An increase in psychodynamic interventions may be associated with a negative therapeutic reaction if the therapeutic alliance has not been established. Children with comorbid problems benefit from a strong relationship and not necessarily psychodynamic technique in the short-run. Long-term follow-up may be needed to observe the effects of psychodynamic interventions in this population.",

      "text": "Even though there is some evidence to support the effectiveness of manualized psychodynamic child treatments (see  Midgley et al., 2017  for a review), there is a gap in the literature on change mechanisms and specific \"active ingredients\" that are associated with a good outcome. There is a highly reliable association between therapeutic alliance and psychotherapy outcomes  (Karver et al., 2018) ; however, very few studies investigated these processes in psychodynamic child psychotherapy (e.g.,  Halfon et al., 2019) . When it comes to therapy techniques, only  Halfon, Goodman, et al. (2020)  have investigated the relationship between psychodynamic technique (PT) and outcome and found a positive association.\n\nThe majority of outpatient clinics receive referrals for children presenting with a range of difficulties that involve co-occurring internalizing (e.g., depression and anxiety) and externalizing (e.g., delinquency and conduct problems) problems  (Ollendick et al., 2008) . Children who suffer from comorbid internalizing and externalizing disorders exhibit even greater impairment in functioning  (Ezpeleta et al., 2006; Ingoldsby et al., 2006) , poorer remission rates  (Hudson et al., 2015) , worse functioning at long-term followup  (Ginsburg et al., 2014) , and less change in diagnostic severity  (Hudson et al., 2015) , and need more intensive care  (Target, 2017) . In this study, we investigated, for the first time, the complex relationships between PTs, therapeutic alliance, internalizing and externalizing problem comorbidity, and their interactions in the prediction of change in problem behaviors with a group of children with distinct internalizing, distinct externalizing and comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems in psychodynamic child psychotherapy. regular therapeutic framework, a trusting relationship, and strengthen existing resources. Expressive interventions provide insight into wishes, affects, object relationships, and defense mechanisms through links and interpretations  (Kernberg & Chazan, 1991; Luborsky, 1984) . Halfon, Goodman, et al. (2020)  in a naturalistic study of psychodynamic child psychotherapy with children with internalizing, externalizing and comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems found that therapists most characteristically point out a recurrent theme in the child's conduct and defenses; make links between a child's feelings and experience; interpret the meaning of child's play; draw attention to disavowed feelings; emphasize feelings to help the child experience them more deeply; interpret unconscious wishes, feelings, or ideas and discuss the therapy relationship. The least characteristic therapist behaviors were acting in a didactic manner and exerting active control over the interaction.\n\nIn psychodynamic child psychotherapy, several manualized treatments use PT with children with both externalizing and internalizing problems (see  Goodman & Midgley, 2019  for a review). PT is effective for offering containment for disruptive behaviors, connecting these behaviors with underlying feelings  (Kernberg & Chazan, 1991)  and, eventually, pointing out the defensive nature of these behaviors  (Hoffman et al., 2016) . PT also encourages children to express and work through central relational conflicts in play and in the therapy relationship while the possible unconscious meanings of the children's symptoms are explored (see  G\u00f6ttken et al., 2014) . Thus, children eventually become more aware of previously unmanageable feelings, anxieties and unconscious conflicts through therapists' links and interpretations in the therapy relationship and no longer need to rely on maladaptive defensive processes or repetitive patterns."

      "title": "Core Mechanisms of Change in Psychodynamic Psychotherapy",
      "text": "In psychodynamic child psychotherapy, even though there is preliminary evidence for the efficacy of manualized psychodynamic treatments (see  Midgley et al., 2017  for a review), research into mechanisms of change mostly draw upon single-case studies of the therapeutic process (e.g.,  Goodman & Athey-Lloyd, 2011; Goodman et al., 2015; Schneider et al., 2010)  without sufficient cross-sectional research with larger sample sizes. Limited research started investigating the core treatment processes such as therapy techniques and therapeutic relationship factors that may lead to change. Halfon, Goodman, et al. (2020)  investigated directly the associations between PT and the outcome in psychodynamic child psychotherapy and found that PT use predicted less problem behaviors for a group of children with internalizing, externalizing and comorbid problems. The therapeutic alliance is an empirically supported therapeutic relational process  (Horvath et al., 2011) , most widely based on  Bordin's (1979)  pantheoretical definition constituting \"bond\" (which refers to the affective aspects of the patienttherapist relationship), \"task\" (which constitutes agreement and participation in the activities of therapy) and, finally, mutual consensus on goals in treatment. The most recent meta-analysis by  Karver et al. (2018)  found 28 studies in behavioral and nonbehavioral child treatments that used an explicit measure of the therapeutic alliance, showing a small-to-medium effect with the outcome, supported for internalizing, externalizing and comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems. However, studies that measure therapeutic alliance repeatedly over the course of treatment are sparse and arise mostly from studies conducted with children with anxiety problems in cognitive behavioral treatment (CBT; e.g.,  Chu et al., 2014; Kendall et al., 2009) . In psychodynamic child psychotherapy, only  Halfon et al. (2019)  investigated the associations between therapeutic alliance and the outcome in a longitudinal design and found both the strength as well as the change in therapeutic alliance is associated with improvement.\n\nPatient diagnosis may affect how responsive children are to psychodynamic treatments. Generally, children with internalizing problems respond better than children with disruptive or comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems to psychodynamic treatments  (Midgley et al., 2017) . Some studies conducted with CBT show that patients with comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems show poorer response to treatment  (Hudson et al., 2015)  and worse functioning at long-term follow-up  (Ginsburg et al., 2014) . Even though meta-analyses regarding PDT have, in general, indicated that children with complex comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems benefit from psychodynamic treatments  (Midgley et al., 2017) ,  Target (2017)  and  Midgley et al. (2017)  indicated that children with such profiles need longer or more intense treatment.\n\nDue to limited literature in child psychotherapy, findings regarding PT and therapeutic alliance from adult psychodynamic research will be discussed. In adult psychodynamic psychotherapy, there have been mixed findings between PT and outcome, including positive, null, and negative relationships (see  McCarthy et al., 2019  for a review). In contrast, the therapeutic alliance is one of the most consistent predictors of a good outcome  (Fl\u00fcckiger et al., 2018) . Some studies have suggested that the relationship between PT and outcome is dependent upon the strength of therapeutic alliance (e.g.,  Goldman et al., 2018; Owen & Hilsenroth, 2011; Owen et al., 2012) . These studies surmised that PT can elicit emotional distress as patients explore unconscious and hard-totolerate issues that are brought to consciousness. Therefore, a strong therapeutic bond where patients feel safe and supported is indicated. This is particularly pertinent for more expressive techniques, such as interpretations which may cause dysregulation in the short-run  (Schut et al., 2005; Town et al., 2012) ."

      "title": "Aims of the Current Study",
      "text": "Different lines of research arising mostly from adult psychodynamic psychotherapy suggest a possible relationship between PT, therapeutic alliance, and patient improvement, but also highlight the potential impact of internalizing and externalizing problem comorbidity on change processes. The present study extends previous work in psychodynamic child psychotherapy (i.e.,  Halfon, Goodman, et al., 2020)  by being the first to examine all of these key variables in relation to patient outcome in the same model with children who have discrete internalizing, discrete externalizing, and comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems. Moreover, in previous studies, problem behaviors were measured at baseline and upon termination. In the present study, problem levels as well as levels of PT and therapeutic alliance were assessed over the course of treatment. This approach enabled the investigation of more meaningful associations between in-session processes and the outcome while controlling for therapist and patient variability. In the current study, we used the PT subscale of the CPQ  (Halfon, Goodman, et al., 2020; Schneider & Jones, 2004) , because it specifically pertains to therapists' PT interventions and the Therapy Process Observational Coding System-Alliance scale (TPOCS-A;  McLeod & Weisz, 2005) , an explicit measure of therapeutic alliance, based on  Bordin's (1979)  conceptualization of the construct. Due to limited literature in psychodynamic child psychotherapy, we drew tentative hypotheses: (a) PT would negatively predict problem behaviors; (b) the therapeutic alliance would negatively predict problem behaviors; (c) PT in the context of the high therapeutic alliance would be associated with less problem behaviors; (d) patients with comorbid internalizing/externalizing problems would make fewer gains in response to PT interventions compared to discrete internalizers and externalizers; and (e) patients with comorbid internalizing/externalizing problems would make fewer gains in response to PT interventions in the context of high therapeutic alliance compared to discrete internalizers and externalizers."

      "text": "Istanbul Bilgi University Psychological Center is a communitybased sliding fee scale mental health clinic. Individuals can apply for a reduced fee for all psychotherapy services by providing annual household income, the amount spent on housing (copy of rent, lease or mortgage payment), and the number of dependents. Referrals were made by the parents themselves or by mental health, medical, and child welfare professionals. Upon referral to the clinic, the parents and the children were screened by a licensed doctoral-level clinical psychologist, with over 10 years of clinical experience, and trained in developmental psychopathology and psychiatric interviewing techniques, in order to determine whether the patients fit the study protocol inclusion criteria. All patients were administered the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL) and only patients with borderline or clinical levels of internalizing and externalizing problems (T > 60) were included in this study. The patients with non-clinical levels of problem received treatment at the center but were excluded from this study due to study hypotheses being directly associated with clinical problem levels. Children between the ages of 4 and 10 years were included in the study because play-based interventions are broadly indicated for pre-school and school-age children. Children with psychotic symptoms and significant risk of suicide attempts (plan, means, and intent) were excluded and referred to an inpatient emergency room. Children with learning difficulties, developmental delays, a primary diagnosis of eating problems or substance abuse were also not accepted and referred to appropriate services. Patients and their parents were informed extensively before commencing therapy about research procedures. Parents provided written informed consent. Children provided oral assent concerning the use of their data, including questionnaires, videotapes and transcripts of sessions, for research purposes."

      "title": "Study Interventions",
      "text": "The standard treatment applied at the clinic is psychodynamic play therapy. The treatment mainly follows an object-relational framework, working on children's self-other representations and mental states using children's play as the main source of internal expression  (Verheugt-Pleiter et al., 2008; Winnicott, 1971) . Parallel parental work takes place with the main goal of increasing parental mentalization  (Slade, 2005) , helping the parent to think about the child's mind, underscoring links between behavior and mental states, and noting the relations between the parent's and child's mental states. The treatment process comprised a standard assessment phase in the first session, in which a clinical interview was conducted with parents to learn about the history of the presenting problem, as well as the developmental history and family background of the child. In the second session, the therapist met with the child and told him/her that he/she was free to play with any toys and noted the rules of safety. After this session, the therapist presented a clinical formulation and treatment plan. The standard treatment plan at the clinic involves a once-weekly therapy session of 50 min with the child, along with once-monthly parent sessions. Treatments are open-ended in length and are determined based on progress toward goals, life changes, and the decisions made by the families of patients.\n\nThe core treatment principles with children are as follows: First, the therapist draws attention to the play process by listening actively and inviting the child to communicate in play, and encouraging the child to express and reflect on his/her perceptions, feelings and thoughts. Second, the therapist clearly identifies the boundaries of the play situation whereby disruptive and potentially harmful actions are differentiated from symbolic aggression. Third, the therapist draws attention to mental states by asking questions about the play setting, temporal ordering, and the details of the characters (their thoughts and feelings). Fourth, the therapist interprets the play content and its possible unconscious meanings cautiously with a wondering stance to help the child see the links between unconscious mental states, warded-off feelings and motives about self and others that find reflection in play. Fifth, the therapist identifies specific play content that has been repetitive in treatment and suggests possible links with what the child could be experiencing in real life. Sixth, the therapist draws attention to the relational patterns in the therapy relationship.\n\nThe parent sessions are conducted individually with the parents. Both parents are encouraged to attend and in case the fathers cannot attend, the sessions are conducted individually with the mothers. The core principles in the parent sessions are as follows: The therapist tries to create an environment of collaboration, where instead of the therapist being the expert and giving advice or suggestions to \"fix\" the child's problems, the parent and the therapist reflect on the parents' and child's issues. The therapist holds the parent and his/her perspective in mind, creating an empathic bond that helps the parent feel understood. The therapist shows an interest in mental states and not just behaviors to help the parent see himself/ herself and the child as a \"mentalizing being\" with thoughts and feelings behind behaviors. The therapist models a reflective stance, showing curiosity and openness about mental states, talking about feelings and making links with behaviors especially at times of conflict, to help the parent understand the interactions with the child.\n\nEach therapist was educated in the theoretical background of psychodynamic play therapy for 2 years during master's-degree classes, supervisions, and case seminars. All therapists had the same level of experience (1-2 years of supervised psychotherapy experience). Each clinician received a minimum of 4 hr of supervision per week (1 hr individually and 3 hr in a regular supervision group) on the case conceptualization, psychodynamic interventions, process, and interpretation from psychotherapists with over 10 years of clinical experience in child psychodynamic psychotherapy. All sessions were videotaped and transcribed. Individual and group supervision focused heavily on the review of videotaped case material and technical interventions. Samples of individual therapy sessions were also tested by independent raters for PDT adherence using the ideal PDT session prototype of the Child Process Q-set (CPQ)."

All psychotherapy sessions were videotaped and transcribed. For in-session PT and therapeutic alliance codings, the session on which the BPM was completed was chosen by the principal investigator. Videotapes and transcripts of these sessions were arranged in random order, and entire sessions were rated by raters independently using CPQ and TPOCS-A (see Figure  1 , for study flow). The raters who completed the CPQ coding were separate from TPOCS-A raters. They were independent raters who were not associated with the treating clinicians or the cases, and blind to the purposes of the study. A total of 359 sessions from every 10th session in each child's treatment was coded."

      "title": "Study Outcomes",
      "text": "The main outcomes were a parent and teacher-report assessment measures determining levels of internalizing, externalizing, and total problem behaviors as well as therapists' assessment of global function.\n\nThe CBCL  (Achenbach, 1991 ) is a widely used method for identifying problematic behaviors in children, with two versions for ages 1.5-5 and 6-18 years. CBCL indicates how \"true\" a series of 112 items of problem behavior are for the child on a three-point scale (0 = not true, 1 = somewhat or sometimes true, and 2 = very true or often true). Outcomes can be determined for significant problems for internalizing (e.g., depression and anxiety), externalizing (e.g., aggression and violence) or total problems. This scale has high levels of internal consistency (CBCL for 1.5-5 years and 6-18 years: \u03b1 = 0.97) and 1-week test-retest reliability (CBCL for 1.5-5 years: r = 0.90; CBCL for 6-18 years: r = 0.94;  Achenbach & Rescorla, 2000) . The scale was adapted to Turkish with good internal consistency and test-retest reliability for internalizing (\u03b1 = 0.87, r = 0.93), externalizing (\u03b1 = 0.90, r = 0.93) and total problems (\u03b1 = 0.94, r= 0.93) scales  (Erol & \u015eim\u015fek, 2010) . In the current study, all three subscales showed good-to-high degrees of internal consistency (CBCL for 1.5-5 years: \u03b1 = 0.83, 0.86, 0.84; CBCL for 6-18 years: \u03b1 = 0.83, 0.87, 0.91 for internalizing, externalizing, and total problems, respectively).\n\nThe TRF  (Achenbach, 1991)  includes 118 items that describe problem behaviors in children, 93 of which have counterparts on the CBCL. This scale has high levels of internal consistency (TRF 1.5-5 and 6-18: \u03b1 = 0.97) and one-week test-retest reliability (TRF 1.5-5: r = 0.88; TRF 6-18: r = 0.95;  Achenbach & Rescorla, 2000) . The scale has been adapted for Turkish with good internal consistency and test-retest reliability for internalizing (\u03b1 = 0.89, r = 0.85) and externalizing (\u03b1 = 0.93, r = 0.89) and total problem (\u03b1 = 0.88, r = 0.87) scales  (Erol & \u015eim\u015fek, 2010) . In the current study, all subscales showed good to high degrees of internal consistency (TRF 1.5-5: \u03b1 = 0.89, 0.96, 0.97; TRF 6-18: \u03b1 = 0.83, 0.94, 0.95 for internalizing, externalizing, and total problems, respectively).\n\nThe CGAS  (Shaffer et al., 1983 ) is a numeric scale from 1 to 100 used by mental health clinicians to rate the general functioning of children under the age of 18. It has shown moderate-to-excellent interrater reliability, good stability over time, and good concurrent as well as discriminant validity  (Shaffer et al., 1983) . It has been adapted to Turkish with good reliability and validity  (G\u00f6kler et al., 2014) .\n\nBPM  (Achenbach et al., 2011 ) is a 19-item subset developed from items included on the comprehensive CBCL  (Achenbach, 1991)  through item-response theory and factor analysis, employs the same three-point scale, and is applicable to children within the same age range. Parents rate their children's problematic behaviors, specifically internalizing (e.g., \"self-conscious or easily embarrassed,\" \"feels too guilty\"), externalizing (e.g., \"argues a lot,\" \"stubborn, sullen, or irritable\"), and attention problems (e.g., \"fails to finish tasks s/he starts,\" \"impulsive or acts without thinking\"). This scale showed satisfactory internal consistency (\u03b1 = 0.74), test-retest reliability in an 8-16-day interval (r = 0.77), and criterion-related validity  (Achenbach et al., 2011) . In the current study, the BPM Total Problem subscale showed good internal consistency (\u03b1 = 0.86)."

The reliability and validity of the CPQ have been demonstrated in various ways. Studies have presented strong interrater agreement on the coding of CPQ items (e.g.,  Goodman & Athey-Lloyd, 2011) . Discriminant validity has been demonstrated between two treatments. The CPQ can distinguish the treatments of two therapists with the same patient  (Goodman et al., 2015; Goodman & Athey-Lloyd, 2011) . It has shown good convergent validity with children's affect regulation and sociobehavioral functioning  (Halfon & Bulut, 2019a)  and divergent validity in distinguishing psychodynamic characteristics of sessions in psychodynamic treatment  (Halfon, Goodman, et al., 2020) .\n\nThe CPQ was independently translated into Turkish by translation-back translation method by a doctoral-level clinical psychologist, with over 10 years of experience and two graduate master'slevel clinical psychology students. Discrepancies between the two versions were thoroughly discussed and resolved until a translation was agreed upon. The raters in the present study consisted of six master's-level research assistants who received 18 hr of training on coding the CPQ by Dr. Geoffrey Goodman, a noted expert on the measure. They Q-sorted practice videos until their intra-class correlation (ICC) reached a benchmark of 0.70. Afterwards, pairs of raters coded the sessions independently and reached satisfactory ICCs varying between 0.70 and 0.98 (M = 0.82, SD = 0.07). Then, the two sets of independent ratings were composited by taking their average.\n\nThe PT subscale of the CPQ was found by  Halfon, Goodman, et al. (2020)  through a principal-component analysis that resulted in a factor named PT. The subscale is calculated by taking the mean of the following CPQ items: \"Therapist interprets the meaning of child's play (item 46)\"; \"Therapist points out child's use of defenses (item 36)\"; \"Therapist makes links between child's feelings and experience (item 76)\"; \"Therapist draws attention to feelings regarded by the child as unacceptable (e.g., anger, envy, or excitement; item 50)\"; \"Therapist emphasizes feelings to help child experience them more deeply (item 81)\"; \"Therapist helps child manage feelings (item 82)\"; \"Therapist interprets warded-off or unconscious wishes, feelings, or ideas (item 67)\"; \"Therapy relationship is discussed (item 98)\"; \"Therapist comments on changes in child's mood or affect (item 79)\"; \"Therapist is neutral (item 93)\"; \"Therapist accurately perceives the therapeutic process (item 28)\"; \"Therapist points out a recurrent theme in the child's experience or conduct (item 62)\"; \"Therapist acts to strengthen existing defenses (item 89, reverse scored); \"Therapist actively exerts control over the interaction (e.g., structuring, introducing new topics; item 17, reverse scored)\"; \"Therapist behaves in a didactic manner (item 37, reverse scored).\" The subscale showed good internal consistency in the present study (\u03b1 = 0.77).\n\nThe TPOCS-A  (McLeod & Weisz, 2005 ) is a comprehensive observer-rated tool that assesses the quality of therapeutic alliance between the therapist and child. TPOCS-A comprises nine items that measure the emotional aspects of the child-therapist relationship (i.e., \"Child experiences the therapist as supportive and understanding\"; and \"Child acts in a hostile, critical, or defensive manner towards the therapist\") as well as collaboration on therapeutic tasks (i.e., \"Child does not comply with therapeutic tasks\"; \"Child and therapist work together equally on therapeutic tasks\").\n\nThe items are rated on a 6-point Likert scale (0 = not at all and 5 = a great deal). The TPOCS-A has demonstrated strong interrater reliability, internal consistency, and convergent validity with self-reported therapeutic alliance instruments  (Fjermestad et al., 2012; Liber et al., 2010) , and predictive validity in relation to the outcome (e.g.,  Halfon, Goodman, et al., 2020; Liber et al., 2010; McLeod & Weisz, 2005) . The TPOCS-A was translated and adapted to Turkish with good reliability and validity  (Halfon, Ozsoy, et al., 2020) . Six master's-level research assistants received 8 h of theoretical training and coded five pilot sessions to achieve adequate inter-rater reliability (ICC = 0.70). Afterward, the sessions were double-coded by independent pairs with excellent ICCs varying between 0.70 and 1.00 (M = 0.91, SD = 0.06) and the mean score of the coded sessions were used in the analyses. The total therapeutic alliance score showed good internal consistency in the present study (\u03b1 = 0.80)."

In order to investigate statistically significant change on a group level, Multivariate Analyses of Variance (MANOVA) were conducted comparing pre and post-test assessments. Effect sizes (ES) were calculated using eta square (\u03b7 2 ) and reported as  Cohen's (1988)  general guidelines with 0.01 for small, 0.09 for medium, and 0.25 for large effects. In order to compare whether subgroups of the sample (i.e., discrete internalizers, discrete externalizers and comorbid internalizers/externalizers) made a clinically significant change, we calculated Reliable Change Index scores (RCI;  Jacobson & Truax, 1991) , which measures the amount of change between preand posttreatment while accounting for the measurement error of the instrument. A child was classified as having made the reliable change if his/her RCI scores were above 1.96 and if the CBCL score has passed the predetermined cut-off point (T < 60), to have made no significant change if his RCI scores were between -1.96 and 1.96, and to have deteriorated if his RCI was below -1.96 on the CBCL."

All predictors were grand-mean centered. To capture change over time, a time variable was created to model the linear change of BPM total problems over the course of treatment. Session numbers were converted into phases such that a session was coded in \"phase 1\" if it was within sessions 1-10, in \"phase 2\" for sessions 11-20, in \"phase 3\" for sessions 21-30, etc. for a total of six phases (M = 3.19 (SD = 2.03); min = 3, max = 6). Thus, the unconditional longitudinal MLM equation was as follows:\n\nBPM Total Problems ij = \u03b2 00 + \u03b2 10 Phase ij + e ij + u 0j where i denotes a phase point, j denotes a person, and BPM Total Problems ij is the value of problems for observation i for person j. Furthermore, \u03b2 00 is the intercept of the regression equation and \u03b2 10 is the main effect of Phase ij representing the rate of change in problem behaviors. Phase-and individual-specific residuals are represented by u 0j and e ij , respectively. To assess the effect size for change scores in problem behaviors over time, we calculated pseudo-R2 as the proportion of total within-person variance from a completely unconditional or base model that is accounted for when time is added to the model  (Singer & Willett, 2003) ."

We first included the main effects of the PT and therapeutic alliance score of each session in order to test Hypotheses 1 and 2. For Hypothesis 3, in order to assess the interaction effect, the product of PT and therapeutic alliance was included as an additional timevarying level 1 variable. For Hypothesis 4, in order to test the effect of internalizing/externalizing comorbidity, we used the pretreatment CBCL scores. Membership of the comorbid category was dummy-coded such that a code of 1 was assigned to the comorbid externalizing/internalizing group if the child had a Tscore > 60 on both the CBCL externalizing and the internalizing scales. Afterwards, we included the product of problem comorbidity and PT, and problem comorbidity and therapeutic alliance as cross-level two-way interactions in the model. Finally, we included the product of PT, therapeutic alliance and problem comorbidity as a cross-level three-way interaction in order to test Hypothesis 5. At Level 2, we included our time-invariant variables, which were children's sex, age, CBCL total problems, as control variables.\n\nThe final MLM model tested was as follows: BPM Total Problems ij = \u03b2 00 + \u03b2 10 Phase ij + \u03b2 20 PT ij + \u03b2 30 TA ij + \u03b2 01 Age j + \u03b2 02 Sex j + \u03b2 03 CBCL Total Problem j + \u03b2 04 Comorbidity j + \u03b2 40j PT \u00c3 TA ij + \u03b224PT ij\u00c3 Comorbidity j + \u03b2 34 TA ij\u00c3 Comorbidity j + \u03b2 44 PT ij \u00c3 TA ij \u00c3 Comorbidity j + e 0ij + u 0j\n\nBefore conducting the MLM analyses, we created two-level (sessions nested within patients) and three-level (sessions nested within patients nested within therapists) \"empty\" multilevel models, where BPM total problems was entered as the dependent variable with no predictor variables. The therapist-level ICC was 0.001, which showed that therapists accounted for \u223c0.001% of the variance in BPM total problems, thereby suggesting that the variance was not attributable to differences between therapists. In contrast, the between-patient ICC was 0.53 ( p < .001), and accounted for 53.45% of the variance in BPM total problems. This finding suggested that a two-level model was appropriate because not all variance was attributable to session-level variables. All analyses were conducted with SPSS 26 and MLwin v3  (Rasbash et al., 2014) ."

We expected that PT and the therapeutic alliance would be negatively associated with problem behaviors. Our findings indicated no significant direct effect of PT ( p = .31) or TA ( p = .17; see Table  4 ) on outcome.\n\nHypothesis 3. We expected that PT, in the context a of high therapeutic alliance would be associated with less problem behaviors.

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "The aims of our study were to investigate whether PT practiced in sessions and therapeutic alliance predicted less problem behaviors over the course of treatment with a group of children with discrete internalizing, externalizing, and comorbid internalizing/externalizing problems. We were not able to find the direct effects of PT and therapeutic alliance on problem behaviors. However, an increase in PT in the context of high therapeutic alliance predicted less problem behaviors. These findings are consistent with some of the adult psychodynamic literature that has found null associations between the direct effect of PT on the outcome, but found support for an interaction effect such that, if the therapeutic alliance is strong, PT is related to a good outcome  (Owen & Hilsenroth, 2011) . Our findings show this association for the first time in psychodynamic child psychotherapy.\n\nHowever, we also found that greater use of PT, practiced in the context of the low therapeutic alliance was associated with more problem behaviors compared to the high therapeutic alliance group.\n\nSince this was a naturalistic study with no control group, there is a need for further replication and a degree of caution when drawing conclusions. Also, our outcome analyses indicated that children on average made a significant change, with most children improving or maintaining current clinical function. However, this finding still raises issues about practice parameters in psychodynamic child psychotherapy. PT, in the short term, may cause emotional arousal  (Town et al., 2012)  and dysregulation; therefore, the use of expressive interventions depends on therapist's assessment of the child's ego strength to tolerate these processes. The child needs to have adequate impulse control as well as tolerance for frustration, anxiety, and negative affect, and to have developed the symbolic capacity to communicate through play or language in order to respond to interpretative interventions  (Fonagy & Target, 1998) . The ultimate aim of therapy is to develop and enhance these functions; however, if they are not yet acquired, the interpretation of maladaptive defenses and the evocation of painful unconscious feelings can be overwhelming and contraindicated  (Kernberg et al., 2012) . Therefore, the therapist must monitor the timing of interventions, continually make a dynamic assessment of the child's ego functions. Future research can investigate the effect of PT in different phases of treatment and also assess interactions with object-relations and affect regulation.\n\nMoreover, the therapist should use the full spectrum of psychodynamic therapeutic interventions, from supportive to expressive Note. PT = Psychodynamic Technique; TA = Therapeutic Alliance; BPM = Brief Problem Monitor. \"Low category\" refers to 1 standard-deviation below, and high category refers to 1 standard-deviation above the mean of therapeutic alliance.\n\nmodalities (see  Luborsky, 1984; Kernberg & Chazan, 1991) . The more supportive therapeutic interventions are meant to support patients' ego strengths and the therapeutic relationship. These may be called for when the therapeutic alliance is not strong, to help establish a safer ground for the practice of more expressive interpretations. Eresund (2007)  found that the initial supportive framework of supportive-expressive psychodynamic therapy (SEP;  Kernberg & Chazan, 1991 ) strengthened children's ego functions and the therapeutic alliance, making it possible to use interpretations later in the process. Moreover, interpretative interventions can be made more tolerable to the child when they are practiced in an \"indirect mode,\" such as using the play metaphor or role-taking  (Kernberg et al., 2012) . Thus, the therapist should apply flexibly generic psychodynamic principles, and select PTs according to the child's needs. This is especially pertinent for children with comorbid internalizing/ externalizing problems, who showed no significant change in response to PT in problem behaviors. Children with more complex problems, if they are to show improvement, appear to respond to more intensive treatment. Such improvement is noted especially at long-term follow-up  (Target, 2017; Schachter & Target, 2009) . Target (2017)  specified that these children may have deficits in mental processes, that is, poor object relations, impaired affect regulation, and problems with social capacities. She suggested that they needed mentalizationfocused interventions. The therapist in this case, should take a more integrative approach starting with mentalizing interventions, such as directing the child's attention to affects, thoughts, behaviors, or play  (Midgley et al., 2017; Verheugt-Pleiter et al., 2008) . By pointing out the sequence of the child's emotional reactions, perceptions and behaviors, the child can develop observing ego functions, memorysequencing, integration of experiences in space and time and a sense of continuity. These interactions also enhance the child's feeling of being understood by the therapist and support the therapeutic relationship.\n\nOur findings pointed to the importance of practicing PT in the context of the therapeutic alliance. In CBT-oriented child therapy, therapeutic alliance predicts engagement in therapeutic tasks  (Chiu et al., 2009 , McLeod et al., 2014) . Moreover, the importance of the therapeutic alliance to the treatment progress of children with complex problems and trauma history has been studied in cognitive-behavioral trauma therapy (TF-CBT; e.g.,  Ormhaug et al., 2014) . Gradual exposure to trauma tasks predicts higher alliance especially with disengaged youth in TF-CBT, suggesting an interaction effect between alliance and technique for certain diagnostic groups  (Ovenstad et al., 2020) .\n\nThere is very little research in child psychotherapy investigating the factors that make PT helpful; therefore, current literature from adult psychodynamic psychotherapy will be discussed. However, it is necessary to be cautious when comparing child treatment with adult treatment keeping in mind the developmental stages and agerelated issues that come into play in child therapy. In adult psychotherapy, despite certain studies showing a positive relationship between early interpretations and outcome  (Levy et al., 2015) , some studies have found negative associations (i.e.,  Connolly et al., 1999; Ogrodniczuk et al., 1999; Schut et al., 2005) . These null findings indicated that greater use of PT is indicated only in certain conditions, such as when the therapeutic alliance is strong. For example,  Patton et al. (1997)  found that therapists used more PT following sessions with a high therapeutic alliance and less PT after low therapeutic alliance sessions. Therapeutic alliance may serve as a signal to increase the use of PT in psychodynamic adult psychotherapy. The reverse is also possible, meaning that wellexecuted PT as well as therapist responsiveness to the patients' relational needs may strengthen the alliance  (Despland et al., 2001; Li et al., 2019) . Future studies can test the temporal sequence between the therapeutic alliance, PT, and problem change in psychodynamic child psychotherapy. Alternatively, greater use is not always associated with a good outcome. McCarthy et al. (2016)  found that a moderate amount of expressive PT use, which is neither too frequent nor too infrequent, is associated with symptom improvement in psychodynamic adult psychotherapy. Moreover, PT in the context of low alliance brings up the possibility of alliance ruptures, defined as a tension or breakdown in the collaborative relationship in the therapeutic dyad  (Safran & Muran, 2000) . It is possible that high use of PT may follow or precede instances of disaffiliation between the patient and the therapist  (Schut et al., 2005) , leading to a negative outcome. Such unrecognized ruptures predict decreases in functioning  (Chen et al., 2018) . Future studies should include a rupture-repair-specific alliance measure to investigate these processes in child psychotherapy."

      "title": "Study Limitations and Directions for Future Research",
      "text": "Our study adds to the evidence base of the factors associated with a change in psychodynamic child psychotherapy. It is one of the only studies to use a longitudinal design, with repeated observer-rated measures of PT and therapeutic alliance collected over the course of psychodynamic treatment from a cross-sectional sample of children. Despite the strengths mentioned, the present study had some limitations. First, the treatment was not randomized, and there was no control group, so causal inferences could not be made. Second, the sample size was relatively small, so larger samples with different diagnoses are needed to test whether these findings can be generalized. Third, other potential mediating variables, such as therapist competence and therapist responsiveness in delivering the interventions, may have affected the results. These variables have been associated with improvement in adult psychodynamic psychotherapy (see  McCarthy et al., 2019, for a review) . Fourth, the clinicians in our study were master's-level graduate students with a limited degree of training. Future research should utilize a more experienced subset of clinicians to investigate if therapist competence is associated with or moderates the study variables. Fifth, we did not detect significant variance at the therapist level to examine how therapist variability affected PT and therapeutic alliance. This factor can be investigated in future research. Sixth, we were only able to include mother-report postsession measures; however, it would be important to collect longitudinal assessments from fathers, teachers as well as children themselves, which may reveal differential associations.\n\nWe were not able to assess the impact of parent sessions on therapy outcome within the scope of this study. However, the therapist-parent/caregiver alliance is the same magnitude as the therapist-youth alliance to outcome in child psychotherapy  (Karver et al., 2018) . Failure to maintain a strong alliance with parents/ caregivers can have serious implications for treatment continuation and early dropout. Moreover, in a recent study, using the same database of psychodynamic child psychotherapy,  Halfon and Besiroglu (2020a)  found that parents' reflective function about their child's mental states predicted a decrease in children's problem behaviors over the course of treatment. This is especially important given that we used parent-report problem assessment measures over the course of treatment, necessitating a level of awareness and the capacity to observe changes in problem behaviors on the parents' part. Future studies should also study parent sessions and include the effect of parent-focused PT and therapeutic alliance on children's therapy progress.\n\nWe used a broad measure of PT that included supportive as well as expressive interventions, but we could not tell which specific interventions were associated with change. Future research can break down the PT variable to assess differential associations based on problem type. Future research should also assess separately patients with internalizing and externalizing problems. Children with externalizing problems may benefit more from client-centered approaches rather than PT  (Halfon, Goodman, et al., 2020) .\n\nWe were able to assess the outcome only in terms of change in problem behaviors. However, studies from adult psychotherapy have shown that PT may be more likely to show positive results with other mechanisms that are central to psychodynamic therapy, such as insight and affect tolerance, which ameliorate symptoms indirectly (see  McCarthy et al., 2019, for a review) . These mediators can be studied in child-psychotherapy research in the future. This is especially pertinent given that we found on average significant improvement for this sample, indicating other factors that may have been beneficial in the therapeutic process. Moreover, long-term follow-up is necessary to see the effects of PT. Even though PT may cause dysregulation in the short-run, the evocation of these difficult feelings, if worked through, may promote improvements subsequently  (Midgley et al., 2017) . The effects of psychodynamic treatments increase during the follow-up  (Abbass et al., 2014) .\n\nThis was the first study to investigate the associations between PT and therapeutic alliance in prediction of the outcome in psychodynamic child psychotherapy. PT use is indicated in the context of a strong therapeutic alliance, especially for children with discrete internalizing and externalizing problems. PT use must be moderated, or integrated with other techniques if therapeutic alliance has notbeen established. For children with comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems, keeping the relationship strong is important."
