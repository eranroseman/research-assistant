  "title": "Mobile phone text messaging interventions for HIV and other chronic diseases: an overview of systematic reviews and framework for evidence transfer",
  "abstract": "Background: Strong international commitment and the widespread use of antiretroviral therapy have led to higher longevity for people living with human immune deficiency virus (HIV). Text messaging interventions have been shown to improve health outcomes in people living with HIV. The objectives of this overview were to: map the state of the evidence of text messaging interventions, identify knowledge gaps, and develop a framework for the transfer of evidence to other chronic diseases. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of systematic reviews on text messaging interventions to improve health or health related outcomes. We conducted a comprehensive search of PubMed, EMBASE (Exerpta Medica Database), CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), PsycINFO, Web of Science (WoS) and the Cochrane Library on the 17th April 2014. Screening, data extraction and assessment of methodological quality were done in duplicate. Our findings were used to develop a conceptual framework for transfer. Results: Our search identified 135 potential systematic reviews of which nine were included, reporting on 37 source studies, conducted in 19 different countries. Seven of nine (77.7%) of these reviews were high quality. There was some evidence for text messaging as a tool to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy. Text messages also improved attendance at appointments and behaviour change outcomes. The findings were inconclusive for self-management of illness, treatment of tuberculosis and communicating results of medical investigations. The geographical distribution of text messaging research was limited to specific regions of the world. Prominent knowledge gaps included the absence of data on long term outcomes, patient satisfaction, and economic evaluations. The included reviews also identified methodological limitations in many of the primary studies. Conclusions: Global evidence supports the use of text messaging as a tool to improve adherence to medication and attendance at scheduled appointments. Given the similarities between HIV and other chronic diseases (long-term medications, life-long care, strong link to behaviour and the need for home-based support) evidence from HIV may be transferred to these diseases using our proposed framework by integration of HIV and chronic disease services or direct transfer.",

      "text": "HIV (human immune deficiency virus) is a major cause of morbidity and mortality all over the world. There are close to 2.6 million new infections each year, representing a 33 percent decline from 3.4 million, over the past ten years  [1] . There has also been a drop in the number of AIDS (Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome) related deaths, due largely to the development and use of lifesaving antiretroviral therapy (ART). As a result, there are more people living with HIV-over 35 million-many of whom are eligible for ART. However, treatment coverage is low worldwide, and among the people receiving ART, adherence to medication is low  [1] .\n\nMobile telephone technology is emerging as a tool in chronic disease management  [2] . Mobile phone ownership and use is experiencing its greatest growth in Africa, where HIV is rife  [3] . These two factors have led to the recent rise in research efforts regarding the use of mobile phones to enhance HIV care. On the African continent recent reports suggest that mobile phone text messages can be used to improve outcomes in people living with HIV  [4] [5] [6] [7] .\n\nAlongside HIV, tuberculosis and malaria benefit from considerable resources from The Global Fund ( http://  www.theglobalfund.org/en/about/diseases/ ). It is indisputable that these disease are responsible for many deaths in sub-Saharan Africa, yet, many other chronic non-communicable diseases (NCDs) still cause significant mortality and morbidity, owing in part to their long lasting nature and debilitating consequences. Close to 45% of the disease burden in adults living in low and middle-income countries can be attributed to NCDs  [8] . In sub-Saharan Africa these chronic diseases are on the rise and do not receive sufficient attention  [9] . Projections of current trends suggest that Africa will experience the highest increase in mortality (27% increase) from chronic conditions such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer and diabetes. Over the next ten years, 137 million people will die from a chronic disease  [8] . There is also an unmet need for affordable medication for many NCDs in low and middle income countries  [10] , a problem resolved in HIV care through sustained commitments to disease control  [10] . Addressing research, practice, and policy limitations are important steps towards alleviating the burden of disease due to chronic disease, however, many lessons can be learnt from the better resourced diseases like HIV, in which global investments have stabilized the epidemic by reducing the number of new cases and deaths  [11] . Furthermore, people living with HIV are at a higher risk for developing many NCDs due to the effect of the virus itself (vascular damage), the effects of antiretroviral therapy (ART; which increases cardiovascular risk) and due to aging (because they are now living longer lives)  [12] . The meeting point of HIV and NCDs present challenges for health systems in meeting up with the needs of the population, but also provides opportunities for transfer of knowledge. There is also a case to be made for extending HIV research to other chronic diseases as questions of equity arise when one considers the disproportionate distribution of funds in favor of HIV.\n\nOne critical similarity between HIV and the NCDs is that they both require long term and life-long medication. For this reason there is an enormous potential for poor adherence to medication and care. Secondly, both affect a considerably large portion of the population and thus merit concern as a public health problem  [13] . The third factor is that they all have a strong behavioural component regarding their prevention, hence in both cases, behavioural modifications are required to reduce the risk of further complications. People living with HIV are encouraged to adopt healthy sexual practices to prevent the transmission of infection as well as potential acquisition of new strains from others; to take medication to control the disease; and to undergo frequent testing to monitor disease control. People with diabetes and high blood pressure, for example, are encouraged to modify their diets and incorporate exercise in their lifestyles, in addition to medication and testing. These behaviour modification similarities make it possible to apply information from HIV research to address certain issues in NCDs  [12] .\n\nBoth conditions also require considerable amounts of social support to sustain effective home-based-care. Family members may be involved in preparing meals that follow specific dietary restrictions, accompanying patients to the hospital, or administering medication.\n\nWith regards to health system weaknesses, HIV and NCDs share a number of barriers and challenges. These include demand-side barriers, inequitable availability of services, human resource shortages, limited adherence support, lack of infrastructure and equipment, unreliable drug and diagnostics supplies, poor referral and linkage systems, the need for community engagement; as well as stigma and discrimination  [14] .\n\nHIV and NCDs have very different pathogeneses and clinical features  [12] . The levels of stigma and discrimination with regards to HIV are considerably higher than for NCDs, where in some places NCDs are considered to be diseases of the rich in low-resource settings and people are therefore more likely to discuss such conditions more freely that they would with HIV. However for some NCDs such as diabetes, cancer, and mental disorders, there is still a considerable stigma  [14] . The demographics are also quite different, with HIV affecting younger populations than the NCDs. Furthermore, in sub-Saharan Africa, women are disproportionately affected by HIV  [13] .\n\nThe purpose of the this paper is to map the scope of mobile phone text messaging research to identify opportunities for knowledge transfer, geographical coverage of text messaging research, and avenues for further research and scale-up. We describe the current state of the evidence, identify knowledge gaps, and highlight the points where lessons can be shared or more research is needed. We hope to use the available evidence on the application of text messaging in HIV and other chronic diseases to develop a framework for extension where the most appropriate kinds of interventions can be tested or taken to scale and duplication of efforts avoided."

      "title": "Why it is important to do this overview",
      "text": "In recent years, text messaging has emerged as an important communication tool in healthcare, yet there is limited information of what interventions work best and which should be taken to scale. In addition, given the disproportionate funding mechanisms for research, especially in low-resource settings, research efforts are directed toward conditions such as HIV, malaria and tuberculosis, often neglecting other chronic or NCDs. We purport that there is room for research findings to be transferred from the more favored conditions, given their similarities. Our objectives were to appraise the scope of text messaging interventions in health care and to develop a framework for transfer of research findings from HIV to NCDs."

The participants could be health workers (professional or lay persons) or consumers of health care (prevention or management). We excluded abstracts, non-systematic reviews and other overviews.

We assessed the methodological quality of the included systematic reviews using the AMSTAR (Assessment the methodological quality of systematic reviews) tool  [15] . AMSTAR can be used to assess how well systematic reviews avoid bias against 11 criteria. Based on the number of items adequately reported a systematic review can be scored as high quality (8 to 11 items), medium quality (4 to 7 items) and low quality (3 or less items)  [16] . The reviews were checked for overlap, since one study may be included in more than one systematic review. Agreement on screening and quality assessment was measured using the Kappa statistic, which measures agreement beyond chance  [17] .

Among those with non-specific disease targets (i.e. HIV or tuberculosis), text messaging was investigated in the following diseases and health conditions: hypertension, diabetes, asthma, smoking, vitamin C, weight loss, physical activity, diet, circumcision and antenatal care. They covered a wide range of study designs, such as parallel group RCTs, crossover RCTs, quasi-experimental designs (non-randomized comparisons and before-after studies), and observational studies. In all the reviews the text messaging interventions targeted patients, and were used for the prevention of disease, disease management, or both. None of the interventions targeted health workers. The wide variety of participants, interventions and outcomes precluded meta-analyses in four systematic reviews. Details on the included studies are reported in Table  1 ."

Personalised messages were adapted to suit patient needs by tailoring of timing (to match timing of dosing, set according to patient preference or before appointments) and content (reminders, medical advice, appointment details or feedback on behaviour change activities). Text messages where used to improve adherence to medication (13 studies), as reminders for medical appointments (9 studies), for self-management of disease (for example, information on warning signs in pregnancy, and reminders to measure blood glucose to blood pressure; 8 studies), for behaviour change (for example, diet, sedentary time and exercise; 6 studies), and to deliver test results (1 study).

      "title": "What is the geographical coverage of text messaging interventions in the world?",
      "text": "The locations of the source studies were unevenly distributed around the globe. Eight studies on HIV were located in four countries: four in the US, two in Kenya, and one each in Cameroon and Brazil. There were no text messaging studies for NCDs conducted in Africa and only one on improving attendance at scheduled appointments, in the general population. There were no HIV studies in Europe and Asia.\n\nHow can the application of the technology be transferred from HIV to NCDs?\n\nTwo approaches can be adopted in extending HIV research to NCDs. The first is integration of services  [12] .\n\nIf HIV services and NCD services were integrated, a lot could be gained in terms of shared human, financial, material and community resources. Yet, given the often separate funding mechanisms for these vertical programmes and persistent stigma and discrimination against people\n\nTable 3 List of excluded studies (Continued) Finitsis 2014  [20]  Gurol-Urganci 2012  [22]  Gurol-Urganci 2013  [21]  Horvath 2012  [6]  Militello 2012  [23]  Nglazi 2013  [24]  Vodopivec-Jamsek 2012  [25]  Was an 'a priori' design provided?\n\nWas there duplicate study selection and data extraction?\n\nWas a comprehensive literature search performed?\n\nWas the status of publication (i.e. grey literature) used as an inclusion criterion?\n\nWas a list of studies (included and excluded) provided?\n\nWere the characteristics of the included studies provided?\n\nWas the scientific quality of the included studies assessed and documented?\n\nWas the scientific quality of the included studies used appropriately in formulating conclusions?\n\nWere the methods used to combine the findings of studies appropriate?\n\nWas the likelihood of publication bias assessed? living with HIV, such integration may be less well received than integration of tuberculosis and HIV services or antenatal care with prevention of mother to child transmission of HIVboth of which are more similar in terms of service provision. However, it is important to consider that modern HIV management will likely result in the development of concurrent chronic diseases in patients. Some programs have successfully integrated HIV care with NCD in Cambodia and Kenya  [26] . The second approach would be transferring evidence-based practices or leveraging HIV successes for NCD care. Successes in HIV which contributed to controlling the epidemic include: improved planning and managing resources, better financing mechanisms, human resources strengthening, augmented infrastructure, developing and strengthening supply systems, better data management and clinical services and behaviour change interventions among patients and providers  [14] . Such transfers may be easier to implement if the evidence developed from HIV research is applicable to NCDs.\n\nIn the field of health economics, a number of guidelines have been published to determine if an intervention is suitable to be transferred from one geographic location to another. Some of these can also be used, albeit with some modification, to determine if technologies are transferable across disease conditions. Borrowing from Heyland's Generalizability criteria, items such as: similarities between patients, clinical setting, cost, outcome measures and safety must be considered  [27] .\n\nDespite the difference in demographics between people living with HIV and those with NCDs, we now recognise the accrued risk of NCDs, especially cardiovascular diseases in people with HIV  [28] . Owing to the fact the people living with HIV are now living longer lives, they are more likely to merge with the age group of people who experience NCD morbidity and mortality. The demographics are becoming more and more similar. With regards to text messaging only level of education seems to be a factor affecting response  [29] .\n\nThe cost of care for HIV is considerably higher than for NCDs, but many of these costs are reduced in places where testing and ART are provided free of charge. However, there is no reason to suspect that a text messaging intervention will cost more for NCDs compared to HIV.\n\nSimilar outcomes are of interest in both conditions, notably adherence to medication and lifestyle modifications, both of which can be achieved using mobile phone technology  [30, 31] .\n\nIn addition to these generalizability criteria, the flexibility of text messaging interventions as seen in the diversity of intervention types is an advantage for transfer. Personalisation, timing and content can be modified to adapt a text messaging intervention to another population or health system. Automated messages, may reduce the human resource requirements but limit interactivity. However, many of these interventions were used in an experimental setting on a small number of participants, and it is unclear how they will perform on a large scale.\n\nThe more challenging question relates to geographical transfer. Given the marked difference in health systems, disease burden, culture and use of mobile phones, the most appropriate approach to transfer may involve efforts to replicate or improve research findings in other settings."

      "title": "Framework",
      "text": "Building upon the existing body of evidence, we propose a conceptual framework for the transfer and implementation of research findings from HIV to NCDs. This framework highlights why it is appropriate to transfer text messaging technology from HIV to NCDs (they are both chronic conditions requiring lifelong care, are strongly linked to behaviour, and often require home-based support). We propose two options for integration: the integration of HIV services with NCD services (providing care for NCDs alongside HIV care with the same staff in the same clinics so that text messaging services can be provided for both conditions) or direct transfer of evidence (a replication of text messaging HIV services in NCD clinics within the same facility of another). Current evidence supports two-way text messaging interventions for adult clients to improve adherence to medication, attendance at scheduled appointments and communication with health workers. The obstacles to transfer we identified are stigma, which can be addressed through education and integration of services; issues related to confidentiality, which can be addressed using appropriate content or encryption in the text messages; and health system limitations such as lack of infrastructure and human capital. The transfer process can be facilitated by integration of services, potential saved costs, enhanced client-provider communication and the fact that the HIV and NCD demographics are mergingservices will be provided to an overlapping group of clients. The items for which further research is required should also be considered, and include the use of text messaging services in caregivers and adolescents, longer term effects (on clinical viral load, acceptability and user fatigue) and some NCD specific outcomes such as blood pressure control, blood sugar control, weight control and cholesterol control. This framework is summarised in Figure  3 ."

Some text messaging studies that did not make it into reviews, either because they did not meet individual systematic review inclusion criteria or are more recent would have been missed in this overview. In addition, many studies were unable to produce a pooled estimate of effects due to diversity in study design, participants and outcomes. The strengths of this study include a geographic mapping, a summary of knowledge gaps, and a framework for transfer of evidence generated for HIV to other chronic conditions."

      "text": "A systematic survey of the evidence demonstrates a paucity of research evidence on how text messages can be used to improve care in patients with NCDs in Africa. The findings from HIV research can for the most part be transferred to NCDs and may represent cost savings for donors, governments and taxpayers. Given that the conditions are not identical, we recommend a gradual approach to technology transfer, building on experiences from other geographical regions. Interestingly, despite high rates of TB/HIV, comorbidity there isn't much evidence supporting the use of text messaging to enhance TB outcomes. This would be a worthwhile and conservative step towards extending evidence from HIV research.\n\nText messaging research should be conducted with adolescent populations with HIV, and people who care for children or adults with HIV. Other populations of interest for text messaging research include health care professionals, and community health workers. The current evidence is in favor of weekly, two-way messaging, but \"dose response\", the possibility of user fatigue and indepth understanding of messaging characteristics warrant further investigation. Given that text messaging is emerging as an add-on to usual care, and may also support other adherence enhancing interventions, comparisons to other interventions may mask its value, yet comparisons of different contents, durations and combinations would be informative. We recommend that further research focus on long term clinical outcomes like viral load and exploration of any harms that may occur (notably inadvertent disclosure of status or road traffic accidents related to the use of text messaging). In addition, strategies to ensure confidentiality should be developed. Finally, economic evaluations of the cost effectiveness for text messaging interventions would be critical components of the big picture.\n\nmanuscript for intellectual content.
