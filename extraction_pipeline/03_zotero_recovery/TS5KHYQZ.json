  "title": "The COVID-19 Telepsychology Revolution: A National Study of Pandemic-Based Changes in U.S. Mental Health Care Delivery",
  "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has altered mental health care delivery like no other event in modern history. The purpose of this study was to document the magnitude of that effect by examining (a) the amount of psychologists' telepsychology use before the COVID-19 pandemic, during the pandemic, and anticipated use after the pandemic; as well as (b) the demographic, training, policy, and clinical practice predictors of these changes. This study used a cross-sectional, national online design to recruit 2,619 licensed psychologists practicing in the United States. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, psychologists performed 7.07% of their clinical work with telepsychology, which increased 12-fold to 85.53% during the pandemic, with 67.32% of psychologists conducting all of their clinical work with telepsychology. Psychologists projected that they would perform 34.96% of their clinical work via telepsychology after the pandemic. Psychologists working in outpatient treatment facilities reported over a 26-fold increase in telepsychology use during the pandemic, while those in Veterans Affairs medical centers only reported a sevenfold increase. A larger increase in percentage telepsychology use occurred in women, in psychologists who reported an increase in telepsychology training and supportive organizational telepsychology policies, and in psychologists who treated relationship issues, anxiety, and women's issues. The lowest increases in percentage telepsychology use were reported by psychologists working in rural areas, treating antisocial personality disorder, performing testing and evaluation, and treating rehabilitation populations. Although there was a remarkable increase in telepsychology use during the COVID-19 pandemic, individual and practice characteristics affected psychologists' ability to adopt telepsychology.",

      "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has led to a literal revolution in mental health care delivery, shifting the vast majority of psychological services to telepsychology. This study conducted a national survey of licensed psychologists and documented this seismic shift, finding that although 7.07% of psychologists' clinical work was performed via telepsychology before the COVID-19 pandemic, this increased 12-fold to 85.53% during the pandemic. Psychologists were optimistic that over one-third of their clinical work would still occur via telepsychology after the pandemic, suggesting the high likelihood of lasting changes in U.S. mental health care delivery.\n\nIn early January of 2020, Chinese health authorities notified the World Health Organization (WHO) that a new type of coronavirus (COVID-19) had been identified as the cause of an outbreak of respiratory infections in Wuhan City, China. By mid-January, nearly 300 cases of the new virus had been diagnosed across China, Japan,  Korea, and Thailand (WHO, 2020a) . Confirmed cases of COVID-19 quickly swelled to more than 85,000 by the end of February (WHO 2020b), and by mid-March WHO declared COVID-19 to be a pandemic, with nearly 120,000 people testing positive worldwide  (WHO, 2020d) . In response to the rapid spread of the virus, WHO recommended that people take precautionary measures such as maintaining physical distance to reduce the risk of interpersonal transmission (WHO, 2020c), and governments, institutions, and businesses in the United States moved to online models for conducting their daily activities whenever possible  (Adalja, Toner, & Inglesby, 2020) .\n\nIn anticipation of the possibility that the health care infrastructure could become overwhelmed, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the American College of Surgeons (ACS) recommended that in-person routine health care visits and elective medical procedures be postponed  (ACS, 2020; CDC, 2020b) . Large health care organizations such as the Veterans Health Administration (VHA), Mayo Clinic Health System, and Johns Hopkins Medicine shifted toward utilizing telehealth services to meet patient needs while lessening interpatient and staff transmission risk and conserving medical supplies  (Nitkin, 2020; Stiepan, 2020; VHA, Office of Emergency Management, 2020) . Reports from the Chinese scientific community showed that ambiguity around COVID-19 contagiousness, prevalence, and risk, as well as mandated social isolation, have been associated with spikes in levels of anxiety, panic disorder, and depression in the general population  (Qiu et al., 2020) . For patients already receiving mental health care services, many original presenting problems have been overshadowed by increased fear, depression, anxiety, and panic  (Perrin, Rybarczyk, et al., 2020) . Public access to nonstop media coverage of the pandemic as well as exposure to social media may also have implications for increased mental health concerns  (Gao et al., 2020; McDonnell, Nelson, & Schunk, 2012 ; United States Department of Health and Human Services Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services  Administration, 2014) . Furthermore, fundamental coping strategies like seeking social support to improve mental health (e.g.,  Harandi, Taghinasab, & Nayeri, 2017)  through gathering with friends and family and at places of worship have suddenly become unavailable.\n\nEfforts to meet the health needs of new and established patients have required unprecedented measures by government agencies and other public and private systems, institutions, and companies. Since the VHA is an example of an integrated federal health system which had already been implementing and developing telepsychology prior to COVID-19, many of the barriers faced by psychologists outside the VHA system have been addressed, and its system may serve as an exemplar of how to deploy telepsychology  (Perrin, Pierce, & Elliott, 2020) . For example, online trainings with experienced trainers are already accessible to all providers  (Caver et al., 2020) . As veterans being served by the VHA are prequalified for services, reimbursement questions are largely nonexistent. Interstate practice within the VHA system is allowed, removing another external barrier to providing telepsychological services.\n\nIn the VHA and more broadly, Medicare temporarily relaxed reimbursement restrictions during the COVID-19 pandemic and allowed reimbursement for telemedicine visits at the same rate as in-person visits (United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services [CMS], 2020). Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) regulations were eased by the United States Department of Health and Human Services' (HHS) Office for Civil Rights (OCR) to allow use of telecommunication apps like  Skype, FaceTime, and Zoom (OCR, 2020a, 2020b) . HHS also published waivers allowing telehealth providers participating in Medicare, Medicaid, and the Children's Health Insurance Program to be reimbursed for visits with patients in states they were not currently licensed within  (HHS, 2020) . Furthermore, in response to declarations of emergency, psychology boards in several states including Arizona, Califor-nia, and Texas suspended typical interjurisdictional requirements to allow psychologists not licensed within their state to provide treatment in their jurisdiction  (California Board of Psychology, 2020; State of Arizona Board of Psychologist Examiners, 2020; Texas State Board of Examiners of Psychologists, 2020) .\n\nMany professional psychology training programs and clinics moved rapidly to telepsychology with telesupervision (e.g.,  Perrin, Rybarczyk, et al., 2020) , and the Association of Psychology Postdoctoral and Internship Centers (APPIC) facilitated this, communicating that training hours via telepsychology could be counted the same as in-person  (APPIC, 2020) . Training programs were established through organizations such as the TeleBehavioral Health Institute (2020), and the American Psychological Association (APA) developed tools and resources to aid psychologists in their adoption of telepsychology (e.g.,  APA, 2020; Martin, Mill\u00e1n, & Campbell, 2020) . Psychology organizations around the world, such as the European Federation of Psychologists' Associations (EFPA) and the Australian Psychological Society (APS), also quickly developed resources for not only their members, but also consumers so they, too, could become accustomed to the idea of using telepsychology for their therapy  (APS, 2020; EFPA, 2020) ."

      "text": "Telepsychology, according to the APA, is the use of any of a number of telecommunication technologies to deliver psychological services  (APA, 2015) . Therefore, telepsychological services may run the gamut from smartphone apps meant to enhance treatment adherence  (Reger et al., 2013)  to Internet-based self-management tools for individuals with depression  (G\u00f6rges, Oehler, von Hirschhausen, Hegerl, & Rummel-Kluge, 2020)  and other extensions of in-person services  (Heesacker, Perez, Quinn, & Benton, 2020) , to synchronous provision of audiovisual telepsychotherapy  (Adler, Pritchett, Kauth, & Nadorff, 2014) . Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, telepsychology was being used but in a limited capacity. Despite the availability of the technology for some time and the findings that for many psychological issues telepsychology is just as effective as in-person sessions  (Varker, Brand, Ward, Terhaag, & Phelps, 2019) , many psychologists had been slow to adopt telepsychology as a substantial part of their practice. Previous national-level research suggested that only about 21% of psychologists used telepsychology in their clinical practice  (Pierce, Perrin, & McDonald, 2020b) . An exception to this may be psychologists in the VHA, which was an early mover in telehealth and provided nearly 100,000 patients with telehealth services between 2006 and 2010  (Godleski, Darkins, & Peters, 2012) . The VHA had been promoting the use of telepsychology as a way to reach veterans who would otherwise have limited access to mental health services because of geographic distance  (Adler et al., 2014)  and to reduce the length and frequency of psychiatric admissions  (Godleski et al., 2012) ."

      "title": "Pre-COVID-19 Barriers to Telepsychology",
      "text": "As telepsychology has been shown to be efficacious  (Varker et al., 2019)  and efficient (e.g.,  Adler et al., 2014; Darkins, 2016; Tadmor, McManus, & Koenig, 2006) , one might wonder why it was not being utilized more extensively before the COVID-19 pandemic. A number of intrapsychic and environmental barriers to the adoption of telepsychology by psychologists have been identified. For example, many psychologists seemed to have doubts regarding the ease of using telepsychology in practice, as well as how useful it might be  (Pierce et al., 2020b) . Additionally, despite acknowledging its potential usefulness for therapy, approximately 75% of psychologists and other allied providers said they were not willing to refer their clients for telepsychology  (Perle, Burt, & Higgins, 2014) . When investigated further, a lack of self-efficacy has been evident in psychologists' reasons for not utilizing telepsychology in their practices, as many cited insufficient opportunities for training as a major stumbling block in their willingness to go forward with telepsychology in their practices  (Perry, Gold, & Shearer, 2020) .\n\nIn addition to intrapsychic barriers like bias and low self-efficacy, there have been many environmental barriers for those desiring to implement telepsychology. One example of an obstacle is federal security laws such as HIPAA. While enacted to protect patient privacy, in effect it limited options for telepsychology, as it precluded the use of common telecommunication applications like Skype and Facetime for the provision of telepsychology  (APA, 2014) . Medicare regulations are another example, as they laid out specific reimbursement qualification stipulations for telehealth sessions. For example, prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, patients were required to be in a Medicaredesignated rural area and at a Medicare-specified medical treatment center in order for practitioners to receive reimbursement from Medicare for telemedicine visits. Accordingly, the American Medical Association reported that only .25% of Medicare patients received telehealth treatment  (O'Reilly, 2019) . State laws and regulations have also been limiters in the adoption of telepsychology; for example, most states require that the psychologist be licensed in the same state both they and the client are in at the time of treatment. Apart from legal regulations, the settings in which psychologists practice may restrict the implementation of telepsychology  (Pierce, Perrin, & McDonald, 2020a)  because policies and guidance on implementation are nonexistent, or there is no appropriate equipment or space available. Even when clinical settings have procured the necessary technology, technical issues on either the clinician's or patient's end can hinder willingness to use telepsychology."

      "title": "Current Study",
      "text": "The flexibility and adaptability of telehealth and telepsychology services have been touted as an important part of crisis response plans, as telehealth allows professionals to provide services to hot zones rapidly or without having to be there in person at all  (Darkins, 2016; Tadmor et al., 2006) . This allows for efficient deployment of services when and where they are needed. The use of technology to conduct remote telepsychology sessions has very likely become more widespread because of the mandated social distancing imposed by authorities in an effort to reduce the transmission of COVID-19. The pandemic has even coincided with what some have called a \"telemedicine revolution\"  (Perrin, Pierce, et al., 2020, p. 1) , although no research to date has examined precisely how the use of telepsychology by psychologists has changed during the pandemic, nor what variables may account for the change in use. As a result, the purpose of this study was to examine (a) the amount of psychologists' telepsychology use before the COVID-19 pandemic, during the pandemic, and anticipated use after the pandemic; as well as (b) the demographic, training, policy, and clinical practice predictors of these changes. To remain consistent with Medicare's expanded definition during the pandemic, within the current study, \"telepsychology\" was defined as \"the use of real-time audio (e.g., telephone) and/or video conferencing technology to provide psychological services.\" It was hypothesized that telepsychology use would increase dramatically during the pandemic relative to before the pandemic, and that this increase in use would lead psychologists to anticipate continuing to use telepsychology at higher rates after the pandemic relative to baseline, though less than during the pandemic. The results of a previous study  (Pierce et al., 2020a)  suggested that age, gender, race/ethnicity, supportive policies, receiving training, and population density accounted for 29.8% of the variance in psychologists' telepsychology use. The results also indicated that setting and treatment focus accounted for 5.3% and 13.1% (respectively) of the variance. These findings informed the variables chosen as predictors in the current study."

      "title": "Method Participants",
      "text": "Potential psychologist participants were recruited using e-mail addresses from directories of professional organizations, counseling center and mental health clinic websites, and psychology newsgroups. Eligibility requirements were that participants had to be: (a) licensed to practice as a psychologist in the United States, (b) age 18 or older, and (c) currently practicing (seeing patients) as a psychologist in the United States. Data were collected from May 11, 2020, to May 25, 2020. Initial and follow-up e-mail invitations were sent to 27,324 individuals, 3,897 of which were returned as \"undeliverable,\" and resulting in 3,694 participants who opened the survey. Of this number, 184 participants left after viewing the information sheet or indicated their refusal to provide informed consent, while 541 participants abandoned the survey at various points without completing it. Among the remainder, 198 individuals were not eligible to participate because they were not currently licensed or treating patients, and 127 were not included after refusing to answer demographic questions (e.g., age, years in practice). Finally, 25 participants' data were excluded from analysis after they provided nonsensical responses to the validity check question (\"In one sentence or less, what do you think the purpose of this study was?\"), years of practice being equal to or less than the participant's reported age, or years of practice reported indicating the psychologist started practicing prior to age 18. These exclusions resulted in a final sample of 2,619 licensed, currently practicing psychologists and an 11.18% completed response rate.\n\nPsychologists in this sample had an average age of 57.29 years with 35.4% identifying as men and 64.2% as women. These closely resembled APA membership demographics (57.8 years, 41.4% men, and 57.8% women; APA, 2018). The average number of years in practice was 24.22, with most individuals having an individual practice (54.4%) in a suburban (46.9%) or urban (43.9%) setting. Full sample demographics appear in Table  1 ."

      "title": "Measures",
      "text": "In addition to demographic data about themselves, their practice location and setting, and treatment foci, participants were asked to provide responses regarding their telepsychology use, training, and organizational policies relative to January 20, 2020, when the first COVID-19 case was confirmed in the United States. Medicaid and Medicare define \"telemedicine\" as \"two-way, real time interactive communication between the patient, and the physician or practitioner at the distant site\" (United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2019). Medicare also makes further distinction between telehealth visits which they specify use audio and video communication between the provider and the patient. Communication using telephone only is termed a \"virtual check-in\" (United States Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2020). The United States Drug Enforcement Administration limits this definition of telemedicine even further to only include health care facilitated by real-time, two-way, audio/video interactions between the practitioner and their patients (United States Drug Enforce-ment Administration Diversion Control Division, 2019). To remain consistent with this trend and, in particular, the expansion of telepsychology reimbursement during the pandemic under Medicare, telepsychology was defined to participants as the use of real-time audio (e.g., telephone) and/or video conferencing technology to provide psychological services.\n\nThe researcher-generated telepsychology questions used were: (a) \"What percentage of your patient treatment is provided using telepsychology?\" with answers ranging from 0%-100%; (b) \"I have been trained well to use telepsychology,\" with a 7-point, Likert-type scale ranging from 1 (Strongly Disagree) to 7 (Strongly Agree); and (c) \"My organizational policies support telepsychology,\" measured on the same Likert-type scale. For all three questions, participants responded three times with regard to the following prompts: (a) \"Before the COVID-19 pandemic began in the U.S. on January 20, 2020\"; (b) \"During the COVID-19 pandemic in the U.S.\"; and (c) \"Your anticipated perspective or behaviors after the COVID-19 pandemic ends in the U.S.\" The amount of change for the current primary analyses was determined by subtracting participants' responses about their telepsychology use before the pandemic from their answers during the pandemic."

Additionally, all potential participants received a reminder e-mail one week after the initial invitation was sent. If the providers elected to participate, they had to agree to an informed consent document before being directed to the Qualtrics web platform and screened for eligibility. Participants completed a number of demographic questions about themselves and their practice, read the telepsychology definition used in this survey, and then answered the questions about telepsychology."

A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted in which the predictor variable was time (3 levels: before the COVID-19 pandemic, during the pandemic, and projected after the pandemic), and the criterion variable was percentage of clinical work performed via telepsychology.\n\nThen, four ANOVAs were conducted examining the effects of primary treatment setting on (a) prepandemic percentage of clinical work performed via telepsychology, (b) that percentage during pandemic, (c) that percentage projected after the pandemic, and (d) change from percentage of clinical work performed via telepsychology before the pandemic to the percentage during the pandemic. These ANOVAs included only participants who worked in primary treatment settings selected by 25 or more participants, and participants who chose the \"other\" designation were excluded. For these four ANO-VAs only, this resulted in not including participants who worked in correctional facilities, geriatric facilities, psychiatric hospitals, rehabilitation centers, residential treatment centers, or other practice settings. Finally, two multiple regression analyses were conducted to examine the statistical effects of (a) participant demographics, change in workplace telepsychology policy, change in telepsychology training, practice geographic area, and (b) treatment focus on the change in the percentage of clinical work conducted via telepsychology before relative to during the COVID-19 pandemic. In both regressions, the criterion variable was the percentage of clinical work conducted via telepsychology during the pandemic minus the percentage conducted via telepsychology before the pandemic. The first model's predictors included age, gender (1 \u03ed woman, 0 \u03ed man or transgender or nonbinary), race/ethnicity (1 \u03ed White/ European American, 0 \u03ed racial/ethnic minority), the relative change in perceived organizational support via telepsychology policies, relative change in perceived levels of telepsychology training received, and the geographic area type where the practice was located (1 \u03ed rural vs. 0 \u03ed urban or suburban). The second model's predictors included dummy-coded variables representing a variety of issues and diagnoses the psychologists' treated within their practice."

Psychologists in outpatient treatment facilities and academic medical centers reported the lowest.

The largest increase in percentage telepsychology use during the pandemic occurred in group practice, particularly relative to the low percentage increases in hospital/medical practice and VA medical centers. However, in terms of fold increase, psychologists in outpatient treatment facilities reported over a 26-fold increase, followed by psychologists in an academic medical center who reported over a 23-fold increase; by contrast, psychologists in VA medical centers only reported just over a sevenfold increase.

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "The current study is among the first to examine United States psychologists' percentage of clinical work performed via telepsychology before, during, and projected after the COVID-19 pandemic, and to examine demographic, training, policy, and clinical practice predictors of these changes. This study is notable in that it drew data from a large national sample of 2,619 licensed psychologists currently practicing within the United States. Results supported hypotheses that use of telepsychology would significantly increase during the pandemic relative to prepandemic rates, and that psychologists would anticipate continuing to use telepsychology after the pandemic at higher rates than at baseline, though less than during the pandemic. Subsequent analyses also demonstrated the statistical effects of specific demographic, training, policy, and clinical practice characteristics on the change in use of telepsychology, suggesting that psychologists may be differentially able or willing to incorporate it into their own practice.\n\nThese findings document an unprecedented shift in the uptake of telepsychology, as rates of utilization increased dramatically during the pandemic. Consistent with previous national research demonstrating low rates of telepsychology use with only about one fifth of practicing psychologists using telepsychology in their practice  (Pierce et al., 2020b) , psychologists in the current study estimated performing 7.07% of their clinical work with telepsychology before the pandemic. This is in stark comparison to psychologists' estimates that telepsychology comprised 85.53% of their clinical work during the pandemic, an over 12-fold increase. Moreover, participants projected that 34.96% of their clinical work would be conducted via telepsychology even after the pandemic ceases, reflecting an important shift in attitudes toward the use of telepsychology. This represents a nearly fivefold increase from prepandemic rates, indicating the high likelihood of long-lasting changes in the use of telepsychology even after COVID-19-related concerns are ameliorated. These results serve to illustrate the telemedicine revolution  (Perrin, Pierce, et al., 2020, p. 1)  occurring with practice, policy, and attitudes toward telepsychology during the COVID-19 pandemic. Psychologists reported increasing the percentage of their clinical work via telepsychology at record rates, even within the VHA, where training and infrastructure have been in place for over a decade  (Godleski et al., 2012) . These results are also notable because they document the efforts of practicing psychologists to meet the increased mental health needs of the public. Research has already recorded increases in symptoms of anxiety and depression in the general population during the pandemic  (Gao et al., 2020; Qiu et al., 2020) , while simultaneously observing decreased access to traditional coping strategies  (Harandi et al., 2017)  and in-person options for health care (e.g.,  ACS, 2020; CDC, 2020b) . Telepsychology presents an opportunity for psychologists to meet many patients' mental health needs while supporting efforts to limit virus transmission.\n\nOverall, psychologists in group and individual practices reported the highest percentage use of telepsychology during the pandemic, though these percentages were only statistically different from psychologists in a hospital/medical practice, who reported the lowest percentage use. Psychologists in group practice reported the largest increase in telepsychology use during COVID-19 relative to baseline, with smaller increases in use observed in hospital/medical practice and VA medical centers. Within the VHA, lower change in percentage use was likely due in part to the higher-than-average rates of telepsychology use before COVID-19, and perhaps the level of bureaucracy involved in implementing additional changes relative to more nimble practice settings. These results suggest differential abilities of psychologists to introduce or increase telepsychology practice based on primary practice setting.\n\nCertainly, many commonly cited barriers to telepsychology were addressed on a national scale, such as privacy and security regulations  (APA, 2014; OCR, 2020a OCR, , 2020b)) , Medicare reimbursement (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2020), and training (e.g., APA, 2020), which likely impacted the universal increases in percentage of telepsychology use documented here. However, these findings also suggest that psychologists in group practice had access to the support needed to transition to telepsychology in conjunction with fewer procedural obstacles to overcome, and that working within a group practice provided opportunities for psychologists to address remaining environmental and individual barriers to uptake. For example, while psychologists have previously reported concerns about ease of telepsychology use  (Pierce et al., 2020b) , access to other practitioners within the group and/or administrative personnel may have increased the likelihood that typical concerns were readily addressed, particularly if a colleague was already using telepsychology. Further, new policies and guidance on telepsychology may have been more quickly and easily implemented within a group practice in comparison to a hospital system or VA medical center, where the more complex policy-making infrastructure may have slowed implementation.\n\nResults also supported previous research findings  (Pierce et al., 2020a ) that uptake of telepsychology during the pandemic would relate to several demographic variables.\n\nWoman-identified gender, nonrural practice setting, increased organizational policies supporting telepsychology, and increased training in telepsychology were all associated with increases in percentage of telepsychology use. Age and race/ethnicity were not associated with changes in telepsychology service provision. Despite the lack of age effects, the mean age and experience of the sample indicate that many participants probably trained in an era with less video conferencing technology; therefore many of these psychologists likely learned this approach and adapted rapidly during the demands of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nThese findings have several important implications. First, the finding that psychologists who self-identified as women showed greater increases in percentage of telepsychology suggest that gender role variables may have affected these changes. For example, given that women tend to provide the majority of childcare  (Bianchi, Sayer, Milkie, & Robinson, 2012) , woman-identifying psychologists with children may have experienced a greater need to increase telepsychology use in order to facilitate provision of care at home after schools and childcare options were closed. Psychologists in rural locations may have experienced a lower demand for telepsychology, as initial rates of COVID-19 cases were generally higher in more populated states  (CDC, 2020a) . Previous research indicates rural psychologists have been less likely to use telepsychology within their practice  (Pierce et al., 2020a) . With that in mind, rural psychologists eager to offer their expertise to help areas more severely affected by the pandemic may experience the added benefit of filling openings within their schedules  (Centore & Milacci, 2008) . Rural psychologists or their patients may also have had limited access to technology required for telepsychology such as reliable high-speed Internet. The findings regarding training and policies underscore the importance of adequate organizational support in addressing both environmental and intrapsychic barriers to telepsychology use. This is reinforced by the finding that psychologists in VA medical centers reported higher percentage use before COVID-19 than psychologists in all other primary practice settings except individual practice, given VHA's history of telepsychology infrastructure and accessibility of training (e.g.,  Caver et al., 2020) .\n\nFinally, the current study explored therapeutic issues and diagnoses associated with increased telepsychology use during the pandemic in comparison to telepsychology use prior to the pandemic. These results suggested that some presenting concerns may be less amenable to clinical work via telepsychology, or that psychologists treating these issues experienced greater concerns about the use of telepsychology. It should be noted that while the overall regression model uncovered a medium-sized effect, the unique effects within the model were quite small and should be interpreted through that lens. The findings might suggest that psychologists believe that complex or severe symptomatology such as antisocial personality disorder, behavioral issues, and bipolar disorder may be more difficult to treat via telepsychology or may require specialized training for psychologists to feel comfortable adapting treatment to telepsychology; psychologists may also be reluctant to treat these issues via telepsychology because of perceived safety concerns. Traumatic brain injury and physical medicine and rehabilitation may be difficult to treat via telepsychology because of the need to coordinate care with in-person services like medical examinations and physical therapy. Testing and evaluation were also associated with lower increases in telepsychology uptake, which could indicate limited access to tests adapted for telepsychology use and concerns regarding test security. In contrast, anxiety, relationship difficulties, sleep/insomnia, and women's issues were associated with greater increases in telepsychology uptake. To some extent, this finding may be impacted by increased rates of problems in these areas related to COVID-19 and therefore to increased demand for services. However, these results also suggest that these issues may be particularly amenable to treatment via telepsychology or that psychologists are more open to providing for these concerns using telepsychology."

      "text": "The substantial changes in percentage of telepsychology use observed in the current study suggest that many of the previously documented barriers to telepsychology have been addressed, at least on a temporary basis, either by procedural changes or by the immediate needs of patients and providers during the COVID-19 pandemic. While some facilitating changes may be short-lived, these results also show that psychologists plan to continue using telepsychology at greater rates in the future relative to before the pandemic, suggesting important shifts in attitudes toward the use of telepsychology. Adequate training in telepsychology and supportive organizational policies and procedures appear to be an important component in increasing use, and are likely to continue to be a crucial factor in maintaining telepsychology use after risks of in-person health care associated with COVID-19 have lessened. A number of training resources exist, including trainings and tools published through the APA (e.g., APA, 2020), VHA, and others. In terms of training, it is surprising that psychologists within academic settings were not using telepsychology more often prior to the pandemic, and that they anticipated after the pandemic that they would be using it less than psychologists within individual practice, group practice, hospitals, and VA medical centers. Students enrolled in professional psychology training programs may benefit from access to information and training with telepsychology as an integral part of the curriculum. These findings also highlight factors associated with less substantial increases in telepsychology use that could serve as targets for future interventions to support telepsychology uptake. This study found that woman-identifying psychologists and those in nonrural primary practice settings were most likely to increase telepsychology use. Future research could explore in greater detail barriers to uptake in psychologists who identified as men, transgender, or nonbinary, as well as psychologists in rural practice settings, and additional training or supportive policy changes could be implemented to address these discrepancies if appropriate. Moreover, future interventions and research could be targeted at clinical issues associated with lower rates of uptake; for example, the findings regarding testing and evaluation suggest a need for valid computer adapted assessments that patients can complete from their homes without violating administration norms or test security practices."

      "title": "Limitations and Future Directions",
      "text": "The findings from the current study should be interpreted within the context of several limitations. The observational nature of the study precludes causal inferences about patterns in telepsychology use and uptake. Thus, although the study found demographic and practice-related predictors of increases in rate of telepsychology use, these variables are not necessarily causally related. Also, the recruitment method resulted in an 11.18% rate of completed response. Although this is typical for completion rates for emailed web survey invitations  (Liu & Wronski, 2018; Petrovc \u02c7ic \u02c7, Petric \u02c7, & Lozar Manfreda, 2016)  and the sample demographics closely mirrored APA membership demographics (APA, 2018), there may be meaningful difference between those who opted to participate and those who did not. A large number of participants were excluded due to not providing informed consent, not completing the survey, or providing invalid answers to survey questions. Since the survey did not collect identifiable information (e.g., e-mail address, IP addresses) or use digital cookies to track and store progress, participants were required to complete the survey all at once, rather than saving progress to return later. Therefore, a substantial number of those not included (541 participants) may have abandoned the survey to attend to something else or experienced technical issues. Although no mention of telepsychology was made in the recruitment e-mail, it could be that those individuals who started but did not complete the survey differed in some way from other participants on views of telepsychology or psychotherapy practice. Also, there was small representation in the sample from psychologists practicing within correctional facilities, geriatric facilities, psychiatric hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and residential treatment centers. These settings typically have higher levels of in-person contact with the population they treat since their patients often reside on site.\n\nThe study would have greatly benefited from the views of psychologists working within these environments.\n\nSince data for the current study were collected in May 2020 during the first wave of the pandemic, additional research is needed to determine whether the results will hold if the pandemic persists for longer than originally projected, or if additional waves of positive cases occur. For example, if the United States continues to experience high rates of positive cases in the absence of a widely available vaccine or effective treatments, it is possible that rates of telepsychology use may continue to increase, as patients may feel that they can no longer wait to access services.\n\nThe survey questions did not ask participants to differentiate between their use of video-conferencing and telephone in the definition of telepsychology (\"real-time audio (e.g., telephone) and/or video conferencing technology\"), which was consistent with CMS definitions. Some psychologists may have communicated answers differently based on each delivery method, so future research should not only document rates of telepsychology use, but also nuances therein such as delivery methods and type of clinical work performed (e.g., psychotherapy vs. assessment). Although age was not revealed to be a significant predictor of change in telepsychology use during the pandemic, there may have been differences between younger and older participants in the type of telepsychology they use. These analyses also did not examine participants' level of competency with telepsychology or ask about specific content within any training they have received. Future studies may consider exploring these topics.\n\nAlso, this study was generally conducted from the vantage point that increased adoption of telepsychology is advantageous for the field and the public. As a result, variables were not included that could have shed extensive light on the limitations of telepsychology, such as barriers to adoption, negative feedback reported by patients, impact on clinical care, and so forth. Future research should attempt to assess for variables reflecting the limitations of telepsychology, rather than just its potential. Finally, the current study partly relied on psychologists' recall of how often they were using telepsychology before the pandemic. Previous research has demonstrated that individuals' recall of activities and experiences are affected by multiple recall biases  (Solhan, Trull, Jahng, & Wood, 2009) . Although psychologists were asked about overall telepsychology use just a few months prior, their answers concerning certain activities in their daily practice may have been distorted. Similarly, the current study assessed psychologists' predictions in the percentage of their future clinical work that would be conducted via telepsychology, future policy impacts on telepsychology are not yet known. For example, it is unclear whether privacy/security regulations will be amended after the pandemic or will revert to prepandemic rules, and whether telepsychology services will continue to be reim-bursed at rates comparable to in-person services. These policy changes may have substantial impacts on psychologists' availability and attitudes toward offering telepsychology, even as self-efficacy and ease of use may increase over time. Additionally, ongoing research is necessary to evaluate the impact of these policy decisions on psychologists' service delivery in order to ensure that the mental health needs of the general public are adequately met."
