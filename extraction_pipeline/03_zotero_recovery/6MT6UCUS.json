  "title": "AI-driven multi-agent reinforcement learning framework for real-time monitoring of physiological signals in stress and depression contexts",
  "abstract": "Purpose Effective patient monitoring is crucial for timely healthcare interventions and improved outcomes, especially in managing conditions influenced by stress and depression, which can manifest through physiological changes. Traditional monitoring systems often struggle with the complexity and dynamic nature of such conditions, leading to delays in identifying critical scenarios. This study proposes a novel multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework to address these challenges by monitoring vital signs and providing real-time decision-making capabilities. Methods Our framework deploys multiple learning agents, each dedicated to monitoring specific physiological features such as heart rate, respiration, and temperature. These agents interact with a generic healthcare monitoring environment, learn patients' behavior patterns, and estimate the level of emergency to alert Medical Emergency Teams (METs) accordingly. The study evaluates the proposed system using two real-world datasets-PPG-DaLiA and WESAD-designed to capture physiological and stress-related data. The performance is compared with baseline models, including Q-Learning, PPO, Actor-Critic, Double DQN, and DDPG, as well as existing monitoring frameworks like WISEML and CA-MAQL. Hyperparameter optimization is also performed to fine-tune learning rates and discount factors. \n Results Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed multi-agent DRL framework outperforms baseline models in accurately monitoring patients' vital signs under stress and varying conditions. The optimized agents adapt effectively to dynamic environments, ensuring timely detection of critical health deviations. Comparative evaluations reveal superior performance in metrics related to decision-making accuracy and response efficiency, highlighting the robustness of the framework. \n Conclusions The proposed AI-driven monitoring system offers significant advancements over traditional methods by handling complex and uncertain environments, adapting to varying patient conditions influenced by stress and depression, and making autonomous, real-time decisions. While the framework demonstrates high accuracy and adaptability, challenges related to data scale and future vital sign prediction remain. Future research will focus on extending predictive capabilities to further enhance proactive healthcare interventions.",

      "text": "Mental health disorders, particularly depression and stress, are among the most pervasive global health challenges today, significantly impacting individuals' wellbeing and productivity  [1] . These conditions, often referred to as\"silent epidemics,\"require early detection and timely interventions to mitigate their effects. However, traditional approaches to mental health management have often been reactive, addressing symptoms only after they manifest significantly. This underscores the urgent need for proactive monitoring and assessment frameworks that can identify early warning signs, enabling clinicians to intervene effectively before the conditions escalate.\n\nThe physiological and behavioral manifestations of depression and stress, such as changes in heart rate, respiration patterns, and body temperature, provide measurable indicators of an individual's mental health state  [2, 3] . Modern advancements in wearable technology and Internet of Things (IoT)-enabled systems now make it possible to continuously monitor these indicators in real time, presenting new opportunities to enhance mental health care. However, the challenge lies in effectively analyzing the complex, multi-dimensional data generated by these systems and deriving actionable insights to guide clinical decisions.\n\nTraditional machine learning (ML) techniques have been extensively employed in this domain to classify physiological signals, identify patterns, and predict health outcomes  [4, 5] . These methods have laid a strong foundation for developing monitoring frameworks but are inherently limited by their reliance on static models that do not adapt to changing conditions or learn dynamically from ongoing data streams. They are primarily observational, suggesting potential courses of action without the ability to autonomously adapt or act in response to the observed patterns.\n\nReinforcement Learning (RL) represents a paradigm shift in this context by enabling autonomous agents to actively interact with their environment, learn from feedback, and optimize their actions to achieve predefined objectives  [6] . Unlike traditional ML models, RL agents leverage a reward-driven approach where each action taken by the agent is evaluated through a reward mechanism that reinforces favorable behaviors and discourages undesirable ones. This iterative learning process allows RL agents to adapt dynamically to complex, uncertain, and ever-evolving environments, making RL an ideal candidate for healthcare applications that require precision, adaptability, and responsiveness.\n\nRL has already demonstrated its potential in various domains, including dynamic treatment optimization, diagnostic decision-making, and medication scheduling  [7] [8] [9] . For instance, RL algorithms have been used to optimize the timing and dosage of medications, ensuring that treatments are administered at the most effective intervals. The analogy of RL agents acting as virtual clinicians, continuously monitoring a patient's state and making decisions based on observed changes, highlights the transformative potential of this technology in healthcare  [10] .\n\nIn this study, we propose a novel monitoring framework that utilizes multi-agent Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) to address the complexities associated with monitoring depression and stress. The framework is designed to analyze and interpret real-time physiological data, enabling clinicians to detect deviations from normal patterns and respond proactively. Each DRL agent is dedicated to monitoring a specific physiological parameter, such as heart rate, respiration rate, or body temperature, and learns optimal thresholds based on Modified Early Warning Scores (MEWS)  [11] . By introducing a clinically-informed reward mechanism, the framework enables these agents to continuously refine their decision-making capabilities, ensuring timely and accurate alerts to medical teams (Fig.  1 ).\n\nThe proposed framework represents a significant advancement over traditional RL models by employing a multi-agent architecture that allows simultaneous monitoring of multiple vital signs. This distributed approach enhances the system's scalability, enabling it to handle the complexities of real-world healthcare scenarios where multiple parameters must be monitored concurrently. Furthermore, the novel reward system ensures that the agents are aligned with clinically relevant objectives, optimizing their behavior to support timely medical interventions.\n\nThe contributions of this study are summarized as follows:\n\n\u2022 Introduction of a clinically-informed reward mechanism tailored to support RL agents in learning behavior patterns indicative of depression and stress.\n\n\u2022 Development of a generic, multi-agent monitoring environment that enables simultaneous tracking of various physiological parameters. \u2022 Establishment of a novel paradigm for remote monitoring of mental health conditions, leveraging multiagent DRL to provide actionable insights in real-time. The rest of this paper is organized as follows: Sect. 2 reviews related literature on RL applications in healthcare and mental health monitoring. Section 3 provides a detailed description of the research problem, technical background, and proposed methodology. Experimental setup and evaluation metrics are discussed in Sect. 4, followed by an analysis of the results and insights in Sect. 5. Applications and implications are discussed in Sect. 6, and Sect. 7 concludes the paper by outlining limitations and future directions."

      "text": "Machine learning (ML) has transformed healthcare by providing predictive, diagnostic, and monitoring solutions across various domains  [12] . Supervised learning algorithms, in particular, leverage labeled datasets to make predictions and classifications based on input features  [13, 14] . For instance, ML and deep learning techniques have been employed to predict vital signs like heart rate and classify physical activities  [15] . In the context of mental health, ML models have demonstrated efficacy in detecting stress and depression through the analysis of physiological and behavioral data  [16, 17] . Stress and depression are critical public health concerns, often linked to chronic conditions like cardiovascular disease and diabetes. Early detection of these conditions can significantly improve outcomes by facilitating timely interventions.\n\nOyeleye et al.  [18]  investigated ML and deep learning models to estimate heart rate using wearable devices, comparing various regression algorithms including linear regression, k-nearest neighbor (kNN), decision tree, and LSTM. Similarly, Luo et al.  [19]  utilized LSTM models to predict heart rate by integrating factors such as gender, age, physical activity  [20] , and mental state, highlighting the relevance of mental well-being in monitoring overall health.\n\nUnsupervised learning algorithms further contribute by deriving patterns from unlabeled data, employing clustering and association techniques  [21, 22] . Sheng and Huber  [21]  proposed an encoder-decoder framework to cluster physical activity data, achieving high accuracy by learning behavioral embeddings. Despite their strengths, these traditional ML techniques face limitations in dynamically adapting to uncertain environments or integrating diverse data sources.\n\nReinforcement Learning (RL) addresses these gaps by enabling systems to learn through interaction with their environment  [23] . Unlike supervised approaches, RL relies on rewards or penalties to optimize decision-making processes, making it particularly suited for real-time and sequential decision-making tasks  [24] . This capability is critical for monitoring complex conditions like stress and depression, where continuous data-driven interventions can prevent deterioration."

Such frameworks emphasize the importance of understanding both highlevel behaviors (e.g., emotional and cognitive states) and low-level behaviors (e.g., speech, gestures, and physiological signals)  [29] .

[30]  demonstrated how RL could optimize the timing of interventions for cancer patients, employing models such as Deep Q-Learning (DQL), Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C), and Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to develop virtual coaches for personalized prompts. Personalized interventions, including messaging for diabetes patients, have shown efficacy in increasing physical activity and improving mental health  [31] .\n\nLi et al.

[33]  proposed a dynamic weight assignment network inspired by advanced RL algorithms, demonstrating its application in human activity recognition. RL's ability to integrate multi-agent frameworks further enhances its potential for mental health monitoring by enabling concurrent learning across multiple parameters. Despite RL's success in areas like gaming and assistive robotics, its deployment in healthcare, especially for mental health conditions, poses unique challenges. Traditional approaches struggle with the safety and uncertainty inherent in dynamic healthcare environments. Stress and depression monitoring, for example, require systems that can adapt to fluctuating physiological and behavioral data. Our study introduces a multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) framework designed specifically for these challenges. Unlike single-agent systems, MARL allows for concurrent monitoring of multiple physiological parameters, each modeled by a specialized agent. This framework is particularly suited for stress and depression monitoring, where indicators such as heart rate variability, sleep disruptions, and activity levels must be continuously analyzed.\n\nBy incorporating a clinically-informed reward mechanism, our MARL framework aligns agent behavior with healthcare objectives, ensuring timely interventions. This approach not only addresses safety concerns but also enhances the scalability and adaptability of mental health monitoring systems, providing a novel contribution to AI-driven healthcare."

The aim of the system is to monitor vital signs to learn human behavior patterns and ensure clinical safety in an uncertain environment. The proposed framework involves a multi-agent system where each vital sign state is observed by an individual agent, as shown in Fig.  2 .

      "title": "3.1. Technical background",
      "text": "The challenge addressed in this research is the development of a multi-agent framework for real-time health status monitoring by learning and interpreting patterns in vital signs through wearable sensors. The agents must detect deviations from normal vital sign patterns that exceed Modified Early Warning Scores (MEWS) thresholds and alert the emergency team accordingly.\n\nTo formulate this problem, we leverage the framework of Markov Decision Processes (MDP), expressed as a 5-tuple M = (S, A, P, R, \u03b3 ) . Here, S represents the finite state space, where each state s t \u2208 S corresponds to a distinct combination of vital sign readings at time t. The action set A comprises potential alerts the agents can issue based on the observed vital signs. The transition function P(s, a, s \u2032 ) models the probability of moving from state s to state s \u2032 upon taking action a, reflecting the dynamic nature of human vital signs.\n\nCentral to our approach is the reward function R(s, a), which is defined to prioritize actions that lead to the early detection of potential health risks, thereby enabling timely intervention. This is mathematically represented as:\n\nwhere \u03b3 is the discount factor that balances the impor- tance of immediate versus future rewards, ensuring the agents' actions are aligned with long-term health monitoring objectives.\n\nThe goal is to discover an optimal policy \u03c0(s t ) that maximizes the expected reward by selecting the most appropriate action a t in any given state s t . This optimi- zation is achieved through the iterative update of the Q-function, as outlined in the Bellman equation:\n\nwhere \u03b1 represents the learning rate, influencing the inte- gration of new information into the Q-function. Through this process, the agents continually refine their decisionmaking strategy, enhancing the system's capability to monitor and respond to emerging health risks effectively."

      "text": "A custom RL monitoring system based on MDP has been created to have human vital signs data serve as the observation space S, action space A for learning agents to make decisions, and rewards R for the agents' actions as depicted in Fig.  2 . This study introduces a novel isolated multi-agent MDP framework that allows multi-agents to share the same environment and make decisions based on the health parameters they are monitoring, receiving\n\nrewards without being influenced by the decisions of other agents. The goal of all agents in this environment is to monitor the health of patients using the predefined MEWS, as shown in Tab. 1. In healthcare, each vital sign plays a critical role in determining a person's clinical safety.\n\nIn the current framework, we have implemented three RL agents to monitor heart rate, respiration, and temperature. These agents operate primarily in cooperative mode, sharing information about the patient's health status and working together to ensure timely interventions. Cooperation allows the agents to pool rewards from collective actions, improving overall system learning. However, when multiple patients are being monitored or resource constraints arise (e.g., limited access to medical personnel), the agents may enter competitive mode. In this mode, agents prioritize the most critical health states and may compete for resources by adjusting the urgency of alerts based on the patient's condition. As the number of agents increases, the framework is designed to scale effectively. Each additional agent monitors new physiological parameters or additional patients, with the system adjusting the reward mechanism and communication strategy to maintain efficient performance. The system remains modular, enabling easy expansion without significantly impacting computational load or decision-making speed. Importantly, the system's ability to operate in both cooperative and competitive modes ensures flexibility, allowing it to adapt to various healthcare scenarios, including large-scale monitoring in hospitals."

      "text": "The environment in Fig.  2  has a state, represented by s i t \u01ebS , where i = 0, 1, 2, ...n , refers to observations at time t. The aim is to divide the state into observations and allocate them to multi-agents. Suppose S represents the state of the human body, and there are three observations, s 0 t , s 1 t , s 2 t \u01ebS , that represent different internal vital signs of the human body at time t. The human health status is controlled by multiple internal vital signs, each with a different threshold as shown in MEWS Tab. 1. Using a single agent to monitor all the vital signs can result in a sparse rewards challenge  [16] , where the environment might produce few useful rewards and hinders the learning of an agent. Therefore, multi-agents need to be deployed for each human to monitor the critical vital signs. The expected return E \u03c0 of a policy \u03c0 in a state s can be defined by state-value Eq. 3 in the multi-agent setting, where i = 0, 1, 2, 3, ...n is a finite number of observations n in the state."

      "title": "3.2.3. Rewards",
      "text": "The reward policy is designed to incentivize accurate monitoring and timely alerts. Agents are positively rewarded for actions aligned with MEWS thresholds (Table  2 ), ensuring critical conditions like stress-induced hyperthermia or depression-related bradycardia are prioritized. Rewards are categorized for each action, as shown in Eq. 6. This encourages agents to maximize cumulative rewards and learn behavior patterns, crucial for addressing mental health risks.\n\nThe goal of RL is to maximize cumulative rewards obtained through the actions of learning agents in an environment. In traditional RL, an agent is rewarded based on its action that leads to a transition from state s t to s t+1 . In this study, the objective of the learning agent is to learn patterns in human vital signs. This is achieved through the design of an effective reward policy. The reward policy, as defined in this study, is calculated using Eq. 5. The agents are positively rewarded if they monitor vital signs in a state and take the correct action from the action space to communicate with the correct MET as defined in MEWS Tab. 1. On the other hand, if the agent takes the wrong action, it is negatively rewarded. The rewards are split into five categories for the five actions in the action space based on the MET from MEWS Tab. 1. The full rewards for each action selected by the agents are presented in Tab. 2. The reward policy utilizes the DRL agents' desire to maximize rewards in each learning iteration, making them learn the behavior patterns. Under each category, different levels of rewards were configured. For example, an observation s 1 t \u01ebS at the time t is related to heart rate falling under MET-4, the rewards are shown in Eq. 6.\n\n(4) Correctness Determination in Reward Design The clinically-informed reward mechanism in our framework is designed to reflect the accuracy of agent decisions with respect to established triage protocols. Each physiological observation is assigned a severity band based on the Modified Early Warning Scores (MEWS), which are widely used in clinical settings to determine escalation levels. If the agent selects the correct Medical Emergency Team (MET) level that corresponds to the MEWSderived threshold (for instance, selecting MET-3 when the heart rate exceeds 130 bpm), it receives a high positive reward (+10). In contrast, if the agent overestimates or underestimates the appropriate escalation level, it is penalized proportionally (e.g., -1 to-4) based on the deviation from the correct action. This graded reward policy allows agents to learn both clinical accuracy and escalation sensitivity, supporting a balance between safety (avoiding false negatives) and efficiency (avoiding false positives)."

Through empirical testing, we found that an exploration rate \u01eb between 0.1 and 0.2 provided the optimal balance in our healthcare environment. This range ensured that agents could adapt to changing patient conditions while still providing timely and accurate interventions.

These cumulative rewards quantify the agents' ability to make correct decisions based on real-time physiological data, which is essential for ensuring timely medical interventions. Given the critical nature of healthcare systems, focusing on cumulative rewards allowed for the evaluation of how well the agents were trained to detect early signs of health deterioration.\n\nTo provide a more holistic evaluation, we introduced additional performance metrics:\n\n\u2022 Learning Rate: This metric evaluates how quickly the agents converge to an optimal policy, which is vital in healthcare applications where rapid adaptation to changing patient conditions is crucial. Faster learning ensures that the agents can respond to emergencies in real time, improving the effectiveness of the system. \u2022 Computational Complexity: This metric assesses the system's processing demands, particularly in terms of CPU/GPU time. Minimizing computational complexity is essential in healthcare settings with resource constraints, such as hospitals or wearable monitoring devices. Lower complexity ensures that the system can run efficiently without causing delays in decision-making. \u2022 Memory Usage: As the system scales to monitor multiple physiological parameters across various agents, memory usage becomes a key factor. Efficient memory utilization is critical for deploying the framework on resource-constrained devices like wearables, ensuring scalability and adaptability without compromising performance.\n\nIncorporating these metrics provides a more comprehensive evaluation of the proposed framework, ensuring not only its effectiveness in terms of rewards but also its efficiency, scalability, and real-world deployment potential in healthcare environments."

      "title": "5.1. DRL agents performance",
      "text": "The performance of the proposed DRL framework was evaluated using two datasets, with a focus on cumulative rewards, learning rate, computational complexity, and memory usage. Additionally, we expanded our comparison to include multi-agent RL frameworks, MADDPG and QMIX, to assess how well these frameworks handle the complexities of real-time health monitoring tasks.\n\nThe results are summarized in Tab. 3, which includes the performance of single-agent RL methods (Q-Learning, PPO, A2C, and DDPG) and multi-agent RL models (MADDPG and QMIX). The proposed DRL framework consistently outperforms all other models in terms of cumulative rewards, with significant improvements over the baseline methods.\n\nAs shown in Tab. 3, the proposed DRL framework surpasses both MADDPG and QMIX in cumulative rewards for both datasets, particularly excelling in agent 1's performance on the PPG-DaLia dataset. This indicates that our framework's design, which includes a tailored reward mechanism based on Modified Early Warning Scores (MEWS), enables more efficient learning in healthcare environments. Additionally, the exploration-exploitation trade-off in our system is better optimized for the variability of physiological data.\n\nTo provide a more intuitive assessment of the framework's performance, we evaluated the classification accuracy of the agents by comparing their actions against MEWS-derived ground truth escalation levels. Accuracy was computed as the ratio of correct escalation actions (e.g., MET-2 chosen when MEWS score corresponds to MET-2) to the total number of decisions made across episodes. This metric offers a clinically relevant view of agent performance, especially for practitioners accustomed to discrete outcome measures. The proposed DRL agents achieved an average decision accuracy of 88.3% across all episodes and subjects, outperforming baseline models such as PPO (79.1%), A2C (76.4%), and Double DQN (81.6%). These results demonstrate that the agents not only maximize cumulative rewards but also maintain high decision accuracy in real-time physiological monitoring tasks.\n\nBeyond cumulative rewards, we evaluated the proposed DRL framework against baseline models using additional performance metrics, including learning rate, computational complexity, and memory usage, as shown in Tab. 4. The proposed DRL framework showed superior performance across all these metrics, indicating its suitability for real-time applications in resource-constrained healthcare environments.\n\nIn terms of learning rate, the proposed DRL framework converged after 850 epochs, outperforming all baseline models, including Q-Learning (1200 epochs) and Double DQN (1100 epochs). This faster convergence demonstrates the DRL framework's enhanced efficiency in learning complex healthcare scenarios. Faster learning is especially critical in healthcare, where timely interventions directly impact patient outcomes. The use of multiple agents, each dedicated to a specific physiological metric, accelerates policy optimization and enhances responsiveness in dynamic, real-world environments.\n\nFor computational complexity, the proposed DRL framework exhibited a significantly lower iteration time of 0.70 s, outperforming more complex multi-agent models like CA-MQL (1.30 s) and PPO (1.10 s). This indicates that the framework is computationally efficient, making it ideal for real-time healthcare monitoring where decision delays could compromise patient safety. This improved efficiency is due to an optimized reward structure and action space, which reduces the time required for decision-making without compromising accuracy.\n\nIn terms of memory usage, the DRL framework consumed 110MB, which is lower than all other baseline models, such as DDPG (160MB) and CA-MQL (175MB). This low memory footprint is crucial for deploying the framework on resource-constrained hardware like wearable devices or low-power hospital systems. The efficient memory usage ensures the system can scale with additional agents without overloading system resources, making the framework suitable for large-scale healthcare applications.\n\nAll three learning agents were fed with physiological features such as heart rate, respiration, and temperature, respectively, from the PPG-DaLiA dataset. Based on the observation space, action space, and reward policy defined for a customized gym environment for human behavior monitoring, the learning agents were run for 10 episodes, as shown in Fig.  4 . In the results, agent 1 refers to the heart rate monitoring agent, which showed a constant increase in scores for each episode for most of the subjects except subjects 5 and 6. The intermittent low scores in agent 1 performance are due to the exploration rate in DQN learning, where the algorithm tries exploring all the actions randomly instead of relying on neural networks' predictions. Similarly, agent 2 and agent 3 monitor two other physiological features, respiration and temperature, respectively. agent 2 performed better than the other two agents and achieved consistent scores for all subjects. Out of all agents, agent 3, temperature monitoring performance, was poor. This issue was traced back to the data level, where the units of the temperature thresholds in the MEWS table and the input body temperature data from the dataset were different. Still, agent 3 achieved high scores in monitoring subjects 9, 8, 4, and 10.\n\nThe reward policy designed in the proposed multiagent framework enables agents to learn the human physiological feature patterns. For example, if a subject's heart rate is 139 beats per minute, agent 1 takes Action 3 to communicate the message to MET-3. The agent will get rewarded with +10 points only if Action 3 is taken; otherwise, the agent gets negatively rewarded according to the reward policy (Table  2 ). With this example, the results in Fig.  4  can be interpreted better. An increase in scores episode by episode, with the exception of the exploration rate, actually infers an increase in the learning curve of the agents in terms of human physiological patterns."

      "title": "5.2. Hyper-parameters optimization",
      "text": "The DRL agents were further evaluated by hyperparameters optimization. Out of all the hyperparameters discussed in this study, two hyperparameters, learning rate ( \u03b1 ) and discount factor ( \u03b3 ), were optimized for all three agents, and the results are shown in Figs.  5  and  6 . The learning rate determines how much information neural networks learn in an iteration to predict action and approximate the rewards. The discount factor measures how much RL agents focus on future rewards relative to those in the immediate rewards. In Fig.  5 , Fig.  5a  show the agents' performance while optimizing \u03b1 of neural net- works. The x-axis of the plots represents scores (cumulative rewards) achieved by an agent in each episode shown on the y-axis. The bar plots show that the learning rate \u03b1 = 0.01 is a more optimized value in all the monitoring agents. Similarly, Figs. 6a present the \u03b3 optimization of agent 1, agent 2, and agent 3, respectively. The discount factors \u03b3 = 0.9 and \u03b3 = 0.75 are the more optimized values for agents 2 and 3, respectively, after 10 episodes of training.\n\nConvergence Visualization and Hyperparameter Effectiveness. To provide a clearer view of how different hyperparameters affect model performance and convergence speed, we conducted additional experiments and visualized the episode-wise cumulative rewards under varying values of learning rate ( \u03b1 ) and discount factor ( \u03b3 ). As shown in Figs.  5  and  6 , learning rate \u03b1 = 0.01 led to faster and more stable convergence compared to higher or lower values, which either caused slower learning or higher variance across episodes. Similarly, \u03b3 = 0.9 4 DQN Agents Performance resulted in optimal long-term reward accumulation, balancing future reward consideration with immediate decision-making. These visualizations offer intuitive insights into the convergence dynamics of the proposed DRL framework and reinforce our hyperparameter selection strategy.\n\nClinical Relevance of Cumulative Rewards The cumulative rewards obtained by the DRL agents are not arbitrary metrics but are directly linked to the agents' ability to make timely and clinically relevant decisions. Each reward is assigned based on how well an agent's action aligns with the MEWS-defined threshold for a given vital sign. For instance, if an agent detects an elevated heart rate indicative of stress-induced tachycardia and correctly escalates the condition to the appropriate MET level, it receives a positive reward. Conversely, a delayed or incorrect escalation results in a penalty. Over time, higher cumulative rewards indicate that the agents are successfully learning to respond to physiological deviations in ways that mirror clinical priorities. Thus, cumulative rewards in this framework serve as a quantitative proxy for the agents' effectiveness in the proactive monitoring and assessment of stress-and depression-linked health indicators.\n\nGeneralization Across Heterogeneous Conditions The ability to generalize across varying physiological patterns is essential for any real-world stress and depression monitoring system. While this study uses Modified Early Warning Scores (MEWS) to establish clinically informed reward boundaries, the reinforcement learning agents are not bound by fixed rules. Instead, they learn adaptive policies by interacting with dynamically evolving input states. To assess generalization, we employed two publicly available and heterogeneous datasets-PPG-DaLiA and WESAD-which differ in sensor configurations, experimental settings, and stress elicitation protocols.\n\nThe consistent performance of our DRL agents across both datasets suggests promising generalizability. However, we acknowledge that additional validation on datasets encompassing richer behavioral modalities and more diverse populations is necessary to further substantiate this claim. Future extensions will focus on integrating multimodal data sources and deploying the framework in cross-domain learning environments to evaluate transferability and robustness under real-world conditions."

      "title": "6. Discussion",
      "text": "This study introduces an innovative approach to patient monitoring within the unpredictable environment of healthcare settings, employing adaptive multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to ensure timely healthcare interventions. The fluctuating nature of vital signs, crucial indicators of patient health, necessitates a robust system capable of real-time analysis and decisionmaking. Stress and depression, increasingly prevalent in modern healthcare contexts, are known to significantly impact vital signs such as heart rate, respiration, and temperature  [16, 17] . By addressing these conditions, the proposed framework enhances early detection and intervention capabilities, which are critical for mitigating the physical and mental health risks associated with stressinduced tachycardia or depression-related bradycardia.\n\nBy leveraging the sequential decision-making prowess of RL algorithms, we have established a framework where each vital sign is monitored by a dedicated DRL agent. These agents operate within a cohesive monitoring environment, guided by meticulously defined reward policies to identify and respond to potential health emergencies based on MEWS and MET standards. This approach extends traditional patient monitoring by integrating the capacity to dynamically adapt to physiological changes influenced by mental health stressors, thereby providing a more comprehensive solution.\n\nA notable aspect of our research is the emphasis on the design of the observation space for each DRL agent. This design is pivotal in ensuring the accuracy and effectiveness of the learning process, as it directly impacts the agent's ability to interpret vital sign data and make informed decisions. The challenge encountered with DRL agent 3, responsible for monitoring body temperature, underscores the importance of data consistency and the need for a harmonized observation space. The discrepancy between the temperature units in the MEWS table and the dataset highlighted a critical area for improvement, emphasizing the need for standardized data inputs to enhance agent performance and ensure reliability in detecting stress or depression-related anomalies.\n\nThe autonomous decision-making capability inherent in RL represents a significant advancement in 5 Hyper Parameters -\u03b1 optimization supporting clinicians. By providing real-time updates on patient health, the DRL framework facilitates a proactive approach to patient care, extending its applicability beyond hospital settings to include home monitoring and specialized care environments. This adaptability is further enhanced by the strategic optimization of hyperparameters, which fine-tunes the learning process of DRL agents to achieve optimal performance. Our investigation into hyperparameters such as the learning rate and discount factor reveals the critical balance between immediate and future rewards, a balance that is essential for the effective monitoring of patient health, particularly in cases where stress or depression can cause delayed yet significant physiological effects.\n\nComparatively, traditional supervised learning algorithms, while accurate in predicting vital signs, fall short in dynamic healthcare environments due to their reliance on extensive labeled datasets and external supervision. The DRL approach, free from the constraints of labeled data, offers a more flexible and efficient solution for patient monitoring. However, it is essential to acknowledge the considerable effort required in data preparation and model tuning within supervised learning frameworks, which, despite their limitations, contribute 6 Hyper Parameters -\u03b3 optimization significantly to the development of informed clinical decisions.\n\nThe adaptive multi-agent DRL framework proposed in this study represents a paradigm shift in patient monitoring, offering a dynamic, efficient, and scalable solution for timely healthcare interventions  [44] . By addressing both the physical and mental health challenges posed by stress and depression, this framework introduces a holistic approach to patient monitoring. The challenges and insights gleaned from this research pave the way for future advancements in the field, promising to enhance the quality of patient care through innovative technological solutions.\n\nScope of Physiological Monitoring. We acknowledge that stress and depression are highly complex psychophysiological conditions that cannot be comprehensively diagnosed through the monitoring of only three physiological parameters. In this study, the use of heart rate, respiration rate, and body temperature was intended as a proof-of-concept for evaluating the feasibility and performance of the proposed multi-agent DRL framework in a controlled setting. These variables were selected due to their well-documented correlation with acute stress responses and their widespread availability in wearable sensor systems. However, they serve as proxies for physiological arousal rather than definitive indicators of mental health status. The modular nature of our framework allows for the seamless integration of additional biosignals (e.g., GSR, HRV, EEG) or behavioral indicators (e.g., sleep disruption, speech features) in future work. As such, the current implementation should be viewed as a foundational step toward building a more comprehensive and multimodal system for mental health monitoring."

      "title": "Explainability",
      "text": "While the proposed multi-agent DRL framework demonstrates strong adaptability and decision-making performance in patient monitoring, ensuring explainability remains a vital aspect for clinical adoption. To this end, we suggest incorporating agent-specific decision traceability as a foundational mechanism. Each agent can log transitions in Q-values alongside corresponding MEWS thresholds and selected actions, providing a transparent record of decision rationale over time. Such traceability supports retrospective audits by clinicians and aligns with the interpretability expectations of healthcare AI systems. Furthermore, future extensions of this work will explore the integration of model-agnostic interpretability techniques, such as SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP), to assess the contribution of each physiological feature to the agents' actions in real time. This dual approach-combining Q-value trajectory logging with post-hoc feature attribution-has the potential to enhance clinician trust, uncover failure points, and guide improvements in agent design. Emphasizing explainability is particularly important in sensitive contexts such as stress and depression monitoring, where transparent and accountable AI systems are essential for safe and ethical deployment.\n\nDataset Size and Generalizability. Although the proposed framework was evaluated using two widely recognized datasets-PPG-DaLiA and WESAD-each comprising 15 subjects, the size of these cohorts reflects an ongoing challenge in stress-related physiological research. Collecting high-quality, multimodal data under controlled conditions involving stress and affect remains inherently complex and resource-intensive, often limiting sample sizes across benchmark studies in this domain. Despite this constraint, the framework consistently demonstrated reliable policy convergence and adaptive learning across multiple agents and subjects, providing strong evidence of its robustness and effectiveness in modeling temporal patterns in physiological signals.\n\nImportantly, the controlled nature of the datasets allowed for reproducible experimentation and precise evaluation of the technical capabilities of the multi-agent DRL system. Nonetheless, future work will aim to expand validation efforts using larger and more diverse datasets, potentially integrating synthetic data augmentation and transfer learning techniques to improve generalizability. These steps will ensure broader applicability of the proposed monitoring framework in real-world healthcare settings, while preserving the methodological rigor established in this study."

      "text": "This study has pioneered an adaptive framework for healthcare interventions using multi-agent DRL to dynamically monitor vital signs, establishing a novel approach in patient care. By considering the significant influence of stress and depression on vital signs, this research underscores the importance of addressing mental health challenges in conjunction with physical health monitoring. Through the development of a generic monitoring environment coupled with a strategic reward policy, the DRL agents were empowered to learn from and adapt to vital sign fluctuations, enabling timely interventions by healthcare professionals. The ability of these agents to detect stress-induced or depressionrelated anomalies demonstrates the potential of this system to provide a comprehensive and proactive approach to healthcare. Despite its innovative contributions, the research faced challenges, such as discrepancies in body temperature data scales and the absence of predictive capabilities for future vital sign trends, which limited the effectiveness of one DRL agent and the overall predictive potential of the system. These limitations highlight the need for enhanced data standardization and the integration of predictive analytics to anticipate trends in vital signs influenced by mental health conditions. Future research will focus on overcoming these challenges by augmenting the framework with predictive modeling capabilities, enabling DRL agents to forecast vital sign trends and anticipate health emergencies.\n\nThis advancement aims to revolutionize patient monitoring by facilitating proactive healthcare measures, significantly reducing the risk of critical health episodes associated with stress and depression. The future direction of this research will extend the scope to include multi-agent DRL frameworks capable of predicting future health trajectories, thereby enhancing the integration of mental and physical health monitoring in adaptive patient care systems."
