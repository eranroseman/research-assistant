  "title": "An Adaptive Text Message Intervention to Promote Well-Being and Health Behavior Adherence for Patients With Cardiovascular Disease: Intervention Design and Preliminary Results",
  "abstract": "Background: Most individuals with heart disease struggle to adhere to cardiovascular health behaviors, despite their known health benefits. Text message interventions (TMIs) are a promising treatment modality for health behavior promotion, but existing TMIs typically deliver a fixed set of messages and do not target well-being constructs associated with adherence and cardiovascular health. Objective: To develop a 4-week TMI, which delivers daily messages to promote well-being and adherence to health behaviors and dynamically adapts based on participant feedback to deliver increasingly customized messages; and to assess its feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy in a single-arm, proof-of-concept trial in 14 individuals with coronary artery disease (age mean = 67.9, standard deviation = 8.7). Methods: Participants received daily text messages related to well-being, physical activity, or diet, rated each message's utility, and these ratings informed the TMI's choice of future text messages. Feasibility was assessed by the proportion of messages successfully sent, and acceptability was assessed by participant ratings of intervention burden and text message utility. Finally, the intervention's preliminary efficacy was explored by measuring pre-post changes in psychologic and behavioral outcomes. Results: The TMI was both feasible (93% of participants received all messages) and well-accepted (mean text message utility: 7.0 of 10 [standard deviation 2.5]; mean intervention utility: 6.4 of 10 [standard deviation 0.9]; mean intervention burden: 0.5 of 10 [standard deviation 0.9]). Participants reported that messages related to wellbeing were particularly helpful and that most messages led to an action (e.g., eating more vegetables, being kind to others). The TMI led to nonsignificant, small-to-medium effect size improvements in happiness, optimism, determination, depression, anxiety, self-rated health, and diet (d = 0.19-0.48), and, unexpectedly, small reductions in activity and physical function (d = 20.20 and 20.32). Conclusions: The adaptive TMI was feasible, wellaccepted, and associated with nonsignificant improvements in psychologic outcomes and mixed effects on behavioral outcomes. Larger, well-powered studies are needed to determine whether this TMI will be able to improve wellbeing and health-related outcomes in this high-risk population.",

      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "Among the 120 million Americans with cardiovascular disease,  1  adherence to health behaviors (e.g., heart-healthy diet, physical activity) is associated with a reduced risk of cardiovascular disease progression and complications.  2  Despite these benefits, a majority of patients with heart disease struggle to adhere to recommended guidelines for health behaviors.  3, 4 Although multicomponent interventions (e.g., cardiac rehabilitation) to promote health behavior adherence can be beneficial,  5  they are resourceintensive, poorly attended,  6  and not available in many areas of the US.  7, 8 Furthermore, existing health behavior interventions often do not address psychologic factors (e.g., low self-efficacy, reduced well-being, depression) that are independently associated with adherence and cardiovascular health outcomes.  9 ext message interventions (TMIs) address many of the limitations of existing health behavior programs. TMIs are highly accessible (i.e., 96% of Americans have access to a cell phone  10  ) and can be implemented with fewer resources than mobile application-based or in-person programs. TMIs also can be customized to individual participants (e.g., based on health behavior goals, personal preferences, and medical factors), which can have substantial benefits, as personalized health interventions tend to be more effective than generic, nonpersonalized ones.  11, 12 Finally, TMIs can also deliver content that focuses specifically on the promotion of well-being constructs (e.g., optimism, positive affect) that have been linked to cardiovascular health.  9 xisting health behavior TMIs, most of which deliver a fixed set of educational or motivational text messages, lead to small-to-medium effect-sized beneficial effects on adherence in persons with heart disease and other populations.  [12] [13] 3] [14]  Adaptive TMIs, which select text messages based on regular, ongoing patient feedback, have the potential to have even greater effects on adherence and subsequent health outcomes than interventions customized based solely on static factors. However, to our knowledge, adaptive TMIs that deliver health behavior and well-being-focused messages have never been studied in patients with heart disease.\n\nTo address this gap, a 4-week, adaptive TMI that delivers daily messages to promote well-being and adherence to cardiac health behaviors was designed. In this study, the development of this TMI is described, and the results of a single-arm, proof-of-concept trial to assess the feasibility, acceptability, and preliminary efficacy of this novel TMI in patients with coronary artery disease are reported."

During the first 14 days, a fixed set of messages with a variety of attributes was delivered to obtain initial participant preferences. Then, daily adaptation began through an algorithm that weighted the participants' utility ratings from all previous messages (Figure  1 ).\n\nEach day, the learning algorithm reviewed each participant's ratings for all prior messages and calculated an overall utility rating for the attributes associated with those messages. The algorithm then selected a set of messages for potential delivery that day, in which 70% were chosen based on the combination of attributes that the participant rated most highly, and 30% were chosen at random (to prevent the algorithm from learning too quickly and to ensure that participants continued to receive a variety of message types). Then, 1 of these messages was randomly chosen for delivery.\n\nThe adaptive algorithm was maintained and executed in a secure, online DynamoDB database  18  that was hosted on Amazon Web Services.  19 All text messages were sent and received using Twilio,  20  a secure text messaging platform."

Feasibility was measured by the percentage of text messages successfully delivered, through a review of the Dyna-moDB database and confirmation with participants at the 4-week follow-up assessment.\n\nIntervention acceptability was measured by mean ratings of the intervention burden on a 0-10 Likert scale (0 = 'not burdensome at all' to 1 = 'extremely burdensome'). A priori, feasibility was defined as successful delivery of over 90% of planned messages and acceptability as a mean burden score of ,4 out of 10.\n\nAdditionally, as secondary outcomes, throughout the TMI program, participants rated the utility of each individual text message (0 = 'not helpful at all' to 10 = 'very helpful') on a daily basis, and preferences for specific message types were assessed by calculating the mean utility rating of all messages delivered with that attribute. Following the intervention, participants rated the intervention's utility (using the same 0-10 Likert scale).\n\nFinally, participants provided feedback of the intervention through 6 open-ended questions (Table  1 ) related to the intervention's burden, utility, and impact, along with their preferences for future intervention delivery. Preliminary Efficacy. The preliminary impact of the intervention was assessed through pre-post changes in psychologic and health-related measures from baseline to 4-and 8-week time points. Consistent with previous studies,  23, 24  psychological outcomes were assessed through participant ratings of happiness, optimism, determination, depression, and anxiety over the past week using a 0-10 Likert-style scale for each item/ construct. Self-rated health similarly was assessed by a Text message sent to participant Ex.: Research has shown that variety and novelty are important for life satisfaction. Today, do something totally new, or try making an old activity new and interesting! Attributes: \"well-being\", \"directive\" Feedback is incorporated into the learning algorithm Overall utility scores for the attributes \"well-being\" and \"directive\" are increased by 3.* Participant's preferences are updated Scores for well-being and directive attributes increase, while scores for other attributes remain unchanged. New text message is randomly selected from this set of possible messages 70% messages based on participant's preferences Ex. messages with attributes \"well-being\" and \"directive\" Participant gives feedback about the received message Ex.: How helpful was this message? Response: 8 Algorithm chooses a set of possible messages 30% messages randomly selected from the whole set All types of attributes are considered equally\n\nLikert-scale item (1 = 'very good' to 5 = 'very bad') about their general health. Moderate physical activity was assessed as the number of minutes of moderate activity per week, an approach that has been validated and used in clinical practice.  25 Dietary adherence was measured with the diet item from the Medical Outcomes Study Specific Adherence Scale,  26  and functional status was determined using the well-validated Duke Activity Status Index.  27"

The proportion of messages received was calculated to assess feasibility, and descriptive statistics (mean [M], standard deviation [SD]) were utilized to describe the burden and utility of the intervention and individual messages. To compare the mean score of participants' perceived utility of each type of message (well-being, physical activity, or diet), the Kruskal-Wallis H test was used. Regarding feedback related to the intervention, 2 study team members (A.C. and C.C.) systematically reviewed participants' responses to the 6 structured questions in the exit interviews, derived themes from these raw data, and then reported the results using descriptive statistics. Paired ttests were performed to measure the preliminary impact of the intervention (from baseline to postintervention [4 wk], and from baseline to follow-up [8 wk]) on psychological and health-related outcomes. Given the small sample size and preliminary nature of this study, rather than focusing on statistical significance, effect size was examined to explore the magnitude of the intervention's effect. Effect sizes (Cohen's d) were calculated by subtracting the pre-intervention mean from the postintervention mean (or follow-up intervention mean), divided by the pooled SD of the pre-and postintervention assessment (or pre-intervention and follow-up assessment).  28"

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "This article details the successful creation of an adaptive TMI to promote well-being and health behavior adherence in patients with coronary artery disease. To our knowledge, this is the first study that presents a TMI designed to promote well-being and health behavior adherence for patients with cardiovascular disease that dynamically adapts to participants' preferences. In addition, the proof-of-concept trial showed that the intervention was both feasible and wellaccepted. More than 90% of participants received all messages, and they rated the TMI as moderately helpful and not burdensome, in line with other healthrelated TMI studies.  11, 29, 30 In addition, the text message frequency (i.e., daily) and intervention duration (4 wk) were appreciated by most participants, and most expressed that the messages led to at least 1 direct action (e.g., activity, kind act).\n\nIn both message ratings and the exit interviews, participants' identified well-being messages as being particularly helpful. These messages were the most highly rated in terms of utility, and in exit interviews participants reported them as being most helpful. Additionally, the TMI led to small-to-moderate, nonsignificant increases in happiness, optimism, and determination, and nonsignificant reductions in depression and anxiety levels. Although not statistically significant, the magnitude of the intervention's effects is consistent with recent meta-analyses on the efficacy of positive psychology interventions, which incorporate specific activities designed to increase positive emotions, cognitions, or behaviors.  17, 31 This trial suggests that positive activities can be delivered effectively using text messages and raises the possibility of incorporating text messages into more formal positive psychology interventions or attempting to deliver positive psychology interventions exclusively using text messages. Further research may clarify how to utilize this technology most effectively in the future.\n\nPrevious studies have shown that TMIs can increase engagement in health behaviors, including physical activity, a heart-healthy diet, and medication adherence.  12, 14 In this study, results on health-related outcomes were mixed: although the intervention led to nonsignificant, small-to-moderate effect size increases in self-reported dietary adherence and health, it led to small, nonsignificant reductions in physical activity at follow-up. It is difficult to identify a clear reason for the reduction in activity, which was contrary to what was expected and inconsistent with prior studies.  14 Possible reasons for this finding include the lack of consistent focus on activity (e.g., only 38% of delivered messages were related to physical activity), the short duration of the intervention, and the lack of coaching from study staff, as coaching may be an important adjunct to text messages to promote behavior change and improve health outcomes.  32 It also is possible that the intervention was not personalized or specific enough to impact this important outcome.\n\nThis study has several limitations. It has no control group, a small sample, and a homogeneous population, which makes it difficult to generalize the results to other populations or to establish causal relationships among the variables. Additionally, a substantial proportion of eligible participants (48%) did not return the consent form, and it is unclear if these individuals were different from those who ultimately enrolled. Finally, psychologic outcomes were measured using single-item Likertstyle ratings, rather than validated questionnaires. The effects obtained in this initial trial should therefore be considered with caution. A next step will be to investigate whether these results can result in psychological and health behavior outcomes in a randomized study with adequate power to detect such effects and allow comparison to a control condition."
