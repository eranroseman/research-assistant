  "title": "Predicting Physical Activity Among Cancer Survivors: Meta-Analytic Path Modeling of Longitudinal Studies",
  "abstract": "Objective: We conducted meta-analyses and meta-analytic structural equation modeling of longitudinal studies among cancer survivors to (a) quantify associations between psychosocial predictors and physical activity, (b) test how psychosocial predictors combine to influence physical activity, and (c) identify study, demographic, and clinical characteristics that moderate associations. Method: Eligible studies used a longitudinal, observational design, included a sample of cancer survivors, and measured both a psychosocial predictor at baseline and physical activity at a later time-point. Of 2,431 records located through computerized searches, 25 independent tests (N \u03ed 5,897) met the inclusion criteria for the review. Random effects meta-analyses and meta-analytic structural equation modeling were conducted. Results: Eight psychosocial predictors of physical activity were identified. Self-efficacy (r \u03e9 \u03ed 0.26) and intentions (r \u03e9 \u03ed 0.33) were the strongest predictors in bivariate analyses. The structural equation models included attitudes, injunctive norms, self-efficacy, intentions, and physical activity (k \u03ed 22, N \u03ed 4,385). The model with the best fit, 2 (2) \u03ed 0.11, p \u03ed .95, root mean square error of approximation \u03ed .00, comparative fit index \u03ed 1.00, Tucker-Lewis index \u03ed 1.00, indicated that all specified paths were significant. Intentions were the strongest predictor of physical activity (\u2424 \u03ed 0.27, p \u03fd .001), and attitudes and self-efficacy were strong predictors of intentions (both \u2424s \u03ed 0.29, ps \u03fd .001). Few significant moderators were observed. Conclusion: This review indicates that self-efficacy and intentions are direct predictors of physical activity in cancer survivors. Further, attitudes and norms predict physical activity through intentions. Findings inform intervention development to increase physical activity engagement among cancer survivors.",

      "text": "Cancer survivors are persons living with a cancer diagnosis, including those who have been newly diagnosed, are undergoing treatment, or have completed treatment  (Denlinger et al., 2014) . There are currently more than 15.5 million cancer survivors in the United States and this number is projected to increase to 20.3 million by 2026  (National Cancer Institute, 2018) . Cancer survivors live with increased mortality and recurrence risk, as well as decreased quality of life, due to disease-and treatment-related long-term and late effects  (van Leeuwen et al., 2018) . Physical activity is associated with up to 50% lower cancer mortality and recurrence risk  (Cormie, Zopf, Zhang, & Schmitz, 2017) . Physical activity also improves quality of life for cancer survivors through mechanisms such as decreased pain and fatigue  (Loprinzi & Lee, 2014) . Engagement in physical activity is safe and feasible for cancer survivors before, during, and after treatment (National Academies of  Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2018) . Thus, the American College of Sports Medicine and American Cancer Society recommend that cancer survivors adhere to general guidelines of 150 weekly aerobic minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity or 75 weekly aerobic minutes of vigorous-intensity physical activity and strength training two times per week  (Rock et al., 2012) . Despite numerous efforts to promote physical activity in this population, up to 70% of survivors do not achieve these recommendations  (Blanchard, Courneya, & Stein, 2008) . Understanding what psychosocial factors predict physical activity among cancer survivors is a key step toward designing effective interventions to promote physical activity  (Sheeran, Klein, & Rothman, 2017) . Accordingly, we undertook a meta-analysis of longitudinal, observational studies to quantify associations between predictors and physical activity in research to date."

      "title": "Theories of Physical Activity Change",
      "text": "Health behavior theories are often used to guide physical activity interventions because they contain constructs that can be manipulated and measured to assess whether and why interventions produce behavior change  (Rhodes, McEwan, & Rebar, 2018) . Key theories that have been used in physical activity interventions for cancer survivors include the theory of planned behavior (TPB);  Ajzen, 1991) , social-cognitive theory  (Bandura, 2004) , selfdetermination theory  (Ryan & Deci, 2017) , and the transtheoretical model  (Prochaska & Velicer, 1997) . These theories specify a series of overlapping predictors of behavior  (Sheeran et al., 2017) . The most extensively researched factors are attitudes, norms, selfefficacy, social support, past behavior, and intentions. Attitudes are people's overall evaluation of the outcomes of performing a behavior (e.g., \"For me, engaging in 150 mins of physical activity per week would be good/bad\") and are conceptually equivalent to the constructs, pros-and-cons, and outcome expectancies. Factor analysis and memory paradigms have shown that attitudes have two components-affective and instrumental  (Trafimow & Sheeran, 1998) . Affective attitudes refer to people's feelings about performing the behavior (e.g., \"For me, engaging in 150 mins of physical activity per week would be enjoyable\") whereas instrumental attitudes refer to utilitarian consequence of acting (e.g., \"For me, engaging in 150 mins of physical activity per week would benefit my health\"). Norms come in two varieties-injunctive and descriptive-that both predict health behaviors  (Rivis & Sheeran, 2003) . Injunctive norms refer to beliefs about what behaviors significant others think that one should perform (e.g., \"Most people who are important to me think that I should engage in 150 mins of physical activity per week\"), whereas descriptive norms refer to beliefs about how others themselves behave  (Cialdini, Kallgren, & Reno, 1991) . Self-efficacy refers to confidence in one's ability to perform a behavior and is conceptually equivalent to perceived behavioral control from the TPB  (Ajzen, 2002; Bandura, 2004) . Social support refers to people's perceptions of how others enable and assist them to strive for goals (e.g., \"My loved ones encourage me to stick to my physical activity plans\";  Sallis, Grossman, Pinski, Patterson, & Nader, 1987) . Finally, intentions refer to people's decisions and determination to act; intentions summarize people's motivation to perform a behavior (e.g., \"I intend to engage in 150 mins of physical activity per week\"  (Ajzen, 2002) . Other constructs, such as perceived success  (Courneya et al., 2004) , affect  (Brunet, Burke, & Sabiston, 2013; Mack, Meldrum, Wilson, & Sabiston, 2013), and planning (Karvinen et al., 2009)  have also been tested as potential predictors of physical activity in one or two studies. However, there were too few tests to warrant inclusion in the present meta-analysis."

      "title": "The Present Review",
      "text": "Even though a large literature has accumulated on psychosocial predictors of physical activity among cancer survivors, a quantitative synthesis of this research has yet to be undertaken. The present meta-analysis provides this synthesis. As longitudinal studies that measure predictors at one time-point and measure physical activity at a later time-point afford stronger inferences about the direction of effects than cross-sectional studies  (Webb & Sheeran, 2006) , our review focused on longitudinal research. The metaanalysis had three aims: first, to quantify the associations between constructs from behavioral theories (psychosocial predictors) and physical activity among adult cancer survivors; second, to model how these different constructs combine to predict physical activity over time using meta-analytic structural equation modeling; and third, to identify moderating effects of methodological (e.g., measurement intervals, study rigor), demographic (e.g., race/ethnicity, age), and clinical (e.g., type of cancer, treatment phase) characteristics on the relationship between proximal psychosocial predictors and physical activity."

Search terms were optimized for each database and included terms for (a) psychosocial constructs (e.g., determinants, self-efficacy, TPB), (b) physical activity (e.g., exercise, walk \u202b\u0621\u202c , strength \u202b\u0621\u202c ), (c) cancer (e.g., neoplasm, tumor, leukemia), and (d) longitudinal design (e.g., prospective, predict \u202b\u0621\u202c ).

There were four criteria for inclusion. First, participants were cancer survivors according to the definition of a cancer survivor as someone living with a cancer diagnosis, regardless of treatment status  (Denlinger et al., 2014) . Thus, studies of participants who had not yet begun, were undergoing, and who had completed adjuvant treatment, met the criteria. Studies with adult survivors of all types of cancer except childhood cancer were included. Second, studies had to have a primary outcome of physical activity that was quantitatively measured objectively and/or subjectively. Light, moderate, or vigorous intensity aerobic or strength training physical activity (e.g., yoga, dancing, Tai Chi, resistance bands, and weight lifting) were permissible, though meditation and mindfulness outcomes were excluded. Physical activity could be unsupervised or supervised, including intervention adherence or attendance. Third, studies had to report one or more psychosocial constructs that predict physical activity. Finally, the study had to have a longitudinal, observational design with predictors measured at baseline and physical activity measured at a later time-point. Experimental and cross-sectional studies were excluded.\n\nThe initial search yielded 2,431 articles. Deduplication removed 10 articles, leaving 2,421 titles and abstracts for screening. Two researchers independently reviewed each title and abstract for eligibility, resulting in 59 articles for full text review. Full-text reviews were conducted independently by two researchers. Discrepancies were discussed and, when necessary, resolved with a third researcher. Reasons for exclusion at this stage included (a) not a longitudinal, observational design (n \u03ed 10); (b) was a conference abstract (n \u03ed 6); (c) did not include a psychosocial predictor of physical activity (n \u03ed 5); (d) effect size was not reported and data transformations were not possible (n \u03ed 8); (e) physical activity was not measured (n \u03ed 4); and (f) the study population did not include cancer survivors (n \u03ed 1). Ultimately, 25 studies met the criteria for inclusion in this meta-analysis, as detailed in Figure  1 . The references for all included studies are presented in the online supplemental materials."

Of the six authors who did not respond, we were able to include two studies using only the published data. We extracted data on study characteristics, sample demographics, cancer condition, treatment type, and correlations between psychosocial predictor variables and physical activity from each paper. Theoretical and operational definitions of each predictor variable were examined. Those with similar conceptual and/or operational definitions (e.g., selfefficacy and perceived behavioral control) were grouped together and assigned the title most commonly used in behavioral research. This process resulted in eight psychosocial predictor variables: instrumental attitudes, affective attitudes, overall attitudes (i.e., attitude scales that combined instrumental and affective content), injunctive norms, descriptive norms, self-efficacy, intentions, and past behavior. In cases where there were multiple measures of the same construct, the average within-study correlation of the relevant measures was calculated and used in analyses."

      "text": "Random-effects meta-analysis was used to compute averaged sample-weighted correlations (r \u03e9 ) between psychosocial variables and physical activity using R. The weighted correlations (r \u03e9 ) were calculated by transforming each correlation into Fisher's Z score and weighting the value by the sample size. The average Z was then back-transformed to r. The 95% confidence intervals were calculated in similar fashion. Cochran's Q and the I 2 statistics were conducted to test for heterogeneity. Statistically significant Q values and I 2 values exceeding 25% are indicative of heterogeneity in the correlations  (Higgins, Thompson, Deeks, & Altman, 2003) .\n\nMeta-analytic structural equation modeling was conducted using the metaSEM package Version 1.2.0  (Cheung, 2018)  in R Version 3.5.1 to examine how the psychosocial constructs collectively influence physical activity. A modified version of the TPB was used to model relationships between the variables, as this theory specifies relations among the constructs that were available for analysis. A two-stage random effects approach was used to fit the path models  (Jak, 2015) . With the metaSEM package, a correlation matrix was created for each study, and the diagonal element in the matrix was omitted for missing variables. Additionally, for each missing correlation, one variable-the one that had the fewest remaining correlations with other variables-was treated as missing and omitted on the diagonal element. During the first stage of the two-stage random effects analysis, correlation matrices were pooled; in the second stage, a structural model was fit to the pooled correlation matrix using weighted least squares estimation  (Cheung, 2014; Cheung & Chan, 2005) . For studies that reported different sample sizes for different correlations, we adopted the conservative strategy of using the minimum sample size to represent the study correlations  (Sheeran, Abraham, & Orbell, 1999) ."

Discrepancies were resolved through discussion by the research team. Small-study bias was evaluated by computing statistics based on plots of the cor-relations from each study against study precision (the reciprocal of the study sample size). Asymmetry in the predicted 'funnel' shape of the plots was considered evidence of small study bias, that is, the tendency for studies included in the analysis to exhibit large effects relative to their sample size. Publication bias was evaluated using rank-order correlation to test for the interdependence of variance and effect size, with a significant correlation indicative of bias  (Begg & Mazumdar, 1994) ."

The average methodological quality score was 8.64 (SD \u03ed 1.30) out of a possible 0 -11 range; higher scores indicate greater methodological quality. Most participants were White (91%), female (79%), and an average of 56 years old (SD \u03ed 6). Most studies included only survivors of breast cancer (k \u03ed 14). Most included only those who had completed curative treatment (k \u03ed 13), or a mixed sample of participants who had completed and were receiving treatment (k \u03ed 9).

Because instrumental attitudes and affective attitudes were so highly correlated with overall attitudes (r \u03e9 \u03ed 0.87 and 0.93, respectively), and the correlations between physical activity and instrumental attitudes, affective attitudes, and overall attitudes were similar (r \u03e9 \u03ed 0.15, 0.18, and 0.18, respectively), only overall attitude was included in the model. Past behavior and descriptive norms could not be included in the model because there were too few correlations with the other predictors to permit analyses. Thus, the final models included five variables-attitudes, injunctive norms, self-efficacy, intentions, and physical activity (k \u03ed 22, N \u03ed 4,385).\n\nIn the first model, we specified attitudes, injunctive norms, and self-efficacy as exogenous variables, with paths to intentions, leading to physical activity (see Figure  2 ). The model fit well, 2 (3) \u03ed 12.37, p \u03ed .006, root mean square error of approximation \u03ed .03, comparative fit index \u03ed .99, Tucker-Lewis index \u03ed .95, and all of the specified paths were significant (ps \u03fd .001).

Findings indicated that intentions are the strongest predictor of physical activity (\u2424 \u03ed 0.27, p \u03fd .001), and that both attitudes and self-efficacy are strong predictors of intentions, (both \u2424s \u03ed 0.29, ps \u03fd .001). We also tested a saturated model that specified all possible paths including direct paths from attitudes and injunctive norms to behavior. However, neither of these paths were significant (\u2424 \u03ed 0.02 and \u03ea0.004, respectively, ps \u03fe .70). Thus, Model 2 offers the best fit to the data and would seem to follow the structure of the TPB. That is, intention is the best predictor of cancer survivors' physical activity; there are indirect effects of attitudes, injunctive norms, and self-efficacy on physical activity through intentions; and self-efficacy also has a direct path to physical activity.\n\nAlthough there were too few tests to include past behavior in the model alongside attitudes, injunctive norms, self-efficacy, and intentions, it is important to ensure that the associations observed for intentions and self-efficacy remained significant when past  This article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\n\nbehavior was controlled. We therefore tested a new model that specified direct paths from past behavior, self-efficacy, and intentions to subsequent physical activity. Findings indicated that past behavior predicted behavior (\u2424 \u03ed 0.32, p \u03fd .001). Importantly, however, intentions (\u2424 \u03ed 0.21, p \u03fd .001) and self-efficacy (\u2424 \u03ed 0.15, p \u03fd .001) retained significant paths to subsequent physical activity. These findings are consistent with the idea that intentions and self-efficacy predict changes in behavior  (Sheeran et al., 2017) ."

The Q and I 2 statistics indicated that there was significant heterogeneity in these relationships, which encourages the search for moderators. We tested moderating effects of study characteristics (i.e., time interval between measurement of cognitions and behavior, rigor score), demographic factors (i.e., age, marital status, and body mass index [BMI]), and clinical features of the samples of cancer survivors (i.e., cancer type and treatment status). Too few tests were available to assess moderation by other variables (e.g., race).\n\nFindings showed that only two factors moderated relationships between physical activity and intentions or self-efficacy (see Table  3 ). Sample age moderated the self-efficacy-physical activity relation such that older samples exhibited stronger associations between self-efficacy and behavior relative to younger samples (B \u03ed 0.02, p \u03ed .01). BMI moderated the intention-behavior relation (B \u03ed \u03ea0.07, p \u03ed .03).

This review makes three key contributions to understanding physical activity engagement among cancer survivors. First, we quantified the relationships between eight psychosocial predictors and subsequent physical activity using a database of 25 longitudinal studies that comprised \u03f36,000 cancer survivors. Second, we used meta-analytic structural equation modeling to explore how the psychosocial predictors combine to influence physical activity and tested direct and indirect effects of respective predictors. And third, we evaluated the moderating effects of study, demographic, and clinical characteristics on the proximal predictors of physical activity. This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.\n\nThis article is intended solely for the personal use of the individual user and is not to be disseminated broadly.\n\nFindings showed that the sample-weighted average correlations between physical activity and intentions and self-efficacy were of medium magnitude according to Cohen's criteria  (Cohen, 1992) . Average correlations for the other predictors (overall attitudes, affective attitudes, instrumental attitudes, injunctive and descriptive norms, social support) were small-or small-to-medium-sized. These findings are in line with  Ajzen's (1991)  TPB that posits intentions as the proximal predictor of behavior and attitudes, norms, self-efficacy, and other variables as indirect predictors mediated by intentions. The TPB also suggests that, to the extent that perceptions of control are accurate, self-efficacy also directly predicts behavior alongside intentions  (Sheeran, Trafimow, & Armitage, 2003) .\n\nSufficient data were available to compute sample-weighted intercorrelations for physical activity, intentions, self-efficacy, overall attitudes, and injunctive norms, but not for the other predictors. Accordingly, we undertook meta-analytic structural equation modeling of these data. Our first model tested a direct path from intention to physical activity and indirect paths from overall attitudes, injunctive norms, and self-efficacy via intentions. The model exhibited good fit and all of the specified paths were significant. Next, we tested whether including direct paths from self-efficacy, overall attitudes, and injunctive norms to behavior would improve model fit. We found support for including a direct path from self-efficacy to behavior; model fit improved significantly and the fit of the overall model was excellent. Direct paths from attitudes and injunctive norms to physical activity were not empirically supported. Thus, the structure of the TPB finds strong support in meta-analytic structural equation modeling of longitudinal studies of cancer survivors' physical activity: Intentions and self-efficacy directly predict behavior; intention mediates the attitude-behavior and injunctive norms-behavior relation, and partially mediates the self-efficacy-behavior relation.\n\nPast behavior can function as a surrogate measure of factors that have influenced previous behavioral decisions  (Albarrac\u00edn & Wyer, 2000) . Additionally, past behavior can reflect the extent to which behavior is under volitional control  (Gardner, 2015) . Thus, when testing a model's ability to predict behavior, it is critical to control for past behavior  (Hagger, Polet, & Lintunen, 2018) . Significant associations between both intentions and physical activity, and self-efficacy and physical activity, held up when we tested direct paths between past behavior, self-efficacy, intentions, and subsequent physical activity. These results indicate that intentions and self-efficacy predict changes in physical activity among cancer survivors, in line with the predictions of leading theories of physical activity  (Rhodes et al., 2018) .\n\nThe relative size of correlations between TPB constructs and physical activity in our review are similar to those observed other meta-analyses in other populations, though the magnitude of the sample-weighted average correlations was smaller here. For example, a meta-analysis of 72 studies that included a variety of samples (e.g., college students, children, healthy adults) found that intentions most strongly predict physical activity (r \u03e9 \u03ed 0.51), followed by self-efficacy, (r \u03e9 \u03ed 0.40), and then attitudes (r \u03e9 \u03ed 0.35;  Hagger, Chatzisarantis, & Biddle, 2002 ; see also  McEachan et al., 2016) . The correlations observed in the present review follow the same order of magnitude for intention, self-efficacy, and attitudes (r \u03e9 \u03ed 0.33, 0.26, and 0.18, respectively) but are substantially smaller than those observed in  Hagger et al.'s (2002)  meta-analysis.\n\nWhy are smaller associations observed between psychosocial predictors and physical activity for cancer survivors compared to people with no diagnosis of cancer? The American Cancer Society Guidelines  (Rock et al., 2012)  pointed out that \"fewer than 10% of cancer survivors will be active during their primary treatments and only about 20% to 30% will be active after they recover from treatments\" (p. 250). It therefore seems possible that health concerns or sedentary habits  (Rhodes, Mark, & Temmel, 2012)  could militate against cancer survivors effectively translating intentions and self-efficacy into physical activity. Difficulties in realizing intentions and self-efficacy may not be unique to cancer survivors, however. Rich, Brandes, Mullan, and Hagger (2015)  metaanalyzed relationships between TPB variables and physical activity in people with chronic illness (e.g., diabetes, heart disease, hypertension). Average correlations between physical activity and intention (r \u03e9 \u03ed 0.29, k \u03ed 8) and self-efficacy (r \u03e9 \u03ed 0.16, k \u03ed 7) were considerably smaller than the associations observed by  Hagger et al. (2002)  and  McEachan et al. (2016)  for general population samples, but were similar to those observed here for cancer survivors. The implication is that while cognitions specified by the TPB predict physical activity for both patient and nonpatient samples, predictive validity is weaker for cancer survivors and patient samples.\n\nRebar and colleagues (2019) pointed out that the strength of intention-behavior correlations greatly depends upon statistical assumptions about linearity and homoscedasticity, and recommended that researchers examine profiles of intention-behavior consistency. Profile analyses indicates that people who intend to act but subsequently do not (as opposed to nonintenders who subsequently behave contrary to their intentions) are mainly re- This document is copyrighted by the American Psychological Association or one of its allied publishers.

This is also the case for physical activity intentions and behavior  (Rhodes & de Bruijn, 2013a) . Vallerand, Rhodes, Walker, and Courneya (2016)  observed that intentions were effectively translated into exercise in only about 40%-50% of hematological cancer survivors suggesting that the intentionbehavior \"gap\" is substantial in this population. Further research with cancer survivors is needed to test theoretical approaches such as the action control framework  (Rhodes & de Bruijn, 2013b; Sniehotta, Nagy, Scholz, & Schwarzer, 2006 ) that offers traction in understanding discrepancies between intentions and physical activity in other populations.\n\nIt is also notable that the strength of relationships between physical activity and instrumental versus affective attitudes differed for cancer survivors compared to participants in previous reviews. In  McEachan et al.'s (2016)  meta-analysis, affective attitudes better predicted behavior than instrumental attitudes for general population samples (r \u03e9 \u03ed 0.30 and 0.20, respectively; see  Conner & Sparks, 2015 , for equivalent findings). The corresponding average correlations were r \u03e9 \u03ed 0.18 and r \u03e9 \u03ed 0.15 in our study, which suggests that cancer survivors attach equal weight to the health benefits of physical activity as to its enjoyment, unlike their counterparts without a cancer diagnosis (O'  Neill et al., 2013) . It is apparent from reviews of both general population samples  (Hagger et al., 2002; McEachan et al., 2016)  and people with chronic illness  (Rich et al., 2015)  that norms are weakly associated with physical activity. This also proved to be the case among cancer survivors in the present review (r \u03e9 \u0545 0.14) and may reflect low societal expectations of physical activity among this population.\n\nWe observed few significant moderators of intention-behavior and self-efficacy-behavior relations among cancer survivors. Older samples demonstrated a stronger relationship between selfefficacy and physical activity, and samples with lower BMI exhibited reduced consistency between intentions and physical activity. Both of these findings would seem to align with TPB predictions. In particular, the TPB proposes that stronger relationships should be obtained for both of these predictors when participants possess greater actual control over the behavior  (Ajzen, 2002; Sheeran et al., 2003) . Thus, assuming that older samples have more accurate perceptions of control and that higher BMI reduces actual control over physical activity, it is understandable that age and BMI moderated these respective relationships. We should note, however, that these significant findings occur in the context of multiple tests of moderation, so replication of these results in primary studies would be desirable.\n\nIt is important to interpret the present findings in the context of limitations of our meta-analysis. First, even though we conducted computerized literatures searches guided by a medical librarian, and made efforts to access the gray literature, relatively few studies met the inclusion criteria for the review (k \u03ed 25, N \u03ed 5,897). Of the included studies, the majority (k \u03ed 14) used only self-report to measure physical activity while targeting psychological variables of interest. Second, we were unable to obtain full intercorrelation matrices for several studies, which limited the number of tests available for meta-analytic structural equation modeling. Third, while survivors of all types of cancer, in all stages of curative treatment were eligible for inclusion, most studies involved breast cancer survivors who had completed curative treatment; this consideration limits the generalizability of the present findings. The implication is that additional longitudinal studies using objective measures of physical activity among survivors of multiple types of cancer are needed, and full intercorrelation matrices should be reported to facilitate future quantitative syntheses. Finally, the scope of this meta-analysis excludes identification of confounding effects. We acknowledge that correlation is not causation and corroboration of the observational findings reported here with the results of experimental tests that manipulate intentions, selfefficacy, and so forth would be valuable.\n\nNotwithstanding these limitations, the present findings have implications both for health behavior theories and for interventions to promote physical activity among cancer survivors. Although we had no theoretical agenda at the outset of the review and included studies that used multiple, different theories, the present findings clearly fit the structure of the TPB. We also note that support for TPB constructs emerged in the context of primary studies that had a high average rigor score (M \u03ed 8.64) and used longitudinal designs that assess how psychosocial constructs predict subsequent behavior. The present findings offered little support for extensions to the TPB such as distinguishing between affective and instrumental attitudes or injunctive and descriptive norms  (Conner & Sparks, 2015) . At the same time, we acknowledge that our database did not include several key variables that predict physical activity after TPB variables have been taken into account, including anticipated regret  (Sandberg & Conner, 2008) , implementation intentions  (Gollwitzer & Sheeran, 2006) , and self-identity  (Rhodes, Kaushal, & Quinlan, 2016) . Empirical tests of these variables' capacity to improve prediction of cancer survivors' physical activity beyond that engendered by the TPB are warranted.\n\nOur findings have two key implications for interventions to promote physical activity among cancer survivors. First, the results indicate that techniques geared at strengthening intentions and enhancing self-efficacy are liable to be effective, and techniques that target attitudes, norms, and self-efficacy should strengthen intentions  (Abraham & Michie, 2008) . Second, we identified a substantial \"gap\" between physical activity and both intentions and self-efficacy among cancer survivors that was similar to the cognition-behavior discrepancy observed for other patient groups  (Rich et al., 2015) , and is greater than the gap seen in general population samples  (Hagger et al., 2002; McEachan et al., 2016) . It was also the case that younger and overweight samples had particular difficulty in enacting their physical activity intentions and self-efficacy. These findings speak to the potential value of using volitional strategies such as prompting selfmonitoring (e.g., via pedometers; review by  Harkin et al. (2016)  or forming implementation intentions) (i.e., if-then plans that specify how to respond to opportunities for, or obstacles to, physical activity; review by  B\u00e9langer-Gravel, Godin, and Amireault (2013) , as these strategies are known to improve the translation of cognitions into action). In sum, the present meta-analysis signals several directions for predictive and interventive studies that can and should be tested in future research."
