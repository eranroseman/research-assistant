  "title": "Remote Blood Pressure Monitoring With Social Support for Patients With Hypertension A Randomized Clinical Trial",
  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE Hypertension management has traditionally been based on office visits. Integrating remote monitoring into routine clinical practices and leveraging social support might improve blood pressure (BP) control. OBJECTIVE To evaluate the effectiveness of a bidirectional text monitoring program focused on BP control and medication adherence with and without social support in adults with hypertension. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This randomized clinical trial included adults aged 18 to 75 treated at an academic family medicine practice in Philadelphia in 2018 and 2019. Patients had been seen at least twice in the prior 24 months and had at least 2 elevated BP measurements (>150/90 mm Hg or >140/90 mm Hg for patients aged 18-59 years or with diabetes or chronic kidney disease) during visits. All participants had a cell phone with text messaging, offered at least 1 support partner, and were taking maintenance medications to treat hypertension. Patients were randomized 2:2:1 to remote monitoring of BP and medication adherence (RM), remote monitoring of BP and medication adherence with feedback provided to a social support partner (SS), or usual care (UC). Data were analyzed on an intention-to-treat basis between October 14, 2019, and May 30, 2020, and were revisited from May 23 through June 2, 2023. \n INTERVENTIONS The RM and SS groups received an automatic home BP monitor, 3 weekly texts requesting BP measurements, 1 weekly text inquiring about medication adherence, and a weekly text with feedback. In the SS arm, support partners received a weekly progress report. The UC group received UC through their primary care practice. Clinicians caring for the patients in the intervention groups received nudges via electronic health records to adjust medications when 3 of 10 reported BP measurements were elevated. Patients were followed up for 4 months. \n MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was systolic BP at 4 months measured during the final follow-up visit. Secondary outcomes included achievement of normotension and diastolic BP. RESULTS In all, 246 patients (mean [SD] age, 50.9 [11.4] years; 175 females [71.1%]; 223 Black individuals [90.7%] and 13 White individuals [5.3%]) were included in the intention-to-treat analysis: 100 patients in the RM arm, 97 in the SS arm, and 49 in the UC arm. Compared with the UC arm, there was no significant difference in systolic or diastolic BP at the 4-month follow-up visit in the RM arm (systolic BP adjusted mean difference, -5.25 [95% CI, -10.65 to 0.15] mm Hg; diastolic BP adjusted mean difference, -1.94 [95% CI, -5.14 to 1.27] mm Hg) or the SS arm (systolic BP adjusted mean difference, -0.91 [95% CI, -6.37 to 4.55] mm Hg; diastolic BP adjusted mean difference, -0.63 [95% (continued) Key Points Question Can remote monitoring of blood pressure (BP) alone or with feedback to the patient's social support partner improve BP control among patients with hypertension? Findings In this randomized clinical trial of 246 patients with hypertension, remote BP monitoring and remote BP monitoring with social support did not improve BP control compared with usual care. Meaning Findings of this trial indicate that neither remote monitoring of BP alone nor combined with social support result in improved BP control in adults with hypertension. Additional research on interventions aimed at reminding patients to take their BP medications is warranted.",

      "text": "Hypertension (HTN) affects about 30% of US adults.  1  Effective treatment that reduces long-term risk is available, but only about half of adults maintain good blood pressure (BP) control depending on the guidelines used,  [2] [3] [4] [5]  and Black patients typically have worse outcomes.  6, 7 Control of HTN requires diagnosis, initiation of treatment, adherence to medications, and titration of medications, traditionally delivered through face-to-face primary care visits.\n\nNew care delivery models might improve outcomes. First, substantial literature has shown the benefit of remote monitoring interventions in controlling HTN.  [8] [9] [10] [11]  Second, text messaging has become a common form of communication and could be used to engage patients in HTN management.  12, 13 Third, new approaches to clinical practice design that use strategies from behavioral science might make patient engagement more effective.  14, 15 For example, providing motivational feedback to patients might overcome present bias (defined as overvaluing immediate costs or rewards compared with long-term consequences) by highlighting the benefits of taking HTN medications that may not be immediately apparent for this disease, which often has no immediate symptoms.  16 Additionally, people are influenced by the behavior of others through social accountability (defined as being influenced by connections to other individuals),  17, 18  and an opportunity to engage a friend or family member who might serve as a witness to behavior and to whom the patient might feel accountable may yield better clinical outcomes.  [19] [20] 0] [21]  Evidence of the benefit of a feedback partner is limited, but such benefit could be enhanced through remote monitoring and text messaging in an approach called facilitated cheerleading, in which the technology platforms helps to communicate and enhance social support.  [22] [23] [24]  Among patients with poorly controlled HTN at an academic urban family medicine practice, we evaluated the effect of monitoring BP and medication adherence via bidirectional text messaging with feedback to the patient and, if needed, the clinician. We also compared the effect of remote monitoring combined with providing feedback to a social support partner with providing remote monitoring alone."

      "text": "Patients in both the RM and SS arms were mailed an electronic BP cuff (model BP710N; OMRON Healthcare, Inc). An adult size, extra-large cuff was provided upon patient request (Medline).\n\nPatients received 3 text prompts per week to take and submit their BP measurements, and 1 text each week asking them about their medication adherence for the past week. Patients in both of these arms also received a weekly text with feedback on their BP monitoring and medication adherence from the study staff. Additionally, in the SS arm, support partners received a weekly text update on the BP monitoring and medication adherence of their associated patient. Support partners were able to opt out of providing feedback to their associated patient. If the support partner did not opt out, the patient received a once-weekly feedback text message on behalf of their support partner either encouraging them to continue their good work or to try to do better in the following week, depending on their performance (trial protocol in Supplement 1). Patients in the RM and SS arms were monitored for 4 months. Patients randomly assigned to the UC control arm received UC as provided by the clinical practice, which included office visits only as scheduled through routine practice.\n\nFor phase 1 (151 patients), if at any point 3 of 10 reported BP measurements were elevated per JNC 8 guidelines, the elevated measurements and any subsequent measurements (up to 10) were sent via EHR message to the patient's primary care physician (PCP) along with the patient's reported medication adherence and a nudge to adjust medications (\"JNC 8 guidelines suggest that hypertension medications should be adjusted and added until blood pressure is controlled.\").\n\nMeasurements were reported again in this same manner if they remained elevated and at least 3 weeks elapsed between nudges.\n\nIf at any time a patient's BP was severely elevated (systolic BP \u0546180 mm Hg or diastolic BP \u0546110 mm Hg), a text message was sent to the patient with instructions to recheck in 15 minutes and if the BP remained elevated, to call the clinic to discuss their measurement with a nurse or other clinician.\n\nThis severely elevated BP measurement, along with information about patient-reported medication adherence, was also reported directly to the PCP via an EHR message.\n\nBased on feedback from clinicians, this procedure was updated for phase 2 (100 patients). At this time, the study team implemented an integration between the Way to Health platform and patient EHRs, so that all patient-reported BP measurements populated into a flowsheet in the EHR, and a centrally designated team of nurses and a nurse practitioner (NP) were identified to manage patient follow-up and medication changes. On enrollment into 1 of the 2 intervention arms, in addition to notifying the PCP of the patient's enrollment, research staff sent a special BP monitoring order to the NP, who approved and signed the order for each patient. This order electronically authorized patient-submitted BP measurements to be reviewed via flowsheet directly within the patient EHR. Nursing staff met twice weekly with the NP to review all monitoring notifications in bulk and make appropriate medication adjustments with follow-up phone calls or visits as needed. Any changes to patient medication were then routed via the EHR to the PCP."

Study staff performed the follow-up BP measurement at the practice site using the same machines used for routine office visits (Welch Allyn model 4200B). Patients rested for 5 minutes prior to having their BP measured, during which time they completed a brief follow-up survey assessing end of study BP monitoring and medication adherence and their experience with the intervention as measured by a net promoter score. The net promoter score measures the likelihood of a patient to recommend a service on a score of 1 (not likely) to 10 (very likely). Values of 7 and 8 are discarded and the number of detractors (6 and below) is subtracted from the number of promoters (9 or 10) to calculate the score (range, -100 to 100).\n\nBlood pressure was measured 3 times with a 1-minute rest between each measurement.

For patients with missing BP data, we first included BP measurements available from the EHR occurring from 90 to 150 days after the participant's enrollment in the trial, and then conducted multiple imputation using all available baseline covariates (all 246 participants). Secondary analyses assessed achievement of BP control by trial arm using \u03c7 2 tests and repeated the analyses for systolic BP with diastolic BP at the 4-month visit (all 246 participants). In addition, we tracked BP measurements by arm from the EHR that were obtained through UC for up to 8 months after the end of the trial. We also compared self-reported BP monitoring and medication adherence by trial arm at baseline and at the end-of-study visit (209 patients) based on patient survey responses.\n\nSystolic and diastolic BPs were compared using multivariable linear regression, and BP control was evaluated using \u03c7 2 tests, with a 2-sided P < .02 considered significant. The mean percentage of expected BP measurements received for patients in the RM and SS arms was compared against the UC arm using an independent t test with a 2-sided P < .05 considered significant.

However, based on additional clinical information obtained after the study was initiated, we estimated an SD for systolic BP of 20 mm Hg, larger than our initial estimate. Thus, we increased our accrual target to 100 patients in each intervention arm and 50 patients in the control arm, which provides 80% power to detect a difference in systolic BP of 11 mm Hg between either the RM or SS groups and the UC group, and a difference in systolic BP of 9 mm Hg between the RM and SS arms.

In a post hoc analysis, we did not find any differences in change in systolic BP and proportion of patients with normotension between either intervention and control arms 12 months from the start of the trial based on any office BP measurements in the EHR between 4 and 12 months after the date of enrollment (eTable 4 in Supplement 2).

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "In this randomized clinical trial, we found no significant improvement in BP control in either of the remote monitoring arms compared with UC. Likewise, there was no difference in self-reported frequency of BP monitoring in the intervention groups with or without social support.\n\nThe intervention incorporated remote engagement with text messaging, the provision of home BP monitors, integration of data in the EHR, and social support to help patients improve BP control. Despite the conceptual appeal of these interventions, we found no improvement in BP control in this study. Several factors might explain the results. First, the intervention was primarily focused on patient behavior, while clinician management and prescribing may also influence BP control.  28 In phase 1, the BP alerts may have overburdened PCPs, who may not have had enough time to respond appropriately. Only in phase 2 were alerts sent to a dedicated team of nurses and NPs. Additionally, there is evidence that clinical inertia may impede dose escalation.  29 cond, there may not have been enough time in the 4-month intervention for BP control to change. Many of the PCPs were still relying on office visits for responding to BP alerts since the current payment model for primary care at this institution still relies on reimbursement for office visits, which may take weeks or months to schedule. Across both phases, requesting an office visit with the patient for BP follow-up was the second most common action taken in response to alerts (21.7%), while the most common response to alerts was to take no action (37.9%). Medications were titrated only 17.4% of the time, in a mix between remote management and in-person visits. When we reviewed clinician actions by study arm, we found that while medication doses in both groups were titrated at similar rates, alerts from the SS arm were acted on less frequently than alerts from the RM arm (38.8% vs 30.9%).  30 Nevertheless, we did not observe differences across arms when we extended our assessment of outcomes an additional 8 months after the end of study office visit.\n\nThird, social support partners may have been able to provide social accountability but may not have known how to provide substantive support. Fourth, the study relied on an opt-in consent process, so we may have selected patients who were particularly motivated and may have improved BP with no intervention. Also, the enrollment process and final BP check for the control group may have acted as an intervention. Our control group experienced a 40% rate of controlled BP at the end of the study."

      "title": "Strengths and Limitations",
      "text": "The trial has strengths in design and evaluation. This trial was conducted in close partnership with an urban primary care practice with a large proportion of Black patients, who are known to have worse outcomes in BP management. We also leveraged new technology through text messaging and automation that are being used more in practices across the country, particularly since the COVID-19 pandemic. Finally, we rigorously evaluated the utility of creating a mechanism for increased social accountability that holds promise for health care delivery but also needs to be evaluated in additional clinical care settings.\n\nAn important limitation of the study is that there may not have been sufficient power to detect smaller improvements in BP control, so we cannot make conclusions about the effectiveness or lack of effectiveness of remote monitoring. The SD of the mean systolic BP change was greater than the initial estimate but lower than what was estimated in the revised power calculation. Additionally, as this was a pragmatic design, the inclusion criteria for BP control were based on routine office visits, while the outcome ascertainment was conducted through a separate end of study research visit using the same equipment, and research staff were unblinded. Finally, there was differential follow-up for the final visit, but we conducted imputation to account for missing data."

While 213 of 246 patients (86.6%) attended the end-of-study visit, 3 were excluded from complete case analyses because their last visit was outside of the 30-day window, and 4 more were excluded because of incomplete BP data from the visit. Of the 206 patients (83.7%) with complete end of study data, we found follow-up visit completion was higher in the 2 intervention arms (84.0%"

A total of 246 patients (mean [SD] age, 50.9[11.4] years; 175 females [71.1%] and 71 males [28.9%]; 223 Black patients [90.7%], 1 Hispanic or Latino patient [0.4%], 13 White patients [5.3%], 6 patients [2.4%] of other races, and 5 patients [2.0%] of unknown race and ethnicity) were included in the intentionto-treat analysis: 5 of the enrolled patients were excluded (2 patients were ineligible, 1 left the practice, 1 withdrew from the trial, and 1 died of unrelated causes). A total of 151 patients were enrolled in phase 1 and 100 in phase 2: 100 patients in the RM arm, 97 in the SS arm, and 49 in the UC arm. While 213 of 246 patients (86.6%) attended the end-of-study visit, 3 were excluded from complete case analyses because their last visit was outside of the 30-day window, and 4 more were excluded because of incomplete BP data from the visit. Of the 206 patients (83.7%) with complete end of study data, we found follow-up visit completion was higher in the 2 intervention arms (84.0%"
