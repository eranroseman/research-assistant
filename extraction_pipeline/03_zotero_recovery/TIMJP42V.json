  "title": "The Association Between State Physical Education Laws and Student Physical Activity",
  "abstract": "Introduction: This study examined the association between state physical education time requirements and physical activity and physical education outcomes among high school students. \n Methods: State physical education time requirement laws for 2004-2016 from the Classification of Laws Associated with School Students database were linked with 2005-2017 national Youth Risk Behavior Survey data using state and year identifiers. Analyses were conducted between 2018 and 2019 to assess associations between physical education time requirement laws and physical activity or physical education outcomes using multinomial logistic regressions, while controlling for sociodemographic characteristics, year-fixed effects, and state confounders. Results: State laws requiring \u226590 minutes of physical education per week were associated with 3.1 percentage points lower probability of no days of physical activity \u226560 minutes (95% CI= \u00c05.0, \u00c01.1), 3.7 percentage points lower probability of no days of moderate exercise \u226530 minutes (95% CI= \u00c06.2, \u00c01.3), 4.2 percentage points lower probability of no days of vigorous exercise \u226520 minutes (95% CI= \u00c05.2, \u00c03.3), and 19.3 percentage points lower probability of not attending physical education class (95% CI= \u00c034.4, \u00c04.2). The laws were associated with a 2.4 percentage point higher probability of daily moderate exercise \u226530 minutes in male students (95% CI=0.6, 4.2) and a 3.4 percentage point higher probability in female students (95% CI=1.9, 4.9), with larger associations for female students (p<0.01). Conclusions: Findings from this study help support the role that physical education state requirements can play in enhancing adolescents' ability to meet recommended amounts of daily physical activity and the related public health benefits.",

      "text": "T he Physical Activity (PA) Guidelines for Americans recommend that children and adolescents engage in moderate-to-vigorous PA for at least 60 minutes/day, including vigorous-intensity aerobic, muscle strengthening, and bone strengthening activities at least 3 days/week.  1 Many youth fall short of these recommendations: Only 26% of high school (HS) students in the U.S. participate in PA for at least 60 minutes/day.  2, 3 olicymakers and advocates have long considered physical education (PE) laws as potential effective policies to increase youth PA and PE engagement during the day,  [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23]  particularly those requiring specific amounts of PE time.  8, 19, 21, 23 The Institute of Medicine and SHAPE America recommend HS students spend an average of 45 minutes/day or 225 minutes/week in PE.  [24] [25] [26]  However, only about 30% of HS students nationwide report attending PE classes daily during an average, 5day school week,  3, 27  and only 51.7% report attending PE on \u22651 day in an average school week.  27 These statistics are concerning because PE is the primary opportunity for students to engage in PA during the school day.  1, 24, 28 A declines as children grow older, so if they are not getting PA during PE, they may be getting little to no daily PA. 3, 27  Studies have shown that students in states with PE time requirement laws at the elementary and middle school levels are engaged in more PE time. 9, 21, 22, 29  PE time requirements, whether at the state law or school policy or practice level, tend to have a more pronounced effect on girls' PE attendances and activity than boys. 7, 20, 23  Because female youth are less physically active than male youth,  [30] [31] [32]  understanding whether PE laws increase rates of female youth PE attendance and PA is critical.\n\nA few studies have examined the relationship between PE laws or policies and PE or PA. Cawley et al.  23  found that state PE credit requirements were associated with increased time spent being physically active in PE and with increased time girls spent on vigorous exercise and strength-building activity. However, that study only used state agency-reported PE credit requirements rather than state law PE time requirements. In addition, it only included 1 year of state law data (2001), though those data were linked with 3 years of national Youth Risk Behavior Survey (YRBS) data (1999, 2001, and  2003). The study assumed PE credit requirements were the same for 1999-2003 (inclusive), and the authors did not allow for any policy lags between the policies taking effect and student outcomes. In another study,  Kim 7  found that schools' PE requirements were associated with improved children's PA with some sex variation. Sabia et al.  33  exploited within-state variation in state HS PE laws and found that a 1-semester (0.5 credits) increase in PE requirements was associated with a 10%-13% increase in minutes spent physically active in PE. The investigators also found that increases in PE requirements were associated with increases in days of moderate exercise for male but not female students.\n\nThere is some evidence that girls may be more likely to offset increased PE time by reducing PA outside of school (\"ActivityStat hypothesis\"),  34  but such evidence is only for elementary school students and does not extend to how PE law affects overall PA. The possibility also exists that PE might well increase PA time out of school by forming and reinforcing exercise habits.  22 onsidering the low rates of PA and PE participation among HS students and especially those who are female,  27, 35  PE time requirement laws at the HS level could provide a mechanism to support increased PA during and after the school day. This study fills a research gap by examining the association between state law requirements for PE time at the HS level and a range of student PA and PE practices and explores sex differences in these relationships."

      "text": "The YRBS is a national, publicly available school-based survey of HS students in grades 9-12, conducted biennially by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention since 1991. The YRBS monitors an array of health behaviors, including PA.  36, 37  The national YRBS sample is considered representative of all students in grades 9-12 who attend public and private schools in the U.S.  38, 39  YRBS data are regularly used in the literature to research different HS behaviors and outcomes.  [40] [41] 1] [42] [43] [44]  Data from the national YRBS for 2005-2017 (inclusive) were used herein. The YRBS data were obtained through a restricted use agreement with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that provided the individual-level national data for all years with state identifiers.  45 odified state PE time requirements for HS were obtained from the National Cancer Institute's Classification of Laws Associated with School Students (CLASS) system, which rates the strength of these time requirements on a scale of 0-5.  46 CLASS includes data for all 50 U.S. states and the District of Columbia (hereafter all referred to as \"states\"). Consistent with previous studies,  20, 21  the authors dichotomized this scale to group states that either (1) had no PE requirement, required a nonspecific amount of time for PE, or required <90 minutes/week (ratings of 0-2) or (2) required \u226590 minutes/week of PE (ratings of 3-5). This categorization was chosen because of the limited number of states in the 4-5 categories (2-4 states depending on the year) and because a score \u22653 indicated the state had a definitive time requirement for PE in place. The 90-minute minimum threshold corresponds to the average amount of time reported for PE time in HS, so it was used as a cut point.  47 This dichotomous indicator was the key independent variable in the analyses to compare PA outcomes in states without a requirement for \u226590 minutes of PE/ week with those with such a requirement. Because CLASS collects codified laws in effect as of December 31 of each year, YRBS data were linked to PE law data that were lagged by 1 year, using state and year identifiers. For example, CLASS data from 2014 were linked to 2015 YRBS data.\n\nAs the YRBS national data do not contain district-or schoollevel identifiers, it was not possible to control for these characteristics; however, analyses did control for individual-and state-level contextual factors. Individual-level YRBS control variables included age (categorized as \u226412, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, and \u226518 years), sex, race and ethnicity (white, black, Hispanic, non-Hispanic multiple race, other race, and missing race), and grade (9, 10, 11, 12, and ungraded or other grade). State-level percentage of students eligible for free or reduced-price lunch (FRPL) was linked using state and year identifiers  [48] [49] [50] [51]  (YRBS data were matched to data from the corresponding school year; for example, 2015 YRBS data were matched to 2014-2015 school year data). Tertiles of FRPL were computed across states within each year to March 2020 capture states with low, medium, or high percentages of students eligible for FRPL, as a proxy for SES.  52"

      "title": "Measures",
      "text": "Six self-reported PA or PE measures were derived from YRBS, with the years they were available noted in parentheses: (1) physically active \u226560 minutes (2005-2017), (2) vigorous exercise \u226520 minutes (2005-2009), (3) moderate exercise \u226530 minutes (2005-2009), (4) muscle strengthening exercise (2011-2017), (5) attend PE class (2005-2017), and (6) amount of time spent in PE exercising or playing sports (2005-2009). Outcomes 1-5 were measured based on whether students engaged in the given behavior 0 days, nondaily, or daily. Outcome 6 was measured based on whether students had no PE minutes exercising or playing sports, 1-60 minutes, or >60 minutes. Details on how these variables were constructed are in Appendix Table 1, available online. Statistical Analysis The pooled 2005-2017 YRBS data set included 101,473 youth with data on their state, age, and sex. Of those, 92 were dropped owing to missing grade-level data, and 1,596 were dropped because of missing state-level FRPL data. Missing data on specific outcome measures left 97,590 youth for analyses of being physically active \u226560 minutes (48,065 males, 49,525 females), 38,976 for analyses of vigorous exercise \u226520 minutes (19,071 males, 19,905 females), 38,805 for analyses of moderate exercise \u226530 minutes (18,974 males, 19,831 females), 44,166 for analyses of muscle strengthening exercise (22,011 males, 22,155 females), 95,515 for analyses of attending PE class (46,994 males, 48,521 females), and 38,055 for analyses of amount of time spent in PE exercising or playing sports (18,597 males, 19,458 females). States included varied by year, with the pooled data set containing 42 states across the study years; in any given year, the number of states with schools or students sampled for inclusion in the national YRBS varied 45 : 2005 (31 states), 2007 (26 states), 2009 (25 states), 2011 (28 states), 2013 (26 states), 2015 (27 states), and 2017 (25 states). The number of states included in the pooled data set for each outcome also varied: physically active \u226560 minutes (n=42; range, 24-28 states), vigorous exercise \u226520 minutes (n=37; range, 24-28 states), moderate exercise \u226530 minutes (n=37; range, 24-28 states), muscle strengthening exercise (n=34; range, 22-26 states), attending PE class (n=42; range, 24-28 states), and amount of time spent in PE exercising or playing sports (n=37; range, 24-28 states).\n\nThe associations between each PA or PE outcome and state PE time requirement laws were analyzed using multinomial logit regressions at the individual level, controlling for contextual controls and year dummies that captured common annual trends. Multinomial logit regressions were used to avoid imposing additional assumptions regarding the ordinality of the data, such as the parallel regression assumption.\n\nStratified analyses were conducted to analyze sex-specific associations between state laws and PA or PE. Sex differences in these associations were tested using F-tests on models with additional interaction terms between sex and independent variables. The command \"mlogit\" in Stata/SE, version 15.1, was used to estimate multinomial logistic models. Specifically, the \"svy\" version of this command was used to account for final weights provided by YRBS and for clustering at the state level by treating state as a primary sampling unit variable. Analyses occurred between 2018 and 2019."

      "text": "The weighted summary statistics are presented in Table  1 . During the study period, 23%-28% of youth lived in a state that required PE for \u226590 minutes/week, and nearly half were in states with a relatively high percentage of FRPL-eligible students. A majority of students were physically active and engaged in different forms of exercise in the past 7 days, with most outcomes being more common some days than every day. A significant proportion of students did not attend PE (48%), but the proportion attending PE daily (31%) was greater than that attending nondaily (21%). In addition, 49% of students spent 1-60 minutes exercising or playing sports during PE, and 10% spent >60 minutes. The analytic sample included male and female HS students in all grades (9-12) who mostly ranged from age 14 to \u226518 years and represented a variety of racial and ethnic groups.\n\nTable  2  presents the multinomial logit regression results. The estimates of the associations between PA or PE outcomes and PE time requirement laws (\u226590 minutes/week) are reported in marginal effects (percentage points) and semielasticities (percentage). Because multinomial regressions were employed, 3 estimates for how PE time requirement laws were associated with each PA or PE outcome are reported, which are the probability of not engaging in that form of PA or PE (column 1), the probability of engaging in it nondaily or spending 1-60 minutes of PE exercising or playing sports (column 2), and the probability of engaging in it daily or spending >60 minutes of PE exercising or playing sports (column 3).\n\nTable  2  shows that PE time requirement laws (\u226590 minutes/week) were associated with decreased probabilities of not engaging in (percentage point changes shown in parentheses): PA \u226560 minutes (95% CI= \u00c05.0, \u00c01.1), moderate exercise \u226530 minutes (95% CI= \u00c06.2, \u00c01.3), or vigorous exercise \u226520 minutes (95% CI= \u00c05.2, \u00c03.3), attending PE class (95% CI= \u00c034.4, \u00c04.2), and taking PE (95% CI= \u00c034.5, \u00c06.8). PE time requirement laws also were associated with increased probabilities of nondaily and daily engagement in PA (columns 2 and 3). PE time requirement laws were significantly associated with an increased probability of being active \u226560 minutes nondaily (95% CI=0.7, 3.2), nondaily vigorous exercise (95% CI=0.6, 3.7), nondaily muscle strengthening exercise (95% CI=1.6, 6.5), and spending 1-60 minutes exercising or playing sports in PE (95% CI=5.3, 38.9). The laws were also associated with a higher probability of daily vigorous exercise (95% CI=0.6, 3.6) and daily moderate exercise (95% CI=1.6, 4.2). The sex-specific results showed similar patterns that were found in the overall analyses, and F-tests did not reveal differences in policy associations for most outcomes (Table  3 ). However, for moderate exercise \u226530 minutes and amount of time spent in PE exercising or playing sports, the magnitudes of associations with state law were larger for female students, and F-tests for these differences were statistically significant (p<0.05)."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "Using nationally representative data, this study found that state laws requiring \u226590 minutes/week of PE were significantly associated with being physically active \u226560 minutes and engaging in moderate-to-vigorous exercise and muscle strengthening exercise and with decreased probabilities of not attending and taking PE class and a higher probability of spending active time in PE exercising or playing sports. Because of the numerous benefits of PA for long-term health-related outcomes, 1,53 PE time laws may help improve PA and related outcomes among youth.\n\nThe key independent variable in this study was state law requiring \u226590 minutes/week of PE, but only 2 of 6 outcome measures were specific to PE. The rest reflected PA more broadly (e.g., any PA inside or outside of school). The \"ActivityStat hypothesis\" suggests when PA is increased or decreased in 1 domain (e.g., in PE), there will be a compensatory change in another domain (e.g., out-of-school time) to maintain an overall stable level of PA or energy expenditure over time.  34 However, the findings reported herein do not suggest such compensatory behavior because state PE time requirements were associated with both increased time spent in PE and being active in PE and overall PA engagement. It is unknown whether more time spent in PE led to an offset in time spent engaged in PA outside of school and is an area worthy of further study.\n\nResults indicated that PE laws mandating students spend \u226590 minutes/week in PE may be an effective means to increase HS student PA. First, PE is the primary opportunity for HS students to engage in PA during the school day.  1, 24, 28 Although national standards recommend 225 minutes of PE/week at the HS level,  25, 26  most states are far from meeting that standard. The 90minute threshold used herein should be considered a minimal requirement and corresponds to the average amount of time reported elsewhere for PE in HS/week.  47 he fact that this study found an association between these minimal time requirements and PE and PA outcomes at the HS level is encouraging; however, states should aim to meet the national recommendations if possible. At the same time, research has shown that   The current study adds to the evidence base on the associations between codified PE time requirement laws and PE and PA among HS students and on sex differences in these associations. PE time laws were associated with a lower probability of no PE minutes spent exercising or playing sports and increased PA (daily moderate exercise and nondaily muscle strengthening exercise) for both sexes, the latter of which had not been previously documented in the literature. One possible explanation for the difference in findings is that the current study used repeated cross-sectional data for PE time requirement laws as opposed to analyses involving only 1 year of state self-reported policy data, and the previous study did not allow a lag between \"policy\" and student outcomes.  23 mitations First, this was a correlational rather than causal study owing to data limitations. Future studies would ideally capture longitudinal changes in PE and PA outcomes associated with PE time requirements. Second, YRBS is limited in the available contextual data; it does not contain family background or parents' education that may play an important role in students' PA and PE class attendances, nor does it include school-level data. Controls included state-level data on the percentage of students eligible for FRPL as a proxy for SES. However, there are likely additional unmeasured confounders, such as availability of funding for PE or levels of teacher training. Third, though YRBS is representative of grade 9-12 public and private school students in the U.S., it does not include participation from all states each year. Although this is an acknowledged limitation, the survey is considered nationally representative and the best available data nationwide to report on student PE and PA practices. Finally, the YRBS data are based solely on self-reported behaviors.  58 This suggests the PE and PA outcome measures may be overstated; although if anything the authors would expect this to attenuate the results owing to measurement error because correlation between error from self-reporting and state law is not expected."

      "title": "CONCLUSIONS",
      "text": "In this study, PE time requirement laws (\u226590 minutes/ week) were associated with a reduced probability of no activity and greater overall PA among HS students. These associations were driven by reduced probabilities of no days of PA, moderate, or vigorous exercise and by increased daily engagement in vigorous exercise and moderate exercise. PE time requirement laws were also associated with the amount of time spent in PE exercising or playing sports. Although future research is needed to isolate the causal impact of PE laws on PA, findings may inform policymaking concerning the potential effectiveness of PE time requirement laws in increasing PA and PE."
