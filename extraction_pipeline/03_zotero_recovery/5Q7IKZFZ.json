  "abstract": "Aim: This study aimed to contribute to the paucity of literature on disability in youth with OCD, particularly in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Methods: In South Africa (a LMIC), data was collected from 26 children and adolescents with OCD (12 girls, 14 boys; age range 6-18 years), and their parents, on an outpatient basis. Clinical measures aimed at assessing functional impairment due to OCD were administered. Results: Key findings were 1) that children with OCD reported being most significantly affected by their OC symptomatology within the school domain whereas parents placed emphasis on the impairment within the social domain; 2) scores on the Child Obsessive-Compulsive Impact Scale -Revised and the Children's Global Assessment Scale, were consistent, and 3) clinician-rated symptom severity was positively associated with parental reports on children's impairment due to OCD. Findings show similarities with data from similar studies in a high-income country (HIC) context. \n Conclusions: Children with OCD and their parents do not necessarily agree on the ways in which OCD impacts their lives. A comprehensive view of functional impairment in children with OCD, that is, from the viewpoints of the patient, parents, and clinicians, is critical when treatment is planned. Such information may assist with selection of relevant treatment targets, and ultimately improve the quality of life of all affected. children, functional impairment, low-and middle-income country, obsessive-compulsive disorder, treatment \n | INTRODUCTION Obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic psychiatric condition (American Psychiatric Association, 2013). The symptoms of OCD in youth are broadly similar to those reported by adults. Children and adolescents may however have less insight into the irrationality or excessiveness of their symptoms, or may have difficulty communicating their concerns, distress and impairments  (Geller et al., 2001; Wells, 2014) . Although it was once considered rare in children and adolescents, epidemiological studies have suggested an estimated prevalence of 0.25%-4% in paediatric samples  (Douglass et al., 1995;",

      "text": "In youth, OCD may affect functioning in different ways than in adults  (Storch et al., 2010) . This constitutes a neglected area of research however, with few studies on impairment associated with OCD in young children and adolescents. The data that do exist, suggest that adolescent OCD is associated with difficulties in school, home, and social behaviours (e.g.,  Piacentini et al., 2003; Storch et al., 2010) . Moreover, until recently, the majority of child psychiatric treatment studies focused on symptoms and diagnoses as treatment outcomes, with less than half (47.5%) of studies including level of functioning or impairment as a treatment outcome  (Hoagwood et al., 2012) , emphasizing the need for further exploration of the impact of this disorder in children and adolescents. Examining the impact of the disorder on specific aspects of functioning may be useful when selecting treatment targets as the extent of improved functioning appear to be predictive of long-term beneficial outcomes  (Barkley et al., 2006) . The value of obtaining information from different sources, in addition to patient report, may add benefit. For example, it has been noted that there may be disagreement between parents and children' s ratings of their functional impairment in a particular domain. Parents' understanding of illness impact may be different to that of the child -perhaps because the \"problematic\" behaviour can in some cases be kept hidden from parents -and this may inform treatment. Therefore emphasis has been placed on the importance of assessing a paediatric patient's functioning by obtaining information from both parent and patient, that he/she can be correctly diagnosed and enrolled in a suitable treatment program, with appropriate support at home (e.g.,  Storch et al., 2010) .\n\nPrevious studies on functional impairment among youth with OCD have mainly emerged from high-income countries (HICs). Individuals from low-and middle-income countries (LMICs) face other obstacles, including low mental health awareness and limited support or access to psychiatric services  (Esponda et al., 2020; Keynejad et al., 2018; Lund et al., 2016) , which may potentially contribute to functional impairment that may differ from, or be more than, that of patients in HIC settings. To our knowledge, there is only one published LMIC study of functional impairment of school aged children with OCD. This study included data from 77 Brazilian children with OCD and reported significant functional impairment due to OCD, highlighting school problems (e.g., grade failures, school refusal/expulsion) and delinquent behaviours (e.g., theft, vandalism)  (Alvarenga et al., 2016) . Notably, in that study, questionnaire-based data were collected from parents or primary caregivers only, overlooking the perspectives of the children.\n\nWe aimed to contribute to the paucity of previous work on functional impairment due to OCD in youth in a LMIC by collecting data from South Africans. Our first aim was to describe the domains and severity of OCD-related functional impairment using data collected using different measures, completed by patients, parents and clinicians, respectively. Our second aim was to assess the degree of convergence between the data collected using two different measures of OCD-related functional impairment. Thirdly, we investigated the association between OCD symptom severity and degree of functional impairment within this cohort, from the perspectives of parents and patients, respectively. And finally, we attempted to compare current findings with those from HICs."

      "text": "The study sample comprised 26 children and adolescents (12 girls, 14 boys; age range 6-18 years) with primary OCD. Each patient, and one parent respectively, were interviewed. Recruitment of participants followed a multipronged approach to increase sample size; information and advertisements of the study were placed in community papers of Cape Town and its suburbs (where the research unit is based), letters were sent to mental health clinicians in the area to request referrals, primary and secondary schools were visited where information on the study aims and procedures were shared with relevant staff, and radio talks were also used to inform the public about OCD and the specifics of the study, inviting people to take part. Inclusion criteria of patients comprised 1) current DSM-IV-TR OCD (American Psychiatric  Association, 2000)  with/out psychiatric comorbidity (aside from psychotic disorders); 2) 6-18 years of age at assessment, and 3) currently enrolled in a formal educational institution.\n\nData from two children were excluded; the one due to current psychosis and the other due to OCD that remitted. Additionally, two participants had attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), rendering them unable to complete the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS;  Scahill et al., 1997) . These latter two participants were still included in the sample, but only the parents' ratings on the CY-BOCS were used in analyses."

      "text": "Study materials were administered during two sessions, on different days, less than 2 weeks apart. Interviews were done by a clinically trained researcher, with the assistance of two research assistants (honours and master's degree level, respectively). Most assessment sessions (n = 24) were administered in the parents' home, while the rest were conducted in a university research laboratory. In both contexts, a patient and one parent were present.\n\nParents completed a sociodemographic questionnaire which included information about age, gender, and level of education. The diagnosis of OCD was established using the Schedule for Affective Disorders and Schizophrenia for School-Age Children-Present and Lifetime Version (K-SADS-PL;  Kaufman et al., 1997)  to parents and children separately (8 cases) or the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for Children and Adolescents Version 5 (MINI-KID;  Sheehan et al., 2010)  to parents and children together (18 cases). The K-SADS-PL is a diagnostic instrument suitable for children between the age 6-18 years and takes about 40 min to administer  (Kaufman et al., 2000) . The K -SADS-PL was only used for the first 8 cases and was replaced by the MINI-KID due to the lengthy administration time.\n\ndu PLESSIS ET AL.\n\nThe MINI-KID is another structured diagnostic interview for DSM-IV that takes less time to conduct (approximately 15 min), and has proven to be reliable and valid for use in children  (Duncan et al., 2018; Sheehan et al., 2010) .\n\nDuring the second assessment session, researchers administered the Child Obsessive-Compulsive Impact Scale-Revised (COIS-R) Report About Child (COIS-RP) and the COIS-R Child Self-Report (COIS-RC) to parents and children, respectively, to assess the latter's degree of OCD-specific academic, social, and home/family impairment  (Piacentini et al., 2007) . Each of these measures comprise of a 33-item Likert-type scale assessing how problematic a situation was in the month prior to the assessment, with response options ranging between 0 (not at all) and 4 (very much). Higher scores indicate increased impairment in the respective domains over the previous month. The parallel measures of COIS-RP and COIS-RC have 23 items in common, and 10 items that are different across the measures. Both COIS-R versions have shown good reliability and validity scores  (Piacentini et al., 2007) .\n\nOn completion of the second session, the clinician completed the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS;  Shaffer et al., 1983)  and the CY-BOCS  Scahill et al., 1997. The CGAS is a single-item clinicianrated measure of global impairment over the previous month in children aged 4-16 years. This instrument assesses the child's functioning in three discrete areas (home, school, and with peers), with scores ranging from 1 to 100, with high scores indicating better functioning.\n\nIt is a reliable measure with good discriminant and concurrent validity  (Shaffer et al., 1983) . The CY-BOCS is a clinician-rated, semistructured inventory of paediatric OCD symptoms and severity over the previous week, with higher total scores indicating more OCD symptoms and/or worse impairment. This instrument has good validity and internal consistency  (Storch et al., 2004) .\n\nAll study procedures were approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Cape Town's Faculty of Health Sciences and in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki (World Medical Association, WMA, 2013). Informed consent and assent were obtained from parents and patients, respectively."

      "text": "The Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) was used to analyse the data. The analyses included four consecutive steps with the threshold for statistical significance set at p < .05. First, for each COIS-RP and COIS-RC item, the total number of participants who endorsed a \"significant problem\" were calculated. The COIS-RC does not have established clinical cut-points; therefore, for the purposes of further data analysis (e.g., levels of parent-child agreement), and consistent with guidelines from  Piacentini et al. (2003)  and  Valderhaug and Ivarsson (2005) , the four response options were converted into a dichotomous rating system by collapsing the responses of 1, 2 and 3 into a single rating point (indicating \"a significant problem\" or \"reflecting more than minimal impairment\") as opposed to a response of 0, which signified \"no more than minimal OC-related impairment\".\n\nSecond, for each of the 23 items that were common to the COIS-RP and COIS-RC, we calculated the level of agreement on ratings between children and their parents using the Kappa statistic. Finally, we calculated the convergence between the child/parent and the clinician's impressions of functional impairment (i.e., the association between the number of COIS-R items indicating a significant problem and CGAS total score), and the associations between functional impairment (i.e., number of COIS-R items rated as describing a significant problem, and CGAS total score) and symptom severity (CY-BOCS total score). In each case, we used Kendall tau-b correlation coefficients (\u03c4 b ) because the data were non-parametric and there were many ties in the ranks."

      "title": "4. | DISCUSSION",
      "text": "Our findings extend prior literature on the functional impairment and illness severity of children and adolescents with OCD, incorporating data from patients, parents and clinicians, in a sample from a LMIC.\n\nKey findings were 1) children with OCD reported being most significantly affected within the school domain whereas parents emphasized social impairment; 2) scores on two different functional impairment measures were consistent, and 3) clinician-rated symptom severity was positively associated with parental reports on their children's impairment due to OCD.\n\nChildren reported that the school domainincluding activities such as taking tests/exams, concentrating, and completing assignmentswas most significantly affected by OCD. OCD studies generally report relative weaknesses in terms of some neurocognitive functions  (Geller et al., 2018) , including reduced processing speed, likely contributing to increased stress in the classroom and/or poorer academic performance. This is consistent with one of the COIS-R items most endorsed by children with OCD, that is, \"getting good grades.\" Contributing to the burden is that teachers may not be informed about OCD, and this lack of knowledge would likely negatively affect their understanding of, and empathy for the challenges faced by these children, compromising their handling of problematic classroom conduct  (Adams et al., 1994; Chaturvedi et al., 2014; Leininger et al., 2010) . Clinicians should thus involve teachers during treatment. The LMIC context may also pose challenges in terms of schooling; for example, here, overcrowded classrooms (high pupilteacher ratios) are typical. Children in general, and those with mental health difficulties in particular, may not receive adequate support in these academic environments  (Bayat et al., 2014) . In apparent contrast to the school domain impairment noted by children taking part in the current study and the parents/caregivers of children with OCD from another LMIC country (Brazil)  (Alvarenga et al., 2016) , the South African parents reported that their children were impaired in Moreover, these findings may suggest that patterns of functional impairment due to OCD in youth from LMICs may be similar to that of samples from HICs where impairments in home-and school-based activities have also been noted  (Piacentini et al., 2003; Valderhaug & Ivarsson, 2005; Weidle et al., 2014) .\n\nAlso consistent with earlier work in a HIC  (Piacentini et al., 2007) , we found that COIS-R (parents and children with OCD) and the CGAS (clinician) scores correlated, suggesting that they assessed a common construct. Of note, however, is that COIS-RP scores (i.e., parents' impressions of impairment), but not COIS-RC scores (children's impressions of their own impairment due to OCD), were significantly correlated with CGAS scores. Parents' ratings of the child's impairment were thus more consistent with clinician ratings than with children's ratings, suggesting that adults (i.e., parents, clinicians) may have comparable ideas about children's level and nature of impairment due to OCD. They may also have better insight than children themselves, that is, a better appreciation for impairment within and across domains). On the other hand, adults are not present in the classroom and may not have an accurate appreciation of the impact of OCD within this context. Children and adolescents with OCD would likely benefit from additional support and guidance on how to manage their symptoms at school. Research that examines the needs and challenges of OCD patients within this context, from their own perspectives, would be clinically useful.\n\nLevel of functional impairment due to OCD as rated by parents and the clinician was associated with OCD symptom severity, and the correlation between impairment in the school-domain as rated by parents and OCD symptom severity was most significant. Interestingly, the association between children's ratings of their functional impairment and illness severity was not significant, a finding resonating with the argument that even if symptoms of a psychiatric disorder are no longer experienced or is of reduced severity, this does not always correlate with low functional improvement  (Winters et al., 2005) .\n\nT A B L E 5 Associations between measures of functional impairment and symptom severity (N = 26 in both groups)\n\nCOIS-RP domain COIS-RC domain CY-BOCS School Family/activities Social Daily living skills Total School Family/activities Social Total Obsessions score .31* .11 .15 .28 .21 .25 .21 .07 .20 Compulsions score .41** .36* .23 .31* .36* \u00c0.07 .21 \u00c0.03 .06 Total score .41** .23 .16 .33* .29* .19 .26 \u00c0.01 .18 Note: Data reported are Kendall tau-b correlation coefficient.

The challenge was also exemplified by the one other LMIC study in youth with OCD  (Alvarenga et al., 2016)  where as much as 12 500 families of children 6-12 years in 57 Brazilian public schools (in the large cities of Porto Alegre and S\u00e3o Paulo) were approached, ultimately rendering a sample of only 77 children with OCD. Recruitment from elsewhere in South Africa, not only Cape Town (with population size at the time of study <500 000), perhaps using online interviewing may be one way of ensuring larger sample size, in future. Also, the South African sample was relatively homogeneous in terms of ethnicity. Future studies should aim to recruit more heterogeneous samples, enabling exploration of possible cultural differences in terms of QOL in more depth.\n\nAnother limitation is that we switched diagnostic instruments when it became clear that administration of the K-SADS presented too much of a burden for participants. Although both diagnostic instruments are suited for administration, no study has directly compared their psychometric properties or diagnostic sensitivity. Nevertheless, the strengths outweigh the limitations, with our study findings having important clinical implications.\n\nIn conclusion, this investigation rendered empirical data on OCDrelated functional impairment across multiple domains, from multiple angles, in a well-characterized LMIC paediatric sample. The work has contributed to the paucity of data on functional impairment in children and adolescents with OCD from LMICs. Our findings suggest that OCD-related impairments in youth may be similar between LMICs and HICs, despite the apparent contextual differences. Moreover, impressions of the extent and patterns of impairments by the LMIC parents and children, and clinicians were similara finding consistent with data from another HIC-based study  (Piacentini et al., 2007) . Finally, in the current study, children with OCD and their parents/caregivers did not always agree on the ways in which the condition impacts their lives. Our findings support the idea that having a comprehensive view of functional impairment in children with OCD, that is, from the viewpoints of the patient him/herself, parents, and clinicians, is critical when treatment is planned."

Obtaining parental input on the paediatric patient's OCD-related functional impairment may contribute to a comprehensive treatment strategy."
