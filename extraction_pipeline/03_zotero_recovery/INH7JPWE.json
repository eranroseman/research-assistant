  "title": "Prescriber perceptions of medication-related computerized decision support systems in hospitals: A synthesis of qualitative research",
  "abstract": "Objective: To identify factors that prevent and promote uptake of medication-related computerized decision support systems (CDSS) in hospitals, based on the perceptions of prescribers. Materials and methods: Databases Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PubMed and PsycINFO and the top five medical informatics journals were searched. English papers published after 2002, which used a qualitative approach to examine prescriber views of CDSS in hospitals were included. Qualitative data were extracted and mapped to the three domains of the HOT-fit framework (human, organization, and technology). Results: Factors preventing CDSS uptake were perceived threats to autonomy, CDSS conflicting with personal prescribing preferences, and mistrust of CDSS information. Factors promoting CDSS uptake were perceptions that CDSS improves safety and efficiency, and is easy to use. With respect to medication alerts, large numbers of irrelevant alerts reportedly led to alerts being ignored. When using order sentences/order sets, long lists of options led to excessive scrolling or clicks, and resulted in users opting for free text ordering. Discussion and conclusion: To promote medication-related CDSS uptake, it is recommended that prescribers' perspectives on CDSS usability and integration into workflow be sought during the design phase, that evidence on CDSS' effectiveness to improve safety be provided to prescribers, and that system information be kept up to date. To improve alert uptake, organizations should ensure that alerts and minimal and relevant. To improve uptake of order sentences/order sets, organizations should minimise the number of options available to prescribers. Future work should focus on exploring prescriber perceptions of other types of CDSS.",

      "text": "Computerized decision support systems (CDSS) integrated into hospital computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems have been shown to be effective in reducing prescribing error rates  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]  and in improving inappropriate prescribing  [5] [6] [7] . However, there are other studies that demonstrate CDSS to be ineffective in improving prescribing behaviours. For example, a recent systematic review summarising studies of prescribing alerts in hospitals found that in 53% of studies, a beneficial effect of alerts was reported, no effect was observed in 34% of studies, and in 6%, a detrimental effect was found  [8] . In the same way, order sets, another common form of CDSS, have been shown to improve prescriber efficiency and facilitate evidence-based practices in some cases  [9] [10] [11] , but are ineffective in others  [12] . Substantial money and time are invested in the development, implementation and ongoing maintenance of CDSS  [13, 14] , therefore ensuring these systems are effective and are being used to their full potential is vital for return on investment and achieving maximum benefits for patients. Despite the potential for CDSS to improve prescribing, a key factor impeding success of these systems appears to be poor uptake and acceptance by prescribers  [15] [16] [17] .\n\nMultiple factors appear to contribute to variability in CDSS uptake, including factors related to the user, the system and the organization  [17] . The human, organization and technology-fit (HOT-fit) framework  [18]  proposes three domains of evaluation: human, organization and technology, and includes subdomains; 1) system use and user satisfaction, 2) structure and environment, and 3) system quality, information quality and service quality. This framework was developed by combining the Information Software (IS) Success Model and the IT-Organizational Fit Model. The IS Success Model contains specific evaluation categories focusing on system quality, and the IT-Organizational Fit Model integrates the factors and concept of fit between human, organization and technology  [17] . The resulting HOT-fit framework therefore allows evaluation of these interrelated aspects and provides a structured summary of factors to determine which are associated with poor uptake of CDSS. This would allow targeted interventions to be implemented to increase adoption by prescribers. Undertaking in-depth qualitative interviews with users is a common approach for ascertaining how and why information technology is used and perceived  [19, 20] . Previous reviews collating user perceptions of medication-related CDSS have mainly focused on the primary care setting, with studies highlighting a lack of technical support, hardware issues and limited integration between the CDSS and existing software to be the main concerns  [17] . No previous reviews of hospital prescriber perceptions of medication-related CDSS have been conducted. In the current study, we used the HOT-fit framework to collate available evidence on prescriber perceptions of medication-related CDSS in hospitals in order to identify key factors that prevent and promote CDSS uptake."

      "title": "Eligibility criteria",
      "text": "To be eligible for inclusion, studies must have explored prescriber perceptions of medication-related computerized decision support in a hospital setting and used a qualitative method for data collection and analysis. This is consistent with other qualitative reviews  [21, 22]  and the supplementary guidance on qualitative evidence synthesis by the Cochrane Qualitative and Implementation Methods Group  [23] . Included studies also needed to be written in English. For studies with both a qualitative and quantitative component, only the qualitative data was extracted and used for this review. We excluded studies that were not primary research studies and those that investigated user opinions prior to implementation of CDSS. As the focus of the review was CDSS embedded in CPOE systems, we excluded studies that explored perceptions of stand-alone decision support systems e.g. mobile phone applications. We excluded studies published prior to 2003, as a previous review published that year on features critical to improving clinical practice with CDSS found only 16% of papers related to CDSS embedded within CPOE  [7] . The remainder were stand-alone systems that provided print out advice to attach to paper medication charts. The majority of studies were also conducted in an outpatient setting and are likely to reveal user perceptions that are no longer relevant due to advancements in health information technology and computer literacy of users."

Fig.  2  depicts the interrelationships between the domains and visually portrays the main themes extracted from papers. As evident in Table  2  and Fig.  2 , most themes related to the subdomains of system use and system quality. Few themes related to organization and we did not find any user perceptions related to the environment.\n\nA large proportion of users' perceptions were categorized into the human domain, in particular, the subdomain of system use. Expectations that medication-related CDSS improves safety  [27, 29, 31, 33, 34, 36, 37]  and efficiency  [27, 29, 36]  were consistently identified as facilitators of CDSS uptake. Factors associated with resistance to using CDSS included mistrust of the information  [26, 28, 34] , CDSS recommendations conflicting with prescribers' professional autonomy  [33, 34, 36] , and personal prescribing preferences  [28, 35] . In the subdomain of user satisfaction, a lack of perceived usefulness was found to be a barrier to CDSS uptake. This included senior doctors viewing CDSS as a tool more useful for junior doctors than themselves  [34, 36] .\n\nIn the technology domain, system quality was a key theme that emerged from papers with usefulness, efficiency and ease of use perceived to affect users' uptake of CDSS. Making the CDSS targeted and relevant to the user was a common facilitator  [26] [27] [28] [29] 35] , while systems that were perceived to reduce efficiency via excessive clicking  [27, 30, 33, 35] , scrolling  [26, 35, 38]  and interruptions to workflow  [27, 28, 33]  were less likely to be used. User perceptions relating to ease of use focussed on clear screen layout  [26, 28, 35]  and appropriate placement of information  [30] ."

A key facilitator to alert acceptance was believing alerts improved patient safety  [27, 31, 37] . The most commonly reported barrier to uptake of order sentences/order sets was that too many options were available to users when prescribing  [26, 31, 35, 37, 38] .

There is limited research focused on stakeholder involvement in developing and implementing CDSS  [39] , however, observational studies of prescribers have shown it is often junior doctors that are most exposed to the CDSS  [40]  and therefore this group should play a role in the development of the system. By involving prescribers at the development and implementation stages, the CDSS is likely to better align with end-user's workflow and cognitive processes  [41] . * percentages do not add to 100 as some studies used multiple methods or assessed multiple types of CDSS."

      "text": "Results suggest that uptake of CDSS will be poor if prescribers feel the system threatens their autonomy or if users perceive the CDSS as unnecessary. A study using a personality profiling tool on health professionals found that it is difficult to change doctor behaviours, and that any change requires highlighting the positive difference adherence to the culture-change can make, particularly with strong evidence  [42] . The most frequently occurring problem was lack of screen direction.

This was particularly the case for medication alerts. A study that interviewed users prior to CDSS implementation showed prescribers have an expectation that CDSS will improve patient safety  [43]  and our study has confirmed that when these expectations are met, uptake of the system is more likely. However, evidence of medication alerts' effectiveness in improving patient safety is mixed  [3, 8] , with variable alert designs and contexts of use possibly precluding generalizability to all hospitals. Providing evidence of benefits from the local site would assist organizations in overcoming this common barrier to CDSS use.

As mentioned previously, our review revealed that threats to prescriber autonomy and individual prescribing preferences often overshadowed CDSS recommendations, which was partly due to mistrust of CDSS information. Furthermore, our review found resistance to CDSS use when prescribers felt that the information presented was not up to date with current policies. A focus group conducted with prescribers revealed they are more accepting of alerts when the system has a reliable knowledge base that is developed with input from trusted peers  [44] . Therefore, ensuring the system is reliable and updated regularly will likely increase CDSS uptake."

      "title": "For alerts: ensure they are minimal and relevant to users",
      "text": "The presentation of irrelevant alerts was identified to be a key barrier to CDSS use in this review. Previous studies have shown that prescribers override the majority of alerts presented  [16, 40] . A review of medication alerts identified low clinical relevance as a major reason for alert overrides  [16] . To minimise this, increased specificity is needed, which can be achieved by, for example, tailoring alerts to patients and removing non-urgent alerts  [16, 45] . Improving CDSS quality in this way can positively impact on system use and on user satisfaction. 4.5. For order sentences/order sets: minimise options available to prescribers and excessive clicks and scrolling, to improve efficiency Improving the usability of the system by minimizing interruptions to workflow, the number of clicks needed and the number of options available to prescribers can improve CDSS uptake. Research has shown that the use of order sets increases efficiency quantitatively (i.e. time taken to prescribe)  [46]  but our review has shown that if prescribers perceive this option to be inefficient due to excessive scrolling and clicking, they are likely to opt for free-text ordering. Previous studies have found that perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of a technological system strongly correlates with system usage  [47, 48] . A survey study investigating user satisfaction with CPOE found that overall satisfaction most strongly correlated with perceptions of productivity, ease of use and speed  [49] . Therefore, improving efficiency through minimising options will likely improve uptake of order sentences/order sets."
