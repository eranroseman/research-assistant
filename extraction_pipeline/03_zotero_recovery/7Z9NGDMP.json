  "title": "The Effect of Technology-Based Home Cardiac Rehabilitation on Risk Factor Modifications in Coronary Heart Disease Patients. A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
  "abstract": "Background: The delivery channels and approaches related to cardiac rehabilitation (CR), such as eHealth, mHealth, and telehealth, are evolving. Several studies have identified their effects on patients with coronary heart disease, although no studies have focused on all the approaches collectively. Methods: Randomized controlled trials have investigated lipid profiles, through systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and body mass index (BMI). Stata software was used for analysis, while Egger's linear regression test and Begg's funnel plot were also applied. Results: Technology-based home CR revealed significantly lower total cholesterol (TC) levels (standardized mean difference (SMD) = -0.19\u037e 95% confidence interval [CI]: [-0.27, -0.11])\u037e triglyceride (TG) levels (SMD = -0.26\u037e 95% CI: [-0.35, 0.17])\u037e low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels (SMD = -0.18\u037e 95% CI: [ -0.25, -0.11])\u037e SBP (SMD = -0.26\u037e 95% CI: [-0.33, -0.19])\u037e DBP (SMD = -0.24\u037e 95% CI: [-0.32, -0.16])\u037e BMI (SMD = -0.12\u037e 95% CI: [-0.18, -0.05]), and improved high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels (SMD = 0.22\u037e 95% CI: [0.14, 0.31]). Conclusions: Technology-based home CR can be used to lower TC, TG, and LDL levels, alongside the BMI, SBP, and DBP indexes, while also raising HDL levels\u037e thus, its use should be widely promoted.",

      "text": "Coronary heart disease (CHD) is a major global cause of death and morbidity  [1] , which represents a huge public health concern as well as a large economic burden because patients with CHD are at serious risk of having a myocardial infarction, requiring hospital readmission, and even dying prematurely  [2, 3] . International guidelines have strongly recommended undertaking cardiac rehabilitation (CR), evidence-based pharmacological therapy, optimization of cardiovascular risk factors, and adherence to diet and physical activity to relieve the risks associated with CHD  [3, 4] .\n\nCompared with center-based CR, there are several advantages to technology-based home CR: (1) It allows patients to access cardiac rehabilitation programs from their homes, eliminating the need to travel to a healthcare facility, which can be especially beneficial for individuals who live in remote areas. (2) Digital platforms can collect and analyze data from wearable devices to customize exercise regimens and design treatment plans specifically to the needs of individual patients. (3) Real-time data on a patient's heart rate, blood pressure, and exercise efficiency can be obtained using wearable technology and apps. In order to improve patient safety, health providers can remotely monitor this data and take appropriate action.\n\nWith the advancement in technology, CR delivery channels and approaches have emerged, such as eHealth, mHealth, and Telehealth. Subsequently, throughout this paper, \"technology-based interventions\" refers to patient care activities that involve the use of the internet, digital/mobile appliances, and telephones, such as evaluations, monitoring, training, and encouragement of a healthy lifestyle. Previous studies concentrated on a single form of CR delivery channels and approaches in patients with CHD, meaning there is no research on technology-based CR delivery, which comprises all approaches related to technology. In addition, according to the currently available evidence, CR makes secondary prevention possible, which is essential after diagnosis because managing risk factors is a crucial step in the management of recurrence  [5] [6] [7] , whereby controlling cholesterol levels and blood pressure are crucial secondary prevention goals. According to the meta-analysis by Ettehad et al.  [8] , which analyzed data from more than 600,000 adults, a 10 mmHg decline in systolic blood pressure (SBP) is linked to a 20% decline in major cardiovascular events and a 13% decrease in all-cause death. Additionally, there is a 21% decrease in cardiovascular events for every 1 mmol/L decrease in low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels  [8] . In a previous study, Chong et al.  [9]  analyzed the efficacy of technology-assisted CR in CHD patients\u037e however, they only analyzed SBP, total cholesterol (TC), and circumference, meaning the evidence for reducing risk factors was insufficient. Meanwhile, considering the importance of reducing cardiovascular risk factors in patients with CHD, we performed a meta-analysis to summarize and update all technology-associated approaches in home CR and determine the efficacy of using technology-based home cardiac rehabilitation to control risk variables in patients with CHD."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "This study focused on the effectiveness of technologybased home CR in controlling risk factors in patients with CHD. We collected all the technology-related delivery methods (eHealth is the practice and delivery of healthcare using information and communication technologies (ICTs), such as the internet and mobile devices  [30] . Telehealth, which incorporates teleconferencing, smartphone applications, and encrypted communication with access from remote access, is frequently used interchangeably with telemedicine  [31] . mHealth is the utilization of mobile devices for medical and public health practices, including cellphones, patient monitoring equipment, personal digital assistants (PDAs), and other wireless appliances of CR, and was used to evaluate their effect on reducing risk factors, such as lipid profiles and BMI, SBP, and DBP). According to our findings, technology-based home CR can drastically reduce blood LDL, TC, and TG levels, while increasing serum HDL levels. Meanwhile, it could considerably reduce the BMI, SBP, and DBP indices. Our results are consistent with those of a previous study that researched the efficacy of mHealth CR in alleviating risk factors  [32] . However, compared with their study, we did not analyze non-English publications but their study did. We restricted the published languages since the English-language articles were of greater quality and more thorough information. Additionally, they included only mHealth CR in their research, while we used all three approaches. Chong et al.  [9] , analyzed the effectiveness of technology-assisted CR in patients with CHD, and their results depicted no significant difference between technology-assisted CR and traditional/center-based CR on modifiable cardiovascular risk variables, such as S/DBP and TC. The differences in our findings could be attributed to the different number of studies included in the analysis. In their meta-analysis, only five papers were included, whereas we included more than 15 investigations. The number of included studies may also have an impact on the presented outcomes. Furthermore, their analysis did not include enough risk factors, based on their results, whereas we also analyzed other crucial variables, such as TG, HDL, and LDL, which are important to the prognosis of CHD. Regarding the high heterogeneity of our results, we conducted a subgroup analysis. Unfortunately, we did not observe any source of heterogeneity in our analysis (Supplementary Tables  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 ). This study thoroughly explored the effects of technology-based home CR on the alleviation of risk factors in patients with CHD. In this study, technology-based home CR included eHealth, mHealth, and telehealth services. This study was comprised of only RCTs. Compared with a previous study, we included more approaches related to technology and analyzed more risk factors that might have an impact on the prognosis of CHD.\n\nCR has been shown to have a considerable impact on both the prevalence and death rates related to CHD, as well as the overall quality of life experienced by patients. CR training has been shown to enhance blood circulation and myocardial capability, facilitate CR, and decrease the chance of impairment and mortality  [33] . As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to develop, technology-based CR will progress significantly in personalizing care, improving monitoring, and providing support. Due to the AI algorithms, the rehabilitation device can assess a comprehensive range of patient data, encompassing medical history, vital signs, and exercise capability. This analysis facilitates the creation of CR plans that are customized for individual patients and exhibit a high degree of personalization. Furthermore, these plans possess the ability to adapt and evolve over time, in response to the patient's progress and changing demands. With the assistance of AI, well-designed programs can be combined with patient education, ongoing monitoring, and ongoing support, meaning that technologybased home CR could be successful over the long term."

      "title": "Limitations",

Second, patients in more than 20 studies were predominantly male, and a sex subgroup analysis was not undertaken because there was insufficient data quantifying the CR benefits by gender. Third, only studies written in English were considered in the inclusion criteria for choosing publications, meaning research written in other languages was excluded. Given these constraints, our findings should be cautiously interpreted."
