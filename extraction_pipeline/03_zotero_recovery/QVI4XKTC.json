  "title": "Using EPPM to Evaluate the Effectiveness of Fear Appeal Messages Across Different Media Outlets to Increase the Intention of Breast Self-Examination Among Chinese Women",
  "abstract": "The current study aims to examine the influence of fear appeal messages across different media outlets on Chinese women's intention of breast self-examination using the Extended Parallel Processing Model (EPPM). A two-by-two-by-two factorial experiment is designed to examine the effect of threat and efficacy level of stimulus on different media outlets on behavioral intention. The sample includes 488 Chinese women who are between 25 and 50 years old. The results revealed that there were significant main effects of both threat and efficacy on the intention to performing breast self-examination. Moreover, the significant two-way interaction effect between threat and efficacy was detected, which indicated that Chinese women who received messages containing both high threat and high efficacy had the highest intention of breast selfexamination. Besides, the results demonstrated that there was no significant difference in the effectiveness of fear appeal messages on between traditional and social media.",

      "text": "Breast cancer has become one of the most invasive cancers, with high mortality rates among adult women. According to the World Health Organization (2013), breast cancer was the most diagnosed strain of cancer among females in 2012, with approximately 1.38 million new cases worldwide. When compared to other types of cancer, breast cancer was responsible for 458,000 deaths, and was ranked as the fifth cause of death in 2012.\n\nIn China, breast cancer has become the most common strain of cancer and is the fourth leading cause of cancerrelated death among Chinese females. In the past two decades, China has experienced an ever-increasing incidence of breast cancer, with national rates twice that of global rates  (Wang et al., 2015) . Each year, cases in China account for 12.2% of all newly diagnosed breast cancer and 9.6% of all deaths from breast cancer worldwide  (Fan et al., 2014) . Although Chinese females are at a high risk for breast cancer, most of them have poor knowledge about breast cancer. Many researchers have indicated that BSE is an important way to detect breast cancer early, which can lower its mortality rate. They believed that it is imperative to increase the knowledge of breast cancer and BSE among Chinese females through health education programs and breast health awareness campaigns in order to lower mortality rates  (Liu, Xia, Isaman, Deng, & Oakley, 2010; Thomas et al., 2002) .\n\nMost of the breast cancer campaigns in China focus on organizing offline activities, such as inviting female celebrities to participate in social welfare activities to attract public attention of this issue. However, fear-inducing campaigns have never been conducted to promote Chinese women's breast cancer preventive behaviors. A number of studies have demonstrated that fear appeals can be effective in promoting individuals' health behaviors  (Tannenbaum et al., 2015; Witte & Allen, 2000) . In light of the extant literature, the purpose of the present study is twofold. Firstly, based on the Extended Parallel Process Model (EPPM), this study aims to examine the causal relationship between the provision of fear appeal messages describing the risks and precautions of breast cancer to women, and their intention to perform BSE. Secondly, this study will also aim to compare between the effectiveness of fear appeal messages on traditional and social media."

      "title": "The extended parallel process model of persuasion",
      "text": "Fear appeal messages based on the EPPM have been widely used in public health and advertising campaigns. Many studies have acknowledged the power of fear appeal messages in motivating behavior changes across a variety of behaviors  (Goei et al., 2010; Kotowski, Smith, Johnstone, & Pritt, 2011; Smith et al., 2008) . In a meta-analysis of fear appeals,  Witte and Allen (2000)  have concluded that variables in the EPPM can directly affect and interact to affect recipients' attitudes, behavioral intentions, and behaviors. Tannenbaum et al. (2015)  also conducted a meta-analysis to test the effectiveness of fear appeals. They realized the power of fear appeals in behavioral change. Moreover, they found that well-designed fear appeal messages that include both efficacy and threat had greater persuasiveness than other messages. Compare with individualist culture, fear appeals can be more effective in promoting recommended actions in collective culture. The current study seeks to explore effective health promotion messages to increase Chinese women's intention of breast self-examination (BSE), thus using the EPPM as the theoretical framework.\n\nOur study builds on the EPPM developed by  Witte (1992) , which aimed to investigate reactions to fear appeal stimuli. The EPPM serves as a message design theory that provides a framework for effective communication through the utilization of fear appeal messages. When developing messages to persuade specific groups of people, designers should include threats which attract audiences' attention, thereby alerting them potential hazards, before following up with suggestions to aid avoidance of these threats. With the combination between threats and feasible responses, recipients are hence motivated to perform protective behaviors to avert threats. However, attention should be paid to the presentation of these messages, as well as to the control of both threats and efficacy, as these may lead to undesirable outcomes, such as message rejection and null responses  (Witte, 1998) . Overall, the EPPM bases its predictions of attitudinal, intentional, and behavioral responses to fear producing information on people's appraisals of two key constructs: threat and efficacy  (Witte, 1992) .\n\nFirstly, the EPPM defines threat as the hazards or dangers present around people  (Witte, Cameron, McKeon, & Berkowitz, 1996) . However, it is important not to confuse threat with actual harm, which motivates people to react. Instead, threat focuses on the subjective perception of dangers. More specifically, perceived threat comprises of two central elements: perceived severity and susceptibility  (Witte et al., 1996) . Perceived severity, as defined by  Witte (1992) , refers to the magnitude or seriousness of a threat based on one's beliefs, while perceived susceptibility refers to the perception of the probability of experiencing the threat. These two aspects subsequently form the perceived threat, which determines the motivation to respond to fear arousing information  (Maloney, Lapinski, & Witte, 2011) .\n\nThe second construct, efficacy, is defined as individuals' beliefs regarding their confidence of successfully performing a recommended reaction in order to avoid threats  (Witte, 1998) . Efficacy also comprises of two dimensions: perceived self-efficacy and perceived response efficacy  (Witte et al., 1996) . The former concept is defined as personal beliefs in the capacity to perform behaviors recommended by messages. On the other hand, the latter dimension refers to beliefs regarding the effectiveness of the recommended response in the aversion of the threat  (Rogers, 1975 (Rogers, , 1983)) . According to the EPPM, perceived efficacy determines the nature of reactions  (Maloney et al., 2011) .\n\nThe application of EPPM can be divided into two steps. Firstly, messages about a threat should attract the attention of its recipients. Upon exposure to fear appeal messages which contain threat, moderate to high evaluations regarding the degree of threat consequences would arouse feelings of fear  (Easterling & Leventhal, 1989) . Recipients would then enter the next phase of the appraisal process to seek and evaluate the efficiency of recommended solutions.\n\nIdeally, when recipients have higher perceptions of efficacy than threat, they will enter the danger control process. In this process, recipients would change their perceptions, attitudes, intentions, and even actual behaviors in order to cope with the threat according to the recommended responses  (Witte et al., 1996) . In contrast, when a low level of efficacy is perceived due to recipients' incapability to adopt protective behaviors or their beliefs in the ineffectiveness of such behaviors, recipients would subsequently engage in the fear control process in order to address internal concerns. More specifically, when fear appeals trigger a high perceived threat alongside a low perceived efficacy, recipients would typically engage in defensive avoidance or reaction behaviors  (Witte, 1994) . As such, the two constructs, threat and efficacy, are critical in determining certain protective behaviors.\n\nMany empirical studies of fear appeals have documented that fear appeal messages can enhance recipients' perceived threat and perceived efficacy, thereby facilitating intentions and encourage individuals to perform certain behaviors  (Sheeran, Harris, & Epton, 2014; Witte & Allen, 2000) . For example,  Rogers and Mewborn (1976)  found that increments in the message threat or efficacy levels increased intentions to adopt recommended practices. Moreover, messages containing both a high threat level and effective preventive measures had led to higher intentions among recipients to adopt recommended responses in smoking cessation and prevention of venereal diseases  (Rogers & Mewborn, 1976) . McMahan, Witte, and Meyer (1998)  examined the effectiveness of fear appeals and obtained a significant main effect regarding message efficacy on the intention to reduce exposure to electromagnetic fields. Moreover, an interaction effect between threat and efficacy highlighted that high threat-high efficacy participants had a stronger intention to engage in protective behaviors than participants in the conditions of high threatlow efficacy, low threat-high efficacy, and low threat-low efficacy. Additionally,  Smith et al. (2008)  and  Kotowski et al. (2011)  used the EPPM to evaluate the effectiveness of fear appeal messages on the use of hearing protection aid. Findings highlighted that individuals who received messages describing threat and efficacy were more likely to use hearing protection aid than those who did not receive the messages. Next, a recent study on the EPPM similarly indicated that fear appeal messages could induce both perceived threat and efficacy, which in turn increase intentions to engage in recommended asthmatic behaviors  (Goei et al., 2010) .\n\nBased on different results from main effects and interaction effects of threat and efficacy,  Witte and Allen (2000)  and  Sheeran et al. (2014)  proposed two different models. First, according to the original EPPM model, for behavioral outcomes, individuals under the condition of high threat and high efficacy outperformed individuals under other three conditions. Specifically, the EPPM indicates that low threat messages coupled with any level of efficacy messages will be less likely to motivate individuals' responses to fear appeals, as low threat may fail to arouse individual's feelings of fear. Besides, individuals are exposed to high threat and low efficacy messages will also have a lower intention to perform recommended responses, this kind of messages would motivate individuals to enter the fear control process and engage in defensive avoidance that interfere with behavior change  (Sheeran et al., 2014; Witte, 1992; Witte & Allen, 2000) . In addition,  Witte and Allen (2000)  propose a revised EPPM model-the additive model, in which the effects of threat and efficacy are separate and independent, such that higher levels of each would lead to more persuasiveness. In other words, both threat and efficacy have main effects. Moreover, the interaction effects between threat and efficacy is additive. Higher levels of both threat and efficacy, in their various combinations, lead to more persuasion  (Sheeran et al., 2014; Witte & Allen, 2000) . Based on this model, individuals under the high-high condition have a highest behavioral intention. Then, the persuasiveness of conditions with highlow combinations are greater than the low-low condition. A few studies have compared the two models and found that additive model is a stronger fit than the EPPM. However, these studies used the U.S sample and focused on people in particular professions, such as school workers and physicians  (Goei et al., 2010; Roberto & Goodall, 2009) . Tannenbaum et al. (2015)  indicated that fear appeal effectiveness varied based on cultural contexts, participants' occupations, type of diseases. Therefore, this study seeks to test the two modelsthe EPPM and the additive model by examining the effectiveness of fear appeals on Chinese women's intention of BSE."

      "text": "Traditionally, health communication professionals have typically conducted fear-based public health campaigns and utilized fear appeal messages on traditional media, such as printed brochures to motivate recipients to engage in recommended practices. However in the past decade, social media has become a platform in which a large amount of healthrelated information is generated and exchanged  (Chen & Shi, 2015; Shi & Chen, 2014; Wang, Shi, Chen, & Peng, 2016) . Moreover, many health communication professionals have used social media for health campaigns and promotions  (Capurro et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016) . Compared to traditional media, health campaigns on social media could be more cost-effective and environmentally friendly. Moreover, health campaigns are able to reach out to a large audience rapidly via social media  (Fritzsche, 2012) .\n\nSurprisingly, many researchers are unconvinced about the effects of social media on attitudes and behaviors (e.g.,  Benea, 2014) . Such reluctance draws from the fact that content on social media is typically generated by regular users instead of professional journalists. As such, many people are hesitant to fully endorse the authenticity of information on social media. Indeed, most individuals in China believe that information on social media is less reliable and credible than that in traditional media, an opinion that has strengthened in recent years due to the generation of numerous rumors, which were subsequently spread on social media  (Li & Zhang, 2017) . This in turn reduced the influence of such information on individuals' opinions and behaviors  (Yang, Chen, & Feng, 2016) . On the other hand, some scholars have argued that as compared to traditional media, social media better fits the normative ideal of two-way communication (e.g.,  Fritzsche, 2012) . As such, social media is regarded as more interactive, dialogic, authentic, and credible (e.g.,  Seltzer & Mitrook, 2007) , which could boost the influence of information on social media. Given these considerations, the effectiveness of health campaigns may vary across different media outlets.\n\nBased on the aforementioned review of literature, the following hypotheses and research questions were developed: H1: Message threat and efficacy levels will interact so that an intention to perform breast self-examination will be greatest for Chinese women who received messages containing high threat and high efficacy.\n\nRQ1: How does the EPPM compare to the additive model in terms of explaining the effectiveness of fear appeal messages? RQ2: How does the effectiveness of fear appeal messages on intention to perform BSE compare between traditional and social media?"

These groups were subsequently assigned to eight different experimental conditions. Random assignment was employed in this study to ensure the homogeneous treatment groups, without involving any potential biases. These conditions were created by crossing two kinds of fear appeal messages and comprised of two factors with two levels: threat (low, high) and efficacy (low, high), and two media outlets: traditional media-printed brochures and social media-Weibo. Weibo, a Chinese version of Twitter launched in 2009, has become one of the most popular social media sites in China  (Miles & Zhang, 2012) . The registered users have exceeded 500 million by the first quarter of 2013  (Huang, Wu, & Huang, 2017) .

In order to minimize time related effects, individual differences, and environment confounds, one hyperlink out of the eight available were randomly emailed to participants during weekends. In the web-based questionnaire found in each hyperlink, participants were first required to complete an eligibility assessment. Demographic questions, such as that asking for participant's age, gender, and nationality, were used in order to exclude ineligible participants. Only Chinese females who were over 25 years old were allowed to continue the web-based questionnaire. After confirming the participants' eligibility, an online informed consent form was presented in order to obtain their permission. The consent form introduced an inaccurate purpose of this study, which was to examine attitudes toward breast cancer. The real purpose of the experiment was concealed.\n\nNext, participants were exposed to one of the eight pictures (i.e. stimulus) in the web-based questionnaire. Participants could only proceed to the final stage of questionnaire upon viewing the picture. Participants were also required to evaluate their intention of performing BSE, and the levels of threat and efficacy of the stimuli. Finally, upon completion of the questionnaire, an online debriefing form was presented to participants. This debriefing form provided clarification on the real purpose of this study, which was to conduct an experiment using a web-based questionnaire to examine the influence of threat and efficacy levels of stimuli on the intention to perform BSE."

Initially, the threat level of the stimuli was measured by using six items, in which participants were asked to rate their levels of agreement on a 5-point Likert scale, which ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree). More specifically, the participants were asked about the following statements: (1) The picture shows that I am at risk for experiencing breast cancer; (2) After viewing the picture, I think I will probably experience breast cancer; (3) The picture shows that I am susceptible to experiencing breast cancer; (4) The picture shows that breast cancer is a serious threat; (5) The picture shows that breast cancer is harmful; and (6) The picture shows that the health effects of breast cancer are of serious concern. All items were averaged to create a scale for the threat level of stimulus, in which a higher score indicated the stimulus with a higher level of threat (M = 2.75, SD = 1.37, Cronbach's \u03b1 = .93). Secondly, efficacy was measured by asking participants to complete six items. Participants were required to indicate their level of agreement on a 5-point Likert scale which ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) as follows: (1) According to the picture, performing BSE is an effective way to prevent breast cancer; (2) The picture shows that performing BSE is effective in getting rid of breast cancer; (3) The picture shows that BSE helps avoid breast cancer; (4) The picture teaches me how to perform BSE to prevent breast cancer step by step; (5) According to the picture, it is easy to BSE examination to prevent breast cancer; and (6) After viewing the picture, I can perform BSE to prevent breast cancer. All items were averaged to create a scale for the efficacy level of the stimuli in which a higher score indicated the stimulus with a higher level of efficacy (M = 2.99, SD = 1.52, Cronbach's \u03b1 = .96).\n\nIn addition, according to previous studies about EPPM and behavioral intentions  (Kotowski et al., 2011) , the intention to perform BSE was measured using three items in which participants were asked to indicate their level of agreement on a 5point Likert scale which ranged from 1 (strongly disagree) to 5 (strongly agree) as follows: (1) I intend to perform BSE, (2) I will try to perform BSE, and (3) I plan to perform BSE (M = 2.92, SD = 1.28, Cronbach's \u03b1 = .92)."

The independent sample t-test was conducted to examine perceptions of the levels of threat and efficacy of the stimuli. Specifically, participants who received the stimulus with the high and low threats were assessed. The results showed that perceptions of threat level for the high threat stimulus (M = 3.86, SD = .93) were significantly higher than that of the low threat stimulus (M = 1.65, SD = .64), which meant the high threat stimulus created for this study had a significantly higher threat level than the low threat stimulus, t(486) = 30.37, p < 0.01.\n\nAdditionally, participants who received the stimulus with high and low levels of efficacy were assessed. The results also revealed that perceptions of efficacy level for the stimulus with a high efficacy level (M = 4.32, SD = .73) was significantly higher than that of the stimulus with a low efficacy level (M = 1.67, SD = .72), t(486) = 40.49, p < 0.01.\n\nFurthermore, according to the recommendations from  Sheeran et al. (2016) , messages that are effective at changing all four EPPM factors are most effective. We conducted t-test for each EPPM factor. The results revealed that participants who had received the high threat stimulus tend to perceived a higher level of susceptibility and severity than those who received the low threat stimulus (see Table  1 ). Similarly, participants who received the stimulus with high efficacy perceived a higher level of self-efficacy and response efficacy than those who received stimulus with low efficacy (see Table  2 ). Therefore, these manipulation checks indicated that the participants' perceptions of threat and efficacy of the stimuli were consistent with the stimulus threat and efficacy levels created."

      "text": "A three-way analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) was conducted to examine the effects of threat and efficacy levels of the stimuli on the participants' behavioral intentions to perform BSE, with age serving as a covariate. The results revealed a significant main effect for the threat level of the stimuli, where participants who had received high threat messages had a higher intention to perform BSE (M = 3.63, SD = 1.19), while those who had received low threat messages had a lower intention to perform BSE (M = 2.21, SD = .94), F (1,479) = 453.56, p < .001, partial \u03b7 2 = .49). Thus, the analysis supported H1. Besides, the results also showed a significant main effect for the efficacy level of the stimuli, which indicated that participants who were exposed to high efficacy messages tended to have a higher intention to perform BSE (M = 3.71, SD = 1.13) than those who were exposed to low efficacy messages (M = 2.14, SD = .91), F(1,479) = 555.47, p < .001, partial \u03b7 2 = .54, thereby supporting H2.\n\nFurthermore, the results revealed a significant interaction effect between threat and efficacy, F(1, 479) = 31.80, p < .001, \u03b7 2 = .06. Figure  1  presents a plot of the obtained mean scores. Examination of this interaction effect indicates that individuals who had received messages with high threat-high efficacy had a stronger intention to engage in BSE (M = 4.58, SD = .63) than those had received messages with high threatlow efficacy (M = 2.65, SD = .78), low threat-high efficacy (M = 2.81, SD = .76), and low threat-low efficacy (M = 1.64, SD = .72). In other words, the intention of performing BSE was highest when messages containing both high threat and high efficacy were presented to participants, hence lending support for H3.\n\nRQ1 asks how the effects of fear appeal messages compare between traditional and social media. The results revealed that the threat \u00d7 media interaction effect (F(1,479) = .04, p = .84, partial \u03b7 2 = .0001), efficacy \u00d7 media interaction effect (F (1,479) = 1.38, p = .24, partial \u03b7 2 = .003), and threat \u00d7 efficacy \u00d7 media interaction effect (F(1,479) = .49, p = .48, partial \u03b7 2 = .001) were not significant. As such, there was no significant difference in effectiveness of fear appeal messages between the two different media forms (see Table  4 )."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "The purpose of this study was to investigate the casual relationship between the provision of messages about the risks and precautions of breast cancer across different media outlets and the intention to perform BSE, using the EPPM. Specifically, this study tested the intention to engage in BSE among females who were exposed to messages with high/low threat and high/low efficacy on two different media outletstraditional and social media.\n\nFirstly, the main effect for threat was examined. According to the EPPM model, when the level of threat in a message is high, people typically engage in more positive responses to these messages, which subsequently increase their intention to perform a certain behavior. Besides, the results are consistent with that of previous studies (e.g. Goodall & Reed, 2013; Kotowski et al., 2011) . This reconfirms the prediction based on the EPPM model that individuals exposed to messages with high threat would have higher intentions to perform recommended behaviors. Secondly, the significant main effect obtained for efficacy also supports the predictive power of the EPPM. These results are also consistent with that of previous research, which reported that efficacy was a significant factor in predicting individuals' behavioral intention to perform recommended behaviors, especially when their fearful feelings were aroused (e.g.,  Askelson et al., 2015; Carcioppolo et al., 2013) .\n\nThirdly, the results demonstrated a significant interaction effect between threat and efficacy. Moreover, women who were exposed to the high threat and high efficacy messages had the highest intention of BSE. This is in line with both the EPPM and the additive model  (Witte, 1992; Witte & Allen, 2000) , which posited that people received messages with high levels of threat and efficacy tend to have the greatest to perform the recommended responses in the given message. Besides, the interaction results were also consistent with that in previous findings, which similarly obtained interaction effects between threat and efficacy levels on behavioral intention (e.g.,  Basil, Basil, Deshpande, & Lavack, 2013; McKay, Berkowitz, Blumberg, & Goldberg, 2004; McMahan et al., 1998) . Furthermore, according to Table  3 , not only was the high threat and high efficacy message the most persuasive, but also messages describing high threat and low efficacy and messages describing low threat and high efficacy had greater persuasiveness than low threat and low efficacy messages. Therefore, the data fits both the EPPM model and the additive model. Moreover, the additive model was better supported  (Roberto & Goodall, 2009; Witte & Allen, 2000) .\n\nFinally, while a previous meta-analytic study has revealed that media types (text versus video/pictures) do not affect fear appeal effectiveness  (Tannenbaum et al., 2015) , very limited studies have examined the effects of different media outlets. Thus, one of major contributions of this study is to test the extent to which effectiveness of fear appeal messages varies two media outlets-traditional and social media. The results revealed that the threat \u00d7 media interaction effect, efficacy \u00d7 media interaction effect, and threat \u00d7 efficacy \u00d7 media interaction effect were not significant. In other words, the effectiveness of fear appeal messages on social media was not significantly different from that on traditional media. These findings are in line with that of  Newbold and Campos' review study (2011) , who indicated that health campaigns presented on both traditional and social media offered similar behavioral outcomes. More importantly, these findings also recommend that health communication professionals conduct fear-based public health campaigns and create fear appeal messages on social media. Compared to traditional media, social media initiatives are more feasible for public health and are less costly to implement  (Schein, Wilson, & Keelan, 2010) ."

      "title": "Limitations and implications",
      "text": "Our study has several theoretical contributions. First, this study is among the first to compare the effectiveness of fear appeal messages on between traditional and social media. In particular, findings from our study develop the EPPM by indicating that fear appeal messages on both traditional and social media can offer similar behavioral outcomes. Second, previous fear appeal studies mostly focus on the effects of threat in promoting individuals' behavioral change (e.g.,  Peters, Ruiter, & Kok, 2013; Sheeran et al., 2014; Tannenbaum et al., 2015) , while very few research has included both aspects of threat and efficacy in the testing of fear appeal theory. Our study has shed lights on the effects of both threat and efficacy in predicting women's intention to perform BSE, which provide a comprehensive understanding of individuals' behavioral change under fear appeal. Besides, many recent studies have used the EPPM to examine the effectiveness of fear appeals in increasing an individual's intention to engage in specific recommended practices to protect hearing  (Kotowski et al., 2011; Smith et al., 2008) , to ensure workplace safety  (Basil et al., 2013) , to prevent HPV  (Carcioppolo et al., 2013) , and to get rid of bed bugs  (Goodall & Reed, 2013) . The current study extends the application of EPPM on BSE among Chinese females. As such, this study has made a great contribution to the body of knowledge on the EPPM.\n\nIn terms of the practical implications, the results of this study suggest that future BSE campaigns targeted at Chinese women should provide high threat and high efficacy messages to increase the intention to perform BSE. Moreover, the nonsignificant interaction effects between media platform and threat or efficacy demonstrates that the effectiveness of fear appeal messages on social media is not significantly different from that on traditional media. As such, health communication professionals should be encouraged to conduct fear-based public health campaigns on social media to motivate individuals to perform health-protective behaviors. In particular, the relevant health campaigns should be designed to include high levels of threat and efficacy to increase the effectiveness of messages in promoting women's behavioural intention to perform BSE.\n\nThis study has its limitations. Firstly, like most studies, the current study tested the EPPM and focused on the danger control, but did not take into account the fear control and defensive avoidance. Future studies should measure and explore both the fear control and danger control. Secondly, in this experiment, we merely examined group differences in terms of the general threat and efficacy. Thus, future studies should make a detailed examination of group distinctiveness in terms of different levels of severity, susceptibility, self-efficacy, and response efficacy. Thirdly, while this study aimed to examine and compare the effectiveness of fear appeals between traditional and social media, the experiment was conducted in the online setting, which may confound the results. Future studies should replicate this experiment in the physical environment to validate the findings. Fourthly, this study only investigated the persuasiveness of fear appeals. However, some other kinds of persuasive messages, such as emotional appeals and benefit messages may also be effective in motivating Chinese women to perform BSE. Future studies could examine the effectiveness of other persuasive messages in increase intention of BSE among Chinese women. Fifthly, this study examined participants' behavioral intention to perform BSE rather than their actual behaviors. Although prior research has provided evidence for the likely translation of behavioral intentions to actual behavior  (Peters et al., 2013) , future research can examine the extent to which behavioral intention is translated into actual BSE behavior."
