  "title": "Build or Buy? Managing the New Technology Decision Tree",
  "abstract": "Technology plays a role in nearly every aspect of healthcare delivery. Health systems must continually invest in new and existing technology and analytics platforms to scale initiatives, enable innovation, and achieve interoperability to meet the needs and expectations of patients and clinicians while remaining focused on the organization's mission and strategic priorities. In this process, decision-makers must determine how to allocate technological resources to platforms that meet clinical and administrative needs while reducing the need for frequent replacement or reconfiguration. Advances in artificial intelligence and its capabilities add urgency and complexity to technology investment decisions. An important consideration during this process is when to build new technology infrastructure and when to partner with existing companies and buy technology solutions. This case study explores a major academic medical center's approach to that decision, including the factors that influenced it and the outcomes of two solutions that were developed in-house.",

      "text": "ealth information technology professionals and healthcare administrators regularly face this decision: whether to buy a solution from a vendor or develop a product that is customized to a specific need in a health system.\n\nIf an already existing product meets the need at hand, buying an off-the-shelf solution is the clear choice. We estimate that 90 percent of the technology in use throughout Penn Medicine was purchased through a partnership with an outside vendor.\n\nHowever, if no product exists or if available products do not closely match the organization's specific needs, the decision can be less clear. The build-vs.-buy decision involves trade-offs in either direction.\n\nThe following considerations can factor into the decision:\n\n\u2022 Scale and velocity: One of the advantages of buying off-the-shelf technology is the opportunity to scale a product horizontally across different sites and service lines. Outside vendors often have more infrastructure and bandwidth to spread a solution than an internal technology group. Outside vendors can also distribute the cost of supporting a product across a large customer base and may be able to respond more quickly to address glitches or accommodate a new version of an operating system. They may also have a greater ability to focus resources to ensure interoperability and adapt systems to new industrywide regulations and requirements. If an organization builds a technology system, it must allocate its resources to address technical support needs and updates.\n\n\u2022 Innovation: Sometimes meeting an emergent or specific need requires going \"off the grid\" to develop a totally new or custom product. An internal technology department may move faster and be more innovative, trying different approaches and \"failing fast\" to move more nimbly to a solution. Working on these issues in-house can increase understanding of the challenges involved and build internal expertise. It also enables organizations to adapt solutions for different purposes. \u2022 Alignment: Off-the-shelf products may shorten the implementation times of technology platforms and may enable synergies in how data are collected and reported across systems. This may be beneficial for quality reporting or tracking performance for certain metrics, which can then be more easily benchmarked when similar systems are used by different health systems. For the end users (e.g., patients and clinicians), this can foster a more seamless, efficient experience across healthcare delivery sites. However, deploying standard, existing products may limit customization, agility, and novelty. \u2022 Interoperability: This is a critical component of any decision about technology. Without interoperability, clinicians must log into multiple systems, adding another task to their already loaded schedule. In a buy model, any solution must sustainably support streamlined data integration among systems. Built systems must work within the existing infrastructure and align efficiently with provider workflow. \u2022 Sustainability: An important feature of a new technology is its sustainability and its alignment with both strategic priorities and business needs. Ensuring alignment across both needs is critically important for making near-and longterm investment decisions about technology.\n\nTo illustrate how Penn Medicine has approached the build-vs.-buy decision and how the decision to build has led to increased innovation and quality of patient care, we look at two examples of in-house solutions that have had significant effects within and beyond the Penn Medicine health system."

      "title": "Needs",
      "text": "Sometimes clinical needs emerge over time. Sometimes they come in an onslaught. This case study examines one example of each of these situations. In both cases, Penn Medicine decided to build in-house, for different reasons and in different ways.\n\nCOVID-19 hit hard and fast. The first case in Philadelphia was reported on March 10, 2020. By the end of March, area hospitals were overwhelmed with patients. Penn Medicine needed to care for a large volume of patients sick with a novel virus that could escalate from being manageable at home to a critical emergency in a matter of hours. For every patient in the hospital, there were 25 or more isolating at home. Without proper monitoring, those mildly and moderately sick patients at home could present to the emergency room, putting others at risk of exposure and overwhelming an already overcrowded hospital. Penn Medicine's clinicians needed a way to monitor, treat, and reassure patients who could safely stay home and to identify those who needed hands-on care. Penn Medicine's in-house technology team took advantage of a homegrown solution used for secure patient communications to check in with patients, assess their symptoms, and escalate to telemedicine or inpatient care as appropriate.\n\nNot all clinical needs are as dramatic as those resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, but addressing them can have an important effect on quality and continuity of care. During diagnostic testing for one condition, the specialist who ordered the test sometimes finds another condition that falls outside their expertise. This can lead to delays in care and follow-up for one or both conditions.\n\nFor example, on a chest CT scan for liver disease, radiologists sometimes detect a pulmonary nodule that requires follow-up from someone other than the clinician who ordered the test. Penn Medicine wanted to find a way to ensure continuity of care for these patients while allowing the ordering physician to focus on treating the liver condition."

      "text": "In both of these cases, Penn Medicine decided to build rather than buy a solution.\n\nIn the case of COVID-19, speed was the motivating factor: With an easily adaptable platform already developed, Penn Medicine was able to modify it quickly in response to an acute situation. In the case of the pulmonary nodule follow-up, nothing on the market readily filled the identified clinical need."

      "title": "COVID Watch",
      "text": "Way to Health (W2H) was originally developed in 2009 to facilitate interventional studies that would help researchers track and communicate with clinical trial participants, especially for studies with behavior-based interventions. Before long, the developers (David Asch, MD, and Kevin Volpp, MD, PhD) realized that the platform also had applications for patient care. W2H, a core program in the Center for Health Care Transformation and Innovation, has become a primary patient communication platform throughout Penn Medicine, especially for conditions and treatments that depend on patient engagement and remote management. COVID-19 matched that description.\n\nWorking from home during the early days of the pandemic, Penn Medicine's software developers quickly went to work to adapt W2H into an infrastructure for patients with COVID-19 who did not yet-but might\n\nache.org/journals soon-require hospitalization. The system, called COVID Watch  (Chaiyachati et al., 2023; Delgado et al., 2021) , enabled clinicians to easily enroll patients and allow them to track symptoms and oxygen levels with a portable pulse oximeter. The W2H platform is fully interoperable and easily connects with Penn's electronic health record. Using COVID Watch, clinicians monitored patients remotely, securely texted with them about vital signs and at-home treatment, watched their progress, and determined who could remain at home and who required hospitalization. COVID Watch helped stem the flow of patients into the overwhelmed health system by offering at-home monitoring, allowing clinicians to focus on those who most needed inpatient care."

      "title": "Virtual Results Clinic",
      "text": "Virtual Results Clinic combines the power of technology with the expertise of clinicians.\n\nNo market-available product existed that would help Penn Medicine clinicians schedule appropriate follow-up appointments with patients whose CT scans detected pulmonary nodules. To meet this need, Penn Medicine's developer and clinician team (led by Tessa Cook, MD) went to work to develop something that would function easily alongside Penn Medicine's Epic electronic health record. The first step was to create enough structure in the radiology interpretation so that an automated system would identify which reports mentioned a nodule that required follow-up. The system notifies a medical assistant and nurse practitioner, who contacts the patient to make sure they come back for any needed follow-up."

      "title": "Results",
      "text": "COVID Watch. More than 18,500 patients used COVID Watch in its first year, and the overwhelming majority were managed by text messages alone. For those who needed additional care, hospital personnel were able to respond in an average of 14 minutes. Patients found the text messages and connection to the health system reassuring, reducing their urge to seek in-person medical care. More importantly, patients who used the texting program were almost 70 percent less likely to die than patients receiving usual outpatient care, with similar results reported across racial and ethnic groups.\n\nThe system also increased staffing efficiency and saved the health system approximately $8 million by reducing clinical staffing needs.\n\nDuring the three years when Penn Medicine used COVID Watch, more than 38,000 patients used the system, and more than 80 percent of those patients did not require escalation to inpatient care. Although COVID Watch has been retired, Penn Medicine plans to adapt the model to other conditions, including hypertension, diabetes, and heart failure. Another product based on this W2H platform, Refill Express, has increased fill rates and response times for specialty pharmacy prescriptions.\n\nVirtual Results Clinic. This system has helped increase continuity of care and has streamlined follow-up for patients who are diagnosed with pulmonary nodules during treatment for other conditions. In one year of operation, the system identified over 2,500 patients with incidental nodules that required follow-up, and it enrolled 900 patients in the follow-up clinic.\n\nDr. Cook's team is now looking at other conditions where the technology might be applied. In the interim, this concept has become an area of focus for commercial solutions, and now Penn Medicine is facing a build-vs.-buy decision as it considers scaling the concept beyond pulmonary nodules. An important question that has emerged is whether to stick with the known solution, which works but requires in-house maintenance and support, or to consider an off-the-shelf solution, which could manage similar functions without requiring the level of in-house support as a home-built solution."

      "text": "Health systems must consider a wide range of factors when deciding whether to buy an already existing product, partner with a technology company to develop a custom product, or forge ahead with in-house innovation to increase understanding and respond more quickly to clinical needs. Evaluating the trade-offs is an important undertaking; it can inform future health system investments and bring the best advances in technology to the forefront of patient care."
