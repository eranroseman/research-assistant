  "title": "Health Care Access and Utilization for Latino Youth in the United States The Roles of Maternal Citizenship and Distress",
  "abstract": "Objectives: We sought to determine the associations between maternal citizenship and health care access and utilization for US-born Latino youth and to determine whether maternal distress is a moderator of the associations. Methods: Using 2010-2017 Integrated Public Use Microdata Series National Health Interview Survey data, multivariable logistic regressions were run to examine the associations among maternal citizenship and health care access and utilization for US-born Latino youth. Maternal citizenship and distress interactions were tested. Results: Noncitizen mothers had higher odds of reporting uninsurance, lack of transportation for delaying care, and lower odds of health care utilization for their youth than citizen mothers. Compared with no distress, moderate and severe distress were positively associated with uninsurance, delayed medical care due to cost, lack of transportation, and having had an emergency department visit for their youth. Moderate distress was positively associated with youth having had a doctor's office visit. Noncitizen mothers with moderate distress were less likely to report their youth having had an emergency department visit than citizen mothers with moderate distress. Among severely distressed mothers, noncitizen mothers were more likely to report youth uninsurance and delayed care due to lack of transportation compared with citizen mothers. Conclusions: Health care access and utilization among US-born Latino youth are influenced by maternal citizenship and distress. Maternal distress moderates the associations among maternal citizenship and youth's health care access and use. Almost one-third of all US-born youth in the United States are Latino and current federal and state noninclusive immigration policies and anti-Latino immigrant rhetoric may exacerbate health care disparities.",

      "text": "Central America.  11 Recent heightened anti-immigrant political rhetoric and sentiment in the United States toward immigrants from Latin America have had negative health implications for youth and Latina mothers already residing in the United States.  [12] [13] ] [14]  Regardless of race/ethnicity and citizenship status, parents experience stress when everyday demands or challenges of parenting surpass their perceived resources, both social and personal, and their ability to carry on with everyday challenges, such as seeking health care.  15 Observations of the associations between maternal distress and youth health care access and utilization have been mixed. Studies have found mothers with higher levels of psychological distress are more likely to take their youth to the doctor compared with mothers with no psychological distress.  16, 17 In addition, mothers with depressive symptoms are more likely to report their youth having visited an emergency department (ED),  18  having visited a clinic,  19  or having a pediatric visit, all in the past 12 months,  20  and to report overutilization of medical services for their youth.  21 In contrast, Sills et al  18  observed mothers with depression were less likely to report well-child visits for their teenagers in the past year compared with mothers without depression. Other studies have shown that maternal depression was associated with reports of barriers in accessing child mental health care, early termination of treatment,  22  and missed pediatric outpatient visits.  23 Lastly, some studies have found no relationship between maternal depression and utilization of well-child visits,  24  pediatric acute care services,  25  and seeking emergency care for youth.  26 To our knowledge, maternal distress has not been examined as a potential moderator in the association among maternal citizenship and health care access and utilization among Latino youth.\n\nParental citizenship has implications for youth health care access and utilization. For instance, Latina immigrant mothers seeking services for their youth may face discrimination and experience barriers in obtaining documents such as proof of income, social security, and citizenship status for themselves and their youth.  27 Access to photograph identification and/or driver's licenses or Medicaid coverage for immigrants residing in the United States for <5 years are policies that can facilitate access to and enrollment in certain benefits for US-born Latino youth and their parents.  28 Conversely, strict immigration policies, increases in law enforcement presence (eg, ICE), anti-Latino, and antiimmigrant rhetoric have been found to be associated with a reduction in health insurance uptake for US citizen youth of Latina mother immigrants.  29, 30 Furthermore, these populations are at risk for poor physical and mental health due to institutional level barriers in access to care that are implemented in the United States, such as exclusion from public benefits or coverage under the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (ACA).  8, 31 Noncitizen Latina mothers, particularly those with friends or relatives who are undocumented or are themselves undocumented, living in a \"risk of deportation\" environment may intensify different levels of stress and has health-related implications for US-born Latino youth.  32 iven the many complexities that contribute to access to and utilization of health care for US-born Latino youth, our study aims to address whether the effects of maternal citizenship on youth health care access and utilization differs by levels of maternal distress. First, we analyze the associations among maternal citizenship status and levels of distress and health care access and utilization patterns among Latino youth. Second, we determine whether maternal distress moderates the associations among maternal citizenship status and health care access and utilization among Latino youth."

NHIS collects data on a broad range of health topics among noninstitutionalized populations in the United States, and some data are collected for all household members while others are only asked of 1 randomly selected sample adult and 1 randomly selected sample child. We relied on IPUMS for the NHIS data because it allows us to link maternal characteristics to sample youth (ages below 18 y) observations. US-born Latino youth with mothers reporting Latina ethnicity was our main inclusion criteria. Kessler's K6 Nonspecific Psychological Distress Scale items were asked of mothers who were sample adults. Youth observations that were missing values for important dependent and independent measures were excluded [eg, youth observations with mothers who were not sample adults and thus the NHIS excluded from asking Kessler's K6 measures (N = 55,659), maternal citizenship status missing, including those who responded \"Refused\" or \"Don't know\" (N = 3252)]. The final sample for this study consists of 10,153 youth observations with Latina mothers, of whom 6044 mothers were US citizens and 4109 mothers were noncitizens."

Citizenship in NHIS is measured through 1 question that asks if the respondent is a citizen of the United States with 7 potential responses: Yes, born in one of the 50 United States or the District of Columbia; Yes, born in Puerto Rico, Guam, American Virgin Islands, or other US territory; Yes, born abroad to American parent(s); Yes, US citizen by naturalization; No, not a citizen of the United States; Refused; Don't know.  35 Maternal distress was measured with Kessler's K6 Nonspecific Psychological Distress Scale  36  which consists of 6 items that ask about the following feelings during the past 30 days: sad, nervous, hopeless, restless or fidgety, worthless, and felt everything was an effort. Responses fell into 5 categories ranging from \"none of the time\" to \"all of the time\" and each question has a value assigned between 0 and 4. We also constructed a composite variable from the sum of a participant's K6 score (0-24). The composite variable was a 3-level K6 variable that consisted of the following K6 scores: 0-7 indicated no nonspecific psychological distress, 8-12 indicated moderate nonspecific psychological distress, and 13 and above indicated severe nonspecific psychological distress. This approach has been used in other studies.  37, 38 ovariates were categorized according to the Andersen model for health care utilization behaviors (predisposing, enabling, and need).  39 Predisposing factors included maternal marital status (married, divorced/separated, never married), paternal citizenship status (US citizen, noncitizen), interview language (English only, Spanish and English, Spanish only), maternal education level (college degree or more, high school degree, less than high school degree), maternal age, youth age, youth sex (male, female), and number of children (1-4, 5 or more). Enabling factors included youth insurance coverage (uninsurance) and insurance type (private, public), maternal income as a percent of the federal poverty level (400% and above, 200%-399%, 199% and below), US Census region (Northeast, North Central/Midwest, South, West), and maternal length of time residing in the United States ( > 10 y, 5-10 y, <5 y). The need factor included parental report of youth's general health status (excellent or very good, good, fair, or poor)."

Initial multivariable logistic regressions were run to determine the associations among maternal citizenship and youth's health care access and utilization. We incorporated maternal distress into the models and tested the interactions between maternal citizenship and distress when predicting the outcomes. Overall Wald tests for interaction effects were performed, and there was statistically significant evidence that the associations among maternal citizenship and health care access and utilization differed by distress levels. Because of the observed interactions, we stratified our multivariable regression models by distress levels.

      "text": "Table  1  presents predisposing, enabling, and need characteristics by maternal citizenship and distress. Compared with mothers who are citizens, noncitizen mothers were less likely to report moderate or severe distress. Noncitizen mothers were more likely to report a lower than high school education level, youth uninsurance, public insurance coverage for their youth, and income below 199% FPL compared with citizen mothers. Reports of excellent/very good youth general health status were lower for noncitizen mothers compared with citizen mothers. Mothers with moderate and severe distress reported lower levels of education compared with mothers with no distress. Mothers with moderate and severe distress reported higher proportions of youth uninsurance, public coverage, and income below 199% FPL compared with nondistressed mothers.\n\nAssociations of youth health care access and utilization with maternal citizenship and distress are presented in Table  2 . Youth of noncitizen mothers were > 2 times as likely to be uninsured, to not have a usual place for health care, and to have delayed health care because they lacked transportation compared with youth of citizen mothers. Conversely, youth of citizen mothers were more likely to have had well-child check-ups and to have had doctor's office visits in the past 12 months compared with youth of noncitizen mothers. Youth of citizen mothers were more likely to have had an ED visit in the past 12 months compared with youth of noncitizen mothers. Mothers with moderate or severe distress had higher parental reports of lacking a usual place for medical care, delayed medical care in the past year due to cost, and lacked transportation compared with mothers with no distress for their youth. Youth having had an ED visit in the past 12 months was much higher among mothers with moderate and severe distress compared with mothers with no distress.\n\nTable  3  presents findings from several models. In model 1, youth with noncitizen mothers had worse health care access and utilization compared with youth with citizen mothers. Youth of noncitizen mothers were more likely to be uninsured, less likely to have delayed health care due to cost but were more likely to have delayed medical care due to a lack of transportation. Youth of noncitizen mothers were less likely to have visited a doctor's office and have had an ED visit in the past 12 months. Lastly, when adding distress as a covariate (model 2), the associations among citizenship and youth's health care access and utilization remained consistent as those in model 1. When compared with mothers with no distress, mothers with moderate and severe distress had higher odds of parental reports of youth uninsurance, delaying medical care due to cost and lacking transportation, and their youth having had an ED visit in the past 12 months. Moderate distress among mothers was also positively associated with youth having had a doctor's office visit in the past 12 months compared with mothers with no distress.\n\nMaternal citizenship and distress interactions were included in our multivariable logistic regressions and overall Wald tests for interaction effects showed statistically significant evidence that the associations among maternal citizenship and health care access and utilization differed based on the distress levels. As a result, we performed stratified multivariable logistic regressions and results are presented in Table  4 . Noncitizen mothers with no distress had higher odds of reporting youth uninsurance, delaying medical care due to lack of transportation, and lower odds of reporting delaying medical care due to cost and youth having had a doctor's office visit and an ED visit in the past 12 months compared with citizen mothers. Noncitizen mothers with moderate distress had lower odds of reporting an ED visit for their youth in the past year compared with citizen mothers with moderate distress.

      "text": "Previous studies have indicated that there are disparities in access to and utilization of health care services among Latino youth.  40, 41 Prior findings on the associations among maternal distress and health care access and utilization for youth have been mixed.  [16] [17] [18] 18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] 42  This study sought to understand the effect of maternal citizenship on health care access and utilization for Latino youth in the United States while also examining maternal distress as a potential moderator of the associations. To our knowledge, no other study has examined the associations among maternal citizenship and distress on health care access and utilization for Latino youth. The associations among maternal citizenship and youth's health care access and utilization differ by levels of maternal distress. Some of our findings are consistent with previous studies. Latino youth have disparities in health care access and utilization when compared with other youth in the United States,  40, 41  and our study finds that these disparities persist among Latino youth according to maternal citizenship and distress. Worse health care coverage among US-born Latino youth with noncitizen mothers could be due to discrimination that immigrant mothers face when seeking services for their youth and barriers in providing documents (eg, proof of income and social security numbers).  27 Confusion about entitlements for youth can occur in families with different stratifications of US citizenship (eg, mixed-status families) including mixed eligibility for health insurance programs within households.  6, 43 avigating a complex health care system within different stratifications of US citizenship or mixed eligibility has been found to lead to disparities for US citizen youth entitled to Medicaid or CHIP coverage.  30, 44 These challenges may contribute to maternal distress that exacerbates health care access and utilization disparities for their youth.\n\nWhile the associations between maternal distress and health care access and utilization for youth have been mixed in previous studies, we observed that maternal distress was associated with a greater likelihood of uninsurance and reports of delayed medical care due to cost and lack of transportation. Citizen mothers who reported severe distress were more likely to report their youth visiting an ED in the past 12 months, and that is consistent with previous observations that have found that mothers with depressive symptoms are more likely to report their children visiting an ED in the past 12 months.  18 On the basis of our findings, distress was also a moderator of the associations among maternal citizenship and health care access for youth where youth with noncitizen mothers who have severe distress experience disparities in uninsurance and lacking transportation compared with youth with citizen mothers with no distress. The unique challenges Latina immigrant mothers experience can contribute to different levels of distress and can influence disparities in health care access and utilization for Latino youth.\n\nGiven the demographic shifts where Latino youth now make up the largest minority group and represent a growing proportion of all youth in the United States,  3  studying the impact of maternal citizenship and distress on health care access and utilization for youth is warranted. This study raises some health policy dilemmas that may be targeted to improve health care access and utilization for Latino youth. While the full implementation of the ACA has reduced disparities in health care access nationally, Latino youth continue to have the worst patterns of health insurance coverage and well-child visits.  45, 46 In addition, funding that has been allocated for certain health programs, including Medicaid expansion, may not be enrolling optimal numbers of US-born Latino youth from immigrant families who are entitled to enrollment (assuming that they meet eligibility criteria) but are not enrolling due to the complex barriers mentioned above, including maternal citizenship.  29, 30 his has health implications for US-born Latino youth.  [12] [13] 3] [14]  If Latino youth are uninsured, which we found to be associated with maternal citizenship, they will be less likely to have wellchild visits which can lead to disparities in health outcomes (eg, disparities in anticipatory care, screening, diagnoses, and immunizations). Disparities in health care access and utilization can have long-term cost implications for families and communities, and investments in ensuring that Latino youth do not have disparities in health care need to be addressed through local, state, and national level health and immigration policies.\n\nThere are several limitations of our study that should be noted. First, our study relies on a repeated cross-sectional design, prohibiting us from observing individual characteristics over time. Second, we rely on a binary variable for citizenship and are unable to measure the different stratifications of citizenship and documentation statuses (ie, legal permanent resident, Temporary Protected Status, visas). We may be underestimating the proportions of Latina mothers with distress since we cannot confirm the exact composition of documented versus undocumented mothers within the binary citizen measure-documented noncitizen mothers may be more likely to report no distress for example, potentially leading to an underestimation of distress due to nonresponse (or lack of sample coverage) for undocumented mothers. With this, we may be underestimating health care access and utilization disparities among US-born Latino youth. Third, we are unable to control for state fixed effects and policies, which have significant influence and impact on immigrant populations (eg, ICE presence, 287(g) contract agreements between ICE and police departments to identify and remove immigrants  47  ). Lastly, items from the K6 distress instrument have been found to function differently by race/ethnicity and language use among Latinos,  48  and distress symptoms may manifest uniquely in different cultural groups and some ethnic populations.  49 We believe that the K6 distress instrument may be limited in measuring the unique stressors among Latino immigrants, and thus, we may be underestimating the proportions of Latina mothers with moderate and severe distress."

      "text": "Latino youth with noncitizen mothers are more likely to experience disparities in access to and utilization of health care services compared with those with citizen mothers, and maternal distress moderates these associations. Latino youth will eventually make up over a third of all youth in the United States, and these findings demonstrate the need to address current health and immigration policy that contribute to these disparities. Furthermore, with the recent shift in the sociopolitical climate of the United States, these disparities for Latino youth will only worsen with the increase in anti-Latino immigrant rhetoric, detention and deportation of Latino immigrants and current efforts to change policies related to public charge."
