      "text": "The global incidence of chronic diseases is rising, posing substantial social and economic challenges. These conditions necessitate effective long-term self-care, which can be supported by digital interventions using remote measurement technologies, like smartphones and wearables. This systematic review investigates the motivational strategies within digital technologies to improve self-care adherence for chronic illnesses, particularly cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus. A literature search was conducted, focusing on studies from 2004 to 2024. A total of 17 studies met the inclusion criteria. The reviewed interventions targeted medication adherence, lifestyle modifications, and symptom tracking. Findings suggest that motivational strategies, such as feedback, health literacy, reminders, and motivational messages, goal-setting, social interaction, gamification, and rewards can improve patient adherence to self-care behaviors. However, their effectiveness relies on theoretical grounding, data-driven features, and personalization. Future research should prioritize integrating robust theories and developing standardized metrics for adherence to enhance the reliability and impact of digital interventions.\n\nAccording to  1  , the incidence of chronic diseases is increasing globally every year, leading to severe social and economic consequences  2  . Chronic diseases normally persist over an extended period and progress slowly, affecting individuals' quality of life and necessitating long-term monitoring and management  3, 4  . Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and diabetes mellitus (DM) are two of the most common chronic diseases due to their high prevalence, morbidity, and mortality rates  5  . CVDs refer to heart and blood vessel disorders, which are chronic physical diseases that evolve gradually over time  6  , which can lead to heart failure, stroke, and sudden death  7  . DM is a metabolic disorder characterized by abnormally high blood sugar levels  8  . It damages many body systems, particularly blood vessels, eyes, kidneys, heart, and nerves  9  . DM is also well-recognized as a main risk factor for the development of CVDs  10  . Moreover, patients with a combination of DM and cardiovascular diseases reported nearly double mortality rates and reduced life expectancy by ~12 years  11  .\n\nSelf-care is vital for both the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases  12  . Effective self-care enables patients to maintain independent lifestyles, improving quality of life, reducing hospitalizations, and enhancing clinical outcomes  13  . According to the middle range theory of self-care of chronic Illness, self-care is defined as \"a process of maintaining health through health promoting practices and managing illness,\" which encompasses three key elements: maintenance, monitoring, and management  14  . Maintenance refers to adherence to behaviors for maintaining physical and emotional stability; monitoring means observing changes in signs and symptoms; management requires responding to these changes  13, 14  .\n\nRemote measurement technologies (RMTs), such as smartphones, wearables, and associated applications, have been extensively studied to deliver digital interventions to support self-care among patients with chronic diseases  15, 16  . These information-gathering technologies enable continuous monitoring outside clinical settings, providing patients with data and feedback and facilitating a more personalized and effective approach to health management  17, 18  . RMTs refer to digital technologies that are able to remotely gather various types of data about human behavior, psychological states, and physiological parameters  16, 19  . RMTs commonly use two approaches to data collection: active and passive. Active RMTs require users to actively input data, which include subjective measures like mood and pain, and behavioral data, such as medication adherence and alcohol consumption  [20] [21] [22]  . Passive RMTs automatically collect information from users through device-embedded sensors, tracking metrics, such as heart rate, skin conductance, step count, and activity levels  23, 24  .\n\nSuccessful RMT-based digital interventions require patients to adhere to active data collection, which requires user effort and accurate selfreporting  22  . While RMTs can offer valuable feedback and support in acquiring health behavior information and skills, patients often face challenges in maintaining motivation over time to use RMTs  25, 26  . According to the information-motivation-behavioral (IMB) model  27  , motivation (personal and social) is a key determinant of adherence behavior  28  . The declining motivation can directly reduce patients' adherence to RMTs, decreasing the effectiveness of overall self-care outcomes  26, 29  . Therefore, understanding and addressing motivational factors is important for enhancing the efficacy of RMTs and supporting sustained self-care.\n\nFurthermore, how patients interact with and interpret health data collected from RMTs can significantly impact the patients' motivation to use RMTs and their adherence to self-care  30  . Data is not merely a fact but requires thoughtful engagement to be meaningful  31  . Recent studies have focused on facilitating patients' understanding and utilization of their health data through various methods, such as data visualization  30  and AI-driven chatbots  32  . Beyond these methods, the design of data presentation in RMTs can also impact motivation. For example, in study  33  , virtual crowns and trophies were used as rewards to recognize users when they achieved specific goals aimed at boosting motivation. However, it remains unclear which motivational strategies are employed and how these strategies affect longterm adherence to self-care.\n\nTherefore, the objective of this systematic review is to assess the current breadth of evidence on the use of motivational strategies within digital intervention to promote self-care adherence among patients with CVD or DM. This review specifically aims to (1) examine the types of RMTs used, (2) identify the motivational strategies and associated theories employed, (3)  inventory the design of data presentation implemented in these RMTs, and (4) assess how adherence outcomes were evaluated and reported. To our knowledge, the only review that has explored motivational strategies to increase participation and adherence in cardiac rehabilitation was recently published by ref. 34. However, this work did not examine self-care adherence but rather focused on content like motivational interviewing and counseling delivered by healthcare professionals  34  . Another study  35  on quantifying the quantified self-focused on understanding patients' motivations for self-tracking health data. However, it did not identify specific motivational strategies that could be integrated into health interventions  35  . Moreover, previous studies on adherence have generally focused on RMTs addressing specific behaviors or activities within self-care. For instance, one study evaluated the effectiveness of app-based interventions in improving medication adherence in CVDs  36  . Another review focused exclusively on wearable activity tracker-based interventions aimed at improving adherence to physical activity and health outcomes in chronic disease contexts  37  . Considering these limitations in the scope of previous reviews, the increasing amount of research on RMTs, and the importance of motivation for sustained adherence to self-care practices, there is a need for an up-todate and comprehensive systematic review.\n\nThis systematic review summarizes the research on motivational strategies in digital interventions from 2004 to 2024. A comprehensive search across four electronic databases yielded 17 studies for inclusion. The included studies are analyzed from the perspective of the types of RMTs, the motivational strategies and theories applied, the data presentation designs, and the evaluation methods for patient adherence. This review reveals that while various strategies and designs have been employed to motivate patient adherence to self-care, challenges remain in the research and development of digital interventions. Insights from this review contribute to the growing field of health information technology, particularly in how digital tools like RMTs can enhance chronic disease management. By integrating motivational strategies into self-management systems, these technologies can improve healthcare delivery. This knowledge may inform the design of health information technologies, such as remote monitoring tools and selfmanagement platforms, to improve patient engagement, adherence, and health outcomes. This review also highlights areas for improvement, emphasizing the need to address existing gaps to develop more effective and sustainable digital interventions for chronic disease self-care."

      "text": "The 17 studies included in this review were published between 2011 and 2023, focusing on patients with diabetes and/or various CVDs. Geographically, 11 studies were conducted in the United States, with the remaining studies conducted in China (n = 1), South Korea (n = 1), Japan (n = 1), and Spain (n = 1). Additionally, one study was conducted across three locations: Spain, Italy, and the Czech Republic. These studies analyzed various types of RMTs and their associated digital interventions, employing diverse study designs, including six randomized controlled trials (RCTs), four pre-post studies, two longitudinal studies, two feasibility studies, one crossover study, and one formative in-situ evaluation study, with duration ranging from two weeks to 12 months. Sample sizes varied considerably, ranging from 10 38 to 450  39  . 11 of the 17 studies (~65%) involved fewer than 50 participants, reflecting smaller-scale trials. The participant populations across these studies predominantly consisted of older adults. Detailed characteristics of each included study can be found in Table  1 ."

      "title": "Digital interventions",
      "text": "Thirteen interventions in the included studies had multiple aims, primarily focusing on improving adherence to self-monitoring and management, such as medication intake and the tracking of symptoms and vital signs, like blood pressure and blood glucose levels  [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48]  , to notice and focus on specific health problems. Six studies also emphasized adherence to lifestyle, including weight management, physical activity, dietary changes, and smoking cessation  38, [44] [45] [46] 48, 49  . Two s udies focused on the rehabilitation for motor deficits and the promotion of physical activity  50, 51  . Additionally, many studies sought to empower patients by improving their selfefficacy  33, 41, 45, 47, [52] [53] [54]  and health literacy, as seen in  42, 45, 47, 53  , educating patients about the fundamental disease knowledge, the risks associated with unhealthy behaviors, and the benefits of adopting healthy behaviors.\n\nInterventions in the included studies take different forms and involve healthcare professionals on different levels. User control refers to interventions where patients have a primary role in managing their own care through digital interventions, including making decisions based on the data they collect and use. Expert control emphasizes the primary role of the healthcare professional, where they supervise the intervention and provide guidance to patients about their behavior. Among the interventions reviewed, 11 were based on user control  [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] 46, 47, 50, 51, 53  . These interven ions allowed patients to manage their health independently, with minimal direct involvement from healthcare providers.\n\nFive interventions incorporated both user and expert control  33, 44, 45, 49, 52  , where patients engaged in self-care activities while healthcare professionals monitored the tracked data and sent motivational or reminder messages at specific times. For example  44  , provided patients with control over daily medication management and adherence tracking, while healthcare professionals set up the medication plan and maintained communication with patients that facilitated ongoing support. Similarly, in  45  , patients were responsible for daily monitoring, goal setting, and accessing educational content, but healthcare professionals played a crucial role in guiding treatment, monitoring patient data, and adjusting care plans as needed. Additionally, one study  48  employed two intervention groups: one with only user control, where patients input their self-care data (e.g., blood glucose, dietary habits, and step count), and another with both user and expert control, featuring bidirectional feedback from physicians.\n\nThe health-related metrics monitored in the RMT-based interventions include blood glucose levels, blood pressure, weight, symptoms, diet, physical activity, and medication adherence. 75% of interventions (n = 12) extended beyond mere data tracking by incorporating feedback mechanisms, ranging from real-time feedback to personalized and behavioral trigger messages. Additionally, nine interventions provided tailored educational resources, and one offered health reports to enhance user knowledge and support health management. Goal-setting and tracking features were included in six interventions. Moreover, reminders and alerts were integrated into six interventions each to support adherence and engagement. Social support, involving peer or family participation, was featured in two studies. Some of these also served as motivational strategies, which are further elaborated in Section \"Motivational strategies to improve patient adherence\"\n\nThis review identified 14 interventions that are based on mobile applications. Of these, four were smartphone-based  38, 40, 41, 51  , one was implemented via a tablet  33  , and the remainder did not specify the type of device  42, 43, [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] 52, 53  . Addit onally, two interventions were web-based  39, 45  , while one was accessible through both web and smartphone interfaces  44  .\n\nRMTs varied in their application across the studies. Four studies employed passive RMTs, such as pedometers, built-in accelerometers, and gyroscope sensors, to unobtrusively monitor physical activity without requiring user input from participants  41, 43, 50, 51  . The majority of the studies (n = 9) utilized active RMTs, which necessitated higher levels of user interaction. These included mobile systems for time-stamped electronic logs, patient-reported physical activity outcomes, dietary records, and wireless monitoring devices, such as blood pressure monitors and weight scales  33, 38, 42, [44] [45] [46] [47] 52, 53  . Furth rmore, four studies incorporated both active and passive RMTs, combining automated data collection with participantreported metrics  39, 40, 48, 49  .\n\nData plays a crucial role in the design and functionality of the digital interventions reviewed in this study. Across various interventions, the collected data from patients was used not only to record and monitor patient progress but also to personalize feedback, tailor messages, and assist care providers in decision-making. Eight studies specifically reported the use of graphical displays within the RMTs; details can be found in Table  2 . Of these, three studies employed line graphs  47, 51, 53  , two used color-coded indicators  47, 48  , and one utilized a horizontal bar display  38  and two studies mentioned the inclusion of data visualizations  33, 45  . These visualizations were intended to help patients track their progress over time and aid understanding of their health data. However, the limited descriptions of these graphical elements across the studies restrict our ability to fully assess their design and effectiveness in driving patient engagement.\n\nBeyond data presentation, the collected real-time health data are used to generate personalized feedback  40, 47, 50, 51  . For example, in ref. 47, collected weight data was used to trigger customized feedback, such as alert messages if the weight exceeded the standard. In ref. 50, the Yousician mobile application uses the device's microphone to capture and assess the user's musical performance, which triggers real-time auditory feedback from a keyboard with concurrent visual feedback on timing accuracy. Similarly, in ref. 51, both auditory and visual feedback are generated based on the collected data.\n\nIn six interventions, data are not only presented to patients but also shared with healthcare professionals to enhance monitoring, provide    45, 48  link collected data with electronic health information systems. In ref. 45, an interactive web-based system was integrated with electronic health records (EHRs), enabling real-time monitoring and immediate response from healthcare providers. Similarly  48  , developed a mobile application that enabled physicians to view patient data in real time between clinic visits, incorporating lifelog data from personal sensors and wearables into electronic medical records. Another two interventions  38, 49  use advanced data processing to provide more sophisticated feedback mechanisms. For example, in ref. 38, a statistical framework was used to provide real-time, personalized blood glucose forecasts by integrating self-monitoring data with physiological models, enabling continuous updates and more accurate predictions to assist patients in daily management tasks. Similarly, in ref. 49, both static data from a baseline database and dynamic behavioral data from patients were fed into a messagematching module to select appropriate messages tailored to the patient's needs. This system also included a behavioral analysis module, which extracted information from the dynamic database to assess patient adherence and behavior, refining the feedback strategy. However, in four studies  39, 42, 52, 53  , the collected data was used solely for recording purposes or study analysis without triggering any further actions within the intervention. For example, in  52  , the focus was more on recording patient-generated data rather than using it to trigger feedback mechanisms or alerts; in ref. 39, although data from pedometers was processed, it was used solely for study analysis and was not integrated into the intervention itself."

      "title": "Motivational strategies to improve patient adherence",
      "text": "To understand the factors contributing to increased adherence to patients' self-care behavior, we analyzed the motivational strategies employed in each study. These strategies can be broadly categorized into seven types: feedback, reminders and motivational messages, goal setting and tracking, social interaction, health literacy, reward, and gamification. Multiple motivational strategies were often combined to enhance user engagement and adherence. Details on applying these strategies and the related theoretical underpinnings in each intervention are presented in Table  3 .\n\nTwelve interventions provided personalized feedback to patients on their behavior and performance related to self-care, often also including alerts or recommendations  [38] [39] [40] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51]  . For in tance, in ref. 38, personalized blood glucose forecasts were offered to assist with meal-time decisions, which patients found reassuring and motivating, with one participant mentioning, \"It would also tell me when I was doing wonderful. I am taking care of my sugar.\" In ref. 46, a health check-up module was included to analyze blood pressure trends and hypertension grades, providing tailored feedback. In ref. 51, the feedback module delivered auditory cues, such as compliments and fanfare sounds, and visual feedback based on performance metrics after activity completion. This approach is akin to that used in ref. 50, where the Yousician mobile application captured musical interactions and triggered real-time auditory feedback from a keyboard, coupled with visual feedback on timing accuracy. Additionally, in ref. 43, text messages were sent to reflect patients' recent self-monitoring blood glucose frequency and glycemic control, with examples like, \"You are doing a good job of monitoring. Your blood sugar levels are improving.\" However, this study highlighted a potential downside: motivational messages could sometimes be discouraging, particularly when feedback indicated that the intended behavior change had not been achieved.\n\nNine studies  40, 42, [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] 52, 53  addressed patients' health literacy in self-care interventions. Four  tudies  45, [47] [48] [49]  utilized one-way messaging for providing education and information. Two of these studies  49  , and  45  , combined the feedback with educational content in the messages: one  49  provided prescription recommendations and health tips, while the other  45  offered webbased educational content and feedback through messaging. The other two studies  47  , and  48  , sent messages covering topics, such as diet, sleep, stress management, and medication adherence.\n\nAdditionally, four studies  42, 46, 52, 53  integrated educational materials within intervention applications to improve patients' health knowledge, awareness, and self-care behaviors. For example  52  , featured modules on diet, exercise, and self-management, delivered through videos and text files.  40 ncluded a \"CHF-info\" module with 10 educational units focused on heart failure and related conditions.\n\nEleven studies provided reminders and/or motivational messages to increase patient adherence  33, [39] [40] [41] [42] 44, [46] [47] [48] 52, 53  , included automated reminders  40, 41, 44, 53  , patient-set reminders  33, 39, 46  , and personalized reminders arranged by external parties  39  . For inst nce, in ref. 46, a reminder service module was implemented, where the reminder times were initially set according to the management plan, with results indicating that this feature was particularly beneficial for patients with limited self-management experience, helping them complete daily tasks. Similarly, in ref. 40, the application sent real-time custom automated reminders to patients, Table 2 summarizes the types of health data and their corresponding visualizations or roles in the included studies.  https://doi.org/10.1038/s44401-025-00017-4 org/10.1038/s44401-025-00017-4  prompting  em to check their weight and complete HF symptom assessments. Although the intervention did not significantly enhance medication adherence, it notably increased self-care confidence compared to a control group that only received HF education. Motivational messages were utilized in seven of these studies  39, 41, 42, 44, 47, 48, 52  . These messages, also referred to as reinforcement or behavior-triggered messages in some studies, were pervasive, being used to encourage adherence in various contexts  39, 41, 42, 44, 47, 48  . For instance  48  , automatically sent motivational text messages alongside educational and behavioral content, while ref. 41 provided tailored motivational and reinforcement messages based on patients' previous day's medication adherence. In ref. 39, patients were invited to write personal motivational messages to be sent weekly or monthly, reinforcing their commitment to becoming more active. Additionally, in ref. 52, two types of motivational messages were used to send to participants based on the Fogg behavior model (FBM)  55  : \"sparks,\" which motivate those needing encouragement, and \"facilitators,\" for individuals lacking ability or capacity. The study found that spark triggers prompted specific behaviors more quickly than facilitator triggers or no triggers, although the difference was not statistically significant. However, the quicker response to spark triggers highlights their potential as a crucial element in prompting timely behavior, aligning with FBM's emphasis on the need for motivation, ability, and a trigger to complete a task  52, 55  .\n\nGoal setting, as a commonly used motivational strategy, has been observed in six included studies  33, 39, 45, 48, 52, 53  . Goal setting is often combined with planning and visual indicators for progress tracking  33, 53  . In ref. 48, researchers set goals for patients to encourage physical activity. In contrast, in refs. 33,39,52,53, the goals are set by the users themselves. Participants in ref. 39 reported that while aiming to meet or exceed step goals was motivating, the fear of failing to meet these goals also drove motivation. Similarly, significant improvements were observed in ref. 53 in self-efficacy through goal setting, which likely enhanced participants' confidence. The intervention in ref. 33 was specifically designed to support goal-oriented care with three modules: goal elicitation, goal setting, and goal tracking, designed to address autonomy, competence, and relatedness according to selfdetermination theory. Results indicated that, in practice, goal-setting and expectation management were predominantly assisted by care managers, which emphasized that digital interventions are often more effective when supplemented with human support  33, 56  .\n\nSocial interaction is featured in four studies, which involved interaction among peers  33, 46  or between patients and their supporters, such as friends, family members, or healthcare providers  39, 43  . For example, the application developed in  46  employed a leaderboard feature that allowed users to compare their progress with others, thereby utilizing social support as a motivational tool. Similarly, social support was incorporated in  33  by allowing users to view goal lists set by others within their social network. Participants found this feature informative and helpful, suggesting that integrating social network insights into digital interventions can enhance user engagement and trust  33  . In ref. 43, it was demonstrated that pairing adults with Type 2 diabetes with a patient-selected supporter in a mobile information and communication technology (ICT) intervention not only enhanced emotional and instrumental support, improving patients' selfefficacy but also provided supporters with valuable insights and awareness about the challenges faced by diabetes patients, helping them more effectively reinforce positive behaviors in their paired patients. Additionally, in ref. 39, the program did not directly facilitate social interaction but offered resources, such as online links to local support services and encouraged users to create and share personal 'physical activity challenges' with their social network, aiming to foster and strengthen social support networks. In ref. 46, a leaderboard module was implemented in the designed mobile health application, using persuasive technology  57  by motivating users to aim for higher scores to see their names on the leaderboards. This not only provided a competitive edge but also served as a source of social support, boosting motivation and indirectly improving compliance. Moreover, the health report module described in 46 implemented a scoring system based on task completion and changes in health data, with the results indicating that patients who were more educated and motivated to learn about their condition found this module particularly effective in enhancing their compliance with prescribed treatments.\n\nThe reward strategy was employed in two studies  33, 50  . In ref. 33, participants earned virtual crowns and trophies for their efforts, which they found motivating. Interestingly, the study 33 also implemented negative rewards by using sad face icons when goals were unmet. Some participants reported that these negative rewards were also motivational; to avoid seeing a negative icon on their dashboards, they worked harder to achieve their goals  33  . However, some desired more tangible incentives, such as vouchers. In ref. 33, participants unlocked new levels and earned \"stars\" and \"certificates\" as rewards, displayed on a summary screen. The music-based nature of the intervention 50 also provided an enjoyable and rewarding experience, enhancing engagement in rehabilitation."

      "title": "Theoretical foundations in motivational strategies",
      "text": "Not all studies specified the theoretical underpinnings for the aforementioned motivational strategies. 41% (n = 7) of them did not explicitly mention the application of psychological theories, models, or principles in the design or implementation of their interventions. However, many of these strategies inherently align with well-established theories employed by the other studies.\n\nThe remaining ten studies cited a total of eight different theoretical models and constructs. Self-determination theory (SDT)  58  was referenced in three studies  33, 39, 41  , which posits that humans have three innate psychological needs: autonomy, competence, and relatedness. This theory primarily supported strategies related to goal setting and autonomous regulation, aiming to enhance self-efficacy and foster intrinsic motivation. Social cognitive theory (SCT)  59  was cited in two studies  45, 52  . In ref. 52, SCT was used to design and reinforce social modeling statements in educational videos to boost self-efficacy beliefs; one example was \"others like yourself have been successful in managing their type II diabetes.\" This was implemented alongside the FBM  55  to develop trigger messages to coincide with the use of the RMT. The other study  45  integrated SCT with the theory of planned behavior  60  and the health belief model (HBM)  61  to enhance the effectiveness of the intervention without clearly outlining the distinct contributions of each theory. Additionally, the HBM  61  was used in ref. 53 to guide strategies to enhance self-efficacy through educational resources and to use goal setting and reminders for regular task performance. Situation-specific theory (SST)  62  was applied in ref. 47, where it focused on self-monitoring of symptoms, health literacy, and self-efficacy. This theory guided the strategies of educational and motivational messages within the intervention. The IMB model  27  was used in ref. 40 to combine information on HF selfmanagement with the RMT as a healthcare coach to enhance intrinsic motivation and improve engagement. The model specifies that health promotion behaviors begin with health promotion information and motivation, which subsequently lead to the development of skills required to initiate and sustain these behaviors  27  ."

Some studies  40, 42, [47] [48] [49] 53  assessed adherence to more than one activity. Sus ained engagement over time is considered a dimension of adherence in this review, as it reflects consistent participation and serves as a facilitator of overall adherence  63  .\n\nAdherence to application usage was normally assessed through the time spent on the applications  40, 46, 50, 52  and the frequency of usage across different features  33, 38  . Medication adherence was evaluated in three studies, each employing distinct methods: one study 40 used the self-administered Morisky medication adherence questionnaire, another  44  utilized the proportion of days covered with medication along with the simplified medication adherence questionnaire (SMAQ), and a third study  41  measured adherence based on the timing of medication intake relative to the prescribed dosing schedule. Nine studies focused on behavioral adherence to prescribed activities, including self-monitoring of vital signs (e.g., blood pressure, blood glucose levels, and body temperature)  42, 43, 45, 48, 49, 53  and dietary  54  , completion of educational content and quizzes  53  , and performing physical activity tasks  39, 48, 51  . Most of these studies measured adherence by assessing the frequency or degree to which patients followed medical prescriptions and their success in achieving set health goals. It was worth noticing that in ref. 49, they used a set of indexes to estimate the patient's adherence to the treatments. Additionally, in ref. 47, the self-care of heart failure index (SCHFI) was used to subjectively assess adherence by evaluating participants' self-care maintenance, management, and selfconfidence.\n\nIn total, 59% of the included studies (n=10) reported high or increased adherence rates in their intervention with motivational strategies  33, [40] [41] [42] 44, 46, 48, 49, 51, 53  . Among these, two  CTs showed significantly higher adherence in intervention groups compared to controls. The smartphone medication adherence stops hypertension (SMASH) intervention  41  led to sustained medication adherence, highlighting the importance of self-efficacy and autonomous regulation. Similarly, in ref. 48, participants who received personalized feedback (MPC group) engaged more consistently with the app, although this engagement declined to 50% by the study's end. Another three RCTs  40, 42, 49  reported high adherence in the intervention groups, but results were not statistically significant or lacked pvalues. In ref. 42, patients, including those with poor digital literacy, maintained high adherence to self-monitoring throughout the study, indicating the application's sustainability. Two studies  40, 49  reported overall improvements in adherence, but they did not include detailed statistical information, such as p-values, to show whether these improvements were significant.\n\nTwo longitudinal studies reported user adherence exceeding 90%, indicating high levels of sustained engagement over time  51, 53  . In ref. 51, patients preferred using their smartphones over traditional rehabilitation tools, though some technical issues affected adherence. In ref. 53, goalsetting and daily reminders in the application were found to significantly improve users' self-efficacy and help establish effective hypertension management habits. A pre-post study  44  showed increased adherence based on self-reports, though this was not reflected in medication coverage, suggesting the need for multiple adherence measurement methods. Additionally, over 60% of participants had a college or professional education, which correlated with higher adherence levels  44  . A formative evaluation  33  revealed that participants who remained engaged valued rewards and experienced increased commitment to their health goals, while those who abandoned the application cited distrust, health issues, or technical difficulties as reasons for disengagement.\n\nOther studies showed mixed results. A crossover study 52 observed higher task adherence with behavioral trigger messages, though not statistically significant. Despite improvements in beliefs about physical activity in ref. 39, the results did not see increased activity levels at 12 months. Among the pre-post studies, usage remained stable over a three-week period in ref. 50, while  45  provided engagement data without detailed results  45  ; clinically relevant improvements in maintenance, self-management, and selfconfidence were observed in ref. 47, though these results lacked statistical significance. In feasibility studies, one  43  found that 20 to 30% of participants did not adhere to SMBG, and the other  38  noted a decline in adherence overtime during the intervention."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "Patients with chronic diseases (CVD and DM) often require long-term selfcare to achieve optimal health outcomes. Digital interventions play a crucial role in supporting these self-care behaviors. This systematic review synthesized evidence from 2004 to 2024 on motivational strategies within digital health interventions designed to improve patient adherence to selfcare. Despite an extensive literature search, only 17 studies met the inclusion criteria, underscoring the limited attention given to the specific integration of motivational strategies in the design of the self-care intervention and highlighting a pressing opportunity for further investigation. The following discussion analyzes the strengths and weaknesses of current approaches, including gaps in theoretical application and methodological inconsistencies, identifies key areas for improvement, and proposes possible directions for future research to optimize patient adherence and engagement with digital interventions.\n\nAll the studies included in this review utilized user control in their interventions, as we focus on self-care, where patients play an active role in managing their health. However, user control alone may not be suitable for all patient populations, particularly those with complex health conditions or lack of self-care experience where expert control becomes essential. In such cases, expert supervision can help to offer guidance, and monitor progress. Some interventions incorporated both user and expert control, with only one study  48  directly comparing these approaches. In ref. 48, the hybrid system, combining user and expert control, demonstrated better health outcomes, a greater reduction in glycated hemoglobin levels, and improved adherence, compared to the user-only control group. However, the findings from a single study cannot be generalized. Further research is needed to evaluate the effectiveness of different control approaches across diverse contexts and patient populations.\n\nOur review examined the types of RMTs used in digital interventions, highlighting their diverse applications. Passive RMTs offer unobtrusive monitoring and continuous data collection without requiring active input from users. This feature aids in long-term adherence by reducing the burden of manual data reporting. In ref. 39, passive RMTs, pedometer, and the fridge magnet (equipped with recording strips) were used not only for monitoring but also as motivational tools. Active RMTs were more commonly used in the interventions reviewed. These systems can offer richer data by capturing a wider range of health indicators. Nevertheless, the need for active participation poses challenges, such as low user engagement and compliance. For example, in ref. 46, participants reported the routine of recording data as tedious and disengaging. This highlights the importance of integrating motivational features into active RMTs to enhance user engagement. Some interventions combined passive and active RMTs  39, 40, 48, 49  , allowing continuous objective data collection while incorporating subjective user-reported metrics, which also requires sustained patient motivation. Moreover, integrating data from both sources can be complex, necessitating sophisticated algorithms and user-friendly interfaces to ensure the information is actionable and meaningful.\n\nOur review was unable to establish definitive conclusions about the relative efficacy of passive, active, and hybrid systems due to the varied methodologies and adherence outcome measurements used across the included studies. Further exploration of the strengths and limitations of these systems in different contexts is needed to better understand their relative efficacy. This review has found evidence suggesting digital interventions incorporating motivational strategies can positively influence patient adherence to self-care behaviors. However, their effectiveness often varies and is not always statistically significant due to factors like study design limitations (e.g., small sample sizes or short durations) and the context, user characteristics, and specific self-care behaviors targeted. These variations highlight the need for tailored approaches rather than one-size-fits-all solutions. To address this, we recommend adopting user-centered approaches like co-creation or participatory design, involving collaboration between patients, healthcare providers, and other stakeholders, when designing motivational strategies. This can help tailor interventions to individual needs and contexts, ultimately maximizing their impact on adherence and health outcomes.\n\nWhile several studies  [40] [41] [42] [43] 48, 52, 53  have explored the relationship between the proposed digital interventions and patient self-efficacy, there is a notable absence of evidence supporting a clear pathway from the design of motivational strategies to improvements in self-efficacy, and ultimately, to sustained behavior change, i.e., adherence. Despite  hese gaps, the review showed that certain features of digital interventions regardless of the applied platform, which are feedback, health literacy, reminders and motivational messages, goal-setting, social interaction, gamification, and reward can serve as motivational strategies. These features can potentially improve self-care practices and, consequently, enhance adherence to the intervention. While we could not definitively conclude which specific feature is more effective in motivating patients, the evidence suggests that combining multiple strategies is more likely to yield positive outcomes. Further research can explore the contextual factors influencing the effectiveness of various motivational strategies and test their impact in diverse settings.\n\nPrevious reviews have found that effective behavior change interventions often include personalized, tailored, and actionable feedback  64  . Our findings are consistent with this, as personalized feedback is widely used and recognized as a key motivator in the reviewed studies, which not only provides patients with real-time reflections on their health behaviors but also serves as an emotional touchpoint, reinforcing positive behavior. However, its effectiveness depends heavily on timing and how the feedback is worded and presented; poorly delivered feedback can discourage patients  43  . To optimize this, future interventions could consider adaptive feedback systems, tailoring feedback based on user changing behavior and contextual state. For example, AI-driven systems can provide contextsensitive, supportive messages that align with individual progress and emotional states  65  . Additionally, reminders and behavior-triggered messages are often used alongside feedback. Many studies reviewed employ motivational messages, which have been found to outperform simple reminders in encouraging desired behaviors  52  . Therefore, we suggest that incorporating positive reinforcement and behavior-triggered reminders could enhance patients' intrinsic motivation over time, potentially leading to sustained behavior change.\n\nGoal setting has shown promise in sustaining motivation. Our review found that most studies allowed patients to set and modify their goals, which gave them control over their health journey as their needs and priorities changed  33, 52  . This highlights the need for future research to develop flexible, patient-centered goal-setting frameworks that can adapt to individual progress. Additionally, evidence indicates that patients who set goals with the guidance of healthcare professionals, such as through purpose-built applications  33  , tend to manage their conditions more effectively. This underscores the importance of professional support in enhancing patients' ability to manage their health  66  .\n\nEnhancing patients' health literacy has emerged as another important strategy in the reviewed studies. Interventions that incorporate educational content could increase patients' understanding of their conditions and improve self-management skills. However, the effectiveness of these interventions can vary depending on how the content is delivered. Approaches range from one-way messaging to integrated educational modules, with evidence suggesting that the format and delivery method significantly impact the effectiveness of health literacy efforts. Moreover, fostering social interaction has proven to be an important element in enhancing adherence. Social support, whether through peer interaction or supporter engagement, contributed to motivation and adherence. The effectiveness of social network integration, as seen in refs. 46 and 43  , indicates that fostering a sense of community and shared experience can be a powerful motivator. This finding suggests that digital interventions could benefit from incorporating more robust social features.\n\nIn addition to education and social support, rewards play an important role in motivating patients. Our review indicates that virtual rewards can be effective for older adults when well-designed and aligned with user preferences  33  . While in ref. 33, it was found that negative rewards could also serve as a motivational tool for certain individuals, this contradicts findings in ref. 67. These conflicting findings highlight the need for further research to better understand how different types of rewards influence motivation and consider exploring and testing the effectiveness of various rewards to determine their impact on user engagement and behavior change.\n\nGamification has been shown to effectively improve patient adherence in previous studies  68, 69  . However, in our review, only one study utilized this strategy  46  . This limited use might be explained by findings from a review of mobile health applications, which indicated that game-like features are particularly appealing to teenagers but less effective for adults  70  . Given that the participant populations in the reviewed studies are predominantly older adults, this could explain the limited application of gamification strategies. This observation points out a potential gap in using gamification across diverse age groups. Future research can explore how to adapt gamification elements to be more effective for older adults or investigate alternative, equally engaging motivational strategies for various demographics.\n\nDespite the diverse range of motivational strategies employed in digital interventions, there is a notable inconsistency in the explicit integration of theoretical frameworks. While some strategies are aligned with wellestablished theories such as SDT or SCT, many interventions do not explicitly reference these theories. However, not all successful strategies require formal theoretical foundations. For example, social interactions in interventions may not have originated from theory, but digital interventions incorporating social networking features can still benefit from a theorydriven design. Applying theory enhances our understanding of behavior, motivation, and social dynamics, ultimately improving intervention design and effectiveness.\n\nMoreover, even in studies that claim to draw on theory, the connections between theoretical constructs and specific features or design decisions are often inadequately described. This lack of clarity makes it challenging to draw generalizable theoretical insights. Therefore, we recommend adopting a theory-driven approach in the design and development of digital interventions, as demonstrated in studies like  41, 46  , and through research such as  52  , to maximize the potential usefulness of theory. Furthermore, intervention design should also provide clear explanations of how and why they applied and tested theoretical principles in their studies.\n\nThe role of data in digital interventions for patient self-care has shown to be multifaceted and influential. Contemporary digital interventions increasingly utilize real-time patient-generated health data to personalize feedback. The trend toward integrating advanced data processing techniques, such as predictive modeling and real-time analytics, represents a significant advancement. Emerging technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) can enhance this personalization by analyzing large, complex datasets to identify patterns and provide actionable insights  71, 72  . AI can further predict adherence trends based on historical behavior and suggest timely adjustments to feedback mechanisms to better support self-care.\n\nIn addition to personalized feedback, data visualization can play a crucial role in digital interventions to aid patients in monitoring their progress and understanding their health status  73  . However, the lack of focus and insufficient detail in the descriptions of these visualizations indicate that health data visualization might not be a central focus in this field. This also suggests a missed opportunity to implement more effective and engaging data presentation methods, as literature has demonstrated that welldesigned data visualization can enhance patient engagement and adherence to self-care. For example, systems like UbiFit Garden 67 used dynamic visualizations to boost user engagement in physical activity. Additionally, Murnane et al.  74  provided users with esthetically pleasing visualizations that tracked their activities and progress, resulting in increased physical activity, goal completion, and overall user engagement. Therefore, we recommend that future research and intervention design give more attention to developing and integrating advanced and engaging data visualization techniques. One example could be leveraging multi-modal generative AI like Stable Diffusion  75  , to create dynamic, personalized visualizations that adapt to user interests and behaviors.\n\nFurthermore, the data collected through these digital interventions not only aids patient self-care but also facilitates enhanced care coordination through data-sharing between patients and healthcare providers. Systems like refs. 45,48 that enable real-time data sharing have shown promise in improving the responsiveness and accuracy of healthcare decisions. As digital health technologies continue to evolve, there is an increasing need for seamless integration with EHR and other healthcare systems to ensure continuity of care and optimize patient outcomes. Meanwhile, by extracting and analyzing comprehensive datasets from EHRs and RMT-collected health data, AI can maximize its capabilities to predict treatment responses, optimize therapy decisions, and personalize care plans for individual patients  76  .\n\nPatient adherence is a critical factor in the success of digital interventions, yet it remains one of the most challenging aspects to achieve in practice. During the screening process for this review, 91 studies were excluded, 64 of which were excluded specifically because they either lacked adherence evaluations or focused on other outcomes instead. This suggests that adherence is often underemphasized or inconsistently addressed in digital health research, indicating a gap in the field. Including adherencefocused evaluations in future studies is essential, as understanding adherence behaviors is crucial to the effectiveness of digital health interventions.\n\nThroughout the reviewed studies, variability was found in how adherence was measured, making it difficult to compare results and understand the impact of different interventions. This inconsistency may be attributed to the inherent complexity of adherence, as defined by the World Health Organization  77  \"the extent to which a person's behavior-taking medication, following a diet, and/or executing lifestyle changes, corresponds with agreed recommendations from a health care provider.\" Some studies in this review, like  44, 46, 49  , also highlighted the difficulty in measuring adherence, noting the absence of an accepted \"gold standard\" for assessment. Simple metrics, such as time spent on an application or frequency of usage, can not fully capture the complexity of adherence behaviors. While medication adherence is often the focus due to its direct correlation with clinical outcomes and is typically easier to track and maintain  78  , it does not provide a comprehensive picture of selfmanagement. Other critical aspects, such as physical activity and dietary monitoring, are also vital but more complex to measure consistently. As a result, researchers have developed various methodologies to address this complexity. For instance, one study 49 introduced a set of indexes to estimate adherence, acknowledging that a single metric cannot fully capture its multidimensional nature. This approach aligns with the broader understanding that a comprehensive assessment-integrating both objective and subjective data-is necessary, although further validation of these methods is required. Given these challenges, future research should prioritize the development and validation of a standardized set of tools for measuring adherence.\n\nAdherence challenges extend beyond measurement and include behavioral and technological factors. Factors like the usability of technology  39, 40, 44  , the age and educational background of users  44, 46, 48, 79  , and concerns about privacy 44 can all impact adherence. For instance, difficulties in using wearable technology, as noted in ref. 40, stress the importance of designing interventions that are not only effective but also user-friendly and accessible. Many other individual or clinical factors, such as the severity of the illness or psychological conditions, can also influence adherence. While this review focused on the design and motivational strategies, future research should consider these factors when evaluating patient adherence and analyzing results.\n\nIn summary, our review identified a range of RMTs, motivational strategies, data presentation, and adherence evaluation methods currently in use. RMTs enable personalized health management, but their effectiveness heavily relies on sustained user engagement, which remains challenging. The findings suggest motivational strategies, including personalized feedback, health literacy enhancement, reminders and motivational messages, goal-setting, social support, gamification, and rewards, emerged as potentially impactful in fostering self-care adherence. The success of these strategies is influenced by the variability in contexts, user needs, and health goals. As such, user-centered approaches can help tailor interventions to individual needs and contexts, ultimately maximizing their impact on adherence and health outcomes. Moreover, the lack of theoretical frameworks in some interventions and the insufficient or improper use of frameworks in others weaken the ability to draw generalizable insights across studies. Adopting a theory-driven approach could enhance the design and efficacy of future digital interventions.\n\nAdherence itself presents complex challenges, and the reviewed studies highlighted the variability in adherence definitions and measurement approaches. Many interventions rely on single, basic metrics, which often fail to capture the multi-faceted nature of adherence in chronic disease selfmanagement. This suggests a need for standardized, multi-dimensional adherence metrics that would allow for more reliable evaluations and crossstudy comparisons of digital interventions' impacts. Furthermore, this review found that data presentation methods are underutilized, particularly those employing real-time, personalized feedback and advanced data visualization. When implemented effectively, these methods can provide patients with actionable insights and reinforce engagement in self-care behaviors. Future research should explore advanced and effective data visualization to enhance patient understanding of health progress, potentially leading to improved engagement and sustained adherence."

  "abstract": "Abstract\n            The global incidence of chronic diseases is rising, posing substantial social and economic challenges. These conditions necessitate effective long-term self-care, which can be supported by digital interventions using remote measurement technologies, like smartphones and wearables. This systematic review investigates the motivational strategies within digital technologies to improve self-care adherence for chronic illnesses, particularly cardiovascular diseases and diabetes mellitus. A literature search was conducted, focusing on studies from 2004 to 2024. A total of 17 studies met the inclusion criteria. The reviewed interventions targeted medication adherence, lifestyle modifications, and symptom tracking. Findings suggest that motivational strategies, such as feedback, health literacy, reminders, and motivational messages, goal-setting, social interaction, gamification, and rewards can improve patient adherence to self-care behaviors. However, their effectiveness relies on theoretical grounding, data-driven features, and personalization. Future research should prioritize integrating robust theories and developing standardized metrics for adherence to enhance the reliability and impact of digital interventions.",
