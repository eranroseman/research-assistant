  "title": "The effectiveness and usability of online, group-based interventions for people with severe obesity: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
  "abstract": "Long wait times, limited resources, and a lack of local options mean that many people with severe obesity cannot access treatment. Face-to-face group-based interventions have been found effective and can treat multiple people simultaneously, but are limited by service capacity. Digital group interventions could reduce wait times, but research on their effectiveness is limited. This systematic review aimed to examine the literature about online group-based interventions for adults with severe obesity (BMI \u2265 35 kg/m 2 ). The review followed the PRISMA and PICOS frameworks. MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL, Web of Science, and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials were searched. Two authors independently screened articles. Data extraction, analysis, and quality assessment (using RoB2 and MMAT) was shared between two authors. A meta-analysis was conducted on eligible studies; other results were descriptively analysed. 20 papers reporting on 15 studies were included. Most studies reported some evidence of weight loss, but evidence of weight-related behaviour change was mixed. A meta-analysis on four studies indicated that online, group-based interventions had a statistically significant impact on weight loss (p = 0.001; 95% CI -0.69 to -0.17) with a small-to-moderate effect size, compared to waitlist or standard care conditions. Online interventions were considered more convenient but lack of familiarity with the group or counsellor, accessibility issues, and time constraints hindered engagement. Technical support, incentives, and interactive forums to improve group cohesion could mitigate these barriers. The findings suggested that online, group-based interventions are feasible and potentially beneficial, but barriers such as internet accessibility, digital literacy, and unfamiliarity with group members need to be mitigated. Key recommendations to improve experience and impact include providing instructions and run-throughs, building group cohesion, and providing session and additional content throughout the intervention. Future studies should focus on the influence of specific intervention characteristics and investigate the effect of these interventions compared to face-to-face interventions.",

      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "Obesity is a significant public health problem, which puts a major burden on health services and limits access to treatment  [1] . Obesity is strongly associated with a number of health conditions, including type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer, stroke, and depression  [1] [2] [3] . More severe obesity increases health risks, making access to obesity treatment essential  [4, 5] . Group-based interventions, which can reduce the number of staff needed to deliver interventions, can improve accessibility to services and reduce weight times, and also provide opportunities for social support and sharing of strategies  [3, 6] . Delivering group-based interventions digitally could improve their accessibility by reducing barriers for patient attendance and healthcare delivery. Previous research has examined online  [7] [8] [9] [10] [11]  and in-person group-based weight management interventions  [12] [13] [14]  separately, but there is a lack of synthesis of evidence of the impact of integrating the two strategies. This review aims to address this gap by providing a comprehensive review of the existing literature on online, group-based interventions for people with severe obesity.\n\nThe prevalence of obesity is increasing, particularly in the American and European regions, with 60% of European citizens reported to have obesity or overweight in 2022  [15] . In the United Kingdom, over 25% of adults have clinical obesity  [4, 5] . Over a third of people with obesity report never having accessed any weight-management services and access to Tier 3 and 4 services -targeted for people with BMIs over 35 kg/m 2 -can be even more difficult  [16] . Lack of availability of services is an issue, with over 40% of Clinical Commissioning Groups not commissioning Tier 3 services, resulting in long waiting times and a lack of local resources for people who need them  [16, 17] .\n\nFor instance, in one study, nearly 75% of people with BMIs greater than 35 kg/m 2 (and almost 60% of people with BMIs over 40 kg/m 2 ) did not access any obesity services over a 7 year period  [18] . Obesity is strongly associated with a number of noncommunicable health conditions (such as type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular conditions, and cancer  [1, 19, 20] ), with 40% of people with obesity having high or very high health risks, with increased risk in women  [5] . Behaviours associated with obesity, such as an unhealthy diet and reduced physical activity, are commonly known to link obesity with these conditions  [21] . Behavioural weight management interventions can help address some of the contributing factors for these conditions, and accessing them in a timely manner is important to reduce the risk of long-term complications  [21, 22] .\n\nDelivering behavioural interventions in a group-based setting can help improve availability of services by reducing the number of staff needed to deliver interventions. When delivered face-toface, group-based interventions have generally been found to be effective at supporting weight management  [12, 13] , potentially even superior to individual interventions  [23] [24] [25] . The challenge with group-based interventions is that they can be difficult to offer and access in-person due to time, budget, travel, or facility constraints. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, the use of digital technology is becoming increasingly common in healthcare  [26] . Evaluations of digital interventions for weight management have yielded mixed results  [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] ; some research suggests that digital interventions are more effective than no intervention, but less so than face-to-face interventions  [27] .\n\nIntegrating digital and group-based approaches to weight management interventions has the potential to further improve access by reducing burden on services and wait times for patients. Despite this, no published or planned systematic reviews (registered in PROSPERO) synthesising evidence around online, group-based interventions were identified (detailed in our published protocol  [28] ). This demonstrates a gap in the literature and the need for a comprehensive overview of online, groupbased interventions for people with severe obesity. If group-based interventions can be delivered to the same or better effect online, this could enable more patients to access support in a more timely manner. Examining how these interventions are being evaluated and what evidence there is of their effectiveness at achieving health and behavioural outcomes will inform future intervention development and evaluation."

      "title": "AIMS AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS",
      "text": "The primary aim of this review was to synthesise the available evidence about the effectiveness and user perceptions of online, group-based interventions for adults with severe obesity. Based on the previous literature around group-based and digital interventions, we hypothesised that online, group-based interventions would have the potential to be effective at supporting weight management but that there may be barriers to sustained engagement with them. To achieve this aim, the review was centred on two research questions:\n\n1. What methods of delivering online, group-based behaviour change interventions for adults with severe obesity are the most effective at establishing and maintaining positive health behaviour changes and weight loss? 2. What are the perceptions of the acceptability, usability, and overall user experience for different online, group-based behaviour change interventions for adults with severe obesity?"

An initial review of the literature was used to identify key terms and develop the search strategy (detailed in the published protocol  [28] ). The search string was based on three key themes joined with the following structure: online (MeSH OR Keywords) AND group-based (MeSH OR Keywords) AND severe obesity (MeSH OR Keywords).\n\nThe original search was conducted in March 2021, but the screening and analysis of the results was delayed.

The scope of this review was focused on people with severe obesity because of the evidence of their greater inaccessibility to services  [16] [17] [18] . Severe obesity was defined as BMI \u2265 35 kg/m 2 ; however, to ensure that relevant studies were not excluded, study populations that included a range of BMIs beyond the \u226535 kg/m 2 limit were also included, if the mean BMI at the start of the study was greater than or equal to 35 kg/m 2 . \"Group-based\" interventions were defined as interventions that were primarily group-based (involving 3 or more participants), although group interventions with some independent elements were eligible for inclusion. Interventions were considered to be 'online' if they were enabled via technology to connect participants, whether or not they were 'live' (i.e. synchronous or asynchronous).\n\nA broad range of studies were eligible for inclusion, including randomised controlled trials, quantitative, qualitative, cohort, and case studies as long as they evaluated the intervention, with or without a comparator, and reported outcomes.

The remaining studies (7/15) reported weight loss over time but did not compare weight loss in the online, group-based intervention with another condition  [39, 40, 44, 46, 48, [50] [51] [52] ."

One pilot study found a mean change in weekly walking time of 116 min, although there was a huge range and standard deviation in their small sample of 12 participants  [52] . Another found significant improvements in the 30 second sit-to-stand and 6 minute walk tests, but not in gait speed or grip strength  [51]  and a third found that there were higher rates of positive behaviours when the online intervention included incentives compared to when it did not  [42] . An RCT found a significant difference between the intervention and treatment-as-usual group in accelerometer data (activity increased for the intervention group and decreased in the control group) but no significant difference between groups in mobility  [47] , while another, a pilot RCT, found no significant within-group changes for physical activity  [44] .\n\nThree studies reported on dietary outcomes, of which two did not find a difference between groups (on calorie intake, which was reduced in all conditions  [37] , or on eating psychopathology  [49] ). The third study found no significant within group changes in eating practices, although fruit and vegetable intake did increase in the intervention group.\n\nMeta-analysis of impact on mean weight change. Of the 15 identified studies, 13 reported weight change and 9 of these were RCTs; however, only four  [44, 45, 47, 49]  had consistent comparison groups (waitlist or standard care) and were sufficiently similar to conduct a meta-analysis. The remaining studies had various comparisons -including between online and in-person group-based interventions  [40, 48] , the intervention delivered with and without additional components  [42, 54, 55] , and a socialmedia based intervention compared to a conference call  [50]  -but they were determined to be too heterogeneous for a metaanalysis to be meaningful and too few to conduct separate metaanalyses  [56] . The studies included in the meta-analysis compared the intervention with either a waitlist control or standard care and included a total of 356 participants (179 intervention, 177 control). Three of the four included studies had conducted sample size calculations and were sufficiently powered to detect a reduction in weight of 3-10 kg with 80% power  [45, 47, 49] . From this small sample, the results of the meta-analysis indicated that online, group-based interventions have a statistically significant effect on weight loss compared to no intervention or standard care with a small-to-moderate effect size (SMD (Cohen's d)= -0.428; p = 0.001; 95% CI: -0.69 to -0.17) (Fig.  2 ); however, this should be interpreted with caution. Heterogeneity was small (I 2 = 31%) and the Eggers' test indicated no publication bias (p = 0.28)."

      "text": "Engagement. All but one of the papers  [40]  reported data relating to engagement. Most of the reported outcomes were related to completion rates, which ranged from 30%  [52]  to 95%  [55]  (data for each study is provided in Supplementary Table  S3 ). Of the papers that reported comparisons of engagement between online and other conditions (e.g. traditional route, in person or hybrid), most found no significant difference  [37, 48, 54] . One study did find significantly higher engagement with an internetbased intervention when incentives were provided (91% compared to 81% retention)  [42] . Three studies examined how user characteristics were associated with engagement: one found that older and Black, Asian and Minority Ethnicity (BAME) patients were less likely to choose the online-based intervention when it was offered to them  [57] , while another found that older and male participants were more likely to engage in self-monitoring  [39] .\n\nOne study found that the most common reasons for declining to participate in the online intervention were a lack of digital skills or access to the internet  [57] . All but three of the studies reported some information about facilitators to engagement in the group intervention. Approximately half of them (7/15) tailored the intervention in some way to improve engagement. Two studies  [37, 51]  added in-person group sessions alongside online sessions, but one of them  [37]  found no significant effect of this. The other  [51]  provided additional technical support, which was reported to have a positive impact on engagement. About a quarter of the studies (4/ 15) included interactive forums or group chat functions to improve engagement. Most studies also provided detailed technical instructions and run-throughs prior to the sessions, which minimised disruptions caused by technical issues. One study  [53]  established ground rules and reported this to have increased participants' comfort and facilitated engagement. Another  [42]  provided financial incentives, which increased engagement. Two studies  [52, 53]  asked participants for engagement-related feedback and received suggestions to help improve engagement, including reminders of sessions, team building activities, and having someone familiar in the chat room. Two-thirds of the studies (10/15) also reported barriers to group engagement. Common barriers included a 'digital divide' in internet accessibility (access to internet and usability of technology) and lack of familiarity with other group members. Two studies  [52, 55]  reported hectic schedules resulting in a lack of consensus for session times as a significant barrier to engagement. One study  [52]  had its components on multiple platforms which participants highlighted as a burden, while another  [37]  had a different counsellor in person versus online, which reportedly reduced the alliance. Another study  [54]  used text-based communication rather than video, which hindered engagement as the lack of verbal cues and absence of tone led to the text being easily misconstrued. In another study, the virtual environment itself was considered a barrier to social support and consequently, engagement, by some of the participants  [44] .\n\nAcceptability, usability, and satisfaction. Six of the studies examined some outcome related to acceptability, usability, or satisfaction. Four studies reported positive outcomes related to patient experience: one intervention had high satisfaction ratings  [51] , one identified themes such as reduced travel, time, and cost burdens and a less stressful or daunting environment for introverts  [53] , another hypothesised that the use of an online intervention enabled continued engagement and connection throughout the Covid-19 lockdown, mitigating its negative impact on health behaviours  [48] , and the fourth reported that receiving the intervention online was convenient  [44] .\n\nSome studies also identified concerns with the online interventions. Two studies reported that a lack of familiarity limited participants' comfort sharing information  [50]  and potentially also their engagement  [52] . A couple of studies also identified technical issues such as difficulty accessing the Internet  [52, 53]  and managing intervention components on different platforms  [52] .\n\nOne study also collected participants' suggestions for improvement, which included: digital calorie counting applications, food scales, more frequent sessions, more reminders and incentives, adding team-building exercises, inviting friends, and facilitating face-to-face interaction by connecting participants directly  [52] ."

      "title": "Risk of bias and quality assessment",
      "text": "The risk of bias of the randomised trials was evaluated using the Cochrane Collaboration RoB 2 tool (Table  5 )  [31, 32] . Five of the nine studies were assessed as having low risk of bias in all domains and only one was considered to have high risk of bias. Of the various domains, the randomisation process had the most concerns, with three studies failing to report sufficient information about allocation, schedule generation, or concealment. Three studies also provided only limited drop-out information, although this was not thought likely to be related to the outcomes. Only one domain -measurement of the outcome -was assessed as high risk; this was because the patients measured their own BMI, which could have been affected by their knowledge of the intervention conditions. This was not the planned procedure for outcome measurement protocol; self-measurement of weight and circumference data was necessitated by Covid-19 lockdowns and participants had previously been instructed on how to take measurements themselves.\n\nThe Mixed-Methods Appraisal Tool (MMAT)  [34]  was used to assess the quality of the remaining five studies. Generally, the studies met the criteria, with the exception of confounders being accounted for in the design and analysis of the study. The full assessment (with comments) for all of the 12 studies is provided in Supplementary Table  S3 .\n\nForest Plot Estimated overall confidence interva Overall effect size value Confidence interval of effect size No-effect value Estimated overall effect size Effect size of each study -0.425973 (%) et al., 2014 [-1.08, -0.35] 0.00 30.41 Wild et al., 2015 -0.33 [-0.70, 0.04] 0.08 30.34 Bruce et al., 2023 -0.70 [ -0.96, 0.03] 0.07 20.17 Griffith et al., 2023 -0.08 [-0.60, 0.43] 0.75 19.08 Overall -0.43 [-0.69, -0.17 DISCUSSION Principal findings Fifteen studies were identified that examined the impact of online, group-based weight management interventions for people with severe obesity (BMI \u2265 35 kg/m 2 ). There was substantial variability among the interventions, in terms of online platform (including videoconferencing, websites, and chat functions), group size, and number of sessions, but they most commonly lasted for around 6 months and had 1 hour sessions. Overall, the evidence supported our hypothesis that online, group-based interventions could have a positive impact on weight management, as most of the studies observed weight loss associated with participating in the intervention.\n\nA meta-analysis also indicated a small-tomoderate effect of the interventions at reducing weight compared to no intervention. Drawing implications from these findings should be done cautiously, for a couple of reasons. Only four of the 15 studies were sufficiently comparable to be eligible for the meta-analysis and many of the studies had small and nonrepresentative sample sizes (9/15 had samples of less than 100 participants and most of the studies had predominantly female participants). Additionally, although less than half of the studies (7/15) looked at behavioural outcomes, the evidence of impact of the interventions was limited, particularly for dietary behaviour. This is a common limitation in digital health research  [58, 59] , often due to barriers such as motivation, a perceived lack of social connection, and limitations with the recruitment methods  [60] .\n\nWith the available evidence, it was difficult to draw strong conclusions around the first research question of what methods of delivering online, group-based behaviour change interventions for adults with severe obesity are most effective. The relatively small set of studies included in this analysis made a subgroup analysis of intervention methods infeasible. For the remaining studies, the heterogeneity in the intervention types and the variety of comparisons conducted in the RCTs meant that there was little evidence to support any particular type of intervention. Some results suggested that adding incentives and using pre-scripted modular feedback can help support weight loss but that adding motivational interviewing might not increase the impact of the intervention. However, the small number of studies, heterogeneity, and flaws in design, all serve to limit the conclusions that can be drawn.\n\nWe were better able to address the second research question, which focused on users' perceptions about different online, group-based weight management interventions, although our findings are limited by the fact that less than half of the studies (6/15) examined user experience. Online, group-based interventions were considered to be more convenient, but we identified several major barriers to engagement -including lack of access to fast internet, usability issues, and digital literacy issues -that prevented some people from participating and caused frustration in others."

      "title": "Implications for practice and future intervention design",
      "text": "To mitigate barriers related to usability of the specific platforms used, most studies provided detailed instructions and runthroughs prior to the sessions, both of which were considered helpful by participants. Organising times for the sessions that would be convenient for all participants was difficult in some studies, but having set dates and times for the sessions made attendance easier  [52, 55] . A lack of familiarity with other group members had a negative impact on group cohesion, as did having different facilitators for different sessions  [37, 50, 52] .\n\nThe reviewed studies used a variety of methods to improve engagement, but only a few methods demonstrated positive impact in more than one study. One such method was sending the week's content to participants ahead of the sessions, making them feel prepared and increasing comfort levels as participants knew what to expect. Attempts to remove technical barriers also largely had positive results, with participants giving positive feedback about early run-throughs. Incentives such as weekly tips and tricks, access to recipes, and detailed feedback from facilitators have also been reported as helpful. Feedback from participants included suggestions to provide reminders about the sessions and to include activities to promote participation and group cohesion  [52, 53]  (Table  6 ).\n\nComparison with existing literature and implications for future research Several previous systematic reviews of web-based weight management interventions have found similar results. Generally, there appears to be some weak to moderate evidence of a positive effect of web-based interventions on weight loss, at least  in the short term, although these analyses have been hampered by small sample sizes and variable methods  [7, 61, 62] . Even though these reviews did not focus specifically on severe obesity or group-based interventions, they also only found small numbers of eligible studies -8  [62] , 9  [61] , and 11  [7] .\n\nEvidence on the effectiveness of group-based weight management interventions (with various types of delivery) is stronger  [12, 13] . Interestingly, one meta-analysis found that men-only groups had significantly higher weight loss than mixed-gender or women-only groups  [12] . The review mentioned that this finding was consistent with previous literature about men benefiting from group interventions, but did not speculate on the possible reasons for this difference. The majority of participants in the studies included in this review were women. The literature suggests that this could potentially be a factor affecting the effectiveness of the interventions, although this could not be examined with the limited evidence available in this review. Future research should further explore the relationship between gender and mode of intervention delivery.\n\nThe findings of this review related to technical barriers to engagement, with a greater negative impact on marginalised communities such as older individuals or those from minority ethnic backgrounds  [57] , aligns with existing literature on digital inequalities  [63]  and should be considered while designing new digital interventions. One way to bridge this divide could be via referral to digital literacy programmes such as the NHS Digital Health Champions programme  [64]  before the start of the  [57] . Future interventions should continue using mitigation strategies highlighted in the reviewed studies, such as providing technical instructions and allowing time for run-throughs. To help reduce the issue of lack of familiarity, future studies could introduce a social communication component to encourage better group cohesion, while limiting all activities to as few platforms as possible to reduce burden on participants  [52] . Any delays between expressing interest and beginning the intervention would also need to be kept at a minimum to avoid participants losing motivation. Co-production activities aimed at getting patient inputs specifically discussing challenges faced and ideas to improve their comfort levels and motivation could potentially lead to better engagement in future interventions.\n\nGiven the growing shift towards digital healthcare, especially since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, it will be essential to understand the participant and intervention characteristics that are associated with the greatest benefit from online, group-based interventions to enable intervention designs to be optimised and tailored for specific groups. It would also support personalised medicine by helping healthcare providers and patients to choose the type of intervention most likely to benefit them -in-person or online, individual or group -while increasing the availability of services. To this end, it will also be important for future studies to explore patients' perceptions of the intervention and the facilitators and barriers that they experience.\n\nStrengths and limitations of the review Some of the strengths of the review are that the search was conducted using broad search terms in several databases to minimise the likelihood of missing a relevant study, and that the screening was conducted by two independent authors. The review included a range of studies using different methods, which provided different perspectives on evidence around the impact and experience of online, group-based weight management interventions. This enabled us to conduct qualitative and quantitative analyses and synthesise barriers and facilitators to group engagement, providing a more holistic interpretation of the body of literature on these types of interventions. This analysis also enabled us to outline key factors that can support the successful implementation of these interventions, which can inform the future development and delivery of online, groupbased interventions for people with severe obesity.\n\nOne limitation was that due to time and resource constraints, two authors shared the work of data extraction and risk of bias and quality assessment. Another limitation is that due to the considerable heterogeneity of study design, comparisons, populations, and reported outcome measures, only four of the studies could be included in the meta-analysis, making it difficult to generalise the results of the analysis and provide meaningful knowledge  [65] . Additionally, one of the studies included in the meta-analysis was underpowered  [44] . This was included despite the limitations of including underpowered studies in metaanalyses  [66]  due to the small number of studies eligible for this analysis. This is a common issue in meta-analyses  [66]  and limits the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn from it. The low sample size of a majority of the studies included in this review also limits the other conclusions, and all the results found in this systematic review must be treated with caution. Given that underpowered studies and low sample sizes are a common limitation of digital health research  [58, 60] , future reviews should adjust for this issue while conducting statistical analyses to address this limitation. Finally, the heterogeneity of intervention characteristics, population characteristics, and comparison types also limit the ability to conclude who might benefit most from such interventions."

      "title": "CONCLUSION",
      "text": "The purpose of this systematic review was to synthesise evidence on the effectiveness of, and user experience with, online, group-based interventions for people with severe obesity. The evidence was mixed, but overall suggested some positive effect of the interventions on weight loss. The results from the meta-analysis tentatively suggest a small to moderate impact of the interventions compared to wait list controls, but this was based on a small sample and there was insufficient evidence to determine how digital group  conclude what specific intervention characteristics had the strongest impact on weight loss, but we identified key barriers to engagement including internet accessibility, digital literacy, a lack of time, and lack of familiarity with group members and the counsellor. Some of these barriers were mitigated by specific efforts made by study teams including detailed technical run-throughs and additional inperson sessions to improve group cohesion, but they were not always effective. Future studies into such interventions would benefit from co-production activities with diverse groups emphasising the inclusion of marginalised communities, specifically focusing on mitigating the identified barriers and further facilitating engagement. To improve access to and reduce the strain on weight management services, there is a need for further investigation in how to implement digital group-based interventions to maximise their potential benefits, which could inform decision and policymaking regarding obesity services."
