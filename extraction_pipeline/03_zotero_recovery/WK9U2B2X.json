  "title": "Messages to Support Treatment Adherence in Adults With High Blood Pressure (SMS-Text Adherence Support [StAR]) A Single-Blind, Randomized Trial",
  "abstract": "H igh blood pressure is a major risk factor for global disease burden. 1 Even modest reductions in blood pressure are important and would reduce the risk of associated morbidity and premature mortality.  [2] [3] 3] [4]  In settings where health care and medicines are freely available, a substantial burden of cardiovascular disease may be attributable to suboptimal adherence to blood pressure-lowering treatments.  5 Missed appointments for collection of medicine and challenges with taking lifelong treatment are some of the major reasons for suboptimal Background-We assessed the effect of automated treatment adherence support delivered via mobile phone short message system (SMS) text messages on blood pressure. Methods and Results-In this pragmatic, single-blind, 3-arm, randomized trial (SMS-Text Adherence Support [StAR]) undertaken in South Africa, patients treated for high blood pressure were randomly allocated in a 1:1:1 ratio to information only, interactive SMS text messaging, or usual care. The primary outcome was change in systolic blood pressure at 12 months from baseline measured with a validated oscillometric device. All trial staff were masked to treatment allocation. Analyses were intention to treat. Between June 26, 2012, and November 23, 2012, 1372 participants were randomized to receive information-only SMS text messages (n=457), interactive SMS text messages (n=458), or usual care (n=457). Primary outcome data were available for 1256 participants (92%). At 12 months, the mean adjusted change in systolic blood pressure compared with usual care was -2.2 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, -4.4 to -0.04) with informationonly SMS and -1.6 mm Hg (95% confidence interval, -3.7 to 0.6) with interactive SMS. Odds ratios for the proportion of participants with a blood pressure <140/90 mm Hg were 1.42 (95% confidence interval, 1.03-1.95) for information-only messaging and 1.41 (95% confidence interval, 1.02-1.95) for interactive messaging compared with usual care. Conclusions-In this randomized trial of an automated adherence support program delivered by SMS text message in a general outpatient population of adults with high blood pressure, we found a small reduction in systolic blood pressure control compared with usual care at 12 months. There was no evidence that an interactive intervention increased this effect.",

      "title": "Methods Study Design and Participants",
      "text": "We carried out a parallel, 3-group, randomized, controlled trial among the general adult population attending the outpatient chronic disease services in a single, large, public-sector clinic in Cape Town, South Africa. This primary care facility provides a range of healthcare services to an ethnically diverse, socioeconomically deprived population from 2 communities. According to 2011 Census data, the ethnicity of these communities is mostly black African (51%) or mixed ancestry (48%), about one third of households live in informal dwellings or shacks, and 64% of households have a monthly income of less than R3500.00 (about $270.00). The clinic is within walking distance of both communities. All primary healthcare services and medicines are provided free of charge. In the chronic disease services, stable patients on treatment are reviewed by a clinician (doctor or prescribing nurse) every 3 to 6 months, although patients initiating treatment for the first time or those with a blood pressure >140/90 mm Hg are reviewed more frequently.\n\nAt clinical review, patients are prescribed medication on repeat until their next scheduled review. The medications available for firstline prescription are enalapril, thiazide diuretic, and amlodipine. If blood pressure remains uncontrolled, then \u03b2or \u03b1-blockers and occasionally spironolactone are added. Medicines are dispensed for 28-day periods, and patients collect these from the onsite pharmacy. Patients on a stable regimen with a valid repeat prescription receive their monthly supply of medicines prepackaged from the Chronic Dispensing Unit, a centralized service through which the supplies are delivered to the clinic pharmacy 48 hours before a patient's scheduled collection date. Medicines not collected are returned to the Chronic Dispensing Unit 72 hours after the scheduled appointment. The trial protocol, including an outline of the statistical analysis plan, has previously been published.  10 e enrolled adults (\u226521 years of age) who had the following characteristics: diagnosed with hypertension by a clinician using local guidelines, prescribed blood pressure-lowering medication, and with a systolic blood pressure (SBP) <220 mm Hg and a diastolic blood pressure <120 mm Hg at enrollment. Eligible patients were attending the primary care clinic, resided in 1 of the 2 study communities, and had regular access to a mobile phone (and were able to send SMS text messages or could do so with help of a relative). We enrolled only 1 member per household. The following patients were excluded: those requiring specialist care for their hypertension at a hospital (in secondary care), women who self-reported being pregnant or within 3 months postpartum, and those with very high blood pressures (SBP >220 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure >120 mm Hg) who had symptoms suggestive of a hypertensive emergency or were otherwise acutely unwell (who were directly referred to the appropriate clinical service).\n\nClinic staff who measured the vital signs of all patients attending the chronic disease services for a clinical review identified potential participants. Trained research assistants assessed trial eligibility for patients who had agreed to be referred to the trial, and those eligible were enrolled. Participants received an SMS text message at the time of recruitment to confirm their enrollment in the trial. All participants were subsequently sent non-health-related messages at 6-week intervals.\n\nThe trial was approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee of the University of Cape Town (HREC UCT 418/2011), the Oxford Tropical Research Ethics Committee (OXTREC 03-12), and the Metro District Health Services, Western Cape (RP 141/2011). Trial conduct was overseen by a trial steering committee. All participants provided written informed consent, and the trial was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration of 2008."

      "text": "Trained research staff collected baseline data immediately before enrollment, and an independent administrator entered these data into a secure, Web-based randomization database implemented by the Primary Care Clinical Trials Unit in Oxford. A software algorithm assigned participants independently of the research team to information-only adherence support, interactive adherence support, or usual care in a 1:1:1 ratio using a nondeterministic minimization algorithm to ensure balance between groups with respect to age, sex, baseline SBP, years with hypertension, and recent clinic attendance.  11 Trial statisticians, researchers, clinic staff, and research assistants who collected outcome data were masked to allocated interventions until the trial database was locked. Researchers and clinicians were not aware of randomization assignment, were trained not to ask patients about the content of messages, and were unable to determine randomization group from casual comments by participants. Blood pressure measurements were automated, and data were captured directly to the trial database."

      "text": "All participants received written information about hypertension and healthy living and continued to receive care from the clinic. Personalized SMS text messages were sent to information-only message and interactive message group participants at weekly intervals at a time and in a language selected by the participant. We iteratively designed, developed, and tested 2 SMS text messaging-based interventions with clinical staff and patients with high blood pressure working and living in low-income communities around Cape Town.  12 he messages were designed to address a range of common issues with adherence to and persistence with treatment.  13 We developed a library of SMS text messages, which we mapped to a taxonomy of behavior change techniques (Table  I  in the online-only Data Supplement).  14 Most of the messages focused on the techniques of goals and planning, repetition and substitution, social support, and natural consequences. The SMS text messages used in the interventions were developed, translated, and tested in English, isiXhosa, and Afrikaans, the 3 languages most commonly spoken by people living in Cape Town.\n\nThe information-only adherence support group members were sent messages to motivate collecting and taking medicines and to provide education about hypertension and its treatment. Additional reminders were sent when medicines were ready for collection or for scheduled clinic appointments. All trial participants were given a phone number to contact the research team.\n\nParticipants allocated to the interactive adherence support received the same messages as the information-only group but could also respond to selected messages using free-to-user \"please call me\" requests. These generated an automated series of responses from the text message delivery system offering trial participants a number of options, including canceling or changing an appointment and changing the timing and language of the text messages.\n\nAll trial materials, including information sheets, consent forms, and the SMS text messages, were also developed, translated, and tested in English, isiXhosa, and Afrikaans.\n\nAll SMS text messages were delivered automatically via an opensource Web-based electronic medical record system (OpenMRS version 1.6.1, OpenMRS Ltd, Grandville, MI). All participant data were February 9, 2016 captured in the clinic and uploaded to OpenMRS with Sana Mobile (Sana, MIT, Cambridge, MA), an open-source Android platform.  10, 15 iming of messages relating to clinic appointments and medicine collection was facilitated by secure linkage to computerized appointment data.\n\nMessages were sent for 1 year from enrollment. Blood pressure measurements were collected from participants as they attended their routine clinic visits, but otherwise no additional measurements or interventions were carried out during the trial. Delivery of SMS text messages was automatically tracked, and if a message was undelivered, a research assistant blinded to group allocation contacted the number of a friend or relative to obtain a new mobile phone number. Table  II  in the online-only Data Supplement provides a structured description of the intervention and its development.  16 he primary clinical outcome was the change in mean SBP measured at baseline and 12 months with a validated oscillometric device,  10  adapted to record 6 sequential readings at 3-minute intervals. The mean blood pressure was calculated by discarding the initial reading and calculating the mean from the 5 remaining readings.  17 reatment adherence was assessed by calculating the proportion of days of medication covered, a proxy measure of adherence, from prescribing and dispensing data routinely recorded in the clinical record, pharmacy record, and Chronic Dispensing Unit record.  18, 19 hen there were discrepancies in data on dispensing, we used a computer-based algorithm blinded to randomized group to assign the status (dispensed/not dispensed) favoring any evidence that the medication had been dispensed. Proportion of days of medication covered was summarized as the proportion of patients with \u226580% of days covered with blood pressure-lowering medication on the basis of a systematic review providing evidence for the clinical importance of this threshold  5  and reported in 3-month intervals and over 12 months.\n\nAdditional secondary outcomes measured at 12 months, specified in the protocol,  10  were proportion of participants achieving a mean SBP <140 mm Hg and a mean diastolic blood pressure <90 mm Hg, health status measured with the EuroQol Group 5-Dimension Self-Report Questionnaire,  20  proportion of scheduled clinic appointments attended, retention in clinical care, satisfaction with clinic services and care, hospital admissions, self-reported adherence to medication (score range, 5-10),  21  and basic hypertension knowledge.  22 Data were also collected on the number and type of medication changes made during the trial and numbers of clinic visits by participants."

      "text": "The intended target sample size of 1215 participants, allowing 20% loss to follow-up (at least 405 in each group), was estimated to detect an absolute mean difference in SBP of 5 mm Hg (SD, 22 mm Hg; a clinically important reduction in the relative risk of stroke and coronary heart disease events)  23  at 12 months from baseline, with 90% power and 0.05 (2-sided) level of significance. All analyses were performed on an intention-to-treat basis.\n\nWe analyzed the 12-month primary outcome using a mixed-effect model for repeated measures including data available on all randomized patients attending follow-up visits at 6 and 12 months. The method has the advantage of implicitly accounting for the mechanism of data missing at random by using maximum likelihood. In the model, participant-specific intercepts were fitted with the use of random effects, and time and treatment were modeled with the use of fixed effects. An interaction term between time and randomized group was also included so that possible differences in treatment effect (informational versus usual care and interactive versus usual care) could be assessed at each time point. The model was adjusted for baseline SBP and minimization factors.\n\nBlood pressure thresholds were analyzed with mixed-effect logistic regression models, and treatment adherence was analyzed with multiple logistic regression. Secondary outcomes involving categorical data were analyzed by use of \u03c7 2 tests and generalized linear models adjusted for minimization factors. Other continuous secondary outcomes were analyzed with ANCOVA or nonparametric methods if the normality assumption was not satisfied. A statistical test of interaction was done to assess whether treatment effect was consistent across the prespecified subgroups of SBP (<140 or \u2265140 mm Hg), age (<55 or \u226555 years), sex (male or female), number of years with hypertension (<10 or \u226510 years), presence of \u22651 comorbid conditions, and self-reported adherence at baseline (<80% or \u226580%).  24  detailed statistical analysis plan was completed before the trial database was locked (to prevent any further changes before analysis), and the trial allocation was disclosed.  25 A statistical analysis report was prepared in line with Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trial (CONSORT) 2010 statements. No interim analysis was performed.\n\nThe content of the information-only and the interactive adherence support interventions was examined in the preparatory work for the trial (see the expanded Methods in the online-only Data Supplement for further details). The 2 interventions were considered to be distinct treatments and therefore did not require adjustment for multiple comparisons.  [26] [27] 7] [28]  All statistical tests were 2 sided, and values of P\u22640.05 were considered to indicate statistical significance.  26  The trial was registered with the South African National Clinical Trials Register (SANCTR DOH-27-1212-386) before recruitment began. This registration was subsequently incorporated within the Pan African Trial Register (PACTR201411000724141), and we registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02019823) at the time of publishing the protocol to ensure that details were widely available."

Figure  1  summarizes recruitment and followup of participants. Attrition rates did not differ significantly between groups, and those randomized were broadly similar to those screened but not randomized, although more were black (Table III in the online-only Data Supplement).\n\nTable  1  summarizes the baseline characteristics of participants. Mean age was 54.3 years (SD, 11.5 years), and 28% had at least 10 years of hypertension. More than half of the patients had a body mass index of at least 30 kg/m 2 . Other baseline characteristics were similar across the 3 groups. Nearly all the participants owned their own phone (Table IV in the onlineonly Data Supplement). Overall, 176 patients (12.8%) did not have an SBP measurement at 12 months. Not having SBP data at 12 months was associated with being female (P=0.03), having a body mass index <30 kg/m 2 (P=0.002), or having hypertension for <10 years at enrollment (P=0.002). We sent 40 333 SMS text messages to participants in the information-only message group, 41 450 to those in the interactive message group, and 8277 to those receiving usual care. Of the messages sent, 5.5% had a \"failed delivery\" response. In addition, 3477 messages were not sent as planned because of technical errors. A total of 230 participants (50.2%) allocated to the interactive adherence support group responded to a message at some point in the trial; in total, 630 reply messages were sent by participants. There were 1231 visits by participants in the interactive group, 1109 by those in the information-only group, and 1093 by participants in the usual care group. One additional blood pressure-lowering medication was started by 44% of trial participants, and for this group, the median number of changes made was 2 (quartiles 1 and 3, 1 and 3).

The trial was not powered to identify the observed difference in SBP observed between groups, although our sample size calculation was based on the effect sizes found in published trials of other behavioral interventions to support adherence to treatments for high blood pressure.  32 In addition, the measure of adherence used reflects only dispensing in the clinic, not the act of taking medication.\n\nTargeting a group of people diagnosed with hypertension rather than those with a diagnosis of poorly controlled pressure may have also limited the extent to which improvements in blood pressure were possible. However, we could not reliably predict those with poor control as a result of poor adherence, nor could we identify when nonadherence might take place in a previously adherent patient. Our decision not to target nonadherent patients was informed by formative work in which we identified the possibility that nonadherence could start at any time and by patient feedback that SMS messages targeted at people who were nonadherent might reduce their acceptability."

Both trial interventions in StAR were delivered with similar fidelity to the trial protocol. Slightly more SMS text messages were sent in the interactive intervention group compared with the information-only group because of a small number of additional follow-up messages. Fifty percent of participants allocated to the interactive intervention responded, whereas in comparison, 38.5% of participants in a smoking cessation trial sent unprompted SMS texts requesting support.  36 In a trial of weekly interactive SMS text messages to support treatment adherence among HIV-infected people initiating antiretroviral treatment, 68% of participants responded, with nonresponders receiving a phone call from a healthcare worker.  8 he effect size observed on SBP was smaller than anticipated, particularly because the impact on treatment adherence was similar to that reported by others. 9,35 However, those taking additional medication and achieving a lower blood pressure through better adherence may have been only a small proportion of participants. A smaller standard deviation for SBP, the greater follow-up of participants than anticipated, and the use of a mixed model for analysis all may have contributed to the detection of a difference smaller than originally anticipated.\n\nResults from a recent systematic review of interventions delivered via SMS text message to support adherence to antiretroviral therapy suggest that the dose-response relationship for SMS text message frequency, if it exists, may not be linear, although counterintuitively, daily SMS text messages were less effective than weekly messages.  35 More research is needed to identify the optimal frequency for SMS text messages to support treatment adherence.\n\nThe decrease in blood pressure observed in all participants at 6 months may be attributable to seasonal variation in blood pressure.  37 However, this finding should be interpreted with caution because 6-month data were intended to supplement the multilevel modeling of the primary outcome when available and were collected for only a small proportion of participants."

      "text": "This trial has demonstrated that a behavioral intervention to support adherence to blood pressure treatment delivered via SMS text message can improve adherence and may modestly decrease blood pressure at 12 months. The delivery of predefined messages can be achieved by an automated system consistently and without the need for additional training programs for clinical staff. The optimal frequency of the different categories of text messages; the incremental costs of modifying messages so that they remain effective; and the wider implementation of these messages in different communities, for different long-term conditions, and for patients with multiple conditions need further study."
