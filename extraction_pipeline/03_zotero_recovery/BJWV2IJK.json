  "title": "Assessing the Clinical Robustness of Digital Health Startups: Cross-sectional Observational Analysis",
  "abstract": "Background: The digital health sector has experienced rapid growth over the past decade. However, health care technology stakeholders lack a comprehensive understanding of clinical robustness and claims across the industry. Objective: This analysis aimed to examine the clinical robustness and public claims made by digital health companies. \n Methods: A cross-sectional observational analysis was conducted using company data from the Rock Health Digital Health Venture Funding Database, the US Food and Drug Administration, and the US National Library of Medicine. Companies were included if they sell products targeting the prevention, diagnosis, or treatment phases of the care continuum. Clinical robustness was defined using regulatory filings and clinical trials completed by each company. Public claims data included clinical, economic, and engagement claims regarding product outcomes made by each company on its website. Results: A total of 224 digital health companies with an average age of 7.7 years were included in our cohort. Average clinical robustness was 2.5 (1.8 clinical trials and 0.8 regulatory filings) with a median score of 1. Ninety-eight (44%) companies had a clinical robustness score of 0, while 45 (20%) companies had a clinical robustness score of 5 or more. The average number of public claims was 1.3 (0.5 clinical, 0.4 economic, and 0.4 engagement); the median number of claims was 1. No correlation was observed between clinical robustness and number of clinical claims (r 2 =0.02), clinical robustness and total funding (r 2 =0.08), or clinical robustness and company age (r 2 =0.18). \n Conclusions: Many digital health companies have a low level of clinical robustness and do not make many claims as measured by regulatory filings, clinical trials, and public data shared online. Companies and customers may benefit from investing in greater clinical validation efforts.",

There are more than 1900 digital health startup companies in the United States that have raised more than US $2 million in venture funding, which in total have raised more than US $77 billion in venture capital funding since 2011  [3] .\n\nAlthough growth is apparent, the ability to measure impact is not.

In addition, there is evidence that some claims made by digital health companies have been misleading  [10] [11] [12] , with a few highly publicized cases resulting in legal action by the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general  [13] [14] [15] . Most studies focusing on clinical impact are narrowly defined to specific clinical therapeutic areas (eg, diabetes, cardiac arrhythmia), making it difficult to extrapolate findings to the broader field of digital health  [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] . Additional limitations include a small sample of companies and the use of publications as a proxy for clinical impact. Other studies in digital health have examined larger clinical trends, such as growth in clinical trials, but these often lack data on clinical and customer focus  [23, 24] .\n\nAs a result, the literature is often too narrow or too broad to enable an understanding of clinical impact. In addition, no studies have examined both clinical rigor and public claims made by companies. To address these limitations, we sought to comprehensively examine the topic of clinical robustness in digital health companies by using a more comprehensive definition of clinical rigor and examining companies' public claims across the most in-depth database of US-based digital health companies. These findings provide additional context for all stakeholders in health technology that rely on a more accurate characterization of digital health solutions."

    {
      "title": "Principal Findings",
      "text": "Our findings indicate that many venture-backed startups in digital health have limited clinical robustness as measured by regulatory filings and clinical trials. There was, however, a sizable minority (20%) that had a score of 5 or more, suggesting a small population of rigorously tested solutions (Table  2 ). Although this subpopulation may portend progress, the lack of meaningful clinical validation for nearly half of digital health companies (44% had a clinical robustness score of 0) highlighted a major gap in health care technology today. The lack of overall correlation between a company's total venture funding and its clinical robustness score similarly highlighted a significant asymmetry in how companies are potentially valued in today's marketplace (ie, no correlation between clinical impact and funding) (Figure  2 ). However, it is possible that funding amounts reflect future anticipated value rather than current value  [30] .\n\nAlthough average clinical robustness was quite low across the population, there was significant variation across clinical areas (eg, high in cardiovascular and nephrology and low in oncology and primary care) (Figure  3 ). This may reflect the varying levels of technological maturity of digital health solutions across clinical disciplines. Prior literature points to significant differences in technological maturity between well-funded clinical areas such as diabetes  [27]  and less well-funded areas such as reproductive and maternal health  [31] .\n\nThe average and median number of all claims was also low. These findings indicated that digital health companies largely did not share outcomes publicly. This may have reflected a desire to keep this data private, but more likely represented a lack of meaningful analyses of any impact (clinical, economic, or engagement) since this data could be used as a competitive differentiator if shared publicly. Separately, we identified 32 companies that had one or more clinical claims and a clinical robustness score of 0. These findings may suggest a disconnect between marketing and evidence. Additional future research could examine the links between public claims and clinical trials or regulatory filings (ie, are individual claims directly supported by clinical trials or regulatory filings?). Companies that sold to employers made more claims and had higher clinical robustness scores compared to other customer types (Figure  1 ). This may suggest that this customer base is currently the most competitive and/or has the highest entry standards, despite accounting for a relatively small percentage (<12%) of companies in the sample. A competitive employer market for digital health tools is unsurprising given the rising cost burden of health care on employers  [32]  and evidence that employers are increasingly offering digital health benefits to improve health outcomes  [33, 34]  and contain health care costs  [35, 36] ."
    },
    {
      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "Our definition of clinical robustness was limited to clinical trials and regulatory findings, which remain proxies for effectiveness and require companies to register their activities. However, we believe these elements offer a better estimation of clinical rigor than publications, which can lag in timing and may not always relate to clinical outcomes. We chose to focus on clinical trials and regulatory filings because they were publicly available data and are generally undertaken to demonstrate an impact on clinical outcomes. Our approach to measuring clinical robustness equally accounts for clinical trials that demonstrate a technology does and does not work. Additionally, our data collection methodology could have missed clinical trials that were not registered on ClinicalTrials.gov or regulatory filings that were submitted to the FDA under an individual's name rather than the company name (both scenarios are atypical). Future research could incorporate condition-or disease-specific metrics of effectiveness that are then standardized across clinical areas to provide a more accurate measure of clinical impact.\n\nIn addition, our cohort only included venture-backed companies above US $2 million in funding. This may have resulted in selection bias by excluding both ends of the spectrum (ie, not including earlier stage companies or large conglomerate technology companies). Although our population excludes these companies, we believe that our sample represents the most comprehensive assessment of outcomes or claims across the digital health landscape and encompasses the majority of funded companies and activity in this space. As a point of reference, the average seed stage deal size in 2021 was US $3.5 million, 75% higher than our minimum funding threshold  [37] ."
