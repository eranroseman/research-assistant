  "title": "Effectiveness of text messaging interventions for the management of depression: A systematic review and meta-analysis",
  "abstract": "Introduction: Depression is a leading cause of human disability. Telemedicine-based interventions using text messaging are currently being trialled for the management of community-based clients with clinical depression. However, little is known about the effectiveness of such methods. Methods: We searched the databases PubMed, Embase, Informit, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, PsycINFO and Scopus for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published between January 2000 and April 2019. Studies comparing text messaging interventions to a comparator group for patients with depression were included in the review. Articles were assessed for quality using the Joanna Briggs Institute critical appraisal checklist for RCTs. Results: Nine RCTs (945 patients: 764 adults and 181 adolescents) were included in the systematic review. Five studies used text messaging as the only intervention, whilst the remaining combined text messaging with other treatment modalities such as behavioural activation or cognitive behavioural therapy. A meta-analysis was conducted on seven selected RCTs (845 patients: 664 adults and 181 adolescents). The standardised mean reduction in depression due to text messaging interventions was 0.23 (95% confidence interval: -0.02 to 0.48). There was evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effect between studies. Discussion: There is marginal evidence supporting text messaging interventions as an effective treatment modality for people living with clinical depression. However, further research is needed to determine how best to utilise textmessage interventions alongside other conventional forms of health services delivery.",

      "text": "Depression is a common mental health disorder with a 12-month prevalence of 6.2% amongst the Australian population.  1  Globally, it is the most prevalent cause of disability, with the highest proportion (30%) of years lived with disability.  2  Mental health services incur significant costs to health systems. Australia spent approximately AUD$9.1b for providing mental health services during the 2016-2017 period,  1  and it is estimated to rise six-fold over the next 30 years.  3  Depression accounts for 12% of total mental health treatment cost,  4  and it is the most common mental health problem encountered in the primary care setting.  5 Furthermore, depression is the leading cause of death by suicide worldwide.  6 Regardless of the scale and extent of this disease, the level of available health services to people with depression is limited due to the availability of mental health services, expertise, cost and geographical barriers.  7 Reluctance of people to seek health services due to stigma and prejudices is also an important reason for the lack of access to health services to this patient group.  8, 9 vidence accumulated over the last three decades suggests that telemedicine can improve access to mental health services.  10 It is generally accepted that mental health (telemental health) is one of the most mature branches in telemedicine. Studies have shown that video-based consultations can be effectively used to provide remote mental health consultations.  [11] [12] ] [13]  With the increased use of smartphones and other mobile devices, research has attempted to understand the value of other functionalities of such technologies. Text messaging is one such feature that has become one of the most pervasive and effective methods of communication in the modern world. It is estimated that eight trillion text messages are exchanged each day, globally.  14 Short message services (SMS), or simply 'text messages', is the most frequently used interpersonal mobile communication method in the world.  15 It involves the exchange of alphabetic and numeric characters between two or more mobile devices.  16 It is estimated that more than eight billion mobile telephone subscriptions are available across the world, of which over 80% are in low-or middle-income countries.  17 At the beginning of 2019, the number of mobile network connections exceeded the total population of the world (7.7 billion).  18 he effectiveness of telemedicine modalities using videoconferencing and mobile app interventions for the management of depression  [19] [20] [21] [22]  have been assessed. A strong body of evidence supports the notion that text messaging has been effective in some health issues such as smoking cessation.  23, 24 . However, little is known about the effectiveness of text messaging interventions for the management of depression. This study evaluates the effectiveness of text messaging interventions for the management of depression."

      "text": "We searched for randomised controlled trials (RCTs) published in English from January 2000 to April 2019 in PubMed, PsyINFO, Scopus, Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Informit. A combination of relevant MeSH and Emtree terms and keywords were used relating to text messaging interventions for the management of depression. The search syntax used was ('text message OR mobile phone OR SMS' AND 'depression'). The reference management software EndNote version X8 was used to manage identified articles.\n\nStudies with patients who had been diagnosed with depression or depressive symptoms using any recognised diagnostic instrument (Beck Depression Inventory, Patient Health Questionnaire-9, etc.) were included as study participants. Studies with patients over 13 years of age (adolescents and adults) were included in this review. Study protocols and studies that did not identify depression as the main measurable outcome or did not include text messaging intervention were excluded. Change in depression score from baseline to the end of intervention follow-up, measured using any recognised diagnostic tool, was identified as the main outcome.\n\nThe titles and abstracts of the studies retrieved using the search syntax were screened independently by two authors (BS and SE) to identify potential studies for review. The full texts of eligible studies were independently assessed by BS and SE. Disagreements between reviewers were resolved by consensus or by consulting a third reviewer (SW). The quality of evidence of the included studies was assessed using the Joanna Briggs Institute Critical Appraisal Checklist for RCTs.  25 eta-analysis was conducted using the effect size for depression, expressed as standard mean differences, and their 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated using the average standard deviation of the outcome in the groups at baseline. Studies were pooled using a random-effects model meta-analysis using the userwritten 'metan' command in Stata 15. Heterogeneity in effect sizes was measured using I 2 (I 2 > 75% or high, identified as significant heterogeneity) and a p-value was calculated (testing the null hypothesis that each study measured the same effect size).  26"

      "text": "The search strategy identified 1121 articles, of which nine RCTs conducted between 2012 and 2019 met the criteria for review (see Table  1 ). The search process is depicted in a PRISMA flow chart (see Figure  1 ).\n\nThe majority of the included studies were published after 2015 (n \u00bc 8). Sample sizes for the included studies ranged between 54  27  and 226.  28 The overall review included 945 patients with depression: 764 adults and 181 adolescents. Most studies were conducted in the USA (n \u00bc 4), followed by Germany (n \u00bc 2). Seven studies had reported on adults with depression or depressive symptoms, whilst the rest (n \u00bc 2) represented adolescents aged between 13 and 17 years of age. All studies had a follow-up period ranging between one and six months, and most of them (n \u00bc 8) had a monitoring phase of between six weeks and three months.\n\nSeven studies indicated better depression symptoms with text messaging, whilst two studies did not.  28, 29 he majority of studies (n \u00bc 8) were conducted in developed countries.\n\nFive studies used text messaging as the only intervention (with usual care or comparator group), whilst the remaining four studies used text messaging in combination with other treatment modalities such as behavioural activation, cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), book therapy and telephone conversations. Text messages were used for various purposes: therapeutic, motivational and supportive (the characteristics of the text messages are presented in Table  2 ). Messages with therapeutic emphasis were created using the theoretical bases of behavioural activation (with specific emphasis on action plans and coping plans),  30  and CBT.  29, 31, 32 Motivational messages were designed to promote the desire or willingness to achieve a specific goal or target.  30, 33 upportive messages were developed to provide an additional helping hand during difficult times to minimise stress/anger (emotional regulation),  28, 29  improve mental well-being by abating stress,  27, 34  promote medication adherence  27  and to remind participant goals.  35 lthough the frequency of message varied considerably within the studies (from 4-5 messages per day to one message per week), most studies have sent daily or twice-daily text messages. Three studies have sent text messages at a fixed time (scheduled) and two studies have given the option to participants to select the preferred time to receive the messages. Two studies used tailored text messaging according to the participant characteristics,  28, 29  while one study sent tailored messages according to the patient's mood rating.  36 Five studies allowed feedback from patients, while the rest (n \u00bc 4) were not given the opportunity to provide feedback.\n\nQuality of evidence (using the Joanna Briggs Institute protocol for RCTs) showed four studies being categorised as 'good', four as moderate and one study as poor (Table  3 ). The latter had not performed randomisation, allocation concealment or blinding.  36 The study identified as poor also had the highest attrition rate (60%) of patients during the study period. The attrition rate of other studies varied between 0% and 36%. Four studies had 'treatment as usual' control groups  27, 29, 31, 34, 35  and the rest (n \u00bc 5) used comparator groups.  28, 30, 32, 33, 36 In all studies, effectiveness was measured using clinical outcomes, although a variety of validated scales were used. The most commonly used tool (n \u00bc 5) was the Beck Depression Inventory II. For the forest plot, we used the combined intervention vs control effect, which we estimated to be -2.22 (SE 1.6)."

      "text": "Two studies were excluded from the selected nine RCTs for the meta-analysis (845 patients: 664 adults and 181 adolescents). The reasons for exclusion were the heterogeneity in the study population, intervention or comparison group and poor outcome measures. The RCT identified as having poor quality with high attrition rate  36  and the study comparing two textmessaging-based interventions not reflecting the unique impact of the text messaging interventions  30  were excluded. All seven remaining studies were weighted fairly equally (9-21%) in the meta-analysis (Figure  2 ). The meta-analysis revealed a borderline statistically significant reduction due to text messaging (standardised mean difference of -0.23 (95% CI: -0.48 to 0.02, p \u00bc 0.07).

      "text": "Several previous reviews have evaluated the evidence relating to the use of telephone-based interventions for managing mental health issues. Studies showed that telephone-based therapy (psychotherapy) was more effective than conventional treatment (face-to face therapy) in reducing the symptoms of depression.  37, 38 Another study disclosed that text messaging, in addition to telephone-based psychotherapy, was not providing conclusive evidence of reducing depressive symptoms.  39 However, our study showed that text messaging does benefit patients with depression, demonstrating fresh initial evidence in assessing the effectiveness of text messaging for the management of depression. Kobak et al. (2015) 35 Van den Berg et al.

In the therapeutic context, text messages were targeted to improve mood using cognitive behavioural techniques. Patients who received text messages felt more engaged and these messages have helped them to practice these skills (CBT) throughout the treatment period in their own homes.  40 Text messages kept the patients 'on track' with treatment schedules and improved treatment adherence.  41 In the supportive context, text messaging is used to reinforce support systems, minimise daily stressors and uplift mental well-being. This study showed that supportive text messaging is used to enhance treatment adherence and to improve general psychosocial well-being. A review conducted by Ogrodniczuk et al.  42  presented similar findings that text messaging minimises the premature termination of psychotherapy. Motivational messages were designed to achieve self-confidence and focus on self-accomplishments. Studies using motivational text messaging have shown promising results in achieving weight loss  43  and smoking cessation.  44 These messages were designed and used to encourage patients to set goals and work according to an agreed plan of action. However, this study did not show any improvement in depression outcome with motivational messages. This may be due to the fact that motivational messages are highly subjective and varied drastically according to individual personal characteristics. Apart from that, this difference could be explained according to the diversity of message frequency, content, duration and feedback response. This clearly shows that although tele-psychiatry is a principal subdivision of telemedicine, with solid evidence of its effectiveness,  21, 45  the evidence is still emerging and not conclusive for text messaging as an intervention for depression.\n\nIt is worth noting that most of the trials were conducted in developed countries, and its applicability in developing countries has not been extensively studied. Since text messaging interventions are more useful (low costs, effective and simple) for developing countries with high disease burdens and low health budgets, more research should be conducted in low-resource settings to bridge this knowledge gap. The intervention dropout rates were less than 36% among all studies selected for the meta-analysis. This was comparatively low compared to other similar studies where the dropout rate ranged between 1% and 50%.  21, 46 This shows that text messaging interventions are appealing to people and have effective adherence.\n\nThe strengths of this study are that this is a properly conducted systematic review adhering to PRISMA methodology and guidelines with appropriate study selection; all studies were randomised control trials (with low risk of bias for participant randomisation and increased internal validity) with low attrition rates and were analysed according to randomisation. There were some limitations concerning the primary studies. There was a diverse range of text messaging interventions, duration, population and control groups, and outcome measures. There was some statistical evidence of heterogeneity in treatment effect between studies; large effects were seen in two trials by Agyapong et al.,  27, 31  where patients had more severe depression than most of the other trials. Another limitation is the inclusion of both adults and adolescents as study participants. We have assumed that both groups were similar in the way they accessed text messages; hence, inclusion is justified, though treatment modalities would entail different methods. There is a possibility of publication bias where negative results (text messaging has no benefit to managing depression) may have not been published. Our research included studies published only in English and we may have excluded some important studies conducted and published in non-English-speaking countries."

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "Telemedicine-based interventions are useful in providing health services to people with depression by overcoming some of the traditional obstacles to providing health services. Text messaging is promising due to its versatility, non-invasive nature and increased use in a variety of locations around the world where the routine telehealth modalities cannot be used (Internet, email, mobile apps). There is marginal evidence to support the use of text messaging interventions as an effective treatment modality for people living with depression. However, further high-quality research in this field is required to explore the clinical and cost-effectiveness of text messaging as a strategy to reduce inequality and improve access to mental health support services."
