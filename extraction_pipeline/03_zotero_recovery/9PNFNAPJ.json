  "title": "Website-Delivered Physical Activity Interventions A Review of the Literature",
  "abstract": "Background: Evidence-based physical activity interventions that can be delivered to large numbers of adults at an acceptable cost are a public health priority; website-delivered programs have this potential. The purpose of this study was to systematically review the research findings and outcomes of website-delivered physical activity interventions and to identify relationships of intervention attributes with behavioral outcomes. \n Methods: A structured search of PubMed, Medline, PsycInfo, and Web of Science was conducted for intervention studies published up to July 2006. Studies included in the review were those that (1) used websites or e-mail, (2) had physical activity behavior as an outcome measure, (3) had randomized controlled or quasi-experimental designs, (4) targeted adults, and (5) were published in English. \n Results: Of the fifteen studies reviewed, improvement in physical activity was reported in eight. Better outcomes were identified when interventions had more than five contacts with participants and when the time to follow-up was short (\u05453 months; 60% positive outcomes), compared to medium-term (3-6 months, 50%) and long-term (\u03fe6 months, 40%) follow-up. There were no clear associations of outcomes with other intervention attributes. Conclusions: A little over half of the controlled trials of website-delivered physical activity interventions have reported positive behavioral outcomes. However, intervention effects were short lived, and there was limited evidence of maintenance of physical activity changes. Research is needed to identify elements that can improve behavioral outcomes, the maintenance of change and the engagement and retention of participants; larger and more representative study samples are also needed.",

      "text": "egular physical activity decreases the risk of developing cardiovascular disease, diabetes, some cancers, obesity, osteoporosis, and other chronic conditions.  1  Public health guidelines for adults recommend participating in at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity physical activity on 5 or more days of the week.  2  However, the proportion of the adult population meeting these guidelines is less than 50% in many industrialized countries.  1, [3] [4] 4] [5] [6]  Thus, finding effective population-based intervention strategies to promote physical activity is a key challenge.\n\nThe Internet holds promise for wide-scale promotion of physical activity behavior change. Website-delivered interventions have a potentially broad population reach with availability 24 hours per day and widespread accessibility,  7, 8  they have the potential to be hosted and promoted through state health agencies and nongovernmental organizations,  7  and they are potentially costeffective.  8 In many industrialized countries, Internet access is greater than 50% and is increasing.  9 Internet users are becoming more representative of the overall population, with users including more women, older adults, and people with low levels of educational attainment.  10, 11 The Internet is identified as an important source of health information by more than half of its users, and may thus be an appropriate delivery medium for health behavior change interventions.  12 ebsite-delivered physical activity interventions have the potential to overcome many of the barriers associated with traditional face-to-face exercise counseling or group-based physical activity programs. An Internet user can seek advice at any time, any place, and often at a lower cost compared with other delivery modalities.  13 lthough there may be many advantages of using the Internet for delivering health behavior change programs, to reach their public health potential, websitedelivered physical activity interventions must first dem-onstrate feasibility and efficacy through rigorous scientific testing.\n\nIn 2000, the American Journal of Preventive Medicine published a set of articles that identified the potential of interactive health communications, including Internet and website-delivered interventions, for improving health behaviors.  14 -17 At that time, there was little empirical literature to support these optimistic predictions. Since then, a wide range of studies evaluating website-delivered health behavior interventions have been reported. Several reviews have examined Internet or website-delivered health behavior change interventions;  13,18 -21  however, none have specifically focused on physical activity. A systematic review of study outcomes for website-delivered physical activity interventions is thus timely. Three questions will be addressed: (1) What is the efficacy of website-delivered physical activity interventions? (2) Are there specific intervention elements that influence efficacy? (3) How well are participants engaged and retained? Answers to these questions inform an evaluation of the state of the evidence and are used to formulate guidelines and recommendations for future research."

However, when there was a significant increase in physical activity in all groups, but no significant differences between groups, this was also coded as a positive outcome, but only when different intervention delivery modes were compared to each other (not for studies in which there was a no-intervention control group).\n\nTo allow for comparison across studies, effect sizes were calculated according to Cohen's formula.  28 However, they were only reported when significant differences between intervention groups were found and when the data reported allowed their calculation. Effect sizes were interpreted according to Cohen's guidelines: 28 \u03fd0.5 for a small effect size, 0.5-0.8 for a medium effect size, and \u03fe0.8 for a large effect size."

The total number of participants across the 15 studies was 4845; the number of participants across the studies ranged from 13 to 2121, with seven studies having fewer than 100 participants. All but one trial  43  reported higher rates of female than male participation; overall, 3011 (66%) of participants were women. In all studies, the level of educational attainment of participants was high; in total, 84% of participants had a college or university education. Most interventions targeted an increase in total physical activity as an outcome, although some specifically targeted walking, moderate physical activity, vigorous physical activity, or meeting physical activity guidelines. Seven studies intervened on physical activity only, whereas eight studies also addressed other behaviors, most commonly dietary behaviors. Eight interventions had additional components that were not websitedelivered. Nine studies explicitly based their intervention on one or more health behavior theories; the most common were Social Cognitive Theory 47 (n\u03ed3), the Transtheoretical Model 27 (n\u03ed6), and the Theory of Planned Behavior 48 (n\u03ed2).\n\nMethodology. Fourteen studies were randomized controlled trials, and one study was a cluster nonrandomized controlled trial.  46 Four studies recruited a true no-intervention control group,  32, 35, 39, 41  whereas the majority compared a website-delivered intervention to another intervention. Four studies used a different delivery mode (such as print materials or face-to-face counseling) as the control or comparison condition.  31, 33, 34, 37 Seven studies used a standard or lowintensity website-delivered intervention as the compar-ison.  29, 38, [42] [43] 3] [44] [45] [46]  Four studies reported the use of computer sampling to randomize participants.  11, 37, 38, 45 ne study reported that research staff were blind to participants' treatment condition.  37 All studies reported on attrition, and ten reported on participation rate. The use of validated instruments to measure physical activity was reported in all but one study.  46 Six studies used intention-to-treat analysis to account for high attrition,  33, 34, 37, [43] [44] [45]  and six studies reported power calculations.  31, 34, 37, 41, 44, 46"

With regard to the impact of websitedelivered interventions on the maintenance of physical activity behavior change, it is important to evaluate the time of physical activity measurement relative to the length of the intervention.

When it was measured immediately after the end of the intervention, five of twelve studies showed positive outcomes (42%).

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "This systematic review found modest evidence for the efficacy of website-delivered physical activity interventions, with a little over half of the studies reporting significant positive behavioral changes. However, the effect sizes for studies that found positive outcomes were small, and the intervention effects were mostly short lived. There was a clear decrease in efficacy when time to follow-up increased, with studies that had longer follow-ups being associated with less positive outcomes. However, among the handful of studies measuring maintenance of physical activity following the end of the intervention, there was some suggestion of maintenance of outcomes, with three of five studies showing positive outcomes.\n\nWhen evaluating specific intervention elements, the number of contacts with participants was the only factor associated with efficacious outcomes. Interventions with greater than five communications, such as via e-mail, discussion boards, chat sessions, or online coaches demonstrated more positive changes in physical activity than those with five or fewer contacts. This is not surprising, as it is reported in the health behavior change literature that efficacy increases when intervention intensity increases.  49, 50 However, this has also been reported with regard to the duration of the intervention  51  -an observation that could not be confirmed in this review. There seemed to be no clear relationship between the duration of the intervention and outcomes. Interventions shorter than 3 months did relatively well; five of eight had positive outcomes. The lower efficacy rates for interventions longer than 3 months might be explained by the strong decline in website usage over the course of the intervention, as discussed in the information to follow.\n\nOnly five of the fifteen studies reported objective data on website usage. These studies used electronic databases linked to the website-delivered program to monitor \"hits\" and the time that participants spent interacting with the intervention materials. They all reported low website usage and a decline in use as the intervention progressed. From this, and in combination with the overall high levels of attrition and the modest medium-and long-term outcomes of the studies evaluated, it can be concluded, as has been argued previously,  13, 26  that engagement and retention of participants in website-delivered physical activity interventions is challenging. Within this context, it is encouraging that the shorter-term interventions showed good results; short and effective interventions are needed where engagement and retention of participants in longerlasting interventions appears to be difficult. However, to increase the long-term efficacy of website-delivered interventions and to produce true maintenance of physical activity behavior change, methods to increase website use and exposure to intervention materials and subsequently increase engagement and retention of participants need to be developed. This is emphasized by the fact that stronger intervention effects were found within subgroups of participants that used the website more and thus had more exposure to intervention materials.  44 However, it is possible that only those participants that were very motivated to increase their physical activity were willing to keep using the websitedelivered intervention and therefore had better outcomes. Nevertheless, gathering objective data on website usage is technically possible and is an important indicator of intervention effectiveness that should be used in all future trials.\n\nIncreasing the interactivity of these interventions, to enhance engagement and retention of participants, has been the most consistent recommendation made in the literature.  13, 26, 39, 52, 53 However, the results of this review do not indicate that this alone will be sufficient to increase intervention effectiveness. The majority of studies evaluated (n\u03ed13) already used several interactive elements in their interventions. Most studies also used e-mail (n\u03ed11) and had some form of periodic contact with participants (n\u03ed12). Nevertheless, engage-ment and retention of participants in these studies was low.\n\nIt has also been suggested that using a form of computer tailoring that is embedded in the websitedelivered intervention might increase interactivity and in turn enhance participant retention and outcomes.  8, 54 In using computer tailoring, an online questionnaire is linked to scoring algorithms that allow participants to be provided with immediate and personally relevant feedback about their health behavior, plus individually adapted tips and suggestions on how to change.  22, 55 Four studies evaluated this technique and two found positive results. However, given the small numbers of studies, it is difficult to draw any conclusions about the use of computer tailoring, other than that it is a potential strategy to increase efficacy of website-delivered interventions that need to be further explored.\n\nIf it appears that incorporating interactive elements in website-delivered interventions is not enough to engage and retain participants, what then may be the main source of difference between those studies that found positive outcomes and those that did not? To examine this question, an attempt to evaluate the method of interaction (active or passive) used by the interventions and to determine whether they used behavioral modification techniques was made. It was hypothesized that interventions that stimulate action and use behavior modification techniques might be more effective in engaging and retaining participants. However, as previously mentioned, it was impossible to classify the studies into such distinct categories. Direct comparisons of specific intervention elements are thus needed to determine which are effective and to help build the evidence base necessary to inform future website-delivered interventions.\n\nThe findings of this review indicate that programs without a face-to-face contact with participants at the beginning of the intervention are as effective as those that have an initial face-to-face contact. This might be explained by the absence of actual behavioral counseling in those initial contacts. This observation has important implications for the implementation of websitedelivered interventions, as their reach would be greatly extended if face-to-face contact was not necessary. Intervening on multiple health behaviors simultaneously also did not seem to influence physical activity outcomes negatively, when compared with studies that intervened on physical activity only. Website programs provide opportunities to test the hypothesis that change in one behavioral risk factor might serve as a stimulus or \"gateway\" for change in other health behaviors and might create additive or synergistic intervention effects.  56, 57 lthough the Internet is increasingly used by people with lower educational attainment,  11  this is clearly not yet reflected in the samples recruited in the studies reviewed (84% of all participants were college or university educated); this limits the generalizability of findings for those who are less well educated. Similarly, not using intention-to-treat analysis might introduce bias into the results; only six studies used intention-totreat analysis, and attrition was high in most studies (20% or higher in nine studies). Seven studies had less than 100 participants, and some of those might not have been adequately powered to find the differences in physical activity levels between the groups that they were examining. Further, it has been reported that men make more use of the Internet compared with women; 58 however, this is in contrast with the overrepresentation of women in the intervention trials reviewed. Finally, some website-delivered interventions that were not effective for increasing physical activity might not have been published, which introduces potential bias into the results of this review, as it depends entirely on published studies.\n\nBased on this review, it is recommended that future website-delivered physical activity studies/interventions:\n\n1. Study more representative populations, particularly by including men and participants with lower levels of educational attainment. 2. Use larger sample sizes that provide greater statistical power to detect intervention effects on physical activity and enable long-term follow-up. 3. Present data with and without intention-to-treat analysis and report on differential attrition, as attrition tends to be high in website-delivered trials. 4. Measure physical activity at least 6 months after the end of the intervention in order to capture true maintenance of behavior change. 5. Use objective measures of website usage that capture true implementation and exposure to intervention materials. 6. Make direct comparisons of particular intervention elements to allow for distinguishing effective from ineffective intervention components. 7. Explore the optimal duration and intensity of interventions; results from this review suggest that at least five contacts with participants are needed, however, it is unclear what optimal duration should be, given the decrease in engagement and retention as the intervention progresses."

      "text": "Research on website-delivered physical activity interventions is still at an early stage of development, and although progress has been made, and several studies show promising results, much remains to be learned about optimizing and enhancing these interventions to increase their efficacy. Intervening to influence physical activity over the Internet does not appear to be as straightforward as earlier optimistic predictions had suggested. However, this review suggests that the Internet still holds potential for delivering effective physical activity interventions to large populations. Research on specific intervention elements is needed to understand how best to use websites and other Internet-related communication technology as delivery methods for physical activity interventions.\n\nNo financial conflict of interest was reported by the authors of this paper."
