  "title": "Peer and Patient Feedback to Increase Adherence to Postoperative Opioid Prescribing Guidelines A Stepped-Wedge Cluster Randomized Clinical Trial",
  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE Prescribing more opioids than patients need following surgery is associated with long-term use, misuse, and diversion. Interventions are needed to increase adherence to procedure-specific guidelines while preserving the ability to manage pain. OBJECTIVE To test whether providing clinicians monthly feedback with peer comparisons and patient-reported outcomes would increase adherence to postoperative opioid prescribing guidelines. \n DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS This stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial was conducted at 6 surgical departments or divisions caring for patients undergoing 30 high-volume surgical procedures in a 5-hospital academic health system in Pennsylvania and New Jersey. Surgical clinicians (attending surgeons, advanced practice professionals, and resident physicians) with 5 or more opioid prescriptions per month for eligible procedures during a 3-month period at baseline were eligible for inclusion. Six clinician clusters were randomly assigned to the intervention in 3 steps offset by 2 months. Each step included a 9-month baseline, a 6-month intervention, and a 6-month follow-up. The first step of the intervention began on June 8, 2022. Follow-up concluded in October 2023, and data analysis was performed from November 2023 to April 2024. INTERVENTION Clinicians were emailed a report on their most frequently performed procedures, which contained a figure of the following mean numbers: pills prescribed relative to guidelines, pills peer clinicians prescribed, and pills patients reported using after a procedure; an additional figure displayed patients' self-reported ability to manage pain. Monthly reports included prescribing trends, peer comparison feedback, and reminders about how many pills patients take and how well patients reported pain management with guideline-adherent prescriptions. \n MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES The primary outcome was the proportion of guideline-adherent opioid prescriptions; secondary outcomes included patient-reported ability to manage pain (measured on a 0 to 10 scale, with 0 being not at all able), pain score, pills prescribed, pills leftover, and refill rate. RESULTS A total of 143 surgical clinicians treating 20 557 patients were included (10 069 at baseline, 5382 during the intervention, and 5106 at follow-up). Mean (SD) patient age was 57.0 (15.7) years, and 10 996 patients (53.5%) were female. The baseline guideline adherence rate was 57.2%. During the intervention, adherence increased to 71.8%, with an adjusted intervention effect of 5.3% (95% CI, 2.0%-8.7%). The impact of the intervention increased over time, and adherence remained above baseline at follow-up (74.4%). The largest change was noted for orthopedic procedures of knee, hip, and shoulder arthroplasty. Patient-reported pain and ability to manage pain were unchanged. \n CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE In this stepped-wedge cluster randomized clinical trial, a feedback intervention using peer comparisons and patient-reported data increased opioid guideline adherence without compromising patients' ability to manage pain.",

[1] [2] 2] [3] [4] [5]  These high-quantity prescriptions pose threats to opioid-naive patients and are associated with new long-term use.  6, 7 In response, several quality improvement efforts have been initiated to disseminate procedure-specific guidelines based on summarized distributions of data on how many pills patients typically take after a given procedure.  [8] [9] [10]  Questions remain about how best to encourage clinical teams to prescribe within these guidelines. Surgeons cite a major barrier to prescribing smaller quantities is the concern that patients may not be able to manage severe pain.  [11] [12] 2] [13]  To address this barrier, a key recommendation of a 2019 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report was to include patient-reported outcomes (eg, pain scores) as part of opioid stewardship.  9 Broadening stewardship efforts beyond surgeons may also be advised, as advanced practice professionals (APPs) are a critical segment of the workforce.  14 A promising approach to nudging prescribing clinicians is electronic health record-based clinical decision support, such as preset default quantities.  15, 16 However, defaults are difficult to implement, as prescribing guidelines can vary based on the procedure type. An alternative is to provide individual feedback on prescribing relative to guidelines or peer behavior, although it is unknown how to optimize the acceptability, usefulness, and effectiveness of this feedback.  [17] [18] ] [19] [20] [21] [22]  To address these knowledge gaps, we conducted a cluster randomized clinical trial testing a clinician feedback intervention targeting postoperative opioid prescribing. The primary outcome was guideline adherence, and secondary outcomes were patient-reported ability to manage pain, pain score, pills prescribed, pills leftover, and refill rate. The intervention leveraged an existing learning health system platform that continuously engages patients via text messaging after undergoing 30 high-volume surgical procedures.  2, 3 Monthly feedback reports were delivered to both attending surgeons and prescribing clinicians (APPs or residents) and focused on the clinician's top 3 procedures for which opioids were prescribed. Reports had 3 core components: (1) audit feedback showing a clinician's number of pills prescribed compared to the guideline and the number of pills patients take after that procedure; (2) peer comparison feedback showing the number of pills prescribed in the health system; and (3) data showing patients' self-reported ability to manage pain according to whether or not they received a guideline-adherent prescription."

Step 1's intervention began on June 8, 2022, step 2's began August 10, and step 3\u2032s began October 6. After the end of each intervention period, a 6-month follow-up period allowed us to observe whether any changes in clinician prescribing or patient behavior persisted (Figure  1 ). This study followed the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials (CONSORT) reporting guidelines and the CONSORT Extension for the stepped-wedged cluster randomized clinical trial.  23 Because clinician reports were delivered as part of a health system quality improvement initiative, the University of Pennsylvania's institutional review board approved the research with a waiver of informed consent.

The validity of linear mixed models for studying risk difference is supported by randomization of intervention sequences under the stepped-wedge design.

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "In this cluster randomized clinical trial, providing normative, peer comparison, and patient-reported feedback to surgical clinicians who treated more than 20 000 patients undergoing a diverse range of high-volume procedures resulted in increased adherence to opioid prescribing guidelines-with sustained adherence after the feedback was discontinued. The mean number of opioid pills prescribed declined, while patientreported ability to manage pain remained the same. Over the course of the intervention and postintervention periods, we estimate this intervention reduced the number of excess opioid pills by more than 34 000. This represents one of the largest randomized evaluations of an opioid prescribing stewardship intervention that also collected patient-reported data on pain experience, filling a critical gap in evidence called out by a 2019 National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine report.  9 his trial makes novel contributions to improving opioid prescribing stewardship and organizational change management at scale within a learning health system. Prior work on postoperative opioid prescribing stewardship efforts have focused on guideline implementation, demonstrating decreases in number of opioid pills prescribed.  10 However, the scope has often been limited to select procedures within a given surgical subspeciality.  33 While emerging literature highlights the ability of peer comparison to be effective, few studies have investigated strategies that include both peer comparison data and patient-reported outcomes data, while also extending reports to multiple potential prescribers (surgeons, APPs, and resident physicians).  3, 32 The present study overcomes these limitations by including 30 high-volume procedures for which patientreported outcomes were routinely collected and deploying a digital quality improvement intervention to clusters of clinicians at randomly selected start dates. It is important to note that the largest gains were seen in high-volume orthopedic surgeries where the baseline prescribing was the lowest among groups and thus had the largest room to improve. Furthermore, this study shows the benefit of engaging nonattending clinicians in surgical quality improvement, as most postoperative prescriptions are written by APPs and residents.\n\nThis study demonstrates learning health systems science built within an expanding digital era. An automated text messaging program was developed to engage patients on a broad scale, provide patient-reported outcomes, and inform the development of procedure-specific guidelines; data were then fed back to clinicians to modify prescribing practice and assess outcomes. Automated engagement with electronic consent was critical to achieving high uptake rates in a broad population at low cost.  2, 33 This approach is scalable to address clinical conditions where discharge medical decisionmaking has an influence on short-term patient-reported outcomes on symptom relief and where there is a wide variability in practice relative to guideline-recommended care. Future work could extend this approach to other clinical conditions where patient-level variation in dosage, timing, or duration is needed.\n\nFinally, this study adds to the applied behavioral science literature on clinician feedback by demonstrating the effectiveness of combining normative feedback with patientreported data. Most clinician feedback interventions have involved audit or peer comparison quantitative data generated by electronic health records or claims data.  18, 34 This is among the first studies to demonstrate the combined benefit of peer comparison feedback with patient-reported outcomes data provided to address clinician concerns about potential unintended consequences of increasing adherence to guidelines."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "This study has limitations; it was conducted in a single large, urban health system with an active opioid stewardship program. This institution is also situated within or near Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, an epicenter of opioid-related overdose, and thus there may be a heightened awareness of the issue locally. The randomization approach was at the division or department level, and the analysis is unable to provide clinicianlevel or patient-level insights. Cluster randomization would not address any local factors or efforts unaware to the research team within sections of each cluster (eg, any quality improvement work), although models did control for the passage of time. Contamination-discussion between participants receiving the intervention and those still in their baseline periodwas also possible, although it should be noted that any contamination would bias results toward the null. Subanalyses revealed the strongest intervention effect among group 1, which largely consisted of orthopedic procedures, which may be driving most of the overall findings. Furthermore, studies using a digital approach to remotely engage patients following surgery are limited by response bias and variation in technology usage. Finally, the cluster randomization would not address any local factors or efforts unaware to the research team within sections of each cluster (eg, any quality improvement work), and contamination across groups was possible with resident trainee rotations. -15 0 10 -5 5 Absolute difference, % (95% CI) -10 Subgroup Age category, y 35-54 vs \u226555 18-34 vs \u226555 18-44 vs 35-54 Female vs male Race category Black vs other Black vs White Other vs White\n\nThe estimates were generated using the marginaleffects package in R (R Foundation) from a statistical model that was the same as the primary model, with interaction terms added for each demographic group with the intervention indicator.\n\nThe other category included those self-reporting as American Indian, American Indian or Alaskan Native, Asian, East Indian, Native Hawaiian or other Pacific Islander, other, and some other race.
