      "text": "Hypertension is the most considerable but treatable risk factor of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and is thus an enormous economic and social burden.  1  Previous randomized controlled clinical trials using various antihypertensive drugs clearly demonstrated that blood pressure (BP) lowering per se is associated with a reduction of CVD events, independently of the class of antihypertensive drugs.  [2] [3] [4]  Reductions of systolic BP by 10 mmHg and diastolic BP by 5 mmHg have been shown to reduce stroke and heart failure by 25%, and coronary artery disease and total mortality by 15%.  1, 3, 4 Both early BP control and lower BP control over 24-hour are essential to achieve \"zero\" CVD events.  5, 6 spite robust development of various antihypertensive drugs of different classes, and the introduction of community-based lifestyle initiatives as non-pharmacological therapy, real-world BP control rate remains poor.  1, 7 The BP control rate for the threshold of 140/90 mmHg varies widely from 15% to 70% globally.  5, 8 Recently, released guidelines for the management of hypertension lowered the target BP to <130/80 mmHg, and thus, the prevalence of uncontrolled hypertension using the new threshold (130/80 mmHg) has been markedly increased.  7  order to achieve the current targets for BP control, real-world innovations in the interventions for hypertensive management are urgently needed.  1, 7 As information and communication technology (ICT) become increasingly central to our daily lives, development of digital health care and medicine has become a \"hot\" topic.  9, 10 In the era of digital therapeutics (DTx), various trials using applications for chronic conditions such as nicotine dependence,  11, 12  substance abuse,  13  or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder  14  have been initiated. In the case of hypertension management, several non-pharmacological intermittent educational interventions have been well-validated in previous studies. For example, in our previous 3-month intervention study, a face-to-face approach by professional nutritionists reduced salt intake by 1.8 g/per day, resulting in a significant reduction to 7.3 mmHg of the 24-hour ambulatory systolic BP.  15  However, non-pharmacological approaches are not consistently successful across all settings, because their efficacy is highly dependent on the characteristics of individual patients.\n\nDTx is an emerging therapeutic method using software programs such as smartphone apps and/or device algorithms.  16 Here, we describe our development of a new interactive smartphone app, HERB, to lower BP, based on an algorithm that helps users to make lifestyle modifications in conjunction with medically validated non-pharmacological interventions, such as salt reduction, maintenance of adequate body weight, regular exercise, and alcohol restriction. We incorporated the advance in the field of behavioral science 17 specially adapted for the smartphone app into our antihypertensive program. In addition, the application can assess the personalities, behavioral characteristics, and hypertension determinants of individual patients to provide adequate guidance on an individual level.\n\nTo demonstrate the efficacy of this smartphone app for personalized hypertension management, we have initiated a randomized intervention trial. We here present the design and rationale of the HERB-DH1 (HERB digital hypertension 1) trial, which is the first randomized controlled trial (RCT) of digital hypertensive therapeutics."

The HERB smartphone app was developed at CureApp Inc. under the supervision of the Division of Cardiovascular Medicine, Department of Medicine, Jichi Medical University School of Medicine. The app runs on both iOS and Android platforms. The app's prescription code is provided to the patients in the intervention group at the timing of randomization via the electric data capture (EDC) system (DATATRAK ONE \u00ae ; DATATRAK International).\n\nPatients download the app through their smartphones, activate the app by entering the prescription code, and input their personal baseline characteristics, including age, sex, lifestyle, social background, and behavior patterns. These data are efficiently gathered through conversations with a virtual nurse in the app.\n\nThe HERB Mobile will retrieve BP data measured by home BP monitoring (HBPM) via a Bluetooth \u00ae connection. The patient data will then be securely transferred to the data server and analyzed based on an algorithm developed with the assistance of health professionals in order to generate a personalized program of lifestyle modifications to lower BP. The patient data, including the BP record, various daily activities, and progress on the proposed program, will be simultaneously shown to health care providers through the HERB Console. Based on the personal data, the physicians will support patients to promote daily app usage including watching educational videos in the app etc. and will educate them in regard to BP and its measurement.\n\nThe HERB Mobile has the following 3 stages to ensure the life- Through this process, the app will allow the lifestyle plans devised by users to take root and realize the necessary behavioral changes to reduce BP."

Thus, all the recent clinical trials of nonpharmacological devices for hypertension treatment have assigned the mean change in 24-hour SBP measured by ABPM as the primary outcome.  29, 30 A reduction of 5 mmHg or more of 24-hour SBP will support the evidence of a reduction of CVD events by 20%. 31"

The JSH2019 Guideline mentioned the synergistic effects of multiple components of intervention: the DASH (Dietary Approach for Stop Hypertension) diet, DASH diet plus reduction of salt intake, 38 and body weight control plus reduction of salt intake, 39 indicated to potentiate the effect of BP-lowering. dividual patients. On the other hand, this app will take a personalized approach to assess the personal data and provide suitable directions for each individuals; thus, the BP-lowering effect of this app may be sustainable for a longer period of time than other standard nonpharmacological interventions. This smartphone app will enable us to introduce personalized medicine into the clinical practice of BP management.

All of the major guidelines recommend that patients with mild-to-moderate hypertension receive non-pharmacological intervention starting at the time of diagnosis of hypertension before antihypertensive medication is initiated.  1, 7, 26  addition, the predominant cause of systolic hypertension in the elderly is increased arterial stiffness, and we speculate that the BP reduction, especially 24-hour SBP, may take a longer time in elderly hypertensives  40  . In the perspective of the DTx, younger people are generally more comfortable with the use of smartphones and thus may find it easier to use a new app than the elderly. We will therefore target younger adults in the early stage of hypertension to evaluate the BP-lowering effect within a relatively short period of time in this study."

In addition, both groups will equally receive doctors' instructions based on JSH 2019 Guidelines, 1 in regard to non-pharmacological interventions in their clinical practice. Such \"face-to-face\" instruction from the doctors may overwhelm the BP-lowering effect of the application over the relatively short time period of the study. Moreover, the TASMINH4, an unmasked randomized controlled trial, demonstrated that self-BP monitoring, with or without tele-monitoring, to titrate antihypertensive medication in individuals with poorly controlled blood pressure, leads to significantly lower BP than titration guided by clinic readings.  43 In the settings of our study, patients in both the groups will manage their BP by self-monitoring although tele-monitoring is only applied for the app group. Therefore, a certain amount of BP-lowering effect may occur in both these groups by just conducting HBPM and by doctors' instruction based on JSH2019 Guidelines."

Next, in Step 2, the app instructs users non-pharmacological interventions, for example, reduced salt intake, exercise or smoking cessation, to lower their BP based on the knowledge and techniques given in Step 1. Finally, in Step 3, the app encourages users to create their own strategies to lower their BP by combining some of the non-pharmacological interventions learned in Step 2. Users will also be encouraged to evaluate and review the process and results of their individually devised plans."
