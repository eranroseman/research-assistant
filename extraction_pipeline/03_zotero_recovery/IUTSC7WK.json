  "abstract": "We are delighted to introduce the proceedings of the 18th edition of the European Alliance for Innovation (EAI) International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare (PervasiveHealth 2024), which took place at Heraklion, Crete, Greece on 17-18 September 2024. This conference brought together researchers, developers, and practitioners around the world who focus on technologies and human factors related to the use of ubiquitous computing for healthcare and wellbeing. The technical program of PervasiveHealth 2024 consisted of 41 full papers in oral presentation sessions at the main conference tracks. The conference tracks were: Track 1 -Patient Empowerment; Track 2 -Artificial Intelligence; Track 3 -Medical Imaging; Track 4 -Education; and Track 5 -mHealth & Telemonitoring. Aside from the highquality technical paper presentations, the technical program also featured two keynote speeches and one technical workshop. The two keynote speeches were given by Mary P. Czerwinski from Microsoft, USA and Nicos Maglaveras from Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, Greece. The 3rd IOT-HR workshop: Workshop on Internet of Things in Health Research, which took place in parallel, focused on the challenges and opportunities presented by continuous data acquisition by Internet of Things (IoT) devices, such as smartwatches, fitness trackers, mobile phones, and smart home appliances. Coordination with the program chairs, Manolis Tsiknakis, Dimitrios Fotiadis, and Guang Yang, was essential for the success of the conference. We sincerely appreciate their constant support and guidance. It was also a great pleasure to work with such an excellent organizing committee team for their hard work in organizing and supporting the conference. We are also grateful to the local chair Kostas Marias for his support, and last but not least, we would like to thank all the authors who submitted and presented their papers at the PervasiveHealth 2024 conference. We strongly believe that the PervasiveHealth conference provides an excellent forum for all researchers, developers, and practitioners to discuss all science and technology aspects that are relevant to pervasive computing technologies for healthcare. We also expect that the future PervasiveHealth conferences will be as successful and stimulating, as indicated by the contributions presented in this volume.",

      "title": "1. Background 1.Leveraging Mobile Health to Improve Sleep Hygiene in Teens",
      "text": "A worldwide epidemic of sleeplessness is rapidly emerging amongst teens  [1] . With one in four young people reporting sleep problems and 4% of all adolescents reporting patterns of sleep disturbance  [2] , there is great concern that poor sleep habits are fuelling a rise in neurodevelopmental disorders  [3]  and a variety of mental health challenges 4  in young adults. More specifically, long-term adverse effects include metabolic issues, chemical imbalances, obesity, and chronic disease  [4] . It is estimated that this phenomenon is costing the healthcare systems worldwide US $16B annually, with loss in work productivity costs exceeding US $50B annually  [5] . These socioeconomic challenges are driving sleep research towards more rapid, instantaneous mobile health (mHealth) solutions that can help teens solve sleep problems into adulthood.\n\nThe emergence of mHealth is positively disrupting traditional health approaches on a scale not seen since the emergence of antibiotics  [6]  mHealth apps provide ubiquitous, instantaneous access to support digital health diagnostics, self-help, preventive behaviour change and various other intervention types  [7] . With investments reaching US $410 billion in 2022,  [8]  mHealth investment is expected to grow beyond half a billion by 2027  [9] . Key to the development of mHealth into the mid 21 st century is the contextual design  [10]  with young people  [11] . Teens are digital natives who hold the potential to harness the far-reaching impacts of digitally ubiquitous, instantaneous health technologies throughout life. This is especially important seeing that up to 15% of adolescents today have been diagnosed with a chronic illness or disability,  [12]  and the downstream impact on an already overwhelmed health care system is concerning. Developing strategies that help transition young people from paediatric to adult health care in the mode of personalised mHealth self-care is therefore paramount  [10] ."

      "title": "1.2. Teenage Years: A Transition in Sleep and Digital Activity",
      "text": "Considering that adolescence is a period of biological shift in circadian rhythms,  [13]  this is an important time to connect with teens on developing good sleep hygiene for life. From the age of 13 through to the age of 18, teens see a typical decrease in total sleep time of almost 1.5 h  [14, 15] . This, coupled with an increased academic workload and greater independence to utilise digital technologies, provides the opportunity for insomnia and other sleep problems to emerge. Insomnia, which can be defined as \"a difficulty in falling asleep, difficulty staying asleep, and non-restorative sleep,\" leads to symptoms of fatigue, impaired concentration and mood disturbance. Poor sleep habits and their resulting comorbidities can often persist and increase into adulthood,  [15]  contributing to a flow of downstream health and social problems. A recent study (2020) found adolescent sleep problems persisting into adulthood in approximately 50% of teens,  [15]  additionally, global estimates in youth mental health problems have risen to between 10% to 20%  [16] . These alarming trends call for new and innovative approaches to mediate teen sleep problems. In seeking to address these challenges, the opportunity to curate a mHealth app for sleep awareness is a prospective approach, considering today's teens are digital natives living on the cutting edge of tech culture. In support of this, encouraging research has found that 81% of adolescents have used the internet to seek health related guidance  [13] . As digital natives, today's teens are the first generation to grow up with the technological ubiquity of smartphones and other internet of things (IoTs)."

      "title": "1.3. Virtual Crowdsourcing with Teens: The Digital Health Citizens of Tomorrow",
      "text": "Co-designing an mHealth based sleep intervention with teens, one that is embedded into their digital ecosystem is a forward-thinking strategic approach to healthcare intervention design  [6] . As healthcare shifts towards more accessible, tailored solutions that prioritise individual needs and preferences, the drive to find better ways to co-design with young health users is heightened  [10] . An emerging method to improve this is virtual crowdsourcing the co-design ideas of teens. This method leverages the collective brain of participants, promising a wealth of rapidly collected data touchpoints, towards better understanding how to tailor needs to young mHealth users  [17] . More robust, data-rich methods to co-design are foundational towards improving scientific discovery, breakthrough treatments and more personalised care. Crowdsourcing virtually bridges time, distance, and affordability in healthcare in ways traditional co-design methods cannot  [18] . In this regard, crowdsourcing teen co-design presents a window to the future of mHealth. More broadly, this aligns with the World Health Organization's (WHO) systematic and cultural transformation of health care ecosystems, led by disruptive technologies that position people as digital health citizens; active engaged participants in the process of curating digital health solutions  [19] . Digital health citizens are positioned at the intersection of 'bio and techno-sociality'. They are defined as active, responsible partners in the discourse, technologies, and social practices of health care  [20] . This shift in strategy is intended to reduce the downstream cost of sickness services, instead promoting better health services throughout life  [21] . As an overarching philosophy, the digital health citizen approach can seek to impact the three core mobile health (mHealth) design challenges of: reduced costs (budget), increased data points (validity) and rapid digital product delivery (time constraints)  [22] . This all-digital co-design approach resonates well with the technocentric ecosphere of today's teens."

Considering that 95% of adolescents (aged 13-17) use a smartphone,  [4, 16]  and with behavioural strategies being considered the frontline in healthcare prevention  [3] , an educational mHealth sleep app provides a way to engage teens before negative habits form. It is expected that this novel approach to designing a sleep app for teens will uncover more challenges and opportunities, something that should be embraced in the digital health community."

The second iteration then focused on co-designing app screen mockups that would provide a viable design concept to integrate the scientific information with an intelligent app design. Successful apps like Duolingo and Mercedes-Benz were explored for design approaches to app onboarding, gestures and calls to action, in order to evaluate the intuitiveness of interactions with end users. A UX designer reconceptualised the first iteration mock-ups within an app design framework in Figma considering mobile app gestures and calls to action (Appendix 1).\n\nThe initial PPIE feedback pointed to simplicity through visible, relaxing but relative and informative, intelligent design. This began to take form in the second iteration, through app screen mock-ups that utilised soft but bright pastel images and fun, playful iconography that was semiotic.

      "text": "This exploratory case study sought to investigate methods to rapidly iterate a virtual co-design with teen participants facing sleep challenges, and to understand how these methods could be scaled-up to increase validity and reliability of data in the emerging Health 2.0 era. Our findings illustrate the advancements and challenges to co-design outside of traditional workshop environments. As with any approach, there are pros and cons to its utilisation. Whilst virtual crowdsourcing brings the promise of more data, challenges exist in how to recruit and vet participants, and how to analyse emotional UX data acquired remotely. The virtual co-design of Sleep Solved garnered two key themes (Table  2 ). These two themes dominated user feedback such that teen users felt the information presented in the app needed to be scientific yet simple to understand, informative not boring, and demographically relative (i.e. interesting and easy for the teen audience to absorb). Additionally, much of the feedback on the UI and UX was focused on imagery and text being visible yet concise, easy to navigate, and a true visualisation of the scientific message. It was interesting to note that teen users understood the seriousness of a sleep awareness app and the mental health challenges that surround it. A brand affinity survey showed that many of the brands in teen popular culture and their forms of mediation (like TikTok) were deemed unsuitable design references for a sleep self-help app by teen co-designers. This illustrates the astuteness of teen mHealth app users, that they are not in need of mere entertainment for engagement.\n\nA key positive of the design process was the rapid data collection from a wide pool of participants, something that speaks to the need for larger population studies in mHealth co-design (towards improving validity, reliability)  [33] . However, one of the key challenges was the lack of digitisation of traditional UX workshop exercises (e.g. sketching, dot-voting etc.) and the rich emotional feedback it garners, data that often speaks beyond statistical feedback. Additionally, some of the design concepts that were popular amongst expert research team members were less popular amongst teen co-designers and quickly dismissed (despite the small subject pool). This gulf of evaluation supports the need for the further involvement of teens alongside designers in the co-design space at-scale, into the Health 2.0 era. Although the themes discovered during this virtual co-design process satisfied the goals of an iterative design process, to envision Cr\u00e9quit et al.'s \"citizen science\" approach, much larger, richer mixed-method data collection is needed to improve the validity and reliability of data, improving the contextuality of the co-design process  [44] . With these general observations in mind, we turn our attention specifically to the research questions."

Participation rates were similar in size to typical in-person workshops. By incorporating national charities, the research team was able to recruit from a larger pool (nationally), making the core demographic more rapidly attainable in this study. The first three PPIE events were surveys which provided the benefit of rapid and blunt assessment of digital assets and copy. The research team was very attentive to teen co-designer feedback and made changes accordingly. However, as with many traditional co-design studies, the number of subjects was limited, such that strong design determinations were built upon limited end-user feedback. This is consistent with recent findings in a 2024 systematic review of Challenges to Incorporate End Users in the Design of DHIs  [45]  that found 78.3% of studies included less than 20 subjects, with only 7.8% including more than 50 subjects. Although survey feedback is rapid and statistical, it is often brought into question for margin of error (deviation) in small sample sizes. To this end, richer approaches to crowdsource more data could be helpful."

      "text": "The prototypical on-site co-design workshop which garners mainly emotional, qualitative feedback in a fail-fast agile environment, was not replicated virtually. Instead, traditional research approaches such as surveys and think-alouds were conducted to gain rapid insights. Where co-design may more broadly refer to the involvement of stakeholders in the design process, how this takes place is much more subjective. In app design, the process of defining the questions, examining assumptions, exploring personas and mapping user journeys are typically in-person workshop collaborations. During this blue-sky phase, the (research) question may pivot, misconceptions may arise, and challenges often surface. Solutions, be they information or design oriented, are often prioritised and voted on. Sketching exercises wherein the design team (including end-users) flesh together a vision of the solution is common. These approaches would have been beneficial to Sleep Solved but would have added scope and strained delivery timelines. Additionally, these emotionally rich methods are also tagged with the same challenges of reliability and validity due to a similarly limited sample size. Moving forward, the challenge for virtual co-design workshops may lie in how they can be utilised at-scale, in a cost-effective, timely manner. A core challenge exists in digital health on how to utilise proven industry co-design methods: at-scale, with scientific validation, all within the constraints of an mHealth app timeline."

This think-aloud group format allowed teens to scaffold their design feedback as well as stating their misunderstandings or misconceptions about the science of sleep. They were also able to contrast the 'sleep hacks' learned from Sleep Solved with the practical impact (or not) on their sleep-related behaviour. They were then able to suggest better personalisation in the form of more enriching engagement (rewards) and progress markers (checkboxes). Overall, teen codesigners found the app helpful and were intrigued to learn even more about the science of sleep. Nonetheless, virtual ideation and testing approaches that produce large filterable datasets, representing user preferences and tracked usage of the prototype would provide richer more contextual feedback. Attaining this will require novel database-driven codesign interfaces, as we will propose.\n\nTo this end, the three iterative design phases built around three surveys, a oneweek beta trial, and subsequent focus group, provided rounds of changes that improved Sleep Solved. However, just how effective this co-design process could be with virtual approaches that garner much more data is a question of much intrigue. Concerns regarding reliability and validity may be soothed by methods that generate a larger data pool with a more diverse array of virtual UX workshops. In that regard, our attention shifts to our second research question on the potential methods to scale-up virtual co-design."

      "text": "While Sleep Solved showed that virtual crowdsourcing can be effective, it utilised methods (surveys and think-alouds) that only scratch the surface of virtual co-design data collection. To mediate broader challenges in digital health, new approaches are needed that produce larger datasets rapidly, without losing the richness of emotional feedback or falling into siloed perspectives that can limit the potential of the co-design. Reflecting on the co-design approach in this study, we developed the following five recommendations on how to scale up virtual co-design for large-scale ideation and testing in mHealth:\n\nRecruitment: This study revealed a 32.7% participation rate amongst recruited teens.\n\nResearchers can use this marker to consider the scope of outreach needed. Scaled-up, gaining 327 participants from 1000 recruitments would be a much-improved dataset. This underscores-despite any challenges-the potential for virtual crowdsourcing.\n\nWith the assistance of The Association of Colleges (and other charities), demographically relevant recruitment took place across the country. This process could be further enhanced by utilising teen-centric social media such as TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram for demographically-driven recruitment ad campaigns. This opens the potential for 1000s of responses that form the cornerstone of improved validity and reliability (more data, less margin of error) in digital health co-design studies  [46] ."

Sleep Solved utilised remote surveys and think-alouds for rapidity and reach. However, by digitising workshop UX exercises asynchronously-as our concept exemplifies (Fig.  2 )-with a co-design interface that presents mood boards that can be annotated with memes or stickers, by providing lo-fidelity sketches that can be drawn over or highlighted, and logos that can be annotated or doodled over-visual and interactive forms of asynchronous feedback can be obtained en masse. Each section of the co-design could be timeboxed for usage tracking. This of course would require meaningful data that can be filtered and organised in an automated fashion. This is where expanded virtual approaches become very prospective. This approach, deployed on a website or mHealth app may resonate with teens using social cues they enjoy. Additionally, it would allow for some of the best industry practices to be digitised, producing larger datasets. In the Sleep Solved study, financial incentive was provided to teen survey subjects, this approach could also be utilised for a synchronous online design jam, that seeks to utilise industry-styled zero-to-hero design approaches in developing an initial prototype (with teens) in remotely deployed half-day virtual workshops."

It would be an exhaustive process for researchers to comb through extensive online data, one that would negate the gains of digitising feedback. In this regard, there is a need to automate user responses in the forms of stickers, ratings, heatmapping areas of mockups that gain the most activity, pitch recognition of voice feedback and speech-to-text processing that can generate keyword themes and subthemes automatically (automated thematic analysis)-all of this to better understand usage metrics and preferences in co-design. This is a mixed-method approach where qualitative and quantitative approaches can meet, where statistical and emotional feedback can complement one another, a silo-free approach that leverages the best of various sciences in the coproduction of an mHealth app. This is difficult to envision without the smart metrics derived from the automation of workshop data that is collated smartly and instantly.\n\nObservational User Testing: Asynchronous testing that captures both emotional feedback (vibes) and user actions (metrics) can be obtained by observational user testing. This emotional feedback may include speech (pitch and tone, text-to-speech) and body language (reaction to media or calls to action) which can be linked to the given app screen in view. This data can be automated and mapped to the actionable metrics of the end user. This combination may address the longstanding variance in qualitative and quantitative analysis of an mHealth app that often juxtaposes user feedback with user activity. In this, there is the opportunity to 'draw a line' through trends in the data that better combines the actions and opinions of end users, seeking to vastly improve the challenges of validity and reliability; iterating design based on richer data."

It is also an additional way of gauging broader feedback to design concepts. A popular activity amongst teens nowadays is the publishing of multiplayer online role-playing games (MMORPG) experiences to be viewed online, or for young people to publish lived experiences, or their own tutorials (vlogging). The observation of co-design experiences itself may be of intrigue to young people, garnering important secondary feedback at-scale.

Without the value of face-to-face validation, greater challenges exist regarding data integrity. Big data approaches bring data variability and scrutiny into the lens of analysis. There is the danger of obtaining inappropriate data (outside of the target demographic), and falsified tests or designs (junk data), especially when participation may be financially incentivised. This is a longstanding challenge in research that would only be multiplied in larger virtual recruitments. AI and machine learning is an emerging field that can be manipulated to 'lie with statistics'. Ethics and integrity loom large in the scientific discussion of automating metrics. Researchers will need to account of these challenges."

It is well-established in the literature that smaller qualitative studies jeopardise validity and reliability and that clinical trials are long and cumbersome, often outliving the life of an mHealth project  [48] . The Health 2.0 approach that envision digital health citizens as active participants in their own healthcare necessitates the need for deeper involvement of end users in co-design, an approach that has richer, more plentiful data points that better justify design decisions, reducing the gulf in evaluation amongst stakeholders spread across government, research, industry and consumers. The Sleep Solved study exhibited the potential to rapidly crowdsource with teen co-designers through digital outreach and asynchronous online data collection. However, a mixed methods approach that scales up these data points utilising AI and machine learning to digitise UX workshop data represents a potential step forward, such that from both digital and health perspectives, enough confidence in the data can occur in a reasonable amount of time, in line with project deliverables. This novel idea combines a number of core digital health challenges under one proposed umbrella solution as cited in our introduction: reducing costs (budget), increasing data points (validity) and rapid digital product delivery (time constraints)."

Consistent hydration is paramount for health and well-being.\n\nFor knowledge workers, it also has an impact on overall productivity. Unfortunately, many knowledge workers experience insufficient hydration during busy working hours. We conducted interviews (N = 10) to investigate the causes of inconsistent hydration during work and explore the expectations of knowledge workers regarding intervention systems to improve their hydration habits. Based on the results of the interview study we designed the H2Office system, a comprehensive approach comprising a water gauge and a smartwatch app. A comparative field study over 10 days (N = 7) of the H2Office system shows its effectiveness in motivating knowledge workers to increase their water intake substantially (by 61%). The combination of auditory and vibration intervention effectively reminded them without causing any work distractions. In the evaluation of H2Office we identify detailed water consumption patterns of users concerning the time of day, sip interval, and sip quantity.

They are found across multiple professions, where they are expected to innovate and solve complex problems in their respective fields  [27] . Considering the entirety of our lifespan, work emerges as the second most time-consuming activity after sleep  [13] . On average, a working individual located in Europe or the USA allocates 1350-1750 hours per year to working  [14] . Given the demands of their busy schedules and workloads, knowledge workers often overlook the importance of maintaining adequate hydration.\n\nWater intake reminders after a regular interval were one of the desired features of work assistance  [16] . To overcome dehydration knowledge workers have been relying on various techniques to hydrate themselves regularly. Examples include mobile applications like \"Water Minder\"  [20]  and \"Water Reminder\"  [21]  as well as smart water bottles like \"HidrateSpark\"  [25] . However, none of the current water intake apps and devices have been specifically designed considering the challenges and requirements of the knowledge workers while at work.\n\nThe initial phase of this research involved conducting interviews with 10 knowledge workers, with a specific focus on determining challenges related to regular water intake at the workplace. The objective was to identify the expectations of knowledge workers with regard to a water reminder system. Subsequently, we developed the \"H2Office\" system, which comprises a water-gauge device and a smartwatch watchface and app. The water-gauge device was designed for precise measurement of water consumption over time, while the smartwatch app aimed to deliver interventions, update the water intake state within the app, set goals, and motivate knowledge workers to achieve their daily hydration targets.\n\nFollowing the development phase, we executed a 10-day comparative field study involving 7 knowledge workers. The results demonstrate a significant increase in water consumption among knowledge workers when using H2Office in comparison to their baseline (Table  1 ). The auditory icon of a water-pouring sound was well-suited to a formal office setting, effectively capturing their attention without distracting them or their colleagues. Additionally, feedback from knowledge workers highlighted H2Office effectiveness in increasing daily water intake. Furthermore, the participants gave suggestions for improving the system's design and considering holistic approach for H2Office interventions.\n\nOur contributions can be summarized as follows:  (1)  We identified the factors associated with the inconsistent hydration of knowledge workers and elicited their expectations with regard to a water reminder system. (2) We designed and developed the H2Office system for office settings to actively promote and support consistent hydration. (3)  We conducted an evaluation of H2Office through a field study, determining the system's potential and identifying hydration patterns of knowledge workers."

      "text": "Graphical and ambient intervention techniques have been frequently implemented to remind users to drink water. In the 'Mug-Tree' experiment  [7] , Ko et al. designed a playful mug linking water consumption to nurturing a virtual tree. Similarly, 'WaterCoaster'  [5]  introduced a virtual fish character in a fish tank, relying on regular water intake for the virtual creature's survival. Another approach, 'GROW'  [6] , presented an ambient water bottle unveiling a cherry tree silhouette. The act of drinking water determined the visibility of branches and leaves, tracking progress towards the hydration goal. 'MossWater'  [17]  employed an empathetic approach, with the system performing the action of watering moss to remind users to drink. 'WorkFit'  [3]  utilized voice interventions techniques for reminding knowledge workers to drink water. Voice interactions were successful in reminding and motivating knowledge workers in drinking water. Moreover, in 'Dual-intervention'  [2]  strategy Ahire et al. asked knowledge workers to rank their modality preference for nutrition intervention. They ranked vibration, ring, graphical and auditory icon and their preferred mode for primary intervention and followed by voice reminder as secondary mode of intervention.\n\n'Hydroprompt'  [19]  utilized three approaches within its system: historical information, enabling users to compare their water intake levels; implicit feedback, providing subtle cues to users; and explicit prompting, attempting to remind participants when hydration falls below acceptable levels. Gouko et al.  [18]  developed a coaster that prompted desk workers to hydrate by emitting periodic sounds. Their investigation revealed that a 15-min interval was optimal for maximizing work efficiency. Hamatani et al.  [26]  investigated the use of smartwatch sensors to gauge water intake by analyzing drinking duration. They employed a macro-activity classifier to differentiate drinking from other activities and a micro-activity classifier to identify sequential micro-actions like holding the bottle, drinking, and putting the bottle down."

      "title": "3.3. Findings: Causes of Inconsistent Hydration",
      "text": "From the interviews, we identified four important causes of inconsistent hydration.\n\nForgetfulness Amidst Demanding Work Routines. Knowledge workers function within tight schedules and engage in challenging and demanding tasks. Participant P4, P6, and P9 highlighted that their heavy workload and deep engagement in tasks often led to forgetfulness regarding water consumption. In some instances, back-to-back meetings consumed their time, causing them to overlook their health needs. The demanding and fully scheduled nature of their work routines resulted in many users forgetting to prioritize and consume an adequate amount of water.\n\nReduced Hydration: Consequence of Habitual Consumption of Other Beverages. Participants P6, P1, and P7 noted that their habitual consumption of coffee made them less prone to feeling thirsty, resulting in limited water intake each day. The regular consumption of other beverages, such as tea, coffee, and energy drinks, often eliminated their explicit thirst for water. This consistent intake of alternative beverages contributed to a reduced overall consumption of water in their daily routine.\n\nChallenges with Existing Water Reminder Apps. Participants P2, P8, and P3, who had prior experience with water reminder apps, expressed their views on the effectiveness of such apps. While acknowledging the utility of reminder and tracking apps, they pointed out a significant drawback -the reliance on users for inputting data. The dependence on users to manually log water intake updates was perceived as tedious and added cognitive load, as it required consistent input each time. Additionally, participants felt that manual logging introduced inaccuracies, making it challenging to estimate their actual water intake. These inaccuracies, in turn, led to demotivation over the long term.\n\nDilemma of Reminder and Distractions. Many water reminder applications depend heavily on mobile notifications for hydration reminders. However while working if the mobile device is set aside due to distractions, then there is a risk of forgetting to drink water. However, if the mobile phone is kept nearby, the knowledge worker may face additional distractions from other notifications such as social media notifications. This situation presents users with a dilemma, as they must choose between being distracted by the phone and receiving water intake notifications, thereby creating a challenging decision-making scenario."

In contrast to existing applications, participants suggested a system featuring an automated water measurement mechanism. They proposed that the system would monitor their water intake timing, send notifications at regular intervals, record water consumption, and compile a total of daily water intake. Additionally, participants expressed their desire to establish a daily water intake goal, utilizing the water reminder system to assist them in achieving this objective. \"I do not want to give too much effort every time I use the device or the app. I only want to get notification and motivation.\" -P1. Moreover, the participants expressed the desire for the system to send reminders every 45-60 min.\n\nNon-disruptive and Unobtrusive Interventions. Some participants preferred a non-intrusive water reminder in the form of a pop-up rather than an app that requires active opening and tracking. They wished for the water app to be consistently visible on the front of the screen of their smartphone, serving as a subconscious prompt for water intake without distracting them consistently. The app should also automatically display progress in a subtle manner to without breaking their workflow, removing the need to open the app each time to check intake and progress. One participant specifically mentioned his preference to show the information on the front screen, stating, \"I am too busy to open the app and see my progress every time and I might end up forgetting about the app.\" -P2 Furthermore, unlike commercial intervention systems that use distractive reminders, participants desired a system that was subtle and non-intrusive."

      "text": "The smartwatch was chosen as the users interaction device for its close proximity to the user, thereby being effective in capturing attention and delivering voice interventions. The likelihood of users not noticing voice interventions due to focused work is minimized when delivered through a smartwatch. Additionally, smartwatches facilitate multimodal interactions, encompassing graphical, voice, and tactile outputs, enabling users to engage through diverse modes. As found in the interviews (Sect. 3.3) unlike mobile phones, smartwatches do not pose a significant source of distraction for knowledge workers. We used the Samsung Galaxy 4 foot_3  smartwatch for app deployment (Fig.  2 ).\n\nH2Office App. The smartwatch app was created to administer interventions and synchronize user's water intake consumption from the cloud. Users are required to log in to their profile, configure the water intake interval, and set their working hours and working days within the app. Additionally, the app provides a display of weekly statistics (Fig.  3 ) of daily water consumption. Fig. 2. H2Office app stats page, showing the consumption of last 4 days Fig. 3. H2Office gauge system at the in-situ settings\n\nH2Office Watchface. Prior literature has shown that smartwatch users prefer's to update about their activity in glance without consuming more time and is perceivable at the periphery of users attention  [1] . Watchface enables users to quickly glance the activity status. Moreover, watchface helps motivating smartwatch users and encourage them in achieving their goals  [23] . Therefore, we used a watchface so that the water reminder is always upfront and explicit. This enables users to monitor this information in a short glimpse and not get distracted from the on-going task. The watchface must meet aesthetic requirements and can only display one app at a time due to limited space. Because it must be easy to read at a glance and space is limited, it cannot accommodate a large amount of information. Additionally, it must still allow users to easily read the current time.\n\nAs shown in Fig.  1 , we designed the watchface as an animated water tank. The water level increases after each sip. The watchface also displays the total amount of water that was consumed during the day as well as the goal the user set for the day. It displays the water consumption during the last intake and time (in minutes) since last consumption.\n\nH2Office Interventions. While designing the interventions for H2Office, we focused on keeping the attention required by the knowledge workers at a minimum in order to prevent distracting them too much. We decided to deliver the intervention using an auditory icon and a vibration. For the auditory icon we selected the sound of pouring water, which can be easily associated with drinking water. Further, the sound of pouring water is subtle and non-intrusive to knowledge workers and their colleagues. The sound of auditory icon 5 . A vibration intervention combine with audio can serve as an additional reminder if the audio fails to capture the user's attention or if the smartwatch is set on low volume."

      "title": "6.1. Quantitative Findings",
      "text": "Overall, the system recorded 473 sips of water by the seven participants. The total number of sips per participant ranged from 35 to 196, with a mean of 68 sips per participant. Similarly, water consumption per sip for participants ranged from 51 to 140 ml, with a mean of 107 ml per sip. During interviews participants desired the sip interval to be 45-60 min (Sect. 3.4). Nevertheless, except for P6 all participants had sip intervals between 42 and 63 min. During the baseline condition, participants consumed an average of 827 ml, whereas with the H2Office intervention, the average water consumption increased to 1207 ml, indicating a 61% increase.\n\nIn the evaluation we found an average increase in water intake of 61.2%. The smallest increase was by 10.8% for participant P1. The maximum increase was by 107.4% for participant P2. It was unexpected to discover that participants P4 and P6, despite having a substantial baseline intake of 1350 and 1500ml, exhibited notable increases of 26.6% and 31.7%, respectively, in the H2Office condition. A paired t-test showed a significant difference in water consumption between the H2Office condition and the baseline condition (p < 0.05).\n\nThe comparative bar graph of baseline and H2Office for each participant is presented in Fig.  4 , revealing a substantial increase in water consumption for each participant. The distribution of water intake for all participants is shown in the histogram in Fig.  5 . Notably, the frequency of intakes within the 40-80 ml range surpasses that of all other intake values. Additionally, Fig.  6  illustrates the overall water intake for each hour. Notably, there is an observed increase in the frequency and water intake amount from 12 pm to 4 pm, indicating higher and more frequent water consumption in the afternoon compared to the morning.\n\nAs the results show, H2Office substantially increases the water consumption of the participants during the work hours. Thus H2Office is an effective intervention for achieving higher water intake among the participants. This outcome underscores the positive impact of H2Office on encouraging individuals to consume more water, which can have important implications for overall health and well-being."

    {
      "title": "6.2. Qualitative Findings",
      "text": "Auditory Icons and Vibrations Proved to Be Effective. Several participants stated that auditory intervention combined with vibration was well-suited for the formal office setting. It was able to effectively catch their attention but at the same time did not distract them significantly from work. As the intervention was an auditory icon of pouring water, they could easily distinguish the H2Office notification from the other notifications. Furthermore, the auditory intervention was not extensively loud and did not capture the attention of neighboring colleagues. Because of the smartwatch's proximity to the user, they could distinctly feel the vibration during the intervention. As a result, the combination of both modalities effectively reminded them to stay hydrated.\n\nCount-Up Timer Serves as a Hydration Reminder. Several participants expressed that the count-up timer (Fig.  1 , line 2), which shows the time since the last water intake was effective in motivating them to consume water. Participant 1 specifically stated, \"The count-up timer was more helpful than the notification\" emphasizing that observing the time elapsed since the last water intake proved beneficial. Often, participants did not wait for the interventions, but drank water after having a glimpse at the last intake time. In the interview, P6 stated \"I didn't receive so many notifications to drink water, as I looked at the count-up timer and frequently drank water.\" Building Trust: Importance of Accuracy in Water Intake. Participants observed that precision of H2Office during water consumption was particularly intriguing. H2Office demonstrated proficiency in calculating water intake, providing updates in milliliters that were not rounded off to conventional values like 50 ml or 100 ml. Instead, the displayed measurements were precise, such as 58 ml or 67 ml, aligning closely with the actual amount of water consumed with each sip. This non-rounded approach contributed to participant's trusting the device's calculations, leading them to take their water intake more seriously. As one participant, P6, expressed, \"I was skeptical at first: Does the device really measure the amount of water? I drank from the glass and estimated the water intake, then compared it with the given result on the watchface. It is really doing its job.\" This firsthand verification highlighted the accuracy of the device and reinforced the participants' confidence in its functionality.\n\nHolistic Approach: Extending Beyond Water. Some participants suggested adopting a holistic approach that involves tracking the intake of beverages (such as coffee, tea, soft drinks, and juices) and subsequently recommending water intake. The interest in tracking these beverages stemmed from their habitual consumption of these drinks, unlike water, which often required external triggers and motivation. Participants, however, were concerned about the health implications of their habitual consumption of beverages containing caffeine and sugar. Since these beverages also contribute to overall fluid intake, participants proposed incorporating a comprehensive approach to hydration recommendations. Additionally, participants pointed out specific times during the workday, such as the start and post-lunch period, when coffee and tea intake was crucial for functioning and integral to their daily routine. They suggested  H2Office to consider these factors before recommending water intake to align with their established beverage consumption patterns.\n\nRecommending Water Intake Goal Based on a Health Issue. Few participants recommended taking into account individual health considerations related to dehydration. They emphasized the importance of recognizing the critical role of consistent water consumption, acknowledging that while it might be a routine for some, for others, it is crucial for maintaining their health. One participant, P2, expressed a desire for the H2Office to not only monitor but also to recommend a goal based on health issues related to hydration. \"I want it  [H2Office]  to determine the needed amount of water based on health issue.\" This suggestion illustrates the participants' interest in personalized health monitoring and the potential role of technology in addressing individual hydration needs.\n\nDesire for Gamification Based on Points and Penalties. Most Participants expressed a desire for a more gamified experience to enhance their interest and engagement. Participants suggested incorporating gamification elements such as earning coins or points daily upon achieving the set water intake goals.\n\nThis approach was seen as a potential means to encourage consistency in daily water consumption and increase overall participant engagement. Additionally, the idea of rewarding them for the goal completion and penalizing if them for not consistently hydrating them was considered valuable fostering a more serious approach. Participant P7 highlighted this sentiment, stating, \"I think the amount of water that I have consumed was enough, but I need to mention that I would like to have more games if it is possible.\" Participant 5 echoed this sentiment, expressing, \"The idea is great, but I need more games. Water tank alone is good, but I need something more, like coins to buy something in the game.\"\n\nOptimized Design and Aesthetic of the Device. Some participants recommended optimizing the design of H2Office, noting its current size was somewhat bulky for placing on a desk. They proposed a redesign, emphasizing the need to consider the clutter typically found on desks. Specifically, the participants suggested shaping the prototype to resemble a coaster in terms of size and thickness.\n\nIn addition, participants advised taking into account the average empty space available on desks during the design process. One participant, P3, commented, \"The idea and the device itself are well designed, but I don't have enough space on my desk, although I can find some space for it.\" Another participant, P5, highlighted the significance of the device's shape and design, stating, \"The device shape and design are very important to me, as the office is a formal setting.\" These statements underscored the participants emphasis on practicality, aesthetics, and the integration of the device into their professional work environment.\n\nAs knowledge workers have a busy schedule, it was important to find a balance between attention seeking, interventions, and distractions. Users expected our H2Office system to be non-intrusive and not distracting. In H2Office, we implemented a technique involving auditory interventions, GUI notifications, and vibration. Using this combination, users felt that the intervention was not distracting. Users highlighted that the \"last intake timer\" feature increased their awareness of their drinking habits and made them more attentive to their hydration behavior.\n\nWe found that hydration interventions proved beneficial to the users and were able to significantly increase the water intake in comparison to their baseline. We uncovered drinking patterns of the users by considering their time intervals between sips and amount of water consumption. We found that water intake was higher in the period between noon and 4 pm than in the period between 8 am and noon. There can be multiple reasons for this. Knowledge workers generally consume coffee or tea in the morning, which may lead to the less water intake in the early morning. Another reason could be weather conditions, since the study was conducted in the month of May, in which the temperature rises after noon, which may lead to higher consumption. During the afternoon, knowledge workers may demonstrate an increased awareness of water consumption compared to the morning, resulting in a rise in the frequency of intake and overall consumption.\n\nIn the WorkFit study  [3] , proactive voice interventions in office environments faced challenges such as lack of agency, privacy concerns, and intrusiveness to colleagues. However, in our study, auditory interventions proved advantageous by delivering subtle audio cues audible only to the users, ensuring they were nonintrusive to their colleagues. Moreover, the use of auditory icons did not raise privacy or agency concerns among knowledge workers in a formal office setting. In 'Dual-Intervention'  [2]  study, vibration was ranked as most preferred modality for nutritional intervention, similarly we found vibration modality provide beneficial for delivering hydration intervention in work setting.\n\nIn previous studies, penalties were implemented using various methods such as a tree wilting  [7] , moss drying up  [17] , and in the \"Water Coaster\" system  [5] , the water level in the fish tank decreased when there was insufficient water intake, potentially endangering the fish. Although we built an interactive system for water intake, H2Office does not have a provision for assigning penalties for missing the water intake. Like the collective water consumption and drinking techniques  [4, 15] , participants expressed a desire for gamification and for inculcating a competitive approach for achieving their daily goals. This could encourage users to compete and achieve their goals with more dedication.\n\nWhile HidrateSpark  [25]  employs a similar approach, its limitations include dependency on the HidrateSpark water bottle exclusively for tracking and reminders of water consumption. Moreover, it carries a hefty price tag, ranging from $54-$79 per bottle, and requires meticulous care in both cleaning and usage. In contrast, H2Office users have the flexibility to use day-to-day items like glasses, water bottles, or cups according to their needs. Additionally, Hidrate-Spark water bottles and intervention are not specifically designed and developed for office settings and knowledge workers.\n\nAccuracy was judged as an important feature of H2Office. Accuracy of the amount of water consumed helped in building trust and maintain the participants' interest towards H2Office. Further, users were also impressed that H2Office not only delivered interventions, but that it also delivered and calculated their consumption automatically. An average working day of a knowledge workers comprises various drinks, such as water, coffee, juice, and tea. Beverages like coffee and tea were judged as essential for their work day productivity. Furthermore, for some knowledge workers who were habitual to drinking coffee, this was also a growing concern for them. These knowledge workers desired to minimize their coffee intake during their work day. They requested to also measure their coffee consumption and to help them to minimize it and increase their water intake."

Our findings highlight that demanding work schedules, habitual consumption of other beverages and challenges with distractions and reminders in existing apps were key contributors to dehydration. In exploring our participant's expectations, we identified a preference for a device that is effortless, performs automated calculations and interventions, and sustains their interest in the long term. In response to these insights, we developed the H2Office system, comprising a water gauge and a smartwatch watchface and app. We used auditory icon as an intervention for hydration reminder. Results of the field study indicate that H2Office effectively reminds knowledge workers to consistently rehydrate during work. Notably, H2Office substantially enhanced hydration levels compared to the baseline (by 61%). Importantly, we identified the drinking patterns of knowledge workers and in particular quantified the water intake intervals, consumption in milliliters and hourly consumption."

Background. The Mediterranean diet is highly recommended for most patients in cardiac rehabilitation and secondary prevention, but compliance is often poor. This study aimed to evaluate the usability and feasibility of NutriQuest, a gamified smartphone application aimed at supporting patients' adherence to the Mediterranean diet. Methods. The study used mixed-methods: consisting of a usability study and a six-week, single group intervention with patients (n = 21) following a programme for cardiac rehabilitation. Patients were requested to utilize the smartphone application and complete questionnaires to evaluate its usability and acceptance, as well as its impact on modified MedDietScore, knowledge, and self-efficacy. Results. 15 out of 21 patients completed the full six-week trajectory. Patients were accepting the application and general impressions were positive. They mostly made use of the logbook-component and reacted positively towards the dietitian's feedback. The study did not find any significant improvement in the patients' modified MedDietScore, knowledge and self-efficacy after the intervention. Conclusion. The study reveals patients' acceptance of the NutriQuest application and usability improvements. The accuracy of measuring MedDietScore using a daily and digital approach versus weekly questionnaires remains inconclusive. The study provides insights in user preferences for and engagement with different components of the NutriQuest application, which could inform design of dietary management applications."

      "title": "1. Introduction",
      "text": "According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), cardiovascular diseases (CVD) remain worldwide the leading causes of death in 2021  [3] . Secondary prevention has been shown to reduce mortality, cardiovascular events and rehospitalization  [25] . Consequently, it is considered a class 1A recommendation for patients suffering from CVD by the European Society of Cardiology (ESC)  [25] . Secondary prevention mainly involves medication optimization and modification of lifestyle-related risk factors through physical activity, smoking cessation and dietary changes. Diet is one of the most important factors modifiable by lifestyle changes and influences CVD risks via lipids, blood pressure, body weight and diabetes mellitus  [11] .\n\nA targeted diet is therefore recommended for most cardiac patients. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) aims to lower blood pressure in people suffering from hypertension  [27] . The Healthy Nordic diet adheres to current dietary guidelines (Nordic Nutrition Recommendations  [4] ) and includes foods that are locally produced or traditionally used in Nordic countries, such as oily fish like salmon and herring, berries (e.g. blueberries) and fruits (e.g. apples)  [24] . The Mediterranean Diet consists primarily of fish, unsaturated fats, whole grains, fruits, and vegetables  [33] . It is important to promote the Mediterranean diet among patients with CVD, as there is well-established evidence of the cardiovascular benefits, and it may be more efficient at reducing long-term CVD outcomes compared to the DASH diet  [8, 17] .\n\nHowever, changing dietary patterns, and behaviour change in general, is especially difficult when one is stuck in unhealthy habits. Other aspects, such as lack of motivation or limited knowledge about healthy diets, can create additional barriers in the behaviour change process.\n\nMobile health apps may play a positive role in promoting lifestyle change, increasing motivation, and providing education to CVD patients  [7, 20] . They have the capacity to break barriers by presenting trustworthy information on dietary choices, supporting communication with the dietitian and facilitating persuasive techniques to increase motivation and promote behaviour change  [7, 20] . Gamification has been integrated into health apps as a way to boost motivation and engagement. Increasing evidence is currently emerging in this area  [16, 30, 34] .\n\nTo improve cardiac patients' adherence to the Mediterranean diet, researchers developed the mobile application \"NutriQuest\", which includes persuasive principles, gamification, behaviour tracking, goal setting and an information repository. The aim of this study is to evaluate the usability and feasibility of the \"NutriQuest\" application and its different components. The study sets out to investigate which components of the application are preferred by patients and how they use these components. It also evaluates intrinsic motivation during application use and habit formation. Additionally, the study aims to make a preliminary assessment of the effect of the intervention with the gamified application on the Modified MedDietScore (MMDS) (a modified version of the Med-DietScore, which includes salt and sugar intake and considers an alcohol con-sumption of 0 as positive  [14] ), knowledge and self-efficacy in cardiovascular patients."

      "text": "The primary purpose of NutriQuest is to help patients increase their adherence to the Mediterranean diet through persuasive principles and gamification, behaviour tracking, goal setting and an information repository. The app featured three major components:\n\n-A logbook, which was monitored by dietitians, who would leave comments on the entries. Based on the entries in the logbook, the Modified MetDietScore (MMDS) was calculated, and a weekly progress report was generated, showing for which food categories the patient performed well or not. To enter a meal, patients could take a picture, enter a description and indicate portion quantities for the MMDS food categories. -Goal-setting, which automatically updates the goals based on the logbook entries. Patients could choose a goal from a predefined list, or create their own custom goals. -The ability to search for brand-products in the OpenFoodFacts database and retrieve nutritional and guideline-based information (based on the The European Cook Book  [1] ). The home-screen featured a visualisation of a heart. It would show healthier or unhealthier based on the current MMDS of the patient, thus emphasizing the healthiness of the patient's current eating habits. The goal setting was gamified: selected goals were assigned to an \"adventurer\", which would be sent on a \"quest\" once the goal was activated. Each time the patient progressed towards a goal, a system notification with a progress bar was shown. When the user completed a goal, the app showed a notification indicating that the adventurer found treasures. Additionally, there was a small chance that adventurers would uncover wisdom, which was a tip on how to live healthier that could be consulted on a separate screen.\n\nPatients would start with only one adventurer. By collecting enough treasures, patients buy more adventurers, therefore stimulating patients to start small and become more ambitious in their goals when they are performing well.\n\nFinally, patients were able to watch educational videos on cardiovascular disease and how to live healthier."

      "text": "Quantitative Data. Socio-demographic information (age, gender, education, and employment) and information on the Digital Health Readiness level  [28]  were collected at the start of the study.\n\nAll patients were asked to finish questionnaires on the Modified MedDi-etScore (MMDS)  [14] , Nutrition Knowledge questionnaire  [14]  and Nutrition Self-Efficacy scale  [29] , before and after the six-week intervention. At the end of the intervention, patients completed a 22-item version of the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI)  [9] , the Self-Report Habit Index (SRHI)  [31] , and an ad-hoc usability questionnaire.\n\nThe MMDS we used in this study is an adaption of the MedDietScore  [21]  in which parameters about salt and sugar intake are added to the score, and an intake of zero alcohol is considered positive (in contrast to the MedDietScore, which allows limited alcohol consumption). The score was developed by the H2020 CoroPrevention  [2]  research team, but was not yet validated in earlier studies  [14] . The Nutrition knowledge questionnaire was created by the cardiac rehabilitation research team from Jessa Hospital and Hasselt University, together with in-house cardiac rehabilitation dietitians. The questionnaire assesses knowledge about heart-healthy food  [14] . The usability questionnaire asks patients to evaluate various screens of the application based on perceived usefulness, ease of use and ease of understanding. It also assesses visual attractiveness and contains various questions specific to the features on each screen. An ad-hoc questionnaire was preferred over a standardised usability questionnaire (such as the System Usability Scale), as it allowed us to get in-depth feedback for each screen and identify possible reasons for (under)utilisation, as well as provide insights in how to improve future iterations of the application.\n\nDuring the intervention, usability data was collected through data logging within the application and a usability questionnaire at the end of the study. The logging counted the number of visits to the application and the specific pages, as well as data about the logbook entries and goals that were set. An ad-hoc usability questionnaire queried the visual attractiveness, ease of use, ease of understanding and usefulness, as well as some other aspects specific to each component of the application (such as assigning goals, clarity of the advice for a product, etc.).\n\nQualitative Data. Patients were also invited to a short semi-structured interview (that lasted approximately 20 min) at the end of the usability study and at the end of the intervention. With the patients' consent, we recorded the interview. The questions mostly concerned the patients' usage of, and experience with the application, asking for example: \"What features did you think were exceptionally useful?\", \"What aspects or features do you think need to be improved?\", \"What do you consider a must-have feature for diet applications in general?\", etc. The interview evaluated acceptance through questions such as \"If given the option, would you keep on using the application?\", \"Would you recommend the application to friends or family?\" and \"If you had to pay for the application, would you do so and how much would you be willing to pay?\"."

The lowest number was 17 entries on 12 separate days (excluding the one patient who forgot to use the application). The goal-setting component received 404 page-views. However, over the 15 patients, only 63 goals were set, with one patient being responsible for 21 of those goals. 66.7% (10/15) of the patients set 2 or fewer goals over the intervention period.

However, the \"NutriQuest\" application also calculated the MMDS on a weekly basis according to the patients' daily logbook entries of that week. We compared these two different measuring methods, by comparing the first full week reported in the application to the baselines and the last full week to the questionnaire results at the end of the intervention. It was found that there is a significant difference between the MMDS measured by the questionnaire and that by the application (t = 2.36, P < 0.05). The \"first\" and \"last\" full weeks are defined as the first and last weeks in which the patient used the app from Monday to Sunday (for example, if the patients started their intervention on a Thursday, we would take the results of the next week) and for which the amount of reported meals was within the standarddeviation of their average amount of reported meals per week.

A 2019 systematic review by Villinger et al. indicated that mobile app interventions are increasingly developed for nutrition behaviours and are proven effective in improving nutrition behaviours and nutrition-related health outcomes  [32] . However, the studies included in the review concern mostly obese patients, evidence of its efficacy in cardiovascular disease is still emerging.\n\nOur study primarily investigated the usability of the NutriQuest application. On average, patients scored the components of this application neutral to positive for the \"Ease of use\", \"Ease of understanding\" and \"Usefulness\". Although the scores are lower than those given during the usability study, they still show that patients see merit in the use of the application. Furthermore, the general view of patients towards the application was positive. Four patients were interested in continuing to use the application, and seven patients would recommend it to friends or family. Many patients would join this sentiment if some of their current issues with the application would be fixed.\n\nThe correlation of the SRHI and its various subdomains with the amount of application visits means that for patients that frequently used the application, it likely became a habit. This finding is important, as it indicates a positive level of acceptance. Additionally, the presence of habit formation might lead to better adherence over longer periods. In general, the results suggest that this type of application is somewhat welcomed in patients' daily life.

Analysis of the NutriQuest application logs revealed that patients mostly made use of the logbook feature. Only a few patients actively used the product search and goal-setting functions in our application. This might play a role in the efficacy of the application. Nonetheless, one patient mentioned that \"Logging my meals helps me think about what I eat\". This kind of self-reflection is valuable in itself. Self-monitoring and self-evaluation appear in behaviour change models such as the Self-Regulation Theory  [15] . The use of only the logbook could therefore still prove beneficial for some patients."

Rosenstock's Health Belief Model also describes perceived susceptibility, severity, benefits, and barriers as the primary beliefs that determine the likelihood of action. [26] . However, our application might not have reached its full educational potential, due to low interaction with the product search (and information accompanying the products) and the informative videos.\n\nThe current information provided alongside the results of the product search was taken from the European Cookbook  [1]  and offered a broad and nuanced description of the product category and its general effects on health. However, patients indicated that they wanted more detailed and specific information, which clearly indicates why the product was (not) recommended for them.\n\nIn our study, personal feedback was delivered to the patients in the form of the dietitians' comments. Patients considered this as a major benefit. One patient told the interviewer that the idea that someone was monitoring their eating habits encouraged him, and that if the comments were generated automatically by the system, they would be less persuasive. Another participant believed it is a must-have in the context of diet applications to have someone motivating you by confirming you are doing well.\n\nPersonalised advice was also a centre-point for two different RCTs by Recio-Rodriguez et al. and Gonzalez-Raminez et al., evaluating the EVIDENT II and Salbi Educa applications respectively. In both studies, the patients could use the respective application to log their food intake and the application would generate personalised recommendations on how to improve their diet. Both studies found a significant improvement in adherence to the Mediterranean diet after three months for the patients of the intervention group  [13, 23] . (However, neither study found a between-group difference.)\n\nConsidering the patients' statements lauding the human feedback, and the results of our study contrasted to those of the EVIDENT II and Salbi Educa studies, it is unclear to which degree patients actually considered the feedback provided by the dietitians in the NutriQuest app, whether the differences in results are due to the length of the study or due to other feature-differences between the three applications.\n\nA separate study by Kaihara et al. evaluated the use of a chat app in a 12-week RCT  [14] . Patients would send pictures of all their meals to dietitians during weeks one, four, and eight; which in turn would provide feedback. The study found a significant increase in the Nutrition-and knowledge scores. The premise of this study is similar to our logbook, in which the patients could upload pictures and dietitians could leave feedback in the form of comments. However, there are two key differences: (1) in our app, uploading pictures was optional and (2) patients could not respond to the dietitians' comments. We hypothesise that the ability to create a dialogue in which dietitians can rectify misconceptions might play a key role in the learning effect.\n\nThe lack of use of the goal-setting feature in NutriQuest was mainly attributed to two reasons: (1) patients thought they did not need it, and (2) patients found the feature confusing and hard to understand because of the gamification elements and the terminology that was used. While the latter is easier to fix, the former indicates that the application should better promote the feature and benefits, as goal setting remains an important technique for behaviour change, playing into theories such as The Theory of Planned Behaviour  [5]  and the Trans-theoretical Model of Behaviour Change  [22] . Nonetheless, our application was innovative in its inclusion of goal-setting in a healthy nutrition context. A study by McAleese et al. evaluated the presence of behaviour change techniques in mobile apps for the Mediterranean diet. Out of the 55 analysed apps, none of them included any features related to goals; most were limited to providing instructions as well as information on behaviour, health risks and consequences  [19] ."

The correlation of \"perceivedcompetence\" with \"application visits\" and \"ease of understanding\" with \"pageviews\" suggests that for many participants, the app was still too complex. On the other hand, the correlation of \"effort-importance\" with \"application visits\" suggests that the app should make more effort in highlighting its benefits.\n\nNonetheless, the efficacy of the application is likely hampered by the lack of use of its various components, specifically the goal setting and weekly progress report. We hypothesise that the application should more actively guide patients towards these components (for example, by automatically redirecting them when context requires so) and promote their use. Additionally, we hypothesise that education related components should provide higher levels of detail and personalisation might have to be interwoven more strongly into the other components (for example, education could be provided in the weekly progress report)."

The questionnaires reported significantly higher MMDS. The application tracks the patient's diet daily in the logbook interface, whereas the questionnaire requires the patient to recall their diet for the week. Studies found that the amount of memorised information and episodic detail richness declined with retention interval  [10] , therefore daily reporting of measurements may be more accurate, but it depends on the patient's ability and willingness to consistently and accurately record the data. Further studies are needed to fully explore which of the measuring methods is more accurate and effective. Secondly, patients reported their meals to the application by indicating how many portions of each category of the MMDS the meal contained. The same descriptions and clarifications for the categories as the questionnaire were available in the app. However, almost all patients indicated that, even with the extra information, this limited list of categories was often confusing to use for accurate reporting of the meal. They were unsure to what category an ingredient would belong, found it hard to estimate how many portions they had consumed, and were wondering if they had to log it at all. They mentioned they would prefer an exhaustive list of categories that would take longer to browse, over a shorter but quicker one.\n\nBoth issues bring up the question about the suitability of the MMDS (and by extension the MedDietScore) to log meals via the app. Confusion about the categories, as well as having to reflect on the past week, could easily lead to unreliable reports."

Further research with larger sample sizes may be needed to confirm the findings of the current study. Two participants also mentioned that they did not complete their logbook themselves, but that their partners completed it for them, since they would decide about the meal and prepare it. It is unclear whether this situation also applied to other participants. It must also be noted that the proportion of male to female participants (12 to 3) might affect results. Since participation was voluntary, a selection bias might be present: included patients might have had higher motivation, or better adherence to a healthier diet. A minor technical limitation is the fact that this study was only conducted with Android phones, which might cause selective bias.\n\nWith a study length of only six weeks, the study was relatively limited in duration. However, the goal was to assess the initial effect on behaviour change. Lally et al. indicated that it takes on average 9 weeks (more precisely an average of 66 days, ranging from 18 to 254 days) for automacy in habit formation to plateau  [18] .\n\nThis suggests that behaviour change and habit formation is a gradual process. Therefore, we assume that if the application had influenced behaviour, signs of increased effort regarding diet habit formation could have been detected as early as after 5 or 6 weeks. Furthermore, the timing of six weeks aligned with a followup consultation with the dietitian in usual care. The current study was relevant to assess feasibility and usability, but more permanent behaviour change can only be detected in a longer follow-up study."

Participants primarily utilized the logbook feature and neglected the goal-setting and educational components, citing application complexity and lack of awareness as reasons for neglecting these components. An interesting finding is that the study is inconclusive on whether the MMDS is the most suitable method for logging meals in a digital application in the context of behaviour change. Significant differences occurred in scores calculated based on daily logbook entries in the app, and those calculated based on reflections on the past week collected via questionnaires. We believe the findings of this study provide pointers to guide the design of future applications, such as patients' preferences towards the logbook, appreciation of monitoring by dietitians, or the need to actively promote application features.\n\nAcknowledgements.

      "text": "Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a highly prevalent neurodevelopmental disorder affecting about one percent of the population in the U.S. and abroad  [1, 2] , including Bangladesh  [3] [4] [5] . The worldwide predominance of (ASD) has expanded 20 to 30fold during the last 50 years  [6] . Most of the previous research on autism has been limited to western or wealthy Asian countries  [2, [7] [8] [9] [10] . Research in the domain of ASD in the Low-and Middle-Income Countries (LMICs) is mostly done in the area of screening  [11] [12] [13] . Although a few mHealth tools exist that, in a limited capacity, serve for monitoring mental health diseases in LMICs  [14, 16] , those cannot accommodate the rich variety, individual nuances, and the uncertain patterns of ASD. Also, most mHealth applications are built assuming that the health data will be collected by physicians or health care workers  [17] [18] [19] [20] . Moreover, values embedded in a cultural setting impact the perception, diagnosis, and treatment of ASD  [21] [22] [23] . Thus, a carefully designed mHealth application that considers the socio-cultural values, norms and perception of ASD, and can be easily used by caregivers (based on literacy level and mobile use experience) themselves to address the aforementioned constraints, is an important need.\n\nRegardless of gaining remarkable progress in ASD screening and raising awareness in recent years, the healthcare support system is limited for families raising children with ASD (CWA) in Bangladesh  [24] . Like many other low and middle-income countries (LMICs), social-cultural-financial constraints and a scarcity of mental health professionals (MHPs) have deprived CWA from regular monitoring, care, and support in Bangladesh. Approximately 200 psychiatrists and 50 psychologists are currently available for 160 million people in Bangladesh  [25] . The situation is even worse in rural areas. Also, existing practices depend on traditional 'on spot' evaluations of the behavior of CWA or caregiver recollections during their occasional and infrequent visits affect the evidence-based decision making of MHPs resulting in inaccurate and unreliable care.\n\nThe objective of our work is to dynamically improve the care system with an accessible and easy-to-use mobile-based application called mCARE for evidence-based decision making. mCARE designed to address three major constraints in the care systemfinancial hardship for parents to arrange frequent visits and to accurately report to MHPs, lack of availability of MHPs, and lack of availability of longitudinal data of behavioral changes. mCARE, developed following the socio-cultural and existing care protocol, has been used by 8 mental health professionals (MHPs) and 300 caregivers of CWA for over a year. Caregivers of CWA use mCARE (mCARE-APP/mCARE-SMS version) to routinely submit selected behavioral and developmental progress parameters. MHPs utilize the web-based data visualization tool mCARE-DMP (Data Management Platform), to view the submitted data and support evidence-based decision making.\n\nThe contribution of this paper to HCI literature is threefold. First, this paper describes the design, development, and evaluation of mCARE, which is the first mobile-based tool to routinely report behavior and developmental parameters of CWA in LMICs by caregivers. The evaluation of this application demonstrates how the collaborations between the care professionals and caregivers are crucial for such technologies to work properly. Second, this paper reports a novel way to capture the impact of COVID-19 on CWA by using mCARE. We report how COVID-19 had a wide range of impact on various CWA based on their familial circumstances, socioeconomic condition, and geographic location. Finally, this paper describes how the impact of such digital behavior monitoring platform is shaped by familial values of the children and caregivers. We demonstrate how the use of this application was impacted by the patriarchal social structure and other social norms. Thus, this paper makes an important contribution in the HCI scholarship on designing mental health technologies with the people in LMICs (especially in the Global South)."

Besides smart-phone technology, several other technologies are also used to monitor and support children with ASD  [9, 25] . Our thorough review revealed the use of different technologies as follows: (i) wearable devices like a smartwatch  [29, 30] , wrist/chest/ankle bands  [31] [32] [33] , GPS  [34] , head-mounted displays  [35] , and cameras  [36, 37]  (51 papers); (ii) Tablet  [38, 39] , iPad  [40, 41]  or mobile applications  [27, 28, 42 ] (58 papers); (iii) Virtual Reality (VR)  [35]  (11 papers), and; (iv) Robots  [43]  (14 papers). Multiple web-based mobile health (mHealth) apps are proposed to continuously monitor the symptoms and progress of children with ASD including My JAKE (Janssen Autism Knowledge Engine)  [28, 44] .\n\nEarly identification of ASD symptoms is crucial for the ASD treatment process  [11, 12]  and hence research in the domain of ASD in LMICs is mostly done in the area of screening  [11] [12] [13] . Examples of this category include Prottoy  [14] , Autism Barta  [11] , Autism Severity Assessment App  [45]  (Bangladesh), Autism&Beyond  [46]  (South Africa), 12 m [47] (India, Pakistan, Zambia), ACCESS  [48]  (Uganda, Sri Lanka), AHC-DMAT  [49]  (Cambodia), and MDAT  [50]  (Malawi). A 2018 cross-sectional study  [51]  in Bangladesh emphasized the importance of early detection and decentralization of healthcare service delivery in the domain of ASD care. mCARE addresses the shortcomings of the aforementioned projects in multiple ways: i) it has been developed considering the socio-cultural-financial aspects of the population; ii) it includes module to be used by both caregivers and MHPs; iii) to include the mass population, both app and SMS version of mCARE are developed and deployed in 4 institutes (public and private), and; iv) it monitors both behavioral and milestone parameters using locally accepted scales. Successful completion of this project served as a proof of concept that persons living in an LMIC can effectively use a carefully designed mHealth application and that such applications can improve overall outcomes and quality of care of ASD."

      "title": "3.1. Challenge Identification",
      "text": "First, we interviewed 20 parents of children with ASD (12 female, 8 male) in Bangladesh and learned about their challenges in understanding their child's progress and in reporting those to the MHPs. Snowball sampling  [52]  was used to recruit these participants and continued until a saturation point  [53]  is reached. Since it was difficult to reach the participants in person, who are distributed all over the country, we used phone or Viber calls for the interview that lasted for 22 min on average. The mean age of the parents was 37.1 and the mean age of children with ASD was 10.7  [54] .\n\nSecond, we conducted 4 focus groups discussion (FGD) sessions in Dhaka and Chittagong, Bangladesh from May 2017 to July 2017 to identify the challenges faced in the current treatment process and find the potential of an mHealth tool to address these challenges. 28 MHPs, 2 government officials, and 10 parents of CWA participated in these sessions. The MHPs were selected on a random basis from the conveniencesampled institutions  [55] . One of the clinical coordinators of the research team moderated the FGDs which are audio recorded and later transcribed and analyzed.\n\nThese FGDs frequently highlighted the current situation of scarcity of skilled MHPs. We qualitatively analyzed the interview and FGD notes using thematic analysis  [56]  and grounded theory  [57] . The interviews and FGD sessions revealed the following challenges faced by the caregivers on a regular basis: 1) lack of time during visits to express the condition of their children; 2) lack of regular communication with practitioners, and; 3) lack of knowledge in general (what to focus on, what to achieve next etc.). In contrast, that of the practitioners were: 1) lack of data points to get the whole picture; 2) irregular visits with commonly exaggerated information; 3) failure to answer questions with clarity; 4) limited time window during visits, and; 5) lack of communication (no feedback) between visits. From heretofore, we will use PC# and CC# to refer to practitioners' or caregivers' challenge number. Along with the aforementioned challenges, three themes came up again and again as the major constraints in the care system for children with ASD in resource scarce contexts -a) financial hardship for parents to arrange frequent visits (a visit to major cities typically requires patients to spend BDT 800-1600 (approximately USD 10-20)  [54] ) and to accurately report to MHPs; b) lack of availability of MHPs, and; c) lack of availability of longitudinal data of behavioral changes. We included participants from the family welfare department of the Government of Bangladesh to take their input in terms of Government's willingness to make it a scalable and sustainable project in future. One interesting observation from this two step challenge identification process was the unanimous acceptability among the caregivers of an mHealth tool that might help them to improve the quality of care. As one caregiver said: \"I always carry phone with me. Actually, all the adult members of my family have mobile phones. If spending some minutes from my son help me to get better treatment, get better attention, and doctors are ok with it..why not?\"."

Both DSM-5 and Indian Scale of Autism Assessment (ISAA), used for developing the list of behavior parameters to be monitored, are validated in Bangladesh.

The MHPs and parents discarded/altered multiple developmental progress parameters mentioned in Vineland-II as those either do not culturally fit or are not considered as priority. For example, most of the caregivers discarded the 'memorize the address' parameter saying \"\u2026we never let our kid go outside the house alone. Even the gate is under lock and key all the time. So, I don't think it is that important.\" Also, sometimes the MHPs and caregivers have conflicting opinion in terms of importance of certain parameters. As one of the MHPs said: \"We consider self-hygiene (like cleaning themselves after pooping), self-eating, or getting dressed very important whereas many parents think that these will be learnt by the kids later because it is very common for parents in Bangladesh to do these things for their kids (even for normal ones) for long period of time. Parents are more concerned about education (learning colors, alphabet etc.).\"\n\nNumber of parameters adapted from Vineland-II adaptive behavior scale and selected for each age group is summarized in Table  2 ."

We collaborated with two of the largest government ASD research and treatment institutes, National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) and Institute of Pediatric Neuro-disorder & Autism (IPNA), to recruit 100 caregivers of CWA from each. The participants are divided into two groups -mCARE-APP (  50 ) and mCARE-SMS (50) who will be later using the app and SMS version of mCARE. Each group is further divided in test  (25)  and control (25) groups. Typically, in Bangladesh, families with low and high socioeconomic resources receive treatment from public and private organizations respectively. To include participants from all socioeconomic classes, we included two private organizations -Nishpap (means sinless) and AWF (Autism Welfare Foundation). 50 participants are chosen from each of these schools divided into test  (25)  and control  (25)  groups only for the mCARE-APP study. Our FGD sessions revealed that all the parents/caregivers of these children have smartphones and so mCARE-SMS is not applicable in this scenario. A total of 16 MHPs used the webbased mCARE data management platform (mCARE-DMP) to monitor and utilize the data submitted by the caregivers in their treatment process (Table  3 )."

This required 6-8 min by the MHPs. Majority of the caregivers are assigned 6 ~13 parameters (67%) with varied frequency of submissions (daily/weekly/biweekly/monthly) as requested by the MHPs. Later, based on the discussion with each caregiver, MHPs selected one or two developmental progress/milestone parameters from each of the four categories (communication, daily living skills, socialization, and motor skills). The frequency of submission for milestone parameters is selected as monthly and justified by MHP 9 saying:\n\n\"These developmental progress parameters do not change in days or weeks. So, monthly should be fine. Also, we don't exactly need too many data points on these since we do not use them for treatment purpose unlike behavioral parameters.\"\n\nFinally, demographic and baseline values of behavioral and milestone parameters are collected from all 300 participants. For behavioral parameters the scale was from 0 to 10 (0 means never and 10 means almost always as mentioned in the ISAA scale) and for developmental progress parameters the scale was from 0 to 2 (with 0, 1, and 2 stands for never, sometimes, and always respectively as mentioned in Vineland-II scale). While the MHP was recording this information in paper, one researcher recorded the values in the mCARE database. Along with this, we also collected baseline information regarding satisfaction level (towards MHPs and quality of care), basic knowledge of ASD, and travel time and cost for each visit from all participants. This portion was done by the researcher only since we felt that the caregivers would not feel comfortable providing the satisfaction level for MHPs/quality of care in the presence of an MHP. The same set of data is also collected from all 300 participants at the end of the study."

A larger (2 h) group discussion was scheduled quarterly to discuss the experience of long-term use of mCARE-DMP and its impact on the quality of care of CWA. We also had an end of study interview with 30 caregivers to collect their experience of using mCARE-APP or mCARE-SMS. (collect empirical data to underpin the understanding of local values and practices of the stakeholders) step, we relied on exhaustive field visits, FGD discussions, face to face and phone interviews, online surveys, and long experience of the mCARE team members in providing care to children with ASD, and designing, developing mHealth applications for targeted communities in Bangladesh  [7, 9, 12, 16, 21, 23, [26] [27] [28] 51] .

But I don't see any noticeable improvement in my child's behavior. I somehow thought there would be a miracle and my son would get better once I start. Also, it is too many (parameters).\"\n\nBased on this, MHPs asked 20 caregivers (10 mCARE-APP and 10 mCARE-SMS test users) two specific questions: i) what number of parameters they would feel comfortable submitting and ii) what we can do to help them benefited. Then we discussed the findings during our weekly meeting (with all researchers and MHPs) and made the following changes in our protocol: i) maximum number of parameters to be monitored would be restricted to 5-7 parameters; ii) Monthly call from clinical coordinators, and; iii) Monthly free face to face meeting with senior mental health professionals (director of IPNA and NIMH) who served as site principal investigators.

This is now available through mCARE-DMP, and so MHPs can make more informed, data driven decisions. During the quarterly group sessions with participating MHPs, we identified cases where longitudinal data (or other features of mCARE-DMP) helped them in making evidence-based decisions. These quarterly sessions are centered around 4 questions: i) Do you think it is helping you in managing your patients? ii) Can you give a case example for each feature you used? iii) Can you give any example where mCARE-DMP helped you in making evidence-based decision making? iv) Can you please elaborate and compare your experience pre and post deployment of mCARE in terms of patient management?\n\nAlong with the availability of longitudinal data, MHPs identified four specific visit scenarios, that they regularly experience, where mCARE-DMP was helpful. Some use case scenarios are given below that came up during these discussions: Case 1: Focusing Only On Certain Parameters: According to the MHPs, many parents are only interested to talk about certain parameters or issues that they think important. This happens due to socio-cultural impact and personal belief. As MHP 2 said:\n\n\"Many of the parents come to me and spend the whole-time on couple of specific issues like does he respond when called by name or does he smile socially or does he avoid eye contact. These are important parameters, but their kids have other important issues to talk about too. But they are simply not interested.\"\n\nWhen we asked certain caregivers about this, we got the following context.\n\n\"I live in an extended family and people want to make sure kids respect the seniors. As you know, in our culture not to smile or respond when a senior calls is considered as very rude, I want to make sure my child learn these first. Also, it is not the case that I do not want to discuss the others (parameters). They (MHPs) simply do not have that time. If I have 5 min, I first like to talk about these priority points.\" -Nishpap 11.\n\nBut now, MHPs can simply select the other important parameters and monitor them using mCARE.\n\nCase 2: Suppressing Certain Parameters: Many times, MHPs fail to notice some important features during caregiver visits. This is because sometimes parents do not want to show things that they find embarrassing and even coach their children not to do those things during visits. MHP 3 detailed one specific experience as follows:\n\n\"..I was about to finish the visit and then all on a sudden this kid banged his forehead so hard in my table that I was afraid his skull has been fractured. But I saw his parents were not that much concerned. This gave me an idea that this is not the first time. They never reported this issue before and hence I did not select this parameter to be monitored. Then I asked them to be open with me. Initially, the father said that it is not a big deal but later he said he did not want others to know about this issue specially when the door is open and others in line just outside my door can see. Once they are submitting the values from their home, they are typically honest (since no one else is seeing that except me).\" Case 3: Over Emphasizing Symptoms/Outliers: Caregivers travel to IPNA and NIMH from all around the country typically 3 or 4 times a year (according to our field study). There is this common belief among caregivers that they would get better attention and treatment if they exaggerate the values. Also, they inadvertently highlight certain parameters due to recall bias. MHP 7 summarized this common experience as:\n\n\"Any parameter that the caregivers like to prioritize, would get a higher value. And you know, whatever they say that is the gold standard."

MHPs mentioned the term 'complete picture' which they often miss but crucial for treating CWA. MHP 1 said the following:\n\n\"Sometimes I used to feel shaky to prescribe since I was not confident to prescribe with so few and seemingly exaggerated or vague (PC2, PC3) information (received during the face-to-face visits).

They are asking me questions with examples. Like, my child ate rich food and the next day he had these issues. Should I be aware of this? Even one mother came with a notebook showing me that when she notices some abnormal value (while entering that value in mCARE), she tries to record what happened that day to show me. I have not seen this before.\"\n\nCaregiver of AWF 21 said how mCARE is boosting the positive behavior as: \"I regularly check the longitudinal graph of my children and take necessary steps accordingly. This also helps us keep our motivation high in taking care of our child.

The answer lies in the mindset of these two groups of users who come from very different socio-economic class. mCARE-SMS users, belonging to the lower socio-economic class, were happy even to see a MHP in public hospital whereas mCARE-APP users always expected more compared to what they receive in public hospitals. As a result, there was a big gap in the satisfaction level between these two groups prior to the deployment of mCARE (6.6 vs 6.08 and 7.8 vs 6.85). mCARE-SMS users simply submitted selected behavioral parameter values with no other features. Hence, their satisfaction level improved by a simple margin (0.8) post deployment. But mCARE-APP provided many features (longitudinal view of submitted data, biweekly report, milestone parameters etc.) that helped the mCARE-APP users resulting in a big jump for satisfaction level (average satisfaction improved by 1.69 and 1.84 respectively)."

Interestingly we found that COVID-19 impacted the health outcomes of CWA in both positive and negative ways as detailed below:\n\nNegative Impact: Case 1: \"Due to not going outside for the corona virus, my child was at home all the time. He really missed going to the school or park. For this reason, my child shouted and cried loudly. His tendency of screaming really went up. We are being locked down in our congested (small) apartment, and our neighbor's house is very close to our flat. They complained to us when my child got hyper, and sometimes they quarreled with us. For, many nights, I could not sleep\" -(Father of IPNA 167) (Fig.  5 ).\n\nNegative Impact: Case 2: Multiple caregivers reported of stress due to financial situations because of COVID-19. At least 5 head of households lost their jobs due to the pandemic. Majority of the participating families are affected in some way. For many families, survival became the priority and that hampered the care of the CWA. Mother of NIMH 97 (whose husband lost job) said the following:\n\n\"\u2026 my husband lost his job. It became impossible to talk with him. He is continuously thinking how to support the family. We don't have enough savings. He shouts at home and always in irritated mode. I also don't have the money to buy medicine. All these have impacted my son. He became more aggressive in his behavior (as shown in Fig.  6 ).\" Positive Impact: Case 1: \"This COVID was actually a good thing in disguise for me. I worked remotely from home. I was able to spend quality time with my kid. Before, I would leave for the office early morning and came back late in the evening. Also, I would be too tired. But now I am talking and playing with him regularly. Sometimes, we go to the roof in the afternoon. I think all these helped him to do better.\" -(Father of AWF 24).\n\nPositive impact: Case 2: \"We came to the village (hometown) because it is much cheaper here (you don't need to pay rent). My husband has started a small shop here. We have a large family here. My kid is playing with her cousins and getting the chance to spend time with her grandparents.

We demonstrate how the success of mCARE was dependent upon the collaboration between the MHPs and the caregivers. We also discussed how mCARE performed as a reliable tool for measuring the impact of COVID-19 on the CWA. The reported data demonstrated how the CWA's situation during the COVID-19 was dependent on their family members. Further, we also showed how the data collected through mCARE from the home settings helped to gather accurate, reliable data overcoming bias and promote proactiveness among the caregivers. This paper also discusses the deep-rooted socio-cultural-economic norms/beliefs, their impact on ASD care and how mCARE was adjusted/accommodated to adhere those situations. Thus, this paper helps the future designers and practitioners in HCI understand the complex landscape of designing mental health technologies in the LMICs in the Global South."

      "title": "1. Introduction",
      "text": "With the prevalence of smartphones, mHealth has increasingly been used to offer health interventions in timely and accessible manners, with positive outcomes. These interventions span from nudging users towards healthier lifestyles based on behaviour tracking  [17] , to aiding users in monitoring their glucose levels  [23] . Recently, the domain of chronic disease and pain management has received increased attention, supporting patients in monitoring, understanding and managing their chronic condition  [9, 14, 27]  via mobile applications and related sensors.\n\nHowever, mHealth interventions suffer from high attrition rates  [25] , with interventions experiencing a dropout rate up to 40% for randomised controlled trials (RCTs), and up to 50% in real-world settings. Several motivational features have been researched, encompassing behaviour change techniques and persuasive principles, to address these high attrition rates and increase intervention adherence  [13] . Gamification is one example subdomain that involves the use of game-like elements in non-game environments, such as points, badges, leaderboards and personalised avatars  [6, 8] . Another example is social support, where features like community forums or the ability to share progress with others can offer a sense of belonging and accountability  [22] . These elements can be powerful motivators, especially when users feel connected and supported by those facing similar health challenges.\n\nAs these motivational features within mHealth often aim to support positive behavioural change, about half of the interventions guide their development through motivational theories and frameworks. For example, half of the mHealth studies promoting physical activity rely on theories or frameworks to implement motivational techniques, with Self-Determination Theory -focusing on intrinsic motivation and the conditions under which it flourishes -being the most common framework (32%), followed by Behavioural Economics -understanding and modifying behaviour through external consequences -being second (20%).\n\nWhile studies employing motivational features have shown positive outcomes, such as supporting increased physical activity, several surveys also show mixed  [35]  to positive no results  [32]  across interventions. This can be attributed due to guidelines stemming from heterogeneous studies and intervention types  [20, 35]  or a lack of rigorous and standardised frameworks denoting which techniques are appropriate for certain interventions  [5, 24] . Recent work of Geuens et al. tried to bridge the gap between the motivational features being employed, as well as the underlying psychological theories driving them, with a set of 'dyadic lenses'  [13] . Subsequently, they applied these lenses by reviewing mobile apps for managing chronic arthritis, and found that features providing system credibility were amongst the most implemented, whereas social features turned out to be the least implemented  [16] . However, they did not find a link between the features being implemented or not, and the actual rating of the intervention, leading to inconclusive results regarding the efficacy of the implemented techniques.\n\nAs for the adjacent field of mHealth interventions addressing chronic musculoskeletal pain, there has been budding work investigating an app design with few gamification elements from a health expert perspective, with promising results  [18] , but still lacking any concrete design guidelines. As chronic musculoskeletal pain is a very prevalent problem amongst Belgian employees, with 60% experiencing pain on a frequent basis, and one third of them even being on prolonged sick-leave due to these pain complaints  [7] , the need to develop interventions with high adherence rates is high. Therefore, using the work of Geuens et al. as a cornerstone, we set out to design motivational features for supporting mHealth interventions for chronic musculoskeletal pain and assess their effectiveness in mHealth apps for chronic pain management. Concretely, we aim to answer the following research question: RQ1 Which motivational design features are preferred by employees in an intervention supporting their chronic musculoskeletal pain, and why? RQ2 Does this preferences differ between employees (intervention receivers) and health coaches (intervention providers)?\n\nThrough in-depth focus groups with 23 participants in total (from the perspective of 14 employees as well as 9 health coaches), we extract design goals related to implementing motivational features in chronic pain mHealth interventions to steer future work."

Self-monitoring tools that allow users to log pain levels, activity, and medication usage can empower patients and aid healthcare providers in identifying patterns for improved management plans  [9] . Additionally, mHealth apps often deliver educational resources on pain management, stress-reduction techniques, and appropriate exercises, making relevant information readily available. Studies also highlight the benefits of integrated remote coaching and online support groups within mHealth platforms. This access to professional guidance and peer support combats feelings of isolation and has demonstrated the ability to boost adherence to treatment plans. However, while mHealth interventions have shown positive outcomes, there is a mixed level of success  [33] , with one of the main reasons being high attrition rates. A recent study showed that in both controlled RCT settings, as well as real world interventions, the average drop-out rate tends to be 40% (95% CI 16-63) and 49% (95% CI 27-70) respectively  [25] , showing a need for additional understanding to increase retention rates."

      "text": "Motivational features have often been studied as a tool to increase adherence, taking on the form of gamification, behaviour change techniques or other persuasive design strategies  [13] . Gamification for example is defined by Deterding as the use of game-like elements in non-game contexts  [8] . These gamification elements comprise of small components built with a single purpose (i.e. leaderboards for social comparison, badges and streaks for incentives, etc.) -which differ from full-fledged and immersive game experiences as in serious games  [35]  and can be used in mHealth interventions to improve adherence and engagement, support behaviour change, or improve self-management and health knowledge. Another valuable approach lies in the use of nudges and reminders. Nudges -subtle cues within an interface that guide user behaviour -can be highly effective in promoting positive actions  [2] . Reminders, whether push notifications or inapp messages, can help keep users on track with treatment plans and encourage logging of important health data.\n\nStudies have shown that some mHealth interventions incorporating motivational features lead to improved patient engagement, higher treatment satisfaction, and increased treatment adherence compared to traditional, non-gamified approaches  [19, 29] . Additionally, these techniques stimulate behavioural change by playing on both extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, supporting long-term health behaviour adherence  [3] . However, surveys also show that when motivational features are implemented without careful consideration, their effectiveness decreases and can even result in adverse outcomes  [32, 35] . This is due to a lack of standardisation or frameworks that guide which gamification techniques should be selected  [24] , as well as a lack of generalisability across different subdomains within mHealth interventions  [20] . While the subdomain of chronic pain interventions has received increasing attention from the gamification community  [1, 18, 19, 26] , it also lacks any formal overview regarding which motivational features are preferred and which are not -a gap that this work aims to address (Fig.  1 )."

First, each motivational design was discussed (Table  1 ) and users were asked to individually rate each motivational design on a 7-point Likert scale, ranging from ---(-3, not preferable) to +++ (+3, highly preferable), with 0 being a neutral score (indifferent). After explaining and rating each design (approx. 20 min), we transitioned to a group discussion elaborating each design and elaborating why each participant assigned their respective rating (approx. 80 min). Using the ratings, as well as the transcripts from the group discussion, we were then able to rank the feasibility of each motivational design, extract related themes, and describe general design take-aways regarding the use of these techniques in chronic pain mHealth interventions from both a patient as well as a therapist perspective."

These results highlight the importance of self-monitoring and data-driven insights in mHealth for chronic pain management. Visualizations and goal-setting tools appear to provide tangible benefits, fostering a sense of understanding and control (\u00b5 E = 2.07, \u00b5 HC = 2.11). Interestingly, the higher preference for logging among health coaches (\u00b5 E = 0.86, \u00b5 HC = 3.0) suggests that such features might be particularly valuable for enabling communication and targeted coaching during sessions.

Reminders framed with an authoritative tone (e.g., \"Your health coach advises you to ...\") were moderately preferred, while scarcity-based reminders (e.g., \"Today's a unique day to finish ...\") were the least favoured by both participants groups (\u00b5 E = -0.5, \u00b5 HC = 0.0).

This is in line with guidelines for using badges by Zichermann et al.  [36] , suggesting that badges should not be over-congratulatory or reward rote tasks. Instead, as suggested by HC 3 , reward mechanisms such as praises should hold \"greater meaning by supporting personal, user-defined goals within the application\". Points and badges received lukewarm reactions (\u00b5 E = 0.71, \u00b5 HC = 0.67), with HC 5 expressing the need for the badges to \"be relevant and related to health\", and E 1 saying: \"It's positive, a nice extra, but not the reason I would use the app for\".\n\nStreaks (\u00b5 E = 0.71, \u00b5 HC = 0.56) and time pressure (\u00b5 E = 0.07, \u00b5 HC = 0.78), while potentially useful according to 14 participants, were seen as more divisive techniques, mainly due to their pressuring nature.

For example, praises, reminders emphasising consistent behaviour, or philanthropic nudges were unanimously considered as welcome additions, whereas competition leaderboards, scarcity reminders and time pressures playing in on negative emotions (i.e. through pressure or the sense of competition) sparked considerable amounts of discussion during the focus groups. While previous work categorised gamification on how these techniques were integrated (structural vs. content gamification -  [11, 30] ), which target-user they tailor to (achievers, explorers, killers or socialisers -  [10, 28] ) or the type of motivation they target the techniques to (internal vs. external gamification -  [4] ), recent work highlighted a delineation on the type of emotions these motivational techniques play on -with white hat techniques focusing on rewarding good behaviour and playing in on positive emotions, whereas black hat techniques play on the sense of urgency or anxiety to incentivise users  [12] . In our work, we noticed that these so-called black-hat techniques sparked a considerable amount of negative feelings for users coping with chronic pain, leading to discomfort and distrust.

Health coaches deemed data logging as an essential part of any health intervention in order to provide accurate feedback and support, and change intervention needs when necessary. Consequently, features that support consistently logging and checking in on the intervention were also seen as more preferable by health coaches compared to employees, such as consistency reminders and time pressure. Employees on the other hand found logging to be more tedious, and emphasised the burden of daily tracking through questionnaires. Thus, whilst health coaches highlighted the need for consistent logging in order to support personalised interventions, we need to carefully consider the timeliness and frequency, and not [overdo it with the pressure to not burden the user]."

      "text": "Worsening conditions are detrimental across all types of chronic disease management. However, whereas with diabetes monitoring or chronic cardiac conditions a sense of urgency is imperative, this might not always be the case for people coping with chronic pain due to the condition being characterised by a lack of immediate relief. This lead to participants emphasising the need for different, less confrontational ways of communicating insights -for example, while insights and goal setting were among the most preferred techniques score-wise, participants denoted that it might have adverse effects for users experiencing prolonged periods of chronic pain. This was -according to participants -to avoid their tendency to catastrophise, a common phenomenon amongst people coping with chronic pain  [21] . This theme of avoiding negative information extended beyond wording -as certain graphical elements also sparked anxiety and discomfort during focus groups. Previous work emphasises the use of colour feedback due to its ability to shape a person's mood and feelings, therefore playing a role in shaping attitudes  [31] , leading to its use in previous mHealth interventions  [3] . However, participants in our study expressed caution in the use of alarming colours, such as using red to indicate time pressure or missed goals, as they could cause additional anxiety in moments where users already struggle to cope or experience pressure.\n\nTherefore, it is essential to be mindful about how motivational features might promote negative patterns that could instigate catastrophising thinking. Designers should prioritise techniques that help users understand their progress and support their sense of self-efficacy. This might involve careful framing of information, incorporating tailored guidance from health coaches, and avoiding elements that cause pressure or anxiety, especially for users that are prone to catastrophising. However, we do want to mention that some users preferred seeing a sense of urgency or pressure to instigate motivation. Based on previous mHealth research we assume that the need to avoid negative information likely depends on the type of end user, i.e. the often used 'Warrior vs. Worrier' distinction  [15] , and users that are less likely to catastrophise (warriors) would have lesser need to avoid negative information in order to make more informative decisions. Therefore, the ability to personalise or tailor communication towards the type of end user would prove to be beneficial in future work."

Additionally, several ethical and privacy concerns were raised, such as social updates during sick leaves, causing reluctance to engage with the intervention in fear of being scrutinised. This contrasts previous works stating that social motivational features are the second most often used across mHealth interventions  [35] , and competition tends to be well-received  [3] . Therefore, given the personal trajectory of chronic pain management, along with privacy and ethical concerns, we recommend limiting social interactions within the intervention, or at least ensuring strong moderation, to best support chronic pain management."

      "title": "5.5. Ethical Considerations in Motivational Feature Design",
      "text": "As shown in this paper, the use of motivational features in mHealth interventions for pain management raises important ethical considerations. While these features can enhance engagement and adherence, they also have the potential to cause harm if not implemented thoughtfully. Our findings highlighted several key ethical concerns:\n\n-Certain motivational features, such as time pressure, scarcity reminders, and competition leaderboards, can induce stress and anxiety in users. This is particularly concerning for individuals with prolonged or severe chronic pain, who may already be experiencing heightened stress levels. -Excessive use of external rewards, such as points and badges, may undermine intrinsic motivation for behaviour change. It is crucial to strike a balance between extrinsic and intrinsic motivators to foster long-term adherence. -Social features, while potentially supportive, raise concerns about privacy and data security. Users may be hesitant to share personal health information in a public forum, and there is a risk of data being misused or misinterpreted. -Some motivational features, such as those that highlight negative health outcomes or compare users to others, may exacerbate catastrophising tendencies in individuals with chronic pain. This can lead to increased anxiety and a sense of hopelessness.\n\n-It is important to consider the digital divide and ensure that motivational features are accessible to all users, regardless of their technological literacy or socioeconomic status.\n\nTo address these ethical concerns, we argue to focus on motivational features that emphasise positive reinforcement, such as praise, goal setting, and social support. Avoid features that induce pressure, anxiety, or negative social comparison. Use external rewards judiciously and ensure that they complement, rather than replace, intrinsic motivation for behaviour change. Implement robust privacy safeguards for social features and ensure that users have control over their data. Consider individual differences in pain experiences, coping mechanisms, and preferences when designing motivational features. Offer personalised options and allow users to customise their experience. Finally, design motivational features that are accessible to all users, regardless of their technological literacy or socioeconomic status. By carefully considering these ethical implications, designers can create mHealth interventions that not only promote engagement and adherence but also prioritise the well-being and autonomy of individuals with chronic pain."

      "text": "In this work, we set out to design an extensive list of 24 motivational features that could aid chronic pain employees in adhering to an mHealth intervention. Through 5 focus groups with health coaches and employees, we inquired about the needs for the different techniques through preference rankings and thinkaloud discussions. These studies highlighted the promise of incorporating such motivational features for chronic pain management within mHealth interventions, while emphasising the vital importance of an ethically designed and usercentred approach. Our focus groups revealed a strong preference for white-hat motivational techniques that leverage positive reinforcement and avoid elements that could spark anxiety or discomfort. Designers must be particularly cautious with competitive elements like leaderboards, as they may lead to social comparison, exacerbate catastrophising tendencies, and raise ethical concerns about privacy and vulnerability.\n\nWhilst this work gave extensive insights in how motivational features should be applied for supporting employees in a chronic musculoskeletal pain intervention, we want to note in order to generalise these results, future work should also consider the broad range of techniques and assess them with end users in their respective subdomain."

      "title": "1. Introduction",
      "text": "Nowadays, advancements in medicine and improved living conditions have improved the protection against communicable diseases, which are illnesses transmitted from person to person  [3, 33] . However, today non-communicable diseases, or lifestyle diseases such as diabetes, cardiovascular, and respiratory diseases, are chronic diseases that account for up to 70% of all deaths worldwide  [34] . Lifestyle diseases are partially a result of a combination of genetic and physiological factors but primarily stem from unhealthy behaviors such as bad food habits and physical inactivity  [28, 34] .\n\nThe risk of developing lifestyle diseases could be prevented through healthy behaviors and lifestyle habits  [30] . Prevention can be promoted by holistically improving health. Health is defined as a state of complete physical, mental, and social well-being  [22] . Improving health holistically can be done physically through behaviors such as regular physical activity or healthy food habits, mentally by addressing conditions such as depression or anxiety, and socially by increasing social engagement  [21, 30, 37] . As the world population ages and life expectancy increases, there is a heightened risk of developing lifestyle diseases, emphasizing the importance of preventive measures  [5] . However, the process of preventing lifestyle diseases through health behavior change is difficult and is often marked by lapses and relapses into unhealthy behaviors  [15] . A key element to fostering behavior change is to create goals using goal setting  [11] . Following well-defined goals (i.e., Walk the 1 km track around the park three times a week) is associated with better shorter and longer-term healthy behavior change  [25] .\n\nIn recent years, mHealth apps have gained prevalence as a tool to promote healthy behavior change, by empowering individuals and health professionals with systems to track and monitor goal progression  [12, 19] . However, a major issue with mHealth apps is the low retention rate and faltering engagement of individuals using the apps  [20] . The use of game design elements in apps, also referred to as gamification, has been shown to improve individuals' intrinsic motivation leading to continued use of mHealth apps resulting in higher engagement and a higher chance of achieving their goals  [9, 20] . Previous research has pointed out that when individuals using gamified mHealth apps are given goals, they experience more stress when the difficulty of the goal is higher than their current skill level  [14] . The stress is potentially caused due to the participants not experiencing Flow  [7, 14] . Flow is a state of mind in which an individual is fully immersed in an activity  [7] . Game elements can be designed to increase Flow, particularly the concept of level systems as they are designed to provide challenges that match the skill level of individuals using the app, thus facilitating Flow  [16, 26] . However, currently, there is a gap in the literature regarding the impact of level system structures on the engagement of participants in mHealth interventions.\n\nResearch on mHealth gamification has shown that configuring goals in unified and non-unified gamification structures can significantly impact participants' experiences in achieving health goals  [27] . In non-unified gamification structures, participants are promoted and rewarded to achieve goals in each health dimension. In contrast, a unified gamification structure promotes and rewards participants for completing goals of all health dimensions in a combined structure  [27] . These gamification structure variants can be configured in the form of a level system designed to promote holistic health goals. The level structure variants used in this paper are referred to as single-stream and multi-stream level structures, where a stream represents a series of progressively higher levels.\n\nA multi-stream level structure contains multiple (i.e., non-unified) levels simultaneously. A single-stream level structure contains one (i.e., unified) level at a time.\n\nThis study aimed to research which of the level structures is most engaging in mHealth apps. We expected that multi-stream level structures would intrinsically motivate individuals to people more than single-stream levels, due to the design giving participants increased autonomy to complete goals within the health domain of their choosing. Thus resulting in participants being more engaged with the mHealth app. Our hypothesis is as follows: 'When participants are given goals in a multi-stream level structure, they will be more engaged with the mHealth app.'. In this paper, we tested the hypothesis by evaluating the effects of a multi-stream level structure on the engagement of participants in a health intervention using a gamified mHealth app."

      "text": "The concept of engagement in the context of this paper, refers to an individual's behavior leading to interactions with the mHealth app. To incentivize these interactions, the mHealth app used in this study makes use of behavior-change concepts. Behavior change in individuals requires capability, encompassing both psychological and physical abilities to execute the targeted behavior, along with the opportunity facilitated by external factors enabling the behavior, and the motivation to enact the behavior  [18] . mHealth apps particularly have the potential to enhance the motivational aspect. Motivation can be categorized into extrinsic and intrinsic motivation, with extrinsic stemming from external factors and intrinsic from personal interest  [8] . Intrinsic motivation tends to endure longer because it fulfills the three internal needs of the individual: competence, the need to feel capable of the behavior; autonomy, the need for self-control; and relatedness, the need for connection with behaviors and social support  [8] . mHealth apps can target intrinsic motivation by incorporating features that appeal to the three needs for promoting intrinsic motivation, leading to higher engagement  [10] ."

      "title": "2.2. Levels",
      "text": "Gamification has increasingly been utilized in mHealth apps to increase participant engagement in interventions across various health domains, including mental health, physical health, and general promotion of healthy behavior change  [6] [10,35] . The concept of levels in the context of games is a space available to a player during the completion of an objective  [26] . Levels are generally sequential, with each level having progressively difficult objectives to complete  [17, 26] . The increasing difficulty generally matches the player's skill progression throughout completing the levels  [26] . Players can progress in multiple levels simultaneously, and each level has its own set of objectives to complete to advance to the next  [17] . In some configurations, players can revert to the previous level due to rules such as, not completing a level on time or failing to complete all objectives within a game session. The structure of difficulty progression present in level systems can be mapped to the skill and difficulty concepts of the Flow theory  [7] . The difficulty levels have directly been linked to affecting the Flow state of individuals  [36] . By structuring the difficulty of the level objectives optimally, participants may be prompted to experience Flow. Levels have also been used to incentivize engagement in games, by using progression locking, which locks certain areas of the apps until certain conditions are met, and progression blocking features which block all progression within the app until conditions are met  [24, 31] . The progress principle is a theory from the business management literature that states that individuals are more productive and perform better when they have the feeling of making progress toward their goals  [2] . Gaining small wins increases this feeling of progression. Game levels have been linked to the progress principle as they are designed to invoke feelings of progression and achievement of small objectives (i.e., goals)  [2, 26] . Therefore the goals in the level structures should be small enough for participants to gain small wins with an increasing difficulty to keep participants in Flow  [2, 7] ."

Qualitative data was gathered using interviews and surveys (i.e., created goals). This study took place over five weeks and consisted of two intervention periods, each consisting of fifteen days, separated by a one-week break. An overview of the study design can be seen in Fig.  1 . In the pre-intervention stage of the study, participants were randomly grouped into the study arm first receiving goals displayed in a single-stream level structure (SS-MS), or in the study arm first receiving goals displayed in a multi-stream level structure (MS-SS). In the intervention phase of the study, participants received health goals displayed in the respective level structure. After the break period, participants would serve as their control group and receive the other level structure for the second intervention period. Thus participants were exposed to both level structures. Before the intervention phase of the study, participants signed a paper-based informed consent form in person. All study procedures and data protection were reviewed and approved by the Ethical Review Board of the Eindhoven University of Technology (Experiment Reference: ERB2023ID547)."

Students were recruited at the sports center of the university through direct invitations by the researchers. They were given a survey requesting to create three increasingly difficult goals that they relate to, for each health dimension. The students who took part in the preparation stage of this study did not take part in the following stages. To recruit participants for the intervention stage of the study, convenience sampling was also employed  [29] . Participants eligible to take part in this study had to be eighteen or older. They also had to be enrolled as either a student or a staff member of a university in the Netherlands at the time of the study. Participants were recruited at a university in the Netherlands and recruitment was carried out via flyers and direct invitations to potential participants. Upon being approached, individuals received supplementary information about the study in the form of an information document, which included the overall goal of the study, its duration, and what a participant could expect to do during the study. Participants were also informed that all active participants had a chance of winning a reward at the end of the study.\n\nFig.  1 .

      "text": "GameBus. GameBus is a configurable gamification platform that enables research on health interventions through the rapid prototyping of digital health apps, designed to promote participant engagement with lifestyle goals  [32] . We used a custom configuration of GameBus as an mHealth app. The configuration built for the study was a multi-platform and cross-browser web app. In the app, participants were challenged to complete goals that improve their holistic health by promoting mental, social, and physical health goals. The app had three main pages: score points, leaderboards, and the levels page. The score points page displayed all available goals within the current level the participant was in. On this page, participants could also submit self-reports on the completion of the goals. Additionally, participants could optionally also describe how they completed the goal or attach photographic evidence of the goal being completed. For each self-report registered, participants got points towards the level system and progression bars. The progression bar feature was implemented to promote the concept of small wins. The leaderboard page displayed the total amount of points a participant has scored and the average amount of points scored by all participants. The levels page shown in Fig.  2 , displayed the total levels available within each dimension a participant is active in. This page also displayed how many points were needed to advance to the next level. Level System. For this study, we designed, implemented, and compared two different level system structures: 1) single-stream, and 2) multi-stream level structures. During the study, the mHealth app only displayed one of the two, level structures at a given time. We defined a stream of levels as a sequence of levels wherein players could advance or regress. As seen in Fig.  3   foot_8   foot_9   foot_10  , the single-stream level structure used in this study supported only one stream of levels, with each level containing goals of all health dimensions. However, in the multi-stream level structure, three single-stream levels exist in parallel. In the multi-stream level structure, each stream of levels consists of levels containing goals of a specific health dimension. Additionally, in the multi-stream level structure, participants could independently advance or regress within each stream without interference from other streams. Meaning participants could be in level two of the stream containing physical health goals, while simultaneously being in level three of the stream containing cognitive health goals. In both level structures, there were streams of three levels consisting of three goals per health dimension, resulting in an equal workload. At the start of the intervention, each participant began at level one. Both level structures had a total of nine unique goals. Each goal could be completed multiple times and consecutively, with a maximum amount of times based on the goal's frequency setting. Participants scored points by completing goals available within a level. Once a participant scored enough points within a level, they proceeded to the next level. The amount of points earned from completing a goal depended on the difficulty of the goal. The overall goal of the participants was to complete all the levels available to them. Once participants completed level three, no more goals were displayed in the app. Participants had fifteen days to complete all three levels before the phase of the intervention period ended. The system uses a form of progression blocking, when participants fail to complete level one within five days, level two within ten days, or level three within fifteen days, the system would reset and the participant would regress to the preceding level.\n\nThe goals used in the intervention phase of the study were aggregated versions of the goals created by the students during the preparation phase of the study. During the goal-creation phase, the students were asked to report how frequently they wanted to engage in certain activities before considering a goal to be completed. An example of a goal used during the intervention is the following: Level 1 -\"Talk to an (old) family member or friend\" 3x in five days. Level 2 -\"Plan an activity with another person\" 3x in five days. Level 3 -\"Talk to a new person today\" 3x in five days. To promote participant Flow, we reduced the difficulty of the lower levels by lowering the frequency required to advance to the next level. As a result, participants in level one needed to complete the goals once before advancing to level two. Level two required participants to complete the level two goal twice before progressing to level three. Level three required participants to complete the level 3 goal at the participant-reported frequency."

Active engagement was quantified by the number of goals performed by a participant, while passive engagement was determined by the number of navigational click-throughs made by a participant. Throughout the study, one survey was conducted to collect demographic information, and the Intrinsic Motivation Inventory (IMI) survey was conducted before, during, and after the intervention period to collect the perceived intrinsic motivation of the participants throughout the intervention. The IMI evaluates self-reported perceived intrinsic motivation through a 5-point Likert scale  [23] . Following the intervention period of the study, semi-structured interviews were carried out to gather qualitative data in the form of subjective participant opinions on the level structures, perceived engagement, and feedback on areas of improvement. The interviews were recorded using a smartphone and one of the researchers made notes on any points of significance."

Before conducting the analysis, the system data was preprocessed by removing outliers and premature dropouts (i.e., participants who did not take part in both intervention phases), and calculating the mean engagement of each participant. The data was subjected to Shapiro-Wilk and Anderson-Darling tests to evaluate their conformity to a normal distribution. The interquartile range was calculated to remove outliers. Furthermore, independent t-tests were conducted to determine the statistical significance between the groups, using a significance level of p = 0.05. Additionally, a statistical analysis was carried out between the two groups across each intervention period to examine the perceived intrinsic motivation of participants. Before conducting the analysis, the survey data was preprocessed equally to the engagement data. The group means were calculated for each IMI measurement period. Subsequently, a one-way ANOVA test was employed to ascertain the statistical significance between the two groups, using a significance level of p = 0.05. Lastly, thematic analysis was conducted on the interview data. Thematic analysis is a method to systematically organize and interpret the text to uncover themes relevant to the research aim  [4] . For thematic analysis, the interviews were automatically transcribed using two AI transcription tools: 1) Google Cloud's Chirp model  4  and 2) Amazon Web Service's Automatic Speech Recognition service  5  . A copy of the raw data of the AI-generated interview transcripts can be found on Figshare  [13] . The AI-generated transcription data was cross-checked with the researcher's notes to verify the validity, and transcription mistakes were changed. The transcriptions were read by one of the researchers to find any patterns, themes, and key points of significance present in the transcription data. The thematic analysis was done by hand and the notes were coded by grouping similar answers and comments from the participants together. The coded groups were grouped into themes and revised iteratively. Finally, the results were reported in a thematic analysis."

The total number of goals registered in the mHealth app by participants in the SS-MS study arm was 184, of which 99 were registered in the first phase of the intervention period and 85 were registered in the second intervention period. The total number of goals performed by participants in the MS-SS study arm was 172, of which 123 were before the break period and 49 were after the break period. Although the active engagement of participants of both study arms dropped, the over-time engagement of participants in the SS-MS study arm was higher when comparing group means. Additionally, when comparing means, the drop in active engagement over time was also lower in the SS-MS study arm as seen in Fig.  4 . However, the analysis conducted on the active engagement between the two groups during the first phase of the intervention resulted in a p-value of 0.68, and a p-value of 0.26 during the second phase of the intervention. Indicating no statistical significance between the two groups.\n\nPassive Engagement. The total number of navigational interactions participants made in the mHealth app by participants in the SS-MS study arm was 1098. In the first phase of the intervention, participants made 689 navigational interactions within the app, and 408 navigational interactions in the second phase of the intervention. The total number of navigational interactions performed by participants in the MS-SS study arm was 690.

During the break period, 22 participants completed the second IMI survey, and in the post-intervention phase of the study, 19 participants completed the IMI survey.\n\nThe perceived enjoyment of participants in both study arms steadily dropped over the three IMI measurement phases. However, the perceived enjoyment of the participants in the MS-SS study arm dropped lower than the perceived enjoyment of the participants in the SS-MS study arm. Although the perceived enjoyment of the participants in the MS-SS study arm measured in the postintervention phase increased when compared to the perceived enjoyment of this group during the break period. The results of the statistical analysis conducted on the perceived enjoyment of both study arms show that there was no statistical significance between the two groups, with a p-value of 0.77.\n\nThe perceived competence of participants in both study arms steadily dropped throughout the three measurement phases. As seen in Fig.  6 , the participants in the SS-MS study arm scored slightly higher in perceived competence during all measurement phases. The results may indicate that participants over time felt less confident in their ability to complete the goals given to them once using the app. The results of the statistical analysis conducted on the perceived competence between the two study arms indicate that there was no statistical significance between the groups, with a p-value of 0.64.\n\nThe perceived relatedness of participants in both study arms dropped sharply between the measurement in the pre-intervention phase and the break period, as seen in Fig.  5 . This may indicate that after participants used the mHealth app, the app may have not met their expectations regarding how related they would feel to the app. However, in both study arms, the perceived relatedness slightly increased between the break period and the post-intervention phase of the study. Initially, in the pre-intervention phase, the participants in the SS-MS study arm scored higher in perceived relatedness, but lower in the subsequent break period and post-intervention phase. This may indicate that participants may have slightly more relatedness with a multi-stream level structure. The statistical analysis conducted on the perceived relatedness of the participants in both study arms resulted in a p-value of 0.82, indicating that there was no statistical significance between the two groups.\n\nThe perceived choice of participants in both study arms dropped sharply between the measurement in the pre-intervention phase and the break period. In both study arms, however, the perceived choice increased slightly between the break period and the post-intervention phase. However, in both the break period and post-intervention measurement, the mean perceived choice score scored below 0. This may indicate that before the intervention, participants in both groups equally perceived they had much choice in the mHealth app, however, once they used the mHealth apps they perceived limited autonomy in their choices.

      "title": "4.4. Interview Data",
      "text": "The thematic analysis of the interview transcripts resulted in the 3 following themes: difficulty level, social comparison, and level structure preferences.\n\nParticipants stated that advancing through the level structures was a difficult experience with Participant 1 stating that \"this first stage is a little bit hard to do\" due to the goals being too \"generic\". Participant 5 echoed this by indicating that some goals \"were difficult\" and \"the difficulty level was hard to achieve. It was as if the [app] was too difficult.\". Additionally, Participant 13 noted a tendency to register goals near the level system's reset time, stating \"Apparently, I always go to other activities the very last day before everything got reset\" indicating frustration with the lack of clarity regarding reset timings. Despite the frustration, they remained open to the timer concept by stating \"I'm not against it [the timer] per see\". These insights may indicate a need to reduce the size of the goals, provide more variety of goals in each level stream, and reduce the difficulty level in the earlier levels, in both level structures.\n\nParticipants indicated that the level system should be integrated with a social comparison feature outside the social goals, with Participant 2 stating \"I could not see how well [other participants] were doing\" and highlighting \"I couldn't compare myself to other people ... So what does my Level 3 mean, for example, right.\". The sentiment is echoed by Participant 4 affirming that the app felt \"lonely\". Both Participant 5 and Participant 7 matched that sentiment by respectively stating \"I did not see how I could compare myself\" and \"I wish that I could uh see also more things maybe about the levels, [the] average level that people are or some more details about other participants\". The insights of the participants strongly indicate that despite the leaderboard function participants lack ways to compare their progress with others.\n\nParticipants unanimously have a preference for receiving goals in a multistream level structure. Participant 7 stated, \"I think maybe the level system in each category would be better fit for me because maybe at some point, I don't want to focus on physical activities but want to focus on socializing\" Participant 9 expressed that the advantage of the multi-steam level system is the ability to focus on specific activities rather than having to sustain engagement across all dimensions to progress, stating, \"sometimes [I don't want] to sustain every type of activity, I just want to strengthen the physical exercise\". This was echoed by Participant 6, saying, \"From my perspective, I would always choose the [multistream level] option since I just believe that if we have one activity, we have to completely concentrate on that activity to be on a good level.\". Indicating that participants related to the multi-stream level structure. However, Participant 2 noted a drop in engagement with certain goals over time, stating \"So I just like [registered] the [goals in the one dimension] I always do and the other two I just kind of ignored.\". Participant 4 shared this experience by expressing \"There were three objectives that were being prompted to me and I think I vibed with two of them like I could feel that I had something to share with two of them.\". The results indicate that participants purposely ignored the goals in certain health dimensions. A few participants did favor the single-stream level system. Participant 5 expressed \"On one hand, [I did not like it], but on the other hand, maybe that's good because then you develop your weak spots.\" This was echoed by Participant 13, noting that despite the challenges \"[single-stream] forces you to do those [other goals].\" Indicating that a few participants saw the need to achieve goals within health dimensions they normally do not work on. However, some reasons why participants had reservations about single-stream levels were as Participant 14 stated \"[It is] kind of demotivating. If you have to do all of them, go to the next level. I think the [multi-stream level system], you still see progress in at least one of the categories.\" Participant 11 shared a similar sentiment, indicating \"I already mentioned that I didn't like that [in the single stream level system], your points also counted toward the other categories.\". While some participants appreciated the focus on weaknesses provided by singlestream levels, most participants found the requirement to complete tasks across all categories demotivating.\n\nOutside of the themes analyzed, participants gave feedback on how to improve the level structures. Participant 10 proposed adding an additional player level system comparable to Massive Multiplayer Online Role Playing Games where \"You [have multiple] different categories of what you could level up [and an] overarching combat level.\". Participant 11 indicated that there should be more levels and would have liked seeing \"your progress within the levels\", something Participant 5 lacked, stating \"I did not know if I was progressin\". Overall participants wanted the level system to display more player progression."

      "text": "The multi-stream level structure may be less holistic and healthy than the single-stream level structure. In the interviews, many participants indicated a lack of interest in one or more dimensions present in the mHealth app. This indicates that the multi-stream level structure may incentivize participants to solely achieve the goals within the health dimensions they are comfortable with, neglecting goals in the other dimensions that contribute to their holistic health. Despite multi-stream level structures possibly being less healthy holistically, participants unanimously preferred it over the single-stream level structure. Participants were slightly more engaged when given a multi-stream level structure.\n\nAlthough participants subjectively preferred the multi-stream level structure and the objective data states that there was more passive and active engagement when both groups of participants were given goals in the multi-stream level structure, the difference between the objectively measured engagement of the groups was not significant. This implies no significant difference in engagement when participants are given the less-preferred and possibly healthier single-stream level structure. Single-stream level structures are therefore not inferior to multi-stream level structures for incentivizing engagement, resulting in our hypothesis being incorrect. The subjective views of participants on the level structures may not have a statistically significant impact on engagement. This opens the possibilities for experimentation with level structures to promote health, with minimal potential impact on participant engagement. The results may also indicate that the content of the levels has a bigger impact on engagement than the structure in which it is presented.\n\nInterestingly, during the interviews participants indicated that the goals were challenging despite the difficulty of the goals being lowered to a level lower than the perceived skill of the participants. This may indicate that to keep players in Flow, the difficulty of goals present in earlier levels should be significantly easier than the perceived skilled level of the participants  [7] . This result may also suggest that the goals were not small enough for participants to feel progression through small wins  [2] ."

As a result, the results cannot be generalized beyond this context. In this context, participants may have introduced a potential bias, as multiple participants indicated that their primary motivation for continued participation in the intervention was to provide sufficient data for the researchers. Another potential bias may have been introduced by informing participants that there was a chance to win a reward for actively participating in the study. Moreover, the sample size of the study was too small to have large power in the quantitative analysis using engagement data.\n\nThe scope of this study was solely to evaluate the engagement of participants in mHealth apps and not the effectiveness of level structures on health outcomes. Additionally, it was also out of the scope of this study to measure the Flow participants experienced during the use of the mHealth app.\n\nFinally, the current configurations of the level system could be expanded. Participants are currently limited to three levels in each level stream. Additionally, each stream in the multi-stream level structure contained goals from a specific dimension. However, the structure of the level stream could be adjusted to include goals from multiple dimensions per level. This adjustment could potentially maintain the sense of autonomy of participants in making their own choices while encouraging them to pursue goals across various dimensions."

Replicating the study in diverse contexts, involving participants beyond a university setting needs to be conducted to obtain more generalizable results.\n\nA possible future configuration to consider is the use of progression locking where progression in a level stream can be locked until the participant also progresses to the other level streams. This locking feature could possibly incentivize participants to work on all streams simultaneously. This configuration may have a negative impact on participant engagement as it may restrict the autonomy of participants. However, the results indicate that the structure of the levels may not have such a statistically significant impact on the engagement of participants.\n\nFurthermore, there should be further experimentation with different configurations of the level system to benefit holistic health. The level system could be extended by experimenting with a multi-stream structure that incorporates a mix of health dimension goals within the levels of each stream. Additionally, there should be experimentation with an overarching level system, such as player-level systems in role-playing games that track the player's progress independently of the current goal-based level system  [1] . Moreover, future studies should consider incorporating more than three levels per stream. Lastly, adding elements of social comparison of the level system should be considered to improve participant-relatedness with the mHealth app."

      "text": "In this paper, we evaluated the impact of level system structures on the engagement of participants in mHealth apps. The results indicated that despite the participants unanimously preferring a multi-stream level structure, there is no significant impact on engagement when participants are given a multi-stream level structure compared to a single-stream level structure. The results also possibly indicate that the structure of a level system may not have a big impact on the engagement of participants in mHealth apps. Moreover, the findings suggest that a multi-stream level structure configured with streams of levels consisting of goals of only one health dimension incentivizes participants to solely achieve goals within the health dimensions they are comfortable in. This results in participants not achieving goals that holistically improve their health. Using a single-stream level structure in mHealth apps may be healthier for participants, as it incentivizes them to work on all health dimensions. However, more experimentation with different configurations of multi-stream level structures should be done such as goals of multiple dimensions within each stream, progression locking, and social comparisons of level systems."

      "text": "Lifestyle interventions, like cardiac rehabilitation (CR), significantly enhance CVD prognosis by targeting the improvements of behavioral risk factors such as insufficient physical activity, unhealthy dietary habits, prolonged stress, and smoking  [88, 101] . Post-COVID-19, cardiac telerehabilitation (CTR) is gaining traction globally, notably in the Netherlands  [25, 79] . By leveraging communication and telemonitoring technologies (e.g., mobile and sensor-based devices), CTR facilitates the transmission of information between patients who undergo the CR program in the home environment and healthcare professionals (HCPs) who use that information to check lifestyle advice adherence and provide feedback and recommendations  [43] . Nonetheless, the required monitoring information related to CR-targeted behaviors varies across systems and lacks a clear definition in human-computer interaction (HCI) research. Patients typically adhere to clinical recommendations independently, tracking data such as physical activity levels, consumed foods, and stress levels via self-reported surveys or wearable sensors for HCPs to use as metrics in their clinical decision-making process  [27, 63, 97] . However, changing one's behavior outside the controlled hospital environment can be influenced by many personal, contextual factors, such as work, family, and morale, currently not captured by telemonitoring technologies  [44, 59] . Although holistic care principles are implemented in co-located CR, enabling HCPs to gather comprehensive insights into the physical, mental, spiritual, and contextual aspects of the patient's experience, thereby facilitating personalized rehabilitation approaches  [99] , this is rarely the case in CTR. Despite telemonitoring's pervasive role in remote cardiac care and the patient's everyday life  [55] , its design often prioritizes gathering behavior-descriptive data (e.g., step count, sleep quality score), neglecting the patient's situational and experiential context.\n\nRecent research in HCI demonstrates the value of juxtaposing wearable sensor data with patient-generated contextual information, such as motivation and personal experiences with lifestyle change, for clinical decision-making  [95] . Failing to monitor a patient's ever-changing context alongside quantified behaviors can lead to the depersonalization of behavior data, rendering it unactionable for HCPs  [95] . This can result in standardized recommendations for patients in remote environments, potentially hindering long-term health outcomes  [11, 94] . Although the need for combining objective behavior data with contextual insight in health tracking has been expressed  [2, 19, 95] , there is a lack of investigations into what types of patient contextual information is relevant, and how it is utilized by CR HCPs in lifestyle coaching and counseling as a first step towards more inclusive CTR telemonitoring practices. To address this gap, we explore multidisciplinary perspectives on using contextual information in CR practices. We engage with seven HCPs and CR specialists in the Netherlands area, where the adoption of telemonitoring in remote care is of growing interest  [55] . We find that HCPs prioritize a deep understanding of the situational circumstances of behaviors like motivation and routines over detailed behavior descriptions such as physical activity or stress levels. We identify the composition of contextual information needed in CR and its use in clinical decision-making, propose an alternative holistic approach to telemonitoring, and discuss implications for the future design and development of telemonitoring technologies in CTR.\n\nContextual Information in Cardiac Rehab 123 2 Background and Motivation"

      "text": "The Multidisciplinary Efforts in CR. Cardiac rehabilitation (CR) is considered essential for long-term recovery and patient management  [32] , addressing the crucial CVD risk factor: unhealthy lifestyle  [77, 85] . CR, a complex model of care, involves multidisciplinary teams of CR-trained HCPs, including nurses, dietitians, physiotherapists, cardiologists, psychologists, and sports physicians  [93] . As a main part of CR programs, HCPs conduct educational and training sessions addressing healthy behaviors (also called \"core components\") like physical activity, diet, emotional recovery, and coping  [50] . Each professional is assigned a distinct core rehabilitation component  [34] , or assumes the overall responsibility of overseeing the patient's rehabilitation trajectory  [93] .\n\nThe nurse typically acts as the case manager, offering ongoing phone consultations and addressing patient queries, while physicians and psychologists provide periodic consultations or address issues as flagged by the nurse. The HCP network engages in collaborative assessment of behavioral factors and patient adherence to recommendations, coordinating care to address various aspects of patient well-being  [10] . Following program reassessment, HCPs guide individual self-management  [16] , emphasizing the implementation and maintenance of healthy behaviors at home  [32, 88] .\n\nHolistic Care Principles in CR. From a patient's perspective, being diagnosed with a heart condition and facing significant interventions, along with a flood of information and lifestyle changes, can be profoundly challenging. This process is much more complex than merely following recommendations on exercise and healthy eating  [67, 94] . By embracing holistic care principles, HCPs collaborate to provide goal-oriented care tailored to the patient's needs beyond illness by looking at the patient as a whole, specifically, as the unity of body, mind, spirit, and surrounding systems  [99] . In co-located CR, HCPs gather patient information on core components, adapting goals based on individual insights for improved outcomes  [10, 66, 93] . For instance, family narratives are documented next to the objective assessment of physical improvements for goal and advice adaptation  [50, 69] . Nonetheless, the type of information these narratives contain and the strategies HCPs use to obtain information contextualizing healthy behaviors from patients are unknown. Although plenty of clinical studies investigate patients' experiences with CR programs  [29, 31, 41]  and barriers and facilitators of patient participation  [1, 58] , adherence  [35, 68] , completion  [73] , and self-management post-program  [22, 83] , these insights are mainly used to suggest improvements of CR procedures. They are not discussed in the context of clinical decision-making. Armed with the knowledge that utilizing insights into patient barriers, facilitators, and overall context in clinical decisions during CR significantly correlates with shortened recovery time post-cardiac event  [54, 59] , we aim to outline initial categories of contextual information used in clinical decisionmaking in CR from the perspective of a multidisciplinary group of HCPs. These insights may inform the development of a CTR system that integrates comprehensive principles from co-located CR practices."

      "title": "Current Telemonitoring in",
      "text": "Remote Cardiac Care. Cardiac telerehabilitation (CTR) technologies emerge as solutions to enhance CR participation by overcoming barriers such as program awareness, transportation issues, and low social support, compounded by increased risk factors post-in-clinic phase [12,63,64,103]. CTR often employs telemonitoring (e.g., wearable sensors or self-reporting automated surveys) and communication tools (e.g., texting, videoconferencing) for patient-clinician information and feedback exchange to ensure adherence to lifestyle recommendations [17,56]. After analyzing recent systematic reviews of CTR systems, we have found a consistent trend: this exchange heavily relies on quantifying core CR components (i.e., behaviors), particularly physical activity [17,43,49,56,61,65,71,84]. For instance, Zhang et al. [105] utilize a wearable activity tracker to monitor physical activity levels (i.e., through acceleration and steps) between hospitalization and CR, providing data for nurses to offer online feedback. Similarly, Herkert et al. [52] track exercise progress through in-app surveys and activity sensors, measuring postsession exertion and daily activities. Although less common, other telemonitoring systems extend beyond physical activity, including self-reporting cigarette consumption via in-app surveys, uploading meal images, logging weight changes, self-evaluating sleep quality, and measuring sleep efficiency with wearable sensors [18,28,37,46,80,92,100]. While a detailed examination of data collected by CTR systems warrants further investigation, our focus lies elsewhere. Instead, we highlight the prevailing emphasis on quantifying behavior in current CR lifestyle\n\ntelemonitoring and the oversight of contextual information like perceived selfefficacy, habits, and family obligations crucial for understanding human behavior in home settings  [73] . Notably, while evaluating their CTR system, Herkert et al.  [52]  highlight the inability to proactively prevent decreased exercise adherence due to the lack of information on patients' physical complaints and motivators. As telemonitoring advances, designers must acknowledge the challenge of expecting diverse patients with various circumstances to conform to standardized feedback solely based on biophysical data and automated surveys  [94] .\n\nRecent HCI research underscores the importance of individualized design for cardiac technologies  [33, 94] , as neglecting this may lead to misalignment with the patient's \"normality\"  [96] , poor engagement, adherence, and effectiveness in behavior change  [51] .\n\nData Requirements in Telerehabilitation. Due to the intricate network of HCPs and complex targeted behavioral components, defining data requirements for lifestyle monitoring in CTR is challenging. Examples of collected data vary from system to system. In exercise-based CTR, Shimbo et al.  [70]  suggest measuring activity intensity parameters and participant condition indicators in exercise. In a comprehensive CTR portal, Goevaerts et al.  [46]  classify self-reported data such as physical activity, sedentary behavior, alcohol, nutrition intake, and stress to detect and assess risk behaviors. Nonetheless, within recent HCI and Computer-Supported Cooperative Work (CSCW) research, there is a suggestion that the data needs of HCPs in CTR are more intricate than what current systems provide. In a study on telemonitored data supporting CR, Tadas et al.  [95]  highlight the concept of \"situated objectivity\", which integrates standardized, automated data with contextual understanding  [78] . They emphasize the importance of periodically sampling personal experiences alongside objective data like physical activity levels to contextualize them effectively. The transition from data to information can assist HCPs in understanding patients' challenges in meeting recommended targets. These conclusions find support in other telemonitoring interventions. Caldeira et al.  [26]  highlight HCPs' reliance on patients' subjective input for interpreting telemonitored data in stroke telerehabilitation. Similarly, Amorim et al.  [3]  note the need for patient subjective input in HCPs' decision-making for musculoskeletal conditions telerehabilitation. Andersen et al.  [4]  emphasize the importance of the patient's own data interpretation in collaborative ICD data analysis. Akinsiku et al.  [2]  stress the significance of telemonitoring information tied to the patient's context in stroke physical rehabilitation, categorizing it into areas like motivation, mental health, and caregiver assessment. There is a lack of similar studies delineating the contextual information needed in CTR; we expand on existing work and define similar information categories within CR. While Akinsiku et al.  [2]  term this information \"experiential\", we will use the term \"contextual information\". This distinction arises from the differing focus between stroke and cardiac rehabilitation; the latter involves a more complex recovery process, with patients undertaking long-term behavioral changes influenced by various contextual everyday life factors extending beyond mere task execution."

      "text": "Acknowledging that behavior-descriptive data gathered in CTR is not enough for holistic clinical decision-making, we aim to understand what types of patient contextual information is relevant, and how it is utilized by CR HCPs in lifestyle coaching and counseling as a first step towards holistic telemonitoring. Participant recruitment was done through snowball sampling from a teaching hospital in the Netherlands, a CR center in North Belgium (Noord Brabant area), and two Universities in the Netherlands. CR programs in North Belgium are very similar to the Dutch programs. We selected at least one participant for each CR behavioral component (2 psychologists -CP1 and CP2, one dietitian -DT, one physiotherapist -PT, one sports physician -SP) and two CR experts (one project manager -PM, one specialized nurse practitioner -NP) (Appendix A.2).  1  We conducted individual semi-structured interviews, lasting 45 to 90 min each. Four interviews were in person, while three were held online via Microsoft Teams due to COVID-19. All interviews were audio recorded, with online ones also video recorded with participants' consent.\n\nBefore the study, an interview guide and a visual Miro board were developed to guide the conversation. The board contained patient barriers and facilitators of attendance, adherence, and completion of CR identified from a representative corpus of literature (Appendix A.1). After being introduced to the context and aim of the research, participants were given 10 min to review the Miro board. Questions addressed the types of information related to the patient's context participants use in lifestyle coaching and counseling, methods of collecting such information, and their link to addressing CR-targeted behaviors. Participants used the Miro board to define categories of information starting from the collection on the board. Recordings were transcribed verbatim. Semantic and descriptive thematic analysis was employed to identify recurring themes containing contextual information  [30] . Transcriptions were segmented into distinct meaning units related to contextual factors (e.g., work and routines), each assigned a consecutive code to maintain context  [40] . These meaning units and Miro visualizations were used to identify recurring themes representing broader categories of contextual information (e.g., everyday normality)."

      "title": "4.1. Various and Subjective Ways of Collecting Contextual Information",
      "text": "Our findings emphasize the crucial role of patient contextual information in clinical decision-making within CR, essential for understanding patients and guiding their rehabilitation journey. HCPs rely on personal and situational context to grasp the reasons behind patient behaviors. While lifestyle behavior data (e.g., self-reported physical activity levels, physiotherapy session metrics, self-reported smoking habits) is a starting point, contextual insights (e.g., busy family life) help elucidate underlying reasons for why patients behave in a certain way. HCPs follow holistic care principles, interviewing patients and asking open-ended questions. During intake appointments, case managers collect comprehensive information on patients' well-being and surrounding systems. Other HCPs might use issues with adherence (e.g., low physical activity) as triggers for delving further into a patient's personal situation. The information is recorded in the patient's medical file and becomes available to the rest of the multidisciplinary team. Important contextual information for CR coaching includes details about the patient's everyday normality, social environment, psychological and physical well-being, and ability to leverage knowledge. Participants come from different expertise and specializations, each an important puzzle piece during CR. We observe different approaches in which they extract and document contextual information based on the different degrees of closeness with the patient, as well as with administrative versus clinical perspectives. For instance, the nurse practitioner (NP) has the most personal relationship with the patients and views them as a complex ecosystem of factors, not as a clinical subject defined by one's condition. They use the intake appointment at the beginning of CR as an essential opportunity to establish a comprehensive patient profile. Subsequently, during consultations or therapy sessions (e.g., psychotherapy or physiotherapy), all HCPs try to get to know the patient personally to gain trust and adapt their advice to the individual. However, there are friction points regarding how holistic these consultations are since the level of intimacy of the conversation, even though deemed important, is not standardized. For instance, the project manager (PM) argues that the textbook procedure of CR intake appointments is not personal enough: \"it's [the intake appointment] not really focused on the more difficult things to grasp -like their needs, wishes, past experiences, and expectations. [...] I think it's really important to really understand the patient more than just the numbers that are attached to them -my age is 59, my weight is 120 kg and my physical activity behavior is low\". All our participants, however, unanimously agree that CR is a personalized journey shaped by the patient's unique circumstances. Specialists, for instance, employ subjective interpretation and professional intuition to navigate the complexities of personal situations, stratifying patients into appropriate treatment strategies. The psychologist (CP2) assists patients with minimal social support and mood disorders such as anxiety or depression. The sports physician (SP) identifies physical restrictions based on the patient's well-being and explores personal exercise possibilities by targeting trainable aspects according to daily routines, physical capabilities, and mental well-being. Conversely, the dietitian (DT) might try to understand the patient according to a structured procedure, beginning with background factors such as lifestyle and comorbidities, then inquiring into personal factors like social support and confidence, and ultimately focusing on existing dietary knowledge and beliefs regarding illness and treatment.\n\nAlthough of different types, the entanglement among the contextual information HCPs use for clinical decision-making is significant. For instance, a patient's social framework and support directly influence their routines and obligations in the home environment, while their comorbidities and physical limitations can negatively affect their motivation and health beliefs. Similarly, depression and anxiety can limit a patient's ability to leverage CR knowledge about healthy behaviors in their everyday life. HCPs use entanglements and dependencies to extract the right contextual information and identify root problems in a patient's rehabilitation to provide personalized strategies. At the same time, we observe that behavioral data can become contextual information when identifying issues with other behaviors. For instance, data about physical activity levels is utilized as context for dietary problems, whereas information on the patient's smoking behavior can be used to contextualize a decline in exercise capacity."

This information is regularly updated with follow-up questions throughout CR to assess how patients are adjusting their normality to rehabilitation goals and whether these goals align with their habitual lives. By gathering this data, HCPs aim to establish a personal connection with the patient, fostering trust and gaining insights into their individual needs."

      "text": "Existing Lifestyle, Work, Routines, and Obligations. Before initiating any lifestyle changes, the patient's existing lifestyle is evaluated using standardized questionnaires like the International Physical Activity Questionnaire  [98]  supplemented by open-ended discussions. DT underlines: \"You first need to know what the current behaviors are before you can assess where changes need to be made\". Lifestyle information, including existing physical activity levels, dietary habits, and stress patterns, is registered and becomes available to the multidisciplinary HCP team through the electronic patient record, as it can significantly affect patient progress. Patients with healthy habits may adapt more easily to recommendations and reach goals faster, so the pace of change can be personalized. Additionally, DT emphasizes the importance of prior lifestyle in tailoring education, highlighting the need for insights into the necessity for new health behaviors, especially for patients with limited awareness of their habits. However, participants note that patients' recall of their exercise routines and eating habits is not always accurate, posing challenges in setting appropriate goals.\n\nWork patterns and routines are also considered when designing treatment plans, as they could often interfere with the new types of behavior patients need to learn. PM exemplifies: \"People who are used to cycle to work instead of taking the car, especially for physical activity behavior, that's really important. [...] But if you always took the car, it is difficult to start to cycle to work\". Participants observe a trend among patients with demanding jobs and hectic schedules who struggle to find time and energy for exercise or counseling sessions. In such instances, HCPs must provide flexible counseling options and alternative training methods while offering stress management support. Understanding household and family responsibilities is also vital, as they influence patient priorities and adherence to recommendations. HCPs tailor suggestions to match the patient's priorities to enhance their overall quality of life. SP recalls about a young patient with children:"

While insurance companies in the Netherlands strongly support CR, higher-income patients may have easier access to healthier food resources and specialized trainers outside the hospital. HCPs consider a patient's financial situation to recommend affordable, nutritionally suitable food options aligning with cardiac restrictions. PM presents opportunities for suggesting alternative exercise options by using information about the patient's local environ-ments, such as nearby parks or recreational facilities, for those unable to afford gym memberships or personal trainers."

      "title": "4.3. Contextual Information About the Social Environment",
      "text": "All participants stressed the importance of understanding the patient's social environment, both in and outside the home. This information enables HCPs to anticipate or address challenges related to therapy adherence, such as a patient with family members exhibiting unhealthy eating habits. It also informs clinical decision-making, such as involving individuals from the patient's social network in treatment or engaging patients in peer groups.\n\nSocial Framework and Support. Participants concur that understanding the patient's social background, including marital status, cohabitants, friends, and children, is crucial for counseling and training across all lifestyle behaviors. As knowledge acquisition and application occur at home, the family can significantly impact the patient's progress, both actively and passively. While this isn't standard practice in CR and varies among practitioners, our participants conduct dyadic interviews and sometimes therapy sessions to address this. SP mentions: \"[. . . ] if I see a patient and the partner next to them, I can treat them both, and it helps. But if you are alone, it's much more difficult\". The patient and their informal caregiver are asked about lifestyle behaviors, family obligations, and tasks. This allows DT, for example, to provide dietary advice and information tailored not only to the patient but also to the family and caregivers. PT and NP illustrate instances where one family member must make lifestyle changes while another is responsible for cooking and grocery shopping. Participants also investigate the dynamics between patients and caregivers, including perceived support, recognizing that a lack thereof can impede therapy adherence or discourage participation in CR. On the other hand, excessive support can lead to over-protectiveness or anxiety. CP1 exemplifies: \"if the partner is anxiousthe partner is checking 'Are you feeling okay? I think you are not feeling okay. Have you checked your pulse?' Well, that's not helping. Because then the patient doesn't get the trust they need to do things by themselves again\". In such cases, professionals engage partners in consultations, provide structured guidance on supporting a family member with cardiac issues, and may even refer them to psychosocial therapy.\n\nConnections with Peers. HCPs also appreciate gaining insight into the nature of peer support patients are receiving. Some participants encourage community building and bonding in their practice -in some cases, peer advice comes with a certain empathy and understanding the clinician cannot offer. Nonetheless, this approach is not standardized."

      "text": "Information about mental well-being can help identify the roots of existing challenges such as low patient progress or adherence. Patients are screened for depressive disorders and anxiety using standardized questionnaires (e.g., Beck Depression Inventory  [66] ). Throughout rehabilitation, patients share their mental challenges through open-ended discussions with HCPs, who communicate them to the multidisciplinary team, leading to collaborative care adjustments.\n\nDepression and Anxiety. HCPs prioritize investigating if patients have a predisposition to anxiety, depression, or mood problems, which can hinder confidence and self-efficacy. Patients with a history of these issues or with a type-D personality  [62]  characterized by negative affectivity and social inhibition may require special psychological attention. SP explains that addressing depressive symptoms first is crucial, as they can impede treatment progress and patient empowerment. Patients who have experienced a cardiac event before participating in CR may face worries about their future and the trauma of the heart attack. This trauma can lead to anxiety about being physically active again, resulting in inactivity, lack of motivation, and, ultimately, depression. CP1 recalls: \"I recently had a patient and he had a stroke, and he was somewhere far away from home. He's really scared to walk alone in the dark because he's so scared that it will happen again. And he's really having panic attacks as well, really hyper-alert\". Patients in need are referred to a clinical psychologist to address emotional challenges. Group sessions are recommended, while individual sessions and Eye Movement Desensitization and Reprocessing (EMDR) therapy  [91]  are offered to those dealing with trauma. It is important to note that this information may not always emerge at the onset of rehabilitation, as some patients may be hesitant to open up or discuss intimate thoughts and feelings. Rather, contextual information about psychological challenges is continuously collected, and most times, patients need to recognize these challenges themselves and ask for help. NP mentions that oftentimes, anxiety spikes after the program ends when the patient is left with little to no professional support at home."

      "title": "Motivation and Health Beliefs.",
      "text": "Participants document motivational levels during HCP-patient discussions, recognizing low motivation as a primary barrier to behavior change, program attendance, adherence, and completion. While pinpointing the exact causes for low determination is challenging, participants look at factors such as high anxiety, unhealthy coping mechanisms, low selfefficacy, and personality traits that contribute to low motivation. Professionals acknowledge that individuals with low self-efficacy for exercise need encouragement and reassurance of achievable progress. For instance, the sports physician (SP) empowers patients by forecasting their physical fitness post-program and demonstrating ongoing improvements, showing that exercise goals are achievable. They explain: \"If they [i.e., the patients] understand that they have a choice either to have a lower life expectancy but also lower physical fitness with its consequences or a possibility to gain this physical fitness, then most people will choose the physical fitness. [. . . ] But that's what patients don't realize themselves. They have to be explained that that's possible\". By also altering treatment and treating various anxiety or mood problems, motivation can be positively influenced. Furthermore, understanding patients' beliefs about their health situation is crucial contextual information. CP2 uses attribution theory  [47]  to grasp patients' perceptions and attitudes about their condition, while DT focuses on influencing negative beliefs about lifestyle changes by educating them on the consequences of unhealthy nutrition: \"Most of the time they don't think they eat that unhealthy or that it [i.e., unhealthy eating] has that much of an influence\". Negative health beliefs can stem from difficulty accepting the diagnosis and viewing the body as \"failing\". CP1 illustrates the challenge of emphasizing the importance of rest to overly active patients who struggle to adjust their pace after a cardiac event."

Participants stress that comorbidities can impact the patient's perception of the severity of the cardiac condition and its implications for the future, thereby affecting patient physical and mental progress. Additionally, the presence of comorbidities like diabetes or cancer can diminish motivation and reduce the energy and time available for CR. HCPs heed energy levels, health perception, and life outlook related to comorbidities to comprehend why some patients lack motivation to improve their health. Clinicians can suggest alternative physical activity plans for patients with comorbidities like obesity, arthritis, or COPD by considering physical limitations such as knee pain, fatigue, or breathing difficulties. The sports physician (SP) and physiotherapist (PT) adjust exercise difficulty and the pace of lifestyle changes for these patients. SP highlights how individuals with chronic conditions adapt their behavior to physical limitations: \"There are people who have such bad lungs and still work full time. But they have learned to work very slow. [...] And the people that accept their condition, they walk maybe with a rollator [i.e., walker] or with an electric bicycle, they walk more slowly and they take more time, they finish the physical activity and they also take rest\"."

Participants emphasize clinicians' duty to gather data on perceived symptoms and educate patients on symptom recognition to ease anxiety from misinterpretations. CP1 highlights that post-cardiac event, patients often become hyperaware and misinterpret symptoms, leading to stress, anxiety, and insecurity: \"After a stroke, you feel the vulnerability of your body. [...] you monitor your body, and that makes you feel a lot more aware of it. And that can lead to misinterpretation because, for example, you feel your heartbeat after you walk up the stairs. Maybe it was the same before. But now they think 'Maybe it's a stroke' [...] They get really anxious\". Participants advocate for self-awareness, self-reflection, and respecting the body's boundaries by prioritizing rest when necessary. CP2 and PT underscore the importance of breaking a harmful cycle: misinterpreting bodily signals leads to anxiety, which in turn instills fear of movement. Clinicians aim to uncover the underlying causes of symptoms and complaints by inquiring about physical discomfort, fears, and concerns."

      "text": "Providing knowledge is central to CR programs, and understanding and applying it is key to long-term behavior change. Patients receive extensive educational materials during the program, but this diminishes after discharge. They are educated about their diagnosis, rehabilitation procedures, and prognosis, with each piece of information being significant. HCPs make efforts to document and use information regarding patients' ability to leverage knowledge for therapy improvement in their practice.\n\nThe Ability to Absorb Knowledge. During consultations, participants try to adapt the difficulty of the educational materials to the level of understanding of the patient. Even though they try to simplify clinical language, it is sometimes difficult to grasp whether a patient has understood the information. For instance, SP describes that in some cases, patients who are not literate do not feel safe enough to communicate their need for assistance in comprehending the provided information. Detecting early signs of this reluctance can be detrimental to their health and progression. Patients receive information orally and in writing, being allowed to express any uncertainties. HCPs also inquire about self-acquired information sources to prevent patient misinformation. NP describes: \"I think it's important to see how the patient gets their personal information. Is it by talking with other patients who also had a heart attack? Or is it a professional or is it on the Internet to see reviews from medication, for example, that are also clinical?\". Participants express their struggle with helping patients filter through the right information at home. Sometimes, patients base important decisions such as stopping medication intake on self-found knowledge. Participants mention that misinformation can also lead to a lack of interest in the program. HCPs stress the importance of gathering patient feedback to enhance the relevance and usability of provided information, with the goal of improving patient knowledge and understanding. PM recounts the impact of non-personalized educational sessions, noting low engagement levels and the need for content alignment with individual experiences. They highlight the challenge of maintaining interest when the content doesn't directly relate to the patient's condition, suggesting a need for tailored information delivery.\n\nThe Ability to Implement Knowledge. NP partly attributes the lack of motivation to the patients' low ability to use what they learn in the program in real-life situations. During consultations, clinicians may inquire about challenges patients face during the practical application of clinical recommendations to achieve set goals (e.g., eat less fatty foods) and suggest personalized adjustments or interventions accordingly. They utilize patient narratives to pinpoint obstacles like difficulty in adjusting daily schedules to rehabilitation activities or the lack of self-efficacy and confidence to maintain a behavior."

      "text": "Our research was motivated by the misalignment between current CTR practices and holistic, co-located CR approaches. While CTR relies on telemonitoring data that quantify CR behaviors for HCP decision-making in lifestyle coaching, co-located CR aims to understand the patient comprehensively, a sum of behavioral, spiritual, physical, and situational factors  [99] . To improve the alignment between CTR monitoring practices and co-located CR care, we first need to understand the types of contextual information that HCPs consider in their decision-making process within specific hospitals. This study identifies five kinds of contextual information about patients' daily lives used in Dutch CR (i.e., everyday normality, social environment, mental and physical well-being and ability to leverage knowledge). While CTR offers accessible CR programs, its current design provides HCPs with information disconnected from the individual and fails to capture the dynamic nature of a patient's daily life. Although achieving this fully may be challenging, we argue that objective behavioral data should be complemented by a more sophisticated understanding of the patient's context through open data collection methods that capture information related to the five identified categories. We discuss implications for the design of more holistic CTR telemonitoring below."

      "title": "5.1. Aligning with Co-located CR: from Objective to Situated Data",
      "text": "As Martinez et al.  [33]  mention in recent work on cardiac technologies, \"design work is and should always be context-specific\". Although telemonitoring technologies have become pervasive in CR  [36, 55] , they (1) present HCPs with data that quantify and characterize behaviors in isolation from the patient's situated context (e.g.,  [25, 52] ), and (2) lack the means to capture contextual information and present it in a meaningful and useful way to clinicians. Our study shows that the current telemonitoring paradigm in CTR does not align with current co-located CR practices.\n\nPrevious work on health technologies for rehabilitation emphasizes looking beyond automated data collection and quantification of behavior. Bhat et al. criticize the negative spaces in health datafication, underlying the omission of information from alternative subjective sources  [19] . Tadas et al.  [94]  advocate for designing cardiac technologies that reflect patients' everyday lives and individual differences. In their later work on CTR, they stress the importance of combining automated data with subjective patient experiences  [95] , signaling a shift in clinical decision-making toward considering the situated objectivity of data  [78] . With a similar motivation, Akinsiku et al. propose a paradigm reconceptualization for situated stroke telerehabilitation systems that capture the lived experiences of patients next to their movement data  [2] . Driven by a missing comparable investigation in the context of CTR, we examine the information outlining the situatedness of patients' behavior in CR used by HCPs to make clinical decisions, and we urge designers of cardiac telemonitoring technologies to include subjective and non-automated data collection methods as a circumstantial completion of behavior data that can help clinicians provide tailored, holistic care (Fig.  1 ).\n\nFig.  1 . Types of contextual information that could be captured by holistic CR telemonitoring aligned with holistic care principles  [99] .\n\nOur investigation into co-located CR revealed that contextual information is gathered during periodical doctor-patient interviews, documented through open note-taking by clinicians, and serves as a shared knowledge base for the multidisciplinary team  [13] . HCPs utilize contextual information to address barriers in patient adherence to CR components, with data collection methods relying on common sense, experience, and subjective perspectives. In CTR, a dynamic action-reaction process occurs, where clinicians observe red flags or negative trends in automatically collected data and respond accordingly  [52] . In transitioning to a more nuanced approach to data-based decision-making, we advocate for a more open approach to data collection, which is backed by recent research findings  [2, 95] . Open approaches refer to less structured, more spontaneous collection moments and alternative, expressive, and qualitative data-gathering methods beyond standardized questionnaires and passive sensors. Examples can include functionalities that allow patients or clinicians to annotate behavior data through open text fields at any time, prompting impromptu questions to patients and incorporating more diverse data types such as audio or video recordings, pictures, or short diaries. One example is the recent design of Chromatize, a flexible, manual self-tracking application by Barker-Canler et al.  [15] . These approaches can help avoid the de-personalization of CTR data and care  [11] . While exploring open approaches to telemonitoring, designers must consider HCPs' workflows and patient self-reporting burden  [57, 81] . Involving clinicians and patients in designing data collection methods can mitigate workload and reporting overload  [20] . This can be done, for example, by following Andersen et al.'s  [6]  conceptual guidelines for addressing divergent patient-clinician concerns and designing data collection and representation features in line with key characteristics of physician's progress notes (e.g.,  [13] ). For instance, Seals et al.  [89]  recommend visually connecting objective data with clinical goals and patient narratives for efficient access to important information. Contextual information within CTR can serve as a semantic layer to behavior data, providing \"details on demand\". Moreover, our insights, supported by previous work  [4, 48, 89] , highlight the importance of patient-clinician relationships, discussions, and shared reflections, indicating that data visualizations should support patient-clinician conversations, accommodate low levels of data literacy, effectively convey progress or trends, and illustrate clinician explanations effectively. Lastly, it is worth noting that objective data can sometimes evolve into contextual information  [2] . For example, details about a patient's diet can help a sports physician explain a decrease in energy affecting overall functional capacity. To achieve this, telemonitoring interventions should be able to collect a comprehensive dataset covering all key CR components. As emphasized in the recent study of Goevaerts et al.  [46] , such solutions are infrequent and need further development and exploration."

      "title": "5.2. Implications for Collecting Contextual Information",
      "text": "Our research argues that telemonitoring systems should capture diverse patient contextual information through open data-collection methods to help clinicians personalize therapies, and align patient goals with health goals and recommended lifestyle changes  [33, 96] . Our findings align with Akinsiku et al.  [2]  on the experiential information needed in stroke rehabilitation, such as mental and physical health, motivations, and fears. We add to this by addressing the complexities of the CR context, including nuanced needs regarding knowledge absorption, patient lifestyles, and social dynamics. We offer recommendations on how to capture such information in CTR.\n\nThe Everyday Normality. We find that understanding the patient's health habits, work patterns, routines, and home resources is crucial for HCP's collaborative goal-setting, problem-solving, calibrating clinical objectives, and adjusting therapies, as it contextualizes behaviors in the patient's lived environment. CTR telemonitoring technologies should:\n\n\u2022 prompt questions about a patient's everyday normality at program onset, creating a shared database for the multidisciplinary team to make collaborative and individual treatment decisions -e.g., knowing a patient's routines aids in tailoring training intensity, pace of change, and recommended schedules, such as whether they walk or drive to work or if they have a dog to walk each morning.\n\n\u2022 prompt patients to periodically, throughout the program document significant changes in their everyday normality, allowing for customized therapy adaptations (as illustrated in Tadas et al.'s intervention  [95] ) -e.g., economic issues, family obligations, or work priorities can impact patient adherence to CR adherence, and lacking this contextual information can lead to high drop-out rates and hinder behavior maintenance  [51] .\n\nThe Social Environment. Information on social support, family dynamics, and peer interaction is vital for HCPs. Although previous research underscores the pervasive role of family and informal caregivers in long-term lifestyle change  [83] , remote cardiac care falls short in addressing the transitional dynamics of a patient's social relationships  [72] . CTR telemonitoring technologies should:\n\n\u2022 collect comprehensive information on stakeholders involved in long-term lifestyle changes at home, including family status and levels of social support in various activities (e.g., exercising with friends, cooking with a spouse) at program onset. This aids in deciding on family involvement or individual interventions for caregivers, as partner distress or noncooperation can adversely affect patient well-being and adherence in CR  [24] .\n\n\u2022 formalize family or informal caregivers' roles in telemonitoring (e.g., by enabling them to participate in data collection). This can provide insights into the patient's and family's lifestyle changes and coping mechanisms. Family-centered remote care interfaces and caregiver input options are essential [2,8,39,90,104] but still underexplored in interface design. \u2022 enable patients to express social challenges and needs they might hesitate to voice during in-person consultations, facilitating support for family obstacles and connecting with other cardiac patients for community support. The Mental Well-Being. HCPs extensively utilize information about the patient's depression, anxiety, motivation, and health beliefs to build profiles, prioritize clinical goals, recommend suitable therapies, and intervene during low morale. CTR telemonitoring technologies should:\n\n\u2022 enable mental health assessment using validated questionnaires (e.g., the Beck Depression Inventory  [66] ) before, during, and after the program. CTR sys-tems often lack mental health tracking  [51, 65]  -one existing example is the LifeStyleScore app that periodically assesses perceived stress  [46] . \u2022 enable and empower periodic self-reflection by allowing patients to augment objective data overviews with other mental factors (e.g., motivation, health beliefs, psychological struggles) and insights from their decision-making processes. Such data is essential to clinicians but is overlooked, although its absence has been proven to hinder proactive CTR dropout prevention  [52] .\n\nThe Physical Well-Being. Participants also rely on information about the patient's other chronic conditions, physical pains, symptoms, and side effects during consultations, physiotherapy sessions, or patient calls to provide tailored therapy recommendations. CTR telemonitoring technologies should:\n\n\u2022 record the range of comorbidities at program onset and enable periodical logging of physical complaints (e.g.,  [53, 75] ). Pain, its timing, medication side effects affecting physical well-being, and complaints due to comorbidities can significantly contribute to program dropout if not addressed in time  [52] . \u2022 prompt the patient's subjective perception of symptoms alongside commonly monitored vital signs such as blood pressure and heart rate  [8, 12]  throughout the program. Overanalyzing body signals can lead to fear of movement and exercise. Sampling patients' subjective perception of felt symptoms has been encouraged before  [5, 7] , as its clinical validation can create in-the-moment knowledge about recognizing one's body signals for patients  [96] .\n\nThe Ability to Leverage Knowledge. The patient's understanding of educational materials, information during consultations, and ability to implement recommendations in daily life are essential for successful CR adherence and longterm lifestyle change  [93] . CTR telemonitoring technologies should:\n\n\u2022 provide means for patients to express concerns and needs regarding overwhelming or confusing information.\n\nPatients should be able to provide open feedback electronically or comment on clinical recommendations and educational materials as an outlet for expressing a lack of understanding (e.g., Tadas et al.'s weekly open questionnaire [95]) or inform clinicians about concerns arising from unreliable information sources (e.g., as supported in Ongwere et al.'s work [76]). This can help clinicians prevent misinformation and provide educational materials adapted to patients' understanding levels. Such adaptations have been explored in interventions like Gibson et al.'s tablet application for adults with mild intellectual disabilities [45]. \u2022 gather evidence not only on behavior change trends but also on the patient's self-efficacy and reasons behind challenges they face in practical knowledge implementation outside the hospital environment."

Enhanced telemonitoring can make data more actionable, but designers must consider trade-offs like clinician workload and patient self-reporting burden.

Recent advancements in IVF technology have significantly improved success rates and broadened options for couples facing infertility. Artificial Intelligence (AI) is now being utilized in IVF to enhance precision and efficacy, tailoring treatment plans to individual patient needs. The IVF industry is characterized by rapid technological advancement, and AI is making significant inroads in several key areas such as embryo selection, sperm sorting, and risk assessment  [1] [2] [3] . AI technologies analyze factors including morphology, development, and genetics to evaluate embryo quality, identify viable embryos for transfer, and assess risks during IVF treatment. However, the laboratory environment's impact on IVF outcomes remains a crucial and underexplored area  [4] [5] [6] . Factors like air quality, temperature, and light exposure within the laboratory can significantly influence embryo development and quality, ultimately affecting the success of IVF treatments.\n\nWe argue that the employment of vast yet underutilized data resources to enhance the efficacy of IVF procedures by leveraging AI and Machine Learning (ML) technologies can further improve IVF success rates, addressing critical global issues related to fertility, family planning, mental health, and socioeconomic equality. By analyzing and interpreting data on laboratory environmental factors, discerning their impact on pregnancy rates, and developing models to understand the efficiency of environmental conditions, we aim to identify actionable insights for various stakeholders involved in the process. In the remaining parts of this paper, we explore the EIVF-AI project, a collaborative effort between Malm\u00f6 University (MAU), Kristianstad University (HKR), OpenLogger Systems AB, and Reproduktionsmedicinskt centrum (RMC). We do so by first priming the reader with some relevant background on the application of AI technology to IVF and embryology.

      "title": "2. AI Technology Applied to IVF and Embryology",
      "text": "Various kinds of AI technology have been applied in the context of IVF and embryology. This has been done with an emphasis on the evaluation of embryos, which in turn is important e.g. when deciding whether to implant an embryo or not. When it comes to evaluating embryos, it is important to keep track of its development over time, e.g. particular timings of cellular divisions and to detect various kinds of abnormal development. To aid in the automatization of this, automatic annotation of time-lapse microscopic photography of embryo development is of importance. Besides making the whole process more efficient it also makes it possible to avoid problems with intra-and interoperator variability associated with manual annotation. In particular, convolutional neural networks have been successfully employed for such automatic annotation of time-lapse photography of embryo development  [6, 7] .\n\nAI technology has been used in the context of embryo grading, focusing on blastocysts and their evaluation for implantation potential. As in the case of automatic annotation of time-lapse microscopic photography described above, there are similar challenges in human grading of embryos. A problem that AI algorithms can help alleviate  [8, 9] .\n\nThere is an ongoing debate about using static images versus time-lapse microscopy videos for assessment, with AI systems showing promise in both scenarios. Efforts have been made to differentiate inner cell mass and trophectoderm using image segmentation and machine learning methods  [10] . Studies demonstrate high accuracy in predicting blastocyst quality using AI models trained on embryo images  [9] . Various statistical models and AI methods using morphokinetic parameters from time-lapse microscopy data have been developed to predict implantation potential at different stages of embryo development  [11, 12] . AI-based models have also been used to predict embryo implantation by analyzing embryo images or videos, although concerns exist regarding data imbalance and model validation  [11, 12] . Studies using AI on time-lapse microscopy data have shown promising results, with some models claiming improvements over embryologist grading. However, challenges such as unbalanced data sets and variability among laboratories need to be addressed for reliable AI predictions.\n\nAnother area important for IVF is embryo ploidy prediction. The use of invasive embryo biopsy techniques comes with its own challenges, and hence there are ongoing efforts to develop noninvasive methods. One such technique involves cellfree DNA analysis from spent embryo culture media  [13] , but AI-based analysis is also being explored. Studies have shown associations between embryo morphology, blastocyst grading, blastocyst scores, and embryo ploidy, with high-quality embryos more likely to be euploid  [14, 15] . Time-lapse microscopy studies have also linked embryo morphokinetics to ploidy status  [16, 17] , although single aneuploidies may be difficult to predict through image analysis alone, whereas AI may identify complex aneuploidies more effectively. Nonetheless, neither noninvasive techniques nor preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT-A) can predict aneuploidies with 100% accuracy. Recent studies using AI and image analysis have shown promise in predicting ploidy status. For example,  [18]  utilized AI computer vision to predict embryo ploidy from a single blastocyst image with 70% accuracy, highlighting the potential of AI in noninvasive ploidy prediction, though the authors acknowledge the need for larger datasets to validate their algorithm.\n\nBesides the employment for embryo grading and selection, and for embryo implantation success and ploidy prediction, AI technology has also been applied in some other, for IVF, relevant areas. For example, machine learning has been applied to assess and select competent oocytes  [19] , to analyze semen  [20]  and to evaluate sperm  [21]  and their genetic integrity  [22] . One of the applicants for this grant has also been involved in the application of AI technology to predict the quality of semen based on environmental as well as lifestyle factors  [23] . Other examples are the employment of AI technology and convolutional neural networks for miscarriage prediction and the employment of machine learning for ovary and uterus evaluation  [24] ."

Thus, we explore the potential for applying AI technology to enhance the IVF success rate by aiding the understanding of various environmental parameters in and around the incubators. Through the implementation of AI technologies to optimize laboratory environments in IVF clinics, success rates can be significantly enhanced, which will provide substantial benefits for individuals and society. Below we present our approaches.\n\nModeling Temporal Dependencies in IVF Procedure Using Transformers. Using Transformers for time series data and prediction represents an advanced approach that leverages self-attention mechanisms to capture longrange dependencies within sequential data. In our approach, we analyze time series data featuring multiple features structured as a sequence, where each vector element corresponds to a timestamp. Each timestamp encompasses diverse features such as laboratory environmental data (e.g., temperature, humidity, particles) alongside embryo development parameters like morphokinetic timings and developmental stages. To analyze this data, we feed the sequence directly into a Transformer model after performing feature embedding. Feature embedding entails transforming raw or feature vectors into compact, meaningful representations using methods like learnable embeddings or linear projections. This transformation compresses each feature vector into a lower-dimensional space that captures essential information. Transformers leverage positional encoding such that these encodings provide the model with details about the order of features at each timestamp, effectively incorporating temporal information into the model. We utilize the Temporal Fusion Transformer (TFT) technique to train our multivariate time series data efficiently. TFT is specifically designed to handle such data, where each time step may contain multiple features or variables. To capture long-range dependencies within our integrated embryo development time series data synchronized with external variables, we will adapt attention layers in our transformers. The TFT's attention mechanism operates across both the time dimension (sequentially) and the feature dimension (across different variables like external and embryo development parameters). This capability allows the model to focus on specific features at specific time points based on learned dependencies, enabling accurate forecasting and pattern recognition. Furthermore, we aim to explore different approaches for building transformers based on our collected data to identify the most effective method or uncover any inherent trade-offs between them."

      "text": "A powerful strategy to address the challenge of a small training set in the IVF laboratory, involves leveraging synthetic data. Synthetic data has emerged as a promising solution to pre-train deep learning (DL) models, as it allows for effortless generation of labeled datasets using graphics engines. Generative DL models can play a crucial role in automatically synthesizing labeled datasets tailored to the specific learning task, with a content distribution that matches the data captured during IVF procedures, including factors such as development status and external laboratory environmental conditions like temperature, humidity, and particle levels. Currently, creating high-quality synthetic datasets often requires substantial time and expertise from qualified experts, particularly for tasks like generating driving scenes, controlling robots, or simulating indoor navigation. Therefore, there is a clear need to develop more efficient approaches. Techniques such as domain randomization and the use of generative adversarial networks (GANs) can be explored to adjust synthetic data distributions and make them more closely resemble the real-world data encountered in the IVF laboratory setting. These advancements will enhance the effectiveness of using synthetic data to augment limited training datasets in IVF research and development.\n\nLearning from Multiple Sources Using Multimodal Learning. We explore how different sensor modalities can be utilized to make models by extracting complementary knowledge from data streams, which can vary in terms of their data type (e.g. humidity, temperature, particle levels, pH, VOC's and embryo development data), representation, sampling frequency, statistical properties, and noise levels, to name just a few. We have previously explored how to combine and model input from several modalities (see e.g. [10, 11] ). In the context of this project we draw on and extend this experience, but also investigate other approaches (see e.g. [13] ) in an effort to obtain an improved and more accurate multimodal ML model that are more robust and less sensitive to a temporary lack of data from some of the data streams than the unimodal models. A multimodal learning approach will aid in utilizing all kinds of available data from sensors etc. to strengthen and make the ML models more robust, even though significant parts of the data may be unlabeled. This could be achieved by associating representations obtained through unsupervised training on unlabeled data  [11] . We explore and compare the use of multimodal Boltzmann Machines  [12]  with sets of Associative Self-Organizing Map (A-SOM)  [11]  representations -one for each modality -that learn to associate their respective activity at the same time as they learn to represent the input space for their respective modality in a compressed manner. The learnt associations between the SOM representations for the various modalities enable the predictions of temporarily missing modalities. The multimodal representations are then used as input to a deep neural network structure. The overall idea is to obtain a more stable predictive model based on several of the available multimodal data streams including those with missing data whereas also utilizing unlabeled data."

As AI becomes increasingly integrated into various societal applications, particularly in domains like healthcare, XAI plays a critical role in ensuring responsible and ethical deployment of AI technologies. The application of XAI to analyze IVF time-series data holds significant potential for uncovering intricate relationships and improving our understanding of the factors influencing IVF success rates. This can lead to better patient outcomes and informed decision-making in reproductive medicine, including optimization of external environmental factors. We propose a novel approach utilizing transformer-based techniques such as BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) in conjunction with LIME (Local Interpretable Model-agnostic Explanations). BERT's capacity for processing sequential data will be leveraged by converting and tokenizing the time-series data into a format suitable for BERT. Each time point or sequence will be represented as a series of tokens for BERT's processing, capturing contextual information and dependencies between tokens. Next, LIME will be employed to generate local explanations for individual predictions. This involves perturbing the features of the selected instance while keeping other parts of the data constant. An interpretable model are then trained on this perturbed data, alongside corresponding predictions from the BERT model. The resulting model computes local feature importance scores, revealing the contribution of each feature (or time step) to BERT's predictions for the specific instance. The integration of BERT and LIME in this context offers complementary advantages, enabling both sequence-based representation learning and local interpretability of predictions for each embryo throughout the IVF procedure. Furthermore, we explore additional explainable techniques in combination with transformer-based approaches to identify the most effective solution for analyzing IVF and external data. This approach represents a cutting-edge application of XAI to address the challenges of interpreting complex time-series data in the context of IVF, with the goal of improving decision-making and patient outcomes in reproductive medicine."

      "text": "Hearing impairment is a prevalent condition affecting millions of people worldwide  [16] . Early detection and intervention are crucial for mitigating its impact on speech, language, and cognitive development, particularly in infants and young children. Traditional audiometry relies on subjective responses from patients, making it unsuitable for those unable to provide reliable feedback, such as infants, newborns, and individuals with cognitive impairments. This limitation necessitates the development of objective audiometry methods that can accurately assess hearing capabilities without requiring active participation from the patient.\n\nRecent advancements in pupillometry, the measurement of pupil size and reactivity, have shown promise in the field of objective audiometry. Studies have demonstrated a correlation between Pupil Dilation Response (PDR) and auditory stimuli, suggesting that PDR could serve as a physiological indicator of sound detection and perception  [1] . This non-invasive technique offers a potential solution for evaluating hearing thresholds in non-collaborative patients, as it does not rely on subjective reports or behavioral responses.\n\nIn this context, it is worth to remark the impact that the Internet of Things (IoT) has in eye tracking technology. As in many other applications of healthcare domain  [4, 5, 11, 14] , eye tracking technology analyzes ocular movements and is a beneficiary of IoT advancements both in terms of enhanced connectivity and data processing capabilities. Conventional eye tracking systems, often constrained by standalone devices with limited computational and storage capacities, generally deployed in clinical settings, are nowadays transformed by IoT integration. This process facilitates connection to cloud services, increasing computational resources for instantaneous data analysis and implementation of machine learning algorithms. Consequently, this enhanced connectivity enables more sophisticated interpretation of ocular movement patterns, pupil response, gaze analysis and, in general, insights on human vision.\n\nAn important impact of IoT on eye tracking is the facilitation of real-time data acquisition and remote monitoring. In the healthcare domain, for instance, eye tracking serves as a valuable tool for monitoring patients with neurological conditions  [3] . IoT-enabled eye trackers can continuously gather and transmit data to healthcare providers without delay. This capability enables early detection of anomalies and allows for timely interventions, ultimately improving patient outcomes. Similarly, in the marketing sphere, real-time data from IoT-integrated eye trackers provides immediate feedback on consumer behavior, enabling dynamic adjustments to advertising strategies.\n\nIn this context, the APURE (Audiometry with PUpil REsponse) project aims to leverage pupillometry to develop an objective audiometer that can be used in clinical settings. The project's primary objectives are to:\n\n1. Develop an effective audiometry test for non-collaborative patients and validate it against gold-standard audiometry tests."

The project will focus on developing a pupillometry system that can accurately measure pupil size and reactivity in response to auditory stimuli. The system will incorporate advanced signal processing and machine learning algorithms to analyze the collected data and correlate it with hearing thresholds. Preliminary results of the project and data collected in this first stage are available in  [10] . In particular, the data collected in this work can be further analyzed to explore the correlation between physiological pupil responses to auditory stimuli and the emotional state of the user. The results could determine whether PDRs are a viable alternative or complement to traditional audiometric hearing tests in patients with limited responsiveness. They may also help to clarify how the visual and auditory systems work together to detect and localize external sounds.\n\nThe successful development and validation of an objective audiometer based on pupillometry would have a significant impact on the field of audiology. It would enable early detection and intervention for hearing impairments in populations that were previously difficult to assess, leading to improved outcomes for these individuals. Additionally, the open biomedical solution resulting from the project could contribute to research in other areas, such as cognitive science and psychology, where pupil response is used as an indicator of cognitive load or emotional state  [6] .\n\nIn this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of the eye-tracking sensor market, examining the strengths and weaknesses of various commercially available and open-source solutions. The survey will consider the specific requirements of the APURE project, with a particular emphasis on balancing performance, cost, and accessibility. By identifying the optimal sensor technology, we aim to pave the way for the development of an affordable, accurate, and user-friendly objective audiometer that can be readily deployed in clinical settings, ultimately improving the diagnosis and treatment of hearing impairments in diverse populations."

      "text": "The state-of-the-art in eye-tracking technology is constantly evolving, with new systems and features emerging regularly. The following presents a comparative analysis of several prominent eye-tracking systems, considering the key characteristics relevant to the APURE project:\n\n-Pupil Labs Pupil Core foot_18  : This open-source platform offers high accuracy (0.6 \u2022 ) and a sampling rate of up to 200 Hz. Its 120-degree field of view allows for flexibility in head movements, and it is robust to varying light conditions. The open-source software provides extensive analysis tools, making it accessible and customizable for researchers and developers. Pupil Core has been used in various research studies, including investigations of cognitive processes and attentional mechanisms  [12] .\n\n-Tobii Pro Glasses 3 foot_19  : This system offers high accuracy (0.6 \u2022 ) and a sampling rate of up to 100 Hz. Its 82-degree field of view is slightly narrower than Pupil Core, but it still allows for comfortable head movements. However, it requires controlled lighting conditions for optimal performance. The proprietary software provides advanced analysis features, making it suitable for research and commercial applications. Tobii Pro Glasses 3 have been used in studies on visual attention and social interaction  [13] . -SR Research EyeLink II foot_20  : This high-end system offers exceptional accuracy (up to 0.01 \u2022 ) and a sampling rate of up to 500 Hz, making it the most precise option on the market. However, it requires controlled lighting and is very expensive, limiting its accessibility to well-funded research laboratories. EyeLink II has been extensively used in various research fields, including cognitive neuroscience, psychology, and linguistics  [7] . -ETVision Wearable Eye Tracker foot_21  : This wearable eye tracking glasses offers high accuracy (0.5 \u2022 ) and a sampling rate of up to 180 Hz. The glasses can be equipped with an additional sun shield for very bright environments and a proprietary software is provided for data acquisition and analysis. The ETVision Wearable Eye Tracker can be used for gaze, pupillometry, saccade, and fixation data detection and has been used in children neuroscience studies  [15] . -EyeTech VT3 mini foot_22  : This fixed compact and lightweight eye tracker offers good accuracy and a sampling rate of up to 200 Hz. Its wide field of view and robustness to varying light conditions make it suitable for real-world applications. The system comes with proprietary software for data analysis and visualization.

Its compact design and ease of use make it a popular choice for researchers and developers. The system comes with open-source software for data analysis and can be integrated with various programming languages. Gazepoint GP3 has been used in studies on humancomputer interaction and usability  [2] .\n\nAs can be seen in Table  1 , each system offers a unique combination of features and capabilities, catering to different needs and budgets. The Pupil Labs Pupil Core, with its open-source platform and affordability, is an attractive option for researchers and developers seeking flexibility and customization. The Tobii Pro Glasses 3, while more expensive, boasts advanced features and proprietary software that may be appealing to those requiring a comprehensive solution. The SR Research EyeLink II, with its exceptional accuracy and high sampling rate, is a top-tier choice for research laboratories with substantial funding. The ETVision the user mobility and reducing tethering constraints. An additional advisable feature is incorporating multiple IR cameras per eye, enhancing pupil detection accuracy by providing multiple viewpoints, reducing occlusion and improving robustness. Lastly, maintaining a total cost below 15,000e ensures the system is economically viable for the project budget. It should be noted that the use of a threshold in Table  2  rather than a specific price for each product is justified by the fact that costs vary according to the sector requesting the product (public, private or academic). In addition, for devices with proprietary software, the cost of the licensing plan must be added to the initial price of the product. The latter is not fixed as each brand offers a range of plans to choose from. Under all the above conditions, the Tobii Pro Glasses 3 emerges as the most suitable eye-tracking device for the APURE project while the Pupil Labs Pupil Core, could be considered as the second most appropriate choice. These wearable systems offer a compelling combination of accuracy, usability, and affordability, aligning with the project's goals of developing an objective audiometer that is both effective and accessible.\n\nThe Tobii Pro Glasses 3 with its high accuracy (up to 0.6 \u2022 ), offers high precision and a sampling rate of up to 100 Hz, which is sufficient for capturing the relevant aspects of the pupil dilation response. The system's wider field of view (82 \u2022 ) ensures user comfort and allows for natural head movements during audiometry testing. Although the Tobii Pro Glasses 3 requires controlled lighting conditions, this can be easily achieved in a clinical setting. The system's proprietary software provides advanced analysis features, which may be beneficial for in-depth investigation of the relationship between pupil response and auditory stimuli. The device, composed of the wearable glasses and a portable recording and wireless communicating unit, is shown in Fig.  1 . The Tobii Pro Glasses 3 have been widely adopted in research and commercial applications due to their ease of use and robust performance. The provided web API easily allows to both capture the live streaming of the four eye cameras, the world camera and the pupil processed data, as shown in Fig.  2 . For example, they have been used to study visual attention patterns in real-world scenarios, such as shopping behavior and driving performance  [13] . The system's ability to capture natural eye movements in unconstrained environments makes it a valuable tool for understanding human behavior and cognition. The Pupil Labs Pupil Core, with its high accuracy (up to 0.6 \u2022 ) and sampling rate (up to 200 Hz), ensures precise and reliable measurement of pupil size and reactivity. This level of precision is crucial for capturing the subtle changes in pupil dilation that may be indicative of hearing thresholds. Additionally, the system's robustness to varying light conditions makes it suitable for use in diverse clinical settings, where lighting conditions may not always be perfectly controlled. The open-source nature of the Pupil Core platform further enhances its appeal, as it allows for customization and integration with other software tools, facilitating the development of a tailored solution for the APURE project. The only drawbacks of this system is the need to be connected through a USB cable to be operated and the fact that employs only one IR camera per eye. Overall, the versatility and adaptability of the Pupil Core have been demonstrated in various research applications. For instance, it has been successfully employed to investigate the effects of cognitive load on pupil dilation during complex tasks, providing valuable insights into the relationship between cognitive processes and physiological responses  [8] . Moreover, the Pupil Core's open-source nature has fostered a vibrant community of developers and researchers, contributing to a growing body of knowledge and resources for utilizing this technology in innovative ways.\n\nWhile the SR Research EyeLink II boasts superior accuracy and sampling rate, its high cost and requirement for controlled lighting make it less suitable for the APURE project, which aims to develop an affordable and accessible audiometer for widespread clinical use. While the ETVision Wearable Eye Tracker might be interesting for the exposed features, its high cost make it not viable for the project. The EyeTech VT3 mini and Gazepoint GP3, while more affordable, do not offer the same level of accuracy and precision as the Pupil Core and Tobii Pro Glasses 3, which are essential for reliable audiometry results.\n\nThe choice between Tobii Pro Glasses 3 and Pupil Labs Pupil Core was guided by the specific priorities of the APURE project. Initially, we considered the Pupil Core for its cost effectiveness and open source flexibility. However, the advanced analysis functions and wider field of view of the Tobii Pro Glasses 3 were ultimately more critical to our analysis. Given the available funding, we decided to purchase and test the Tobii Pro Glasses 3."

      "title": "1. Introduction",
      "text": "The changing demographics of the global population, with a growing number of individuals living with chronic conditions, poses significant challenges for healthcare systems worldwide. As more people require long-term care and support, there is a pressing need to ensure that individuals maintain optimal health to improve quality of life and reduce the burden on healthcare systems  [5, 9] .\n\nMobility and physical function are key indicators of overall health and wellbeing, regardless of age. A variety of tests exist to assess physical function  [9] . These tests focus on the capacity of the individual to accomplish specific tasks (e.g., activities from everyday living) or to measure physical performance (e.g. Timed Up and Go test and 6-Minute Walk Test) or muscle strength tests (e.g. the hand grip strength test). The tests are designed to provide objective results taken in standardized conditions, while being sensitive to changes and capturing the real biology of complex and multi-domain functions and conditions. They have repeatedly shown predictive capacity for negative health outcomes, like hospitalizations or mortality, and they are therefore often used as general markers of well-being linked to chronic conditions in addition to simple parameters of mobility or strength  [9] .\n\nTraditionally, these tests are conducted in clinics under the supervision of specialized health staff. The tests involve the measurement of a quantity such as duration to complete a test, walked distance or similar. For practical reasons, the test procedure is usually simple and conducted with simple instruments such as a stop watch. A certain level of subjectivity tends to leak into these tests, for example in terms of when exactly the test is considered started and completed, or how far a patient has actually walked, which introduces errors. Instrumented tests have been proposed with the use of digital technologies, particularly inertial sensors  [1] , smartphones  [10] , cameras  [2]  and wearables  [8] . Through embedded sensors in such technologies, measurements can be made more reliable and objective, and may further be augmented with additional information, such as gait analysis, which contain meaningful indicators about the status of the tested person or even hold predictive powers of future health risks. For example, in the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, the time to turn around  [4]  or the step length  [12]  have been found to be especially informative for assessing the status of patients.\n\nNotwithstanding the rich literature in instrumented tests, and the presence of several technical solutions, limited works have compared these solutions in terms of benefits and trade-offs. Within this study, we therefore aim at comparing different types of sensors to be used within a number of functional tests. Our focus is particularly on devices that are commercially available or close to market, inexpensive and that could be used also in home environments, with the potential application of home monitoring. The immediate aim of this paper is not to provide a comparison of the solutions in terms of performances or costs, but rather to provide a dataset for the research community to use for the development of algorithms and for comparisons, created by the use of a large range of relevant solutions. The dataset includes raw sensors data which requires further processing in order to extract metrics and indicators that are clinically significant. A few datasets exist of data that can be used for the evaluation of function, such as gait analysis  [3, 6, 11] . However, to the best of our knowledge, no dataset exists that includes raw information from multiple sensors collected while performing functional tests. This lack limits the ability to compare technical solutions in terms of reliability, signal quality, and other characteristics.\n\nThis paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 describes the technical setup and the data collection procedures, Sect. 3 provides examples of the data that was collected and a tool for their analysis and Sect. 4 concludes the work and indicates future research directions.\n\nFor data collection purposes, six healthy volunteers were recruited to this study -three males and three females, aged between 36 and 63 (average 51.3). All subjects were researchers located at CNR, Pisa, Italy, and data was collected between 2023-10-27 and 2023-10-31. No ethical review was needed because we did not collect clinical or physiological data and because of the technical nature of the work. Consent was obtained from all participants.\n\nParticipants were instructed to perform a series of functional capacity tests:\n\n-Timed Up and Go (TUG): the subject stands up from a chair, walks 3 m, turns around, walks back and sits down. The test was repeated 4 times, 2 at natural speed, and 2 at slow speed, using a metronome at 1 Hz to induce a cadence in the movement. -30-Second Chair Rise Test (30SCRT): the participant stands up and sits down on a chair repeatedly, as fast as possible, for 30 s. This task was executed once because it can be demanding for participants. -Locomo challenge: the subject stands up from one chair, using only one leg and with the arms crossed so that these cannot aid the subject during the task. This task was also executed once. -10-meter walk test: participants are asked to walk on a pathway of 10 m, with additional 2 m at both ends, for acceleration and deceleration. Walking pace is assessed across the 10-meter distance. The test was repeated twice. -40-meter walk test: subjects walk at natural speed over a 20-meter corridor, back and forth. The test is similar to the 6-minute walk test, but shortened. Each participant repeated the test twice.\n\nWe acquired data from an ensemble of sensors simultaneously during the functional tests, in order to maximize comparability of data across the technologies used:\n\n-SensingTex Sensing Mats foot_25  : are pressure sensorized mats with wireless connectivity and a spatial granularity of 2 square centimeters. We used 3 mats, one positioned over a chair, and two mats, 1.5 m long each, positioned to capture walking characteristics in the middle of the pathway. The mats covered the whole area of interest in the TUG, 30SCRT and Locomo challenge tests, but only a partial area in the 10 and 40-meter walk tests. The mats can capture detailed information about foot placement, pressure distribution, and temporal aspects of the gait cycle providing insights into balance, stride length, and the symmetry of gait, which are crucial for assessing mobility. -Ki-Foot sensorized Shoes: equipped with inertial measurement units (IMUs) and five pressure sensors per shoe to gather comprehensive data on foot movement and pressure distribution  [7] . The IMUs track movement and orientation, offering data on speed, acceleration, and directional changes, while pressure sensors across key points in the sole measure the distribution of force throughout the gait cycle. This combination allows for a detailed analysis of foot-ground interactions, stride characteristics, and potential abnormalities in walking patterns. -Smartphones: two smartphones were utilized, one attached to the lower back and the other held in the dominant hand, to record inertial sensor data, including acceleration, rotation rate and orientation. The smartphone placed on the lower back offers data reflective of the body core movements, while the smartphone held in the dominant hand can capture upper body dynamics and the coordination with the lower body during walking. -Smartwatches: worn on the wrist to collect inertial sensor data and photoplethysmography (PPG). Two models were used: Sony mSafety foot_26  and Ban-gleJS foot_27    [13] . Both devices were programmed with a custom firmware to stream raw sensors data. Worn on the arms, they can measure general activity levels, steps taken, and provide insights into the rhythm and pace of walking. -Kinect: used to collect video with information about the position and pose.\n\nIt can also be used as ground truth data for validating sensor readings. -Polar H10 Heart rate sensor: is placed on the chest and computes heart rate and heart rate variability from electrocardiography. Useful as a reference for the (PPG), this sensor was only used in 3 tests. -Polar Running Cadence foot_28  sensor: placed on a shoe, this determines the step rate and step distance of the person wearing it. It does not provide raw sensors data, but can be used as reference or to derive useful gait parameters.\n\nThese sensors were connected to 3 laptops either with USB connections (Kinect and sensorized mats) or wirelessly (smartwatches, sensorized shoes, heart rate and cadence sensors) to custom made applications. The smartphones run a web application, available at  https://dariosalvi78.github.io/Malisa/ , which gathered inertial sensor data and connected to the standard Bluetooth sensors for heart rate and cadence. The setup is visible in Fig.  1  and summarized in Table  1 .\n\nDevices that kept time, such as laptops, smartphones and watches, were synchronized at the beginning of each day by using network synchronization when available (laptops and smartphones) or manually (watches). Timestamping was done by those devices that kept time, i.e. laptops, smartphones and smartwatches. Timestamping was done both for data produced by the device itself, for example smartphones and smart watches, and for devices with no time keeping capability that were connected to them, for example via Bluetooth, timestamping was done at the receiving computer at the time the measurement was received. The source of timestamping is specifed in Table  1 .\n\nParticipants started each test by pressing a button on the smartwatch held in the hand and completed the test by pressing the button again. The timestamps of those 2 events were used as official start and end times of each test."

      "text": "Data was collected using the dedicated software for each hardware. Each sensor was activated before the actual start of the test and was stopped after the end of the test. Start and end of each test was assumed to correspond to when the participant pressed the button on the hand-held phone. All collected signals were later post-processed to only include 5 s before the first press of the button to start the test, and 5 s after the second press of the button (signifying end of the test), to help in case of offsets between clocks among devices. In this way, all signals are \"cut\" around the same timestamps. All data was later stored in comma-separated format files, with a uniform format with all timestamps represented as Unix timestamps with decimals. The data repository is publicly available on:  https://github.com/dariosalvi78/Malisa-Dataset .\n\nIn addition to pre-processing the data, we developed a software tool for the visualization of the signals, available at the same repository. The tool shows, for each participant and for each test, all signals acquired by all sensors (see Fig.  2 ) and allows to manually set markers on the plots. Markers can then be exported to a machine readable format, which allows researchers to conveniently use them in their analysis of the data. Markers can be used for identifying offsets between clocks, as they were not synchronized thoroughly during the experiments.\n\nWe present a qualitative analysis of the signals for a TUG for one subject to show how the phases of the tests can be identified in the data. The qualitative analysis could inspire the creation of algorithms that segment the data automatically. For instance, Fig.  3  shows the tri-axial rotation rate (gyroscope) signals of the smartphone positioned in the lower back during the TUG test. Step rate, step length, speed @1 Hz Fig.  2 . Tool for visualizing the dataset. The acceleration gathered by the phone placed on the lower back is shown. A researcher can mark points on the signal and export them for later analysis.\n\nWhile the subject is standing up, there is a rotation along the alpha axis corresponding to the participant leaning forward, followed by a counter rotation when the subject raises up their body. The walking phase is clearly visible from the regular, periodic rotations, followed by a pronounced rotation over the beta axis, corresponding to the turning around at the end of the 3 m path. A second segment with periodic, small rotations indicates the walk back and a second turning around over the beta axis corresponds to the final rotation before sitting down, indicated by the rotation along alpha which is similar to the earlier standing up phase. We also present an example related to the signals captured with the mats placed on the floor. In Fig.  3  it is possible to observe the position of the feet during the walking phase of the test. This information can be used to analyze of the gait of the subject, including step length, step rate, and the center of pressure. In the picture, for example, one can extract the distance between the left and right feet, when both feet are on the floor (double support phase of the gait cycle). Gait analysis is not usually done in a TUG because of its complexity, but the use of technology allows to add this important aspect to the test (Fig.  4 ).\n\nThe data collection presented some challenges. Keeping all the involved sensors activated and streaming simultaneously turned out to be complex, especially because some Bluetooth sensors disconnected during the tests. The software we employed did not implement automatic re-connection, which meant that, in some of tests, the data from some sensors may be missing. This was particularly true for the heart rate and running cadence sensors. Performing the tests required 3 researchers just to control all the equipment, which also introduced issues of communication and synchronization among them, as they had to agree when to start and stop the equipment. The effect was that some tests had to be repeated, especially on the first day of the data collection."

      "text": "The advent of inexpensive sensor technology offers a promising alternative to conventional functional tests. These have the potential to provide reliable and objective data, and to augment the conventional mobility and functionality tests with measurements that go beyond simple distances and times, adding rich information such as precise gait analysis metrics. The study we are reporting on in this paper focuses on the creation of a publicly available dataset which combines a large number of different technologies used at the same time by our participants.\n\nThis allows researchers to harness an ensemble of cutting-edge sensors, including sensorized mats, sensorized shoes, smartphones, and smartwatches, and a camera-based technology which produces skeleton-like mappings of the body. We encourage other researchers to make use of the collected data to develop algorithms for segmentation of the tests and extraction of parameters, as well as to compare sensor configurations for real-world applications such as in home monitoring.\n\nBy making this dataset public, our research addresses a critical gap in the literature and lays the groundwork for innovative strategies to monitor and assess mobility, a key aspect of overall health and well-being across various populations. This could lead to personalized interventions and improved support for individuals with diverse health conditions and mobility challenges.\n\nFuture research should expand on these initial results, focusing on larger, more diverse participant groups, including individuals with specific health conditions or mobility impairments. Additionally, exploring the integration of these technologies into daily life could enable continuous monitoring and personalized interventions, potentially improving health outcomes and quality of life for a wider range of individuals. Abstract. The Timed Up and Go (TUG) test is a widely recognized and standardized mobility test to measure basic mobility and balance capabilities. Despite the possibility to derive rich information about the patient, only the total time to complete the test is conventionally measured by a professional. This work examines the use of non-wearable sensors for the measurement of parameters of the test in an accurate and objective way. The study illustrates a system specifically designed for conducting the TUG test using a set of sensorized mats. The developed system is able to identify the following 4 phases of the test, with relative timestamps: TUG-time, Sit-to-Stand, Mid-Turning, and End-Turning-Stand-to-Sit. Additionally, meaningful parameters for gait assessment are also extracted: walking speed and stride length. Two experimental iterations were conducted to assess the reliability of the developed software. Both iterations involved two different groups of six healthy participants (41.58 \u00b1 13.32 yrs; 6 females, 6 males) performing various walking types. Our results demonstrate that sensorized mats can be used to segment the phases of the test reliably and can additionally be used to quantify gait parameters during the walk phase of the test."

      "title": "Keywords: Timed Up and Go",
      "text": "Walking is a fundamental human activity and by studying its characteristics, we can reveal significant information about an individual's physical health. In clinical terms, \"gait\" refers to the pattern of walking  [8] . Gait analysis (GA) aims to identify meaningful parameters related to the measurement of walking activity  [5] . Each parameter indicates a specific gait characteristic and can be used for various health assessments and to guide medical interventions  [4] .\n\nIn addition to gait analysis, other clinical tools exist for assessing posture  [1] , movement, and physical capacity, such as the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test  [6] . The TUG test is a semi-subjective test frequently used in physical therapy to measure the ability to maintain balance while walking  [9]  and predict the probability of falls in older people  [11] .\n\nSince these assessments require specialized personnel, there is a need for an automatic and inexpensive system for conducting such tests more frequently and autonomously. Recent technologies using sensors  [7]  allow for objective evaluation, making physical tests and gait characteristic measurements more efficient and effective, providing specialists with reliable information. One common approach is using sensorized mats, which can quantify pressure patterns under a foot over time.\n\nThe focus of this work is thus automatic identification of the phases of the TUG test through the use of sensorized mats. This allows the acquisition of rich, objective and reliable information about the patient being examined. Additionally, we aim at including gait analysis within the TUG test, which is, to the best of our knowledge, a scarcely explored area. Given its short duration, the TUG test is not typically used for objective gait analysis. However, guidelines related to the test suggest that clinicians should observe and annotate gait and balance during the test  [6] . There are indications that gait-related parameters are, in fact, more sensitive to disease progression than the simple duration of the test  [12, 13] .\n\nAmong the various approaches available for conducting the TUG test, we selected sensorized mats for this study due to their unique ability to provide detailed spatial and temporal pressure data across the foot during the entire test. Sensorized mats allow for the non-invasive, continuous monitoring of pressure distribution under the feet, which is crucial for accurately identifying the different phases of the TUG test, such as Sit-to-Stand and Mid-Turning. Additionally, they offer the advantage of being easy to use, requiring minimal setup, and not interfering with the subject's natural movement, making them ideal for both clinical and research environments. These characteristics make sensorized mats particularly effective for obtaining reliable and objective measurements of both TUG-time and gait parameters.\n\nA relevant example of a sensorized system for gait analysis is the GAITRite system  [3] , which offers a pressure-sensitive walkway, measuring temporal and spatial gait parameters. Despite its ease of use and lack of required setup or calibration, the device is expensive. Another related study developed an algorithm for estimating gait parameters through a commercial sensorized mat  [2] . This approach utilizes affordable commercial technology, making it more accessible for widespread use but with a lower spatial resolution. To be noted that none of these technologies have software developed specifically for conducting the TUG test.\n\nThere are gaps both in the literature and market concerning systems specifically designed to streamline and enhance analysis of the TUG test. For these reasons, we developed a system for conducting the TUG test using sensorized mats, improving reliability by objectively quantifying the time needed to complete the test versus the traditional semi-objective method, and incorporating additional gait parameters into the analysis.\n\nThe paper is structured as follows: Sect. 2 outlines the experimental setup, data collection and processing procedures, as well as parameter extraction methods and the validation techniques employed to assess the system's performance, in Sect. 3 we present and reflect on our results compared with our ground truth methods, as well as the evaluation of gait parameters which our system permits, and Sect. 4 concludes this paper with some final remarks."

Normal walk: Participants are instructed to walk at their usual pace along the walkway. As they are all healthy and have no gait impairment, it is assumed that there is a coordinated sequence of movements enabling efficient and smooth movement from one location to another. This involves alternating weight-bearing steps with one foot while the other foot swings forward in a rhythmic manner, which is the description of a normal human walk. 2. Slow walk: Participants are directed to walk slowly, synchronized with a metronome set at 60 beats per minute (bpm), along the same walkway. This is done to simulate patients with reduced pace of their mobility. In the second iteration, participants also wore a G-WALK foot_30  device by BTS Bioengineering to provide ground truth data. Video recordings were taken during each session to serve as an additional reference."

      "text": "The data processing pipeline consists of three subsystems: data collection, analysis algorithm, and parameter extraction algorithm. Each subsystem operates independently, with the output of one serving as the input for the next (Fig.  2 ). The code, written in Python, utilizes the Streamlit foot_31  framework across all subsystems to develop web-based applications with user-friendly interfaces. The collected data is stored in comma-separated-values (CSV) files, with each row containing readings from all sensors at a specific timestamp. The analysis algorithm processes the raw sensor data, ensuring the signals have constant sampling frequency, through resampling, and synchronization. It then employs a state machine to identify key events in the TUG test, such as transitions between sitting, standing, and walking phases (Fig.  3 ) and logs all the state transitions, or events, on a file.\n\nIn the initial state, when the individual is seated, a threshold on the seat mat total pressure triggers the transition to a standing position. Subsequent state transitions are tracked by monitoring the center of pressure (COP) coordinates against predefined thresholds illustrated in Fig.  4  and further referred to as A, B, and C.\n\nDuring the forward and return gait states, the algorithm distinguishes between double and single stances by analyzing the distance in y-axis between the first and last recorded pressure values. Additionally, it determines the left or right placement of single stances by dividing the walkway at a horizontal axis at threshold C and the total pressure on each side of the walkway. The final state transition uses the same personalized threshold as the initial state transition, on the seat, in order to identify the end of the test.\n\nEach state transition and gait phase is logged as an event. The analysis subsystem logs these events along with relevant parameters such as timestamps, COP coordinates, total pressure distribution, and event placements (left or right foot) on a CSV file as an input for the next subsystem. The parameter extraction algorithm identifies the phases of the TUG test (TUG-time, Sit-to-Stand time, Mid-Turning time, and End-Turning-Stand-to-Sit time) and gait parameters (walking speed and stride length) based on the logged events. Walking speed is determined by dividing the total distance covered during the forward and return gait phases by the total duration of those phases. Stride length is calculated by analyzing the distances between consecutive singlestance events. The subsystem also provides visual playback capabilities through heatmaps, as in Fig.  5 .\n\nThe performance of the algorithms was validated using two ground truth methods: the measures produced by G-WALK and observations from video recordings. The accuracy of TUG parameters was assessed by comparing the system's output to the ground truth data. The mean error (ME), standard deviation (STD) were calculated to quantify the system's accuracy and consistency. Bland-Altman analysis was also employed to evaluate the limits of agreement (LOA) between the two measurement methods."

      "text": "The performance of the algorithms when identifying the TUG phases was evaluated using observations from video recordings. The results for TUG-time of normal and slow walks show errors below the Minimal Clinically Important Difference (MCID) threshold of 3.5 s for both normal and slow walks. The MCID represents the smallest change in a treatment outcome that is considered significant or meaningful to patients. The Bland-Altman Limits of Agreement (LOA) for normal walking were +2.00 s and -0.51 s, and for slow walking were +2.57 s and -0.13 s, indicating good agreement between the system's output and the ground truth. The system's performance was less accurate for abnormal walks however, highlighting the need for further refinement to accommodate diverse gait patterns. As our abnormal walk data was created by healthy volunteers simulating movement inhibitions, we were expecting this to be the worst case in terms of accuracy -possibly as a result of exaggerated abnormalities in the walking style.\n\nThe analysis of other TUG phases (Mid-Turning, Sit-to-Stand, and End-Turning-Stand-to-Sit) showed fair to good reliability, with the End-Turning-Stand-to-Sit parameter being the least reliable due to challenges in distinguishing it from the Stand-to-Sit phase. Table  1  summarizes the results for the TUG parameters. The mean absolute error (MAE) for all TUG parameters was below 1 s, indicating that, on average, the system's measurements were within 1 s of the ground truth. The mean error (ME) values were also relatively small, suggesting that the system did not consistently overestimate or underestimate the TUG  To provide a more comprehensive analysis, the TUG parameters were also evaluated separately for each walk type (normal, slow, and abnormal) using G-WALK as the ground truth. The results, presented in Table  2 , reveal that the system's performance varied across different walking conditions. For normal and slow walks, the system generally performed well, with relatively low mean errors and standard deviations for most TUG parameters. However, the system's performance deteriorated for abnormal walks, particularly for the Sit-to-Stand and End-Turning-Stand-to-Sit parameters, which showed larger errors and higher variability. Furthermore, in Table  2 , the Mid-turning phase for the slow walk shows relatively higher Mean Error (ME) and Standard Deviation (STD) compared to other phases. The relatively higher ME and STD observed in the slow walk for the Mid-turning phase can be partly attributed to the fact that participants were mimicking a slower pace rather than walking naturally. This act of mimicking could introduce inconsistencies and exaggerated movements, particularly during the Mid-turning phase, where precise coordination is required.\n\nThe variability in how participants executed the slower pace, combined with the subtler and more cautious movements, likely led to irregularities in sensor detection, resulting in greater measurement error. This highlights a limitation of the current system in accurately capturing movements that are not naturally performed, suggesting the need for further refinement to better accommodate varied gait patterns."

      "title": "3.2. Evaluation of Gait Parameters",
      "text": "The system ability to calculate gait parameters was limited by its inability to consistently identify all phases of the gait cycle. While it could differentiate between double and single stances, it struggled to accurately detect heel strikes and toe-offs. This is mostly due to the low sampling frequency of 10 Hz which limits the ability to capture enough details of the movement of each foot. Sometimes only the heel strike is visible, other times only the tip of the foot is instead captured. Consequently, the calculated stride length exhibited high variability, especially during slow and abnormal walks. Table  3  summarizes the results for the gait parameters. The average walking speed calculated by the algorithm, for normal walking, was 0.93 m/s, which is within reasonable bounds when compared to reference values from the literature  [10] . However, the high variability in stride length measurements, as evidenced by the wide Bland-Altman LOA and high standard deviation, suggesting the need for further refinement of the algorithm."

      "text": "Step counting devices, also known as pedometers or activity trackers, have gained significant popularity in recent years, as small wearable devices have become an integral part of many individuals' daily lives  [1] . Wearables exist for different parts of the body, and the ones which embed step counting functions are generally watches (such as smartwatches and activity trackers)  [2, 3] , smartphones  [4] , foot-worn  [5]  and ankle-worn  [6]  devices, sensorized insoles  [7, 8] , smart glasses  [9] , smart rings  [10] , sensorized shirts  [11] , chest-worn bands  [12] , and earbuds  [13] .\n\nWearables embed different types of sensors, the most common of which are Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), barometers, and GPS systems when they are used for step counting. IMUs are composed of accelerometers, gyroscopes, magnetometers, or a combination of those sensors. Miniaturized accelerometers can detect when a step is performed from the acceleration pattern  [14] . In most circumstances, the accelerometer acts as the lead sensor while the gyroscope functions as the supplementary sensor. There are walking patterns, such as climbing stairs, where performance improves when gyroscopic data are used due to the oscillation of the body. Barometers can be useful in detecting steps while climbing stairs, due to the differences in elevation detectable from atmospheric pressures  [15] . Additionally, GPS data can be fused with other sensor data to estimate the number of steps taken, distance and speed. All these sensors can be embedded in devices applied on different body locations, mostly on the wrist such as in the case of smartwatches and activity trackers.\n\nSensorized insoles can be based on several types of sensors, commonly capacitive or piezoresistive  [16] , and differ from the previously cited technology as they are directly applied under the foot, therefore they directly sense the pressures applied on the insole and can derive the number of steps. Another technology of interest is ankle force myography (FMG), which is recorded by using piezoresistive sensors surrounding the ankle to register the volumetric changes during muscle activities. Even during a low-speed walking, where accelerometer-based step counters encounter difficulties  [6] , the contraction and relaxation of the extensors and flexors causes different force distributions on the ankle-worn band, resulting in distinctive FMG patterns, and thus allowing to count the number of steps.\n\nA limitation of commercial step counting wearable devices, and of wearable devices in general, is that users often have limited access to raw data, and platforms lack the flexibility needed for research purposes. Researchers require the ability to conduct simultaneous measurements from multiple devices and need the flexibility to customize acquisition parameters to suit their specific study needs. In fact, to do research effectively, a platform must be customizable in terms of number and type of devices to be acquired, sensors, sampling frequency, sensitivity, possibility to have a backup with no data loss, and choice between raw and processed data.\n\nFurthermore, several devices currently available on the market, in particular smartwatches and activity trackers, do not have published validation data, therefore the accuracy and reliability of such devices must be assessed before using them. Some studies show how different smartwatches output different numbers of steps after the same walking activity is performed  [17] , thus raising doubts about the validity of some algorithms embedded in commercial smartwatches. Moore et al.  [18]  presented a scoping review on treadmill-based validation of step counting wearable technologies, in an attempt to provide a harmonized, empirically based set of best practices. As a recommendation on a given number of steps per day to take is being increasingly used both in individual and public health interventions, as in the case of the \"10000 steps per day\" recommendation from by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  [19] , validation of wearables for step counting becomes critical."

In fact, the ANT USB2 stick supports up to 8 ANT channels and a combined message data rate of up to 190 Hz with 8-byte data payload in broadcast transmission. As 5 Hz of bandwidth are reserved for the control channel, 185 Hz are left for data transmission; we choose a maximum settable data rate of 180 Hz (BW total ) to facilitate computations when multiple units are used. To obtain the maximum bandwidth per unit (BW unit ), BW total must be divided by the number of units n units used in the acquisition, as in Eq.  (1) .\n\nFurthermore, the maximum data rate (MDR) is influenced by the number of sensors used in the acquisition (n sensors ), as each sensor output occupies 6 bytes (1-byte LSB and 1-byte LSB for each axis).

The adaptive threshold is shown in each acquisition, and the number of steps that can be manually counted by looking at the signal is almost the same as the number of steps detected by the threshold-based algorithm. Furthermore, the possibility to have an adaptive threshold proved useful as in the three presented traces, all obtained from the same participant, the threshold is different, specifically higher as walking speed increases.

      "title": "4. Discussion and Conclusions",
      "text": "This work describes the main characteristics of a flexible, custom-made IMU-based unit worn on the foot and used as a reference for step counting in an experimental protocol to validate a wrist-worn smartwatch. Positioning the unit on the foot allows not to detect artifacts due to arm and upper body movements, which is a major limitation of smartwatch-based step counting algorithms.\n\nBy means of a simple, threshold-based algorithm, the number of steps can be detected in a highly controlled situation such as walking on a treadmill. From the IMU-based unit, we are able to detect a signal with the typical waveforms reported in the literature  [5] . One limitation of this work is that in more ecological conditions, such as walking outdoor or at an irregular pace, this algorithm is probably going to decrease its performance.\n\nFurthermore, the number of enrolled participants is low, and it is therefore difficult to determine to what extent the signal processing strategy is robust even on a treadmill. Further tests are needed to assess the transmission data loss and the robustness of the threshold-based method. However, the flexibility of the designed IMU-based device allows to obtain raw accelerometer, and if needed gyroscope and magnetometer, data without data loss when the SD card is enabled, thus allowing researchers to perform further post-processing and analysis depending on the need.\n\nThe ANT protocol provides an easy strategy for integrating multiple units, but it has a limited bandwidth in the present configuration (broadcast transmission). This means that even with two IMU-based units instead of only one it would be no longer possible to collect data at 100 Hz from both, even if 100 Hz is a commonly used sampling frequency in motion analysis studies. As of today, the user sets the sampling frequency, and this value corresponds to the data transmission frequency too. One possible improvement consists in implementing the possibility of sampling data at a higher frequency, saving them into the SD card, and only send a subset of such data wirelessly. Furthermore, substituting the ANT protocol with BLE would allow to solve this problem, and to avoid the problem of supporting the ANT protocol in the first place, a feature that several smartphones do not have, including Apple smartphones. Using BLE, in combination with adequate app development in other programming languages such as Dart (i.e., using Flutter, which is designed to work on all operating systems), would allow to install the app on almost all users' smartphones with no limitations.\n\nFinally, the presented configuration uses only one IMU-based unit for step counting; however, the firmware and mobile application are designed with the purpose of integrating multiple devices in the BSN, either more IMU-based units, as it was discussed before, or other types of units. As mentioned in the Introduction, one of the main challenges of researchers is to be able to acquire exactly the combination of data needed for an experimentation, which varies from one experimental campaign to the other, and is a need that is not presently satisfied by commercial experimental platforms. The presented system enables the acquisition of various data combinations, including one setup with an IMU-based unit on the foot and another on the wrist. This configuration could be used to optimize step-counting algorithms on smartwatches in real-world settings, using footworn sensing as a reference. Another opportunity is to study the locomotor-respiratory coupling by acquiring raw data from two or three  [25]  chest-worn IMU-based units. In previous works, we have used different combinations of the following units: three IMU-based units  [20, [25] [26] [27] [28] , a pulse oximeter  [20, 27] , a single-lead patch ECG  [29] , and an environmental monitor  [30] . We plan to include in this platform other devices, including a wearable monitor of the partial pressure of transcutaneous carbon dioxide  [31]  and a module for electrodermal activity monitoring. This would enable much more complex analyses of multiple parameters and their interactions with each other during different activities and in various conditions."

Approximately half of individuals with disabilities in the United States lead inactive lifestyles despite the acknowledged health advantages of exercise.

Various factors hinder their participation in physical activities, such as challenges related to transportation, limited access to suitable facilities, and a shortage of skilled professionals who understand disability  [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Teleexercise, which involves the remote delivery of exercise sessions through telehealth, has emerged as a feasible substitute for exercising in person at a nearby fitness facility  [10] . Numerous tele-exercise modalities (asynchronous method, real-time exercise session in one-on-one or group setting, access to live or offline health coaches.) have been explored; however, no universally effective modality caters to the diverse needs of all individuals with disabilities.\n\nThe primary aim of this research is to employ a novel experimental methodology called SMART (Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial) in order to ascertain the optimal strategy for organizing an optimal sequence of multimodal teleexercise tailored for individuals with disabilities (referred to as an adaptive intervention), in conjunction with predictive analytics on participant adherence within a structured series of physical activity interventions."

Predictive analytics is crucial in determining the ideal number of health coaching calls. At the same time, insights from patient-reported outcomes and data collected from wearable sensors aid in distinguishing between responders and non-responders to the initial treatment, thereby influencing the sequential randomization process. A comprehensive monitoring dashboard and automated messaging functionalities are implemented to enhance participant adherence to the intervention program. The primary focus of this study will center on evaluating the level of physical activity, while the secondary outcomes will delve into behavioral aspects, pain management, and fatigue levels.

For example, the health score will be in a high range when users continuously collect points from performing daily activities that contribute to environmental sustainability. Users can collect points from performing different activities (e.g. collecting trashes). Additionally, there is a leaderboard page which enables social comparison among users' connections and friends. The application also provides personalized information about ecological footprint using different modalities (e.g. video, text). In other words, the persuasive messages provided in this page will be adapted to users' environmental values. For example, users who have biospheric value will see recommendations about how to save the planet with their every day's actions.

      "text": "Menopause is a normal part of the ageing process, characterized by the permanent cessation of menstrual periods and reproductive ability. During the menopause transition, women experience various physical, psychological, and social changes. Vasomotor symptoms, characterized by hot flushes and/or night sweats, are the main symptoms of menopause, with 40% of postmenopausal women in Europe reporting moderate-to-severe vasomotor symptoms  [1] . Other psychosocial and physical complaints include weight gain, sleep disturbances, mood swings, anxiety, fatigue, joint aches and pains, and sexual dysfunction. Many of these symptoms can be distressing and can negatively affect a woman's quality of life (QoL)  [2, 3] .\n\nPhysical activity (PA) may help attenuate the negative influence of menopause  [4, 5] . However, despite the well-established benefits, most midlife women are not sufficiently active  [5] . Physical activity is an important determinant of physical functioning (PF), which refers to the ability to perform basic and instrumental activities of daily living. In the Study of Women's Health across the Nation (SWAN), 29.6% of midlife women studied reported moderate functional limitations and 11.0% reported severe limitations  [6] . However, women who maintain high or moderate PA during midlife showed significantly superior PF than those who maintain low PA  [7] ."

Following data collection in the laboratory, participants were provided with a Withings ScanWatch to wear to quantify PA for the following 3-months.

      "text": "Women in midlife report a variety of symptoms associated with menopause, the most common being; sleep problems, joint and muscular discomfort, hot flushes and physical and mental exhaustion. The strong negative correlation between 6MWT distance and MRS scores, suggests that higher physical functioning improves the symptoms of menopause, thereby increasing QoL. In addition the negative correlation, albeit moderate between steps and MRS suggests that menopausal symptoms were experienced less by women who had higher levels of PA. This study provides evidence for the positive effects of PA in midlife women. However in the cohort studied, overall PA levels were moderate. Midlife women tend to report low motivation for PA and experience a number of barriers to PA engagement.\n\nDigital health interventions may potentially encourage midlife women to increase PA. However, despite the development and evaluation of multiple technology-based interventions to promote PA, it remains unclear how to develop and design digital interventions that are both engaging and effective at changing PA behavior. In addition, there is a lack of digital interventions targeting an increase in PA levels specifically in menopausal women. Many digital intervention approaches are static and do not take into account the changing needs of the individual and their environment.\n\nRecent progress in the field of digital health has enabled the development of interventions which provide responsive behavior change support in real-time. Just-intime adaptive interventions (JITAI) holds enormous potential for promoting healthy behavior change. A JITAI leverages mobile and wireless technology and adapts \"over time to an individual's changing status and contexts\", with the goal to deliver support \"at the moment and in the context that the person needs it most and is most likely to be receptive\"  [11] . JITAIs are designed to dynamically address the need of the user via the provision of the right amount or type of support needed at the right time  [12] . Our future work seeks to develop a JITAI specifically targeting PA and sedentary behavior in middle-aged menopausal women. The developed intervention will apply deep learning and advanced analytics to the behavior and context related data gathered by the platform in order to optimize the intervention and achieve the best outcome. In addition to examining the feasibility of the approach, this proposed research will also examine the effectiveness of the developed adaptive intervention in promoting PA and reducing sedentary behavior in menopausal women."

      "text": "The present systematic literature review on social media and its impact on Orthorexia Nervosa (ON) was conducted for the purpose of better understanding the relationship between social media and the condition of ON. As communities evolve at the current fast paced manner, there is much room for the various developments in the human psyche. Most recently, a topic that has come into discussion has been that of Orthorexia Nervosa (ON) which is a condition mainly characterized by an obsessive need to eating healthy  (Donini et al., 2022) . Previous studies have linked it to obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) or Anorexia Nervosa (AN) (Koven & Abry, 2015;  Barthels et al., 2016) . However, ON is also comprised of other symptoms not found in other Eating and Feeding Disorders. Over the years, researchers have argued that ON's prominent indicator is that the anxiety in relation to food is correlated with quality as opposed to quantity (as is in AN, Bulimia Nervosa (BN), Binge-Eating Disorder (BED))  (Donini et al., 2022; Lopez-Gil et al., 2023) . Other differences show that body image dissatisfaction and ON are not significantly correlated in some studies  (Brytek-Matera et al., 2015) . The latter means that the obsessive focus on healthy eating is not directly related to body image dissatisfaction as much as health satisfaction and perfectionism  (Barnes & Caltabiano, 2016) . Other factors that have been confirmed to have an influence on ON development are social media use  (Scheiber et al., 2023) , exercise (Hafstad et al., 2023), and discourses on social media platforms such as TikTok and Instagram (Santarosa et al., 2019) (Fig.  1 ).\n\nIn recent years, social media has become a pervasive part of daily life, influencing behaviors, attitudes, and perceptions with specific notations to healthy eating and eating habits. Platforms such as Instagram and TikTok allow for the rapid dissemination of information, including content related to health and nutrition  (Greene et al., 2023) . The visual and interactive nature of social media amplifies both positive and negative messages about eating habits (Santarosa et al., 2019). Therefore, the question is how are these relationships established and what the next steps are. This systematic literature review aims to examine the impact of social media on the development and reenforcement of ON symptoms.\n\nA comprehensive search strategy was employed to identify relevant studies including databases such as EBSCO Host, Sage Journals Online, Taylor & Francis, and PubMed. The search terms used were \"orthorexia nervosa\", \"social media\", \"impact\", and \"influence\" alongside combinations. Owing to operators such as AND/OR, the search was refined and displayed studies specifically addressing the intersection of social media use and its impact on orthorexia nervosa. The review employed the review of literature within the references sections to maximise the coverage of relevant studies and research articles.\n\nInclusion criteria included: Published in the last ten years; peer reviewed articles; qualitative, quantitative and mixed-method studies; studies in the English language.\n\nExclusion criteria included: Studies indirectly looking into ON; Articles without empirical data (e.g., editorials, opinion pieces); Primarily non-English language publications.\n\nFurthermore, the analysis employed several quality, accuracy, and consistency measures. To ensure the quality of the systematic literature review, studies were assessed using the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) checklist. The checklist offered the means for a standardized approach to evaluate the rigor and reliability of the reviewed studies. The reviewer ensured that the databases were double-checked so as to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the studies extracted. Any discrepancies were resolved through discussion or consultation with a second unaffiliated reviewer (Fig.  2 )."

As implicated by studies included in this literature review, there is a dire need for more research exploring these relationships. With the consistent growth of platforms like TikTok and Instagram, and the increase of social media use since the pandemic, ON becomes an increasingly concerning condition.

The findings of this study will provide valuable evidence for suggesting improvements and enhancing the current operations of digital clinical trials. We recommend that workflow and guidance for CRCs need to be tailored to digital clinical trials. In particular, decentralized or virtual clinical trials are emerging, which means that digital-based trial platforms will need to carry out most of the research activities performed by CRCs without their involvement. Thus, the current challenges of CRCs will be shifted to study participants interacting with the trial platform in virtual clinical trials, as their new barriers. Therefore, service vendors related to digital interventions or trial platforms should consider making their services more user and workflow-friendly in terms of digital health.\n\nBackground. Despite increased downloads and utilization of various mobile health (mHealth) apps emphasizing the significance of technology-based remote monitoring and diagnosis for further progress  [1] , a major barrier to patient care in the use of mHealth interventions is attrition  [2] . In addition, many mHealth studies struggle with high participant dropout rates due to the fundamental challenge of maintaining participant engagement  [3] . For instance, similar to other extensive mHealth investigations, the prominent MyHeart Counts study led by Stanford University encountered significant dropout rates; the average app engagement lasted only 4.1 days  [4] . In addition to this, other previous studies have found that as many as 80% of participants in mHealth interventions may only minimally engage with the service, defined as logging in fewer than twice, and only a small percentage of users consistently use the intervention over the long term  [5, 6] . Although clinical trials often report retention rates of 70% or higher, these trials are typically short-term, some lasting fewer than two months, and may not reflect real-world use  [7] . Besides, an observational study of app usage in a large real-world cohort discovered that only 2% had maintained continuous usage which would likely lead to improved clinical outcomes  [8] . These low retention rates may indicate the minimal benefit of mHealth. In addition, some people could not be able to access or adopt mHealth to manage their health, which varies significantly by country and target population, resulting in unequal opportunities for health  [9, 10] . Therefore, scrutinization of factors related to low retention rates of mHealth apps or interventions in realworld settings and barriers that prevent people from accessing and adopting mHealth is a crucial precondition for better clinical or behavioral outcomes. The main purpose of the study is to identify factors related to inequalities in the use of mobile health in each phase by conducting a systematic review of previously published articles."

More than half studies (61.3%) were conducted in North America, especially in the United States (59.7%). Most included studies were observational studies (75.8%), including crosssectional (37.1%), prospective (12,9%), and retrospective (25.8%) studies. While the qualitative and observational studies tended to meet the most criteria for quality assessment using the MMAT  [11] , the RCTs were less likely to meet the criteria. All included studies were then classified into four implementation phases: access (37.1%), adoption (75.8%), adherence (14.5%), and maintenance (3.2%), which were also considered as the outcome. In addition, inequality indicators were collected from the included studies, and these were classified by levels of influence (individual, interpersonal, community, and societal) and domains of influence (biological, behavioral, physical/built environment, digital/mobile environment, sociocultural environment, and health care system). Based on these principles, a visual framework that represents all extracted inequality indicators in mHealth utilization was constructed. From this framework, it was found that a myriad number of inequality indicators are involved across the implementation phases, especially at the access and adoption phases. To summarize, genetic factors and education level were consistently associated with mHealth utilization across the phases. In addition, comorbidities and mentally or physically impaired health conditions were related to access to mHealth. The behavioral and sociocultural domains had many factors related to access, adoption, and adherence to mHealth. The digital/mobile domains also had a sheer number of factors associated with mHealth utilization, such as digital literacy/numeracy, frequency of smartphones, using the Internet for health issues, readiness to use mHealth and awareness about mHealth. Besides, the healthcare system and physical environment domains were related to access and adoption of mHealth.\n\nMeta-analyses were conducted only for the access and adoption phases, due to the criteria, which required at least three articles for each inequality indicator. At the access Unveiling Inequalities in Mobile Health Utilization phase, while the increase in age was negatively associated with mHealth utilization (OR = 0.96; 95% CI = 0.95, 0.97), a higher level of education had a positive association with mHealth utilization (OR = 2.08; 95% CI = 1. 25, 3.46) .

Introduction: Hysteroscopy is the most frequently performed procedure in gynecology, essential for diagnosing and treating menstrual abnormalities, infertility, suspected endometrial cancer, and congenital uterine anomalies. Diagnostic hysteroscopy lacks a standardized protocol for reporting findings, resulting in inconsistent documentation practices among doctors and hospitals. In Cyprus, but also in a significant percentage of public and private clinics internationally, health records remain paper-based, which hampers efforts to standardize and share health data globally. This situation is untenable in an era where global health data standards are becoming increasingly important for secondary use, cross-system and cross-border communication.\n\nCurrent Systems: Existing systems for diagnostic hysteroscopy allow for image capture through hysteroscopes. However, the equipment used, is not typically connected to Electronic Health Records (EHR) systems, especially in smaller clinics. The latter introduces a manual process, where healthcare professionals transfer these images and/or videos via external storage equipment (i.e., USB drives) to their personal computers for creating clinical reports. This process is inefficient and prone to errors, highlighting the need for a more streamlined and standardized approach.\n\nProposed System: We developed a fully customizable add-on module to our Electronic Health Record system but also for any 3 rd party EHR solution, that revolutionizes the current processes. The proposed module connects directly to hysteroscopes, capturing medical images and medical video operated via a userfriendly interface and/or voice commands, and then stores them in a database, linked to the patient's profile, thus eliminating the need for additional transfers and hardware. It standardizes the report structure for all users (e.g., doctors), thus allowing for automated clinical report generation, which can be further customized to conform to health insurance organizations' requirements. Importantly, it enables the introduction of additional software as a service (SaaS) AI guidance module(s) based on images/ video during hysteroscopy procedures, while it supports 2 nd opinion provision via real-time and/or on demand medical video streaming  [9] . Moreover, the resulting system benefits from the Health Level 7 (HL7) Clinical Document Architecture (CDA) certification inherited from our EHR system, ensuring that it adheres to global health data standards, facilitating international data sharing, interoperability, and aligning and reinforcing the European Health Data Space (EHDS) regulation.\n\nConclusion: This work demonstrates that simple healthcare procedures often overlooked by technology vendors can greatly benefit from novel, customizable interventions. Our EHR system not only makes hysteroscopic data globally accessible but also provides a powerful tool for capturing data to train AI models, ensuring that critical health data is standardized, shareable, and usable on a global scale. Gynecology is a specialized field in medicine focusing on the health and diseases of the female reproductive system, including the uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, and breasts. This branch of medicine encompasses a wide range of conditions and treatments, from routine health checks and preventive care to complex surgical procedures  [4, 5] . Gynecologists manage reproductive health, diagnose and treat disorders such as endometriosis, fibroids, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), and cancers of the reproductive organs. They also provide essential services related to pregnancy, childbirth, and menopause, ensuring comprehensive care throughout a woman's life  [6, 7] ."

At the same time, existing systems in Cypriot hospitals for diagnostic hysteroscopy are outdated and inefficient. While hysteroscopes can capture images, the process requires manual transfer of these images via USB to personal computers, followed by report creation using text editors. This manual approach is time-consuming and prone to errors, leading to inconsistent documentation practices among healthcare providers.\n\nThese challenges highlight the urgent need for more streamlined and standardized Health IT solutions to improve the efficiency, accuracy, and standardization of medical documentation and data management in Cyprus.\n\n2 Current EHR Systems and Hysteroscopy"

These systems enable the capture of images via hysteroscopes, which are essential for visualizing the uterine cavity. However, the process for handling these images is cumbersome and somewhat outdated. After capturing the images, doctors are required to manually transfer them from the hysteroscope to their personal computers. Once the images are transferred, reports must be generated manually using text editors. This process involves inserting the captured images into a report format and adding descriptive text to document the findings.

Firstly, the manual transfer of images and report creation is a timeconsuming process. It requires multiple steps, each of which adds to the overall time taken to complete the procedure and document the findings. Secondly, manual processes are inherently prone to human error. Mistakes can occur during the transfer of images, the input of data, and the creation of reports, leading to inconsistencies and inaccuracies in medical documentation. Importantly, there is no support for video files, posing significant security and privacy concerns to accompanying video files.\n\nAdditionally, there is a lack of standardized protocol for reporting hysteroscopy findings, resulting in varied documentation practices among doctors and hospitals. This lack of uniformity makes it difficult to compare data across different institutions and hinders collaborative efforts. The reliance on paper-based health records further complicates the situation. Paper records are difficult to manage, prone to physical degradation, and do not support easy sharing or integration with digital health systems. Lastly, the absence of adherence to global health data standards in the current systems limits the ability to share and utilize health data at an international scale. This is\n\n234 A.

Tracheostomy is a medical procedure frequently used to secure patients' airways. Typically, healthcare providers measure the patients' neck diameters and tracheas using 3D-CT in order to select specific sizes of tracheostomy tubes. Further, specific decisions before and/or during the procedure may also depend on collected and evaluated data regarding the clinical condition or unique characteristics of the patients. To this day, healthcare providers rely on their intuitive judgment based on previous relevant experience, with no systematic metrics unequivocally guiding their decisions, since no research exists in the literature that investigates patterns in these data. On the other hand, artificial intelligence (AI)-based methods have proved to be powerful tools used in medical care. However, although Deep Learning (DL) techniques have already shown excellent performance in image processing and diagnosis, their combination with the analysis of data informing the clinical condition and unique characteristics of patients remains unexplored, especially in the ENT (i.e., ear, nose, throat) surgical practice. Herein, we will combine these analyses to reveal patterns that previous statistical methods failed to identify. Our model will incorporate both convolutional neural networks for the automated measurement of 3D-CT scans and automated natural language processing of DL to extract clinically relevant information. We aim to create a tool with high diagnostic accuracy comparable to that of experienced healthcare providers. Our study will provide an implementation of AI-based systems that will be able to assist physicians in handling big data and improving diagnostic efficiency, as well as in clinical decision making in cases of high complexity or uncertainty.\n\nKeywords: Tracheostomy \u00c1 Artificial Intelligence \u00c1 Deep Learning"

      "title": "1. Introduction",
      "text": "Tracheostomy is one of the most frequently performed procedures in ENT (i.e., ear, nose, throat) surgical practice  [1] . Tracheostomy patient care requires some of the highest financial expenditures compared to other diagnostic or procedural groups. It is common for patients with acute respiratory failure and may be required in an emergency setting to bypass an obstructed airway. More commonly, it facilitates mechanical ventilation, helps wean patients from a ventilator, or allows for more efficient management  [2] . The procedure of tracheostomy consists of several steps, during which the healthcare provider is expected to choose various parameters of the process and act according to the patient's unique characteristics. The number of parameters along with the frequency of tracheostomy and the patient's characteristics result in a huge amount of data, which can be analyzed and reveal patterns. This multitude of parameters than may be considered for the customization of the tracheostomy procedure to individual patients offers a great choice to the practitioners; at the same time, however, it presents them with a formidable challenge. According to the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD), tracheostomy-related complications were experienced by 24% of patients in Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and 31% of ward patients  [3] . Therefore, efforts to optimize tracheostomy practice may favorably affect both the quality of care and the resources expended in delivering this care of secretions, among other reasons.\n\nTo this day, healthcare providers rely on their intuitive judgment and relevant experience with previous medical cases to make estimates, as no systematic metrics unequivocally guide their decisions. To our knowledge, there is no research in the literature that investigates patterns in these data  [4] .\n\nArtificial Intelligent (AI) methods have proved to be powerful tools in the medical care community in recent years. The creation of complex network architectures that process mathematical functions with millions of parameters has enabled machines to analyze and interpret intricate data with high accuracy  [5] . From image processing to analysis of electronic health data, Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques have demonstrated incredible performance. ML in healthcare has rapidly evolved, offering groundbreaking advancements in diagnostics, treatment planning, patient monitoring, and operational efficiency. DL on the other hand has notably enhanced computer vision. The advent of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) has greatly improved AI's ability to classify images, detect objects, and determine their locations, surpassing the results achieved with traditional machinelearning techniques. Recent initiatives to apply DL to medical image classification have revealed its enormous potential. These applications have shown significant progress in supporting diagnostic decisions, predicting prognoses, and managing hospital triage, underscoring AI's transformative role in healthcare  [6] .\n\nOur study is aiming to combine these ML and DL methods to automatically predict the tracheostomy parameters and identify hidden patterns in the clinical data."

      "text": "A segmentation task involves outlining an exact boundary around histologic structures to extract detailed morphological features accurately. Segmentation is generally challenging, especially when the structures have various possible appearances. As a result, a single comprehensive classifier or model may struggle to capture the entire range of visual cues and features needed to identify a specific histologic structure. Due to the variation of the patients' tracheas, we will use an already established CNN architecture which has already shown high performance in segmentation tasks, that of U-Net (Fig.  2 ).\n\nThe U-Net architecture, first introduced by Ronneberger et al. in 2015  [7] , has gained popularity for its ability to produce high-quality segmentation results with     [7] . The introduced architecture was first applied in 2D images. In our study, a 3D implementation will be used. relatively few training images. Its design facilitates the capture of both local and global features, making it highly effective for precise segmentation tasks. The contracting path is the first half of the U-Net, resembling a traditional CNN. It consists of repeated application of two 3 \u00c2 3 convolutions (unpadded) followed by a rectified linear unit (ReLU) and a 2 \u00c2 2 max pooling operation with stride 2 for downsampling. At each downsampling step, the number of feature channels is doubled. The purpose of the contracting path is to capture context by progressively reducing the spatial dimensions of the input image while increasing the number of feature maps.\n\nLocated at the bottom of the U shape, the bottleneck consists of two 3 \u00c2 3 convolutions followed by ReLU activation. It serves as a bridge between the contracting and expanding paths, capturing high-level abstract features.\n\nThe expanding path is the second half of the U-Net. It consists of an upsampling of the feature map followed by a 2 \u00c2 2 convolution (\"up-convolution\") that halves the number of feature channels. A concatenation with the correspondingly cropped feature map from the contracting path is followed by two 3 \u00c2 3 convolutions and ReLU. This step is repeated multiple times, progressively increasing the spatial dimensions and decreasing the number of feature channels. The purpose of the expanding path is to enable precise localization by combining the high-level abstract features from the bottleneck with the detailed information from the contracting path.\n\nAt the end of the expanding path, a 1 \u00c2 1 convolution is used to map each feature vector to the desired number of classes, usually one for each class in the segmentation task. This results in a segmented output image with the same spatial dimensions as the input image.\n\nThe automated segmentation of the 3D-CT using 3D U-Net  [8]  will enable the automated measurement of the abscess and the distance from the abscess to the inlet of the trachea. Since the CNN performance is highly connected to the quality and characteristics of the data, tuning the hyperparameters and use several variations of the architecture is a necessary process. The U-Net architecture will act as a starting point, but we aim to create a data-oriented architecture for the specific project."

      "text": "DL models are increasingly used for predictive analytics based on prior observations. Various DL algorithms can analyze large datasets, transforming complex and heterogeneous data into actionable clinical insights. Applications of DL in medicine include cancer diagnosis, prognostic predictions, integration of clinical and genomic data, clinical trial design, and the analysis of readmission and mortality data. In the context of infectious diseases, DL aids in diagnosis, severity prediction, and determination of the most appropriate antimicrobial treatments  [11] [12] [13] . Nowadays, high diagnostic performance DL models are becoming increasingly available for clinical practice regarding lesion detection and prediction. Moreover, DL models have been widely used in medical imaging, as their accuracy is human levelled. Additionally, ML and DL algorithms have revealed patterns in clinical data and improved the decision-making in pharmaceutical data. However, in the case of tracheostomy, the only study using ML techniques to date (i.e., the state-of-the-art) focuses merely on the decision whether to perform tracheostomy or not (based on preliminary data), without specifying about other related factors (e.g., size or type of tracheostomy, etc.)  [14] [15] [16] . In our study, a DL model will be developed to predict the optional parameters of tracheostomy of patients based on clinical and CT data, demonstrating potential clinical utility  [17] .\n\nThe k-NN algorithm, one of the oldest and simplest ML algorithms, is renowned for its accuracy in data mining and pattern classification. It assumes that instances in a dataset will be close to other instances with similar characteristics, basing classification on the similarity with nearest neighbors. The algorithm prioritizes relative distances between instances over their absolute positions, making it suitable for large, multidimensional datasets, especially when prior knowledge of data distribution is absent. Additionally, k-NN requires no off-line training, enhancing time efficiency. It is widely used in fields such as transportation, information security, and medicine  [18] . Significant factors will be identified and used for classification. For our DL model, factors will be chosen for their ease of implementation and interpretability, helping clinicians decide the parameters of tracheostomy.\n\nAs CNNs and k-means clustering are different methods used for different data structures, more than one performance criteria are needed  [19] . The most wellestablished and commonly used estimator for the results of CNN algorithms are the Dice coefficient and F1 scores. Additionally, to evaluate the k-means performance, Adjusted Rand Index (ARI) will be used. After the accuracy and performance of the used algorithms reaches its top value, the results of both will be combined to predict the factors of the tracheostomy procedure. The developed algorithms will be refined\n\n244 E. Toulkeridou et al.\n\nthroughout the project duration as more data, as well as clinical feedback from the pilot studies, become available  [20] ."

The EyeTech VT3 mini is a compact and lightweight eye tracker suitable for real-world applications due to its wide field of view and robustness to varying light conditions. The Gazepoint GP3 is an affordable and user-friendly eye tracker with decent accuracy and open-source software, making it a popular choice for researchers and developers.\n\nUltimately, the selection of the optimal eye-tracking sensor for the APURE project will depend on a careful evaluation of these characteristics in light of the project's specific requirements and constraints.

As reported in Table  2 , the eye tracker system should have an accuracy of at most 0.8 \u2022 to ensure precise tracking and measurement and it should operate at a sampling rate of at least 50 Hz to capture rapid eye movements and provide smooth pupil data streams. Moreover, an accessible software API is necessary for seamless integration with various software platforms and to enable interfacing with customized software modules. Another requirement is the real-time wireless operation, essential for preserving rate monitoring. The IMU-based unit attached to the shoe was used as a reference for the Bangle.js 2's step counting algorithm, while the Polar H10 chest-worn strap is equipped with an ECG sensor applied on the torso  [23]  and was used as a reference for the pulse rate monitored by the smartwatch. The IMU-based unit, in this protocol, sampled data at 100 Hz, used only the accelerometer with a sensitivity of \u00b1 4 g, and simultaneously saved backup data on the SD card.\n\nThe complete protocol consisted of the following activities:\n\n-"

(  3 ).\n\nThen a global is filtered using a 3 Hz low pass FIR filter to eliminate high-frequency noise and vibration not related to walking. After the FIR filter of order 300 is applied, a minimum distance between the peaks is selected to avoid overestimation of the number of peaks. The minimum distance between the peaks set by the algorithm changes depending on the walking speed, based on the work of Park et al.  [24] .\n\nThe acceleration threshold used to detect a step is then determined by adding two times the standard deviation of all collected global acceleration values to the mean global acceleration value after being filtered. Every time a peak is detected above this threshold, the algorithm detects a step. It must be noted that, in this case, only one IMU-based unit is used, therefore only one foot is monitored and to estimate the number of steps the obtained count must be multiplied by two."

Data loss is evaluated in terms of transmitted packets, but the lost samples could be retrieved from the SD card, thus making data loss virtually null during the research project. From the results in Table  1 , it emerges that one participant had a systematically higher transmission data loss than the others, probably due to problems with the smartphone's ANT antenna. The results confirm that the SD card is a key feature of the system, which is overall reliable for flexible acquisitions both indoors and outdoors."

Physical function was assessed in the laboratory, and the Menopause Rating Scale was used as a measure of QoL. Physical activity was quantified over 3-months using a wrist-worn PA monitor and average daily step counts were used to classify participants as; low active (n = 3), somewhat active (n = 4), or active (n = 3). The total MRS score (mean \u00b1 SD) was 22.5 \u00b1 6. A strong negative correlation (r s = -0.8, p = 0.01) was found between 6MWT distance and MRS scores and a moderate negative correlation was found between step count and MRS scores (r s = -0.56, p = 0.09). However, overall, in the cohort studied PA levels were moderate. Midlife women tend to report low motivation for PA and experience barriers to PA engagement. Future work will seek to develop a digital health intervention for middle-aged, menopausal women to increase their PA and reduce their sedentary behavior."

Lindsay 5 , Deborah J. Wake 6 , and Rebecca M. Reynolds Abstract. Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), is diabetes at the that is first recognised during pregnancy. It has increasing clinical issue affecting up to 10% of women in pregnancy. We have designed a user-centred prototype mHealth app for GDM care (MyGDM) using includes a clinical dashboard linked with a patient-facing app, that allows automatic transfer of blood glucose data, visualisations, education, culturally inclusive meals ideas and languages, and ability to request a call. We have designed and evaluated MyGDM through: ethnographic observations and 11 semi-structured interviews (6 healthcare professionals and 5 women with GDM) followed by an iterative design through three focus groups with 31 participants (17 healthcare professionals and 14 researchers); 13 questionnaires with women with GDM. From the focus groups, participants were pleased with the user-experience and could see how it would be beneficial in their clinics. During the questionnaires, 100% of women with GDM said that the MyGDM app would fit into their lifestyle and would have helped them manage their GDM. Additionally, 61.54% (8/13) and 69.23% (9/13) of women with GDM responded with likely or very likely to have used the educational resources and the 'request a call' function respectively. In summary, end-users were positive toward the MyGDM prototype mHealth tool, and future work includes piloting in a clinical setting."
