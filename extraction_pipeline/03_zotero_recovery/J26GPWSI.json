No conceptual model exists for examining the roles that social media can play with respect to population health.\n\nWe present a novel framework to guide the investigation and assessment of the effects of social media on public health: the SPHERE (Social media and Public Health Epidemic and REsponse) continuum. This model illustrates the functions of social media across the epidemic-response continuum, ranging across contagion, vector, surveillance, inoculant, disease control, and treatment.\n\nWe also describe attributes of the communications, diseases and pathogens, and hosts that influence whether certain functions dominate over others. Finally, we describe a comprehensive set of outcomes relevant to the evaluation of the effects of social media on the public's health. (Am J Public Health. 2020;110: 1393-1396. doi:10.2105/AJPH.2020. 305746) Dean Schillinger, MD, Deepti Chittamuru, PhD, and A. Susana Ram\u00edrez, PhD O ver the past 25 years, the field of health communication has established itself as central to clinical medicine and public health. In clinical contexts, how patients and clinicians communicate determines a range of health outcomes. In public health contexts, mass communications-whether generated by the private or public sectorinfluence population health by shaping discourse about exposure risk and disease, influencing the adoption (or nonadoption) of health-promoting social policies, linking people to health services, and providing education and motivation that influence behaviors. These conclusions emerged in an era when communications were predominantly controlled by individuals and entities endowed with the power, money, public trust, or platforms required to drive the conversation.\n\nIn the modern era, however, health communications have become more democratized through social media's interactive functionality and popularity. Social media are means of interactions among people in which individuals create, share, or exchange information and ideas in virtual (online or cloud-based) communities and networks. Three quarters of US adults use social media; of these, three quarters engage at least once daily  1  and nearly 50% report that information found via social media affects the way they deal with their health. In China, more than 740 million individuals (> 50% of the population) have social media accounts with which they daily engage,  2  and more than 70% of WeChat's (a Chinese messaging, social media, and mobile payment app) 570 million users report it to be their primary source of health education.  3 espite the ubiquity of health-related content on social media, no consensus has emerged on whether this medium, on balance, jeopardizes or promotes health. During the COVID-19 pandemic, social media has been described by some as the source of a toxic \"infodemic\" and considered by others as an emerging tool for public health.  4 here is little question that social media has the potential to facilitate or undermine public health efforts.  5, 6 Yet no widely accepted conceptual model exists for examining the roles that social media can play with respect to population health.  7, 8"

      "title": "HOW SOCIAL MEDIA CAN INFLUENCE PUBLIC HEALTH",
      "text": "To describe the functions that social media can play, we employ the metaphor of an epidemic. This metaphor is both understandable and fitting: communication is the process of passing information and understanding from one person to another, just as communicable diseases can be passed from person to person. It is no coincidence, then, that social media messages that achieve widespread exposure are often described as \"having gone viral.\" Accordingly, we developed a novel framework to guide the investigation and assessment of social media and public health: the SPHERE (Social media and Public Health Epidemic and REsponse; Figure  1 ) continuum. This model illustrates potentialand often conflicting-functions of social media across the epidemic-response continuum (Figure  1 , middle concentric ring), recognizing that communication itself can contribute to health or disease. We also describe factors that influence which roles social media play based on the contextual attributes in a given circumstance (Figure  1 , outer ring) and outcomes relevant to the evaluation of the effects of social media on the health of the public (Figure  1 , inner ring)."

Similarly, social media communications can apply pressure and motivate resource allocation in support of outbreak preparedness and a robust public health response. Finally, social media can be an engine for grassroots movements to develop a common cause and narrative to advocate and implement policies that combat public health problems, such as type 2 diabetes and gun violence. These movements often employ countermessaging to hold accountable industries, such as junk food, beverage, and gun manufacturers, that contribute to modern epidemics.  17"

Spikes in related communications occur in the midst of a pandemic, such as COVID-19, or right after a catastrophic public or media event, such as a mass shooting or an unexpected celebrity death. Social media communications regarding common, noncommunicable diseases, such as diabetes or cancer, most often increase in the context of (1) regulatory efforts, such as sugary drink taxes or antivaping initiatives; (2) the emergence of controversial clinical or public health guidelines; or (3) compelling scientific publications, such as a controversial study-whose authors had financial conflicts with the food industry-that supported the consumption of red meat and a study demonstrating how beverage industry-related financial conflicts of interest unduly influence research examining the effects of sugary drinks on obesity and diabetes.  22"

The balance between trust in science versus denial of science is a function, in part, of the perceived trustworthiness of official sources and channels.  24 Characteristics and behaviors of social networks that receive and disseminate health communications to a community of listeners and amplifiers can also influence a subpopulation's likelihood of responding to one or more of the functions on the SPHERE continuum, affecting whether social media work to undermine or support health-promoting information, beliefs, attitudes, behaviors, and population health. Social media networks and online communities often serve as echo chambers that foster the replication and amplification of health content that reflects the community's beliefs and values, regardless of whether the communications are inaccurate versus accurate, or unofficial versus official, representations.\n\nUnder certain conditions, however, social media can serve as a platform that gradually reveals the wisdom of the crowdenabling the sharing of disparate opinions and the development of a consensus that is more accurate, including decisions on productive, communal action. Specifically, in decentralized communication networks, group estimates become reliably more accurate as a result of information exchange, depending on network structure.  25 Governments, regulatory agencies, and social media platforms themselves can institute digital policies and practices that determine allowable content and the extent of dissemination, including preferential message promotion, filtering and blocking messages, and censoring nonofficial communications."

First, effects should include proximal communication outcomes, including surveillance and monitoring, uptake of accurate (and inaccurate) information, and public awareness. Intermediate outcomes should involve domains such as outbreak preparedness, implementation of health-promoting policies, mobilization of resources to combat disease, the adoption of healthpromoting behaviors, and social well-being. Distal outcomes include disease incidence, transmission rates and morbidity and mortality, and cost-effectiveness. Finally, a number of collateral (nonhealth) consequences of communications disseminated via social media should be considered, including economic consequences, preferential or irrational allocation of public resources, mass anxiety or fear, discrimination and stigma, denial of basic rights, retaliation, and the erosion of public trust.  12"

      "title": "CONCLUSIONS",
      "text": "Communication is the fundamental social process through which we all interact. And communicating about healthdiscussing how to stay strong, healthy, and well; sharing beliefs about how to avoid sickness and death; exchanging opinions about who will live or die; asking why some die and others do not-is a practice that likely began as early as human language emerged. From that perspective, the continuum of functions that social media can play with respect to public health is not surprising. What is novel, however, is how significantly social media has increased the capacity of communication to influence public health. To an unprecedented degree, the popularity and technical sophistication of social media platforms have translated into health discourse becoming more ubiquitous; content becoming more creative, innovative, and engaging; production becoming both more democratized and more market sponsored; communications becoming massively scalable and rapidly spreadable by influencers and autonomous bots  20  ; artificial intelligence enabling high-volume tailoring and targeting of communications; and governments, regulatory agencies, corporate and sponsoring entities, and social media platforms themselves having the capacity to control the content and flow of communications.  24 et scientists' and public health practitioners' abilities to make sense of the myriad ways that social media can influence public health have lagged, lacking a coherent framework for integrating core elements from communication and public health sciences. The SPHERE continuum can be used to guide researchers and practitioners. Given the scope of the digital revolution and its impact on contemporary communication, observational research is needed to deepen our understanding of the complex dynamics inherent in how social media functions across the public health continuum.\n\nIn this regard, the SPHERE continuum can inform and explain the work of health communication research as well as provide a common language and an easily understood framework to encourage collaborations with practitioners in ways that can advance public health. Specifically, the framework can be employed to jointly generate the most salient research questions, select the most relevant outcomes, and apply the most appropriate methods. In addition, the SPHERE continuum provides landmarks and signposts for the design of experimental (simulation) research in carefully controlled settings via randomized controlled trials with selected samples, as well as a blueprint for real-world, real-time, practicebased quasiexperimental research to be conducted with large populations in collaboration with public health practitioners and communication entities. Both types of interventional research can further inform efforts to effectively harness social media for health promotion while maintaining the unique appeal and value of social media as a platform for constructive discourse in an open society."
