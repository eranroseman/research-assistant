  "abstract": "BACKGROUND: The purpose of this study was to evaluate risk and response-based multi-agent therapy for patients with rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) at first relapse. METHODS: Patients with RMS and measurable disease at first relapse with unfavorable-risk (UR) features were randomized to a 6-week phase 2 window with 1 of 2 treatment schedules of irinotecan with vincristine (VI) (previously reported). Those with at least a partial response to VI continued to receive 44 weeks of multi-agent chemotherapy including the assigned VI regimen. UR patients who did not have measurable disease at study entry, did not have a radiographic response after the VI window, or declined VI window therapy received 31 weeks of multi-agent chemotherapy including tirapazamine (TPZ) at weeks 1, 4, 10, 19, and 28. Favorable-risk (FR) patients received 31 weeks of the same multi-agent chemotherapy without VI and TPZ. RESULTS: One hundred thirty-six eligible patients were enrolled. For 61 patients not responding to VI, the 3-year failure-free survival (FFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were 17% (95% confidence interval [CI], 8%-29%) and 24% (13%-37%), respectively. For 30 UR patients not treated with VI, the 3-year FFS and OS rates were 21% (8%-37%) and 39% (20%-57%), respectively. FR patients had 3-year FFS and OS rates of 79% (47%-93%) and 84% (50%-96%), respectively. There were no unexpected toxicities. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with UR RMS at first relapse or disease progression have a poor prognosis when they are treated with this multi-agent therapy, whereas FR patients have a higher chance of being cured with second-line therapy.",

      "text": "Rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS) is the most common soft-tissue sarcoma of childhood and adolescence.  1 Multimodality therapy with surgery, radiation therapy, and cytotoxic chemotherapy has resulted in approximately 70% of patients achieving long-term survival.  2 However, patients who are refractory to primary therapy and those who relapse after primary therapy have a poor prognosis.  [3] [4] 4] [5]  This is true especially for patients with stage 2 to 4, clinical group II to IV embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma (ERMS); those with stage 1 or clinical group I ERMS who were initially treated with vincristine, dactinomycin, and cyclophosphamide (VAC); and those with alveolar RMS.  3  In aggregate, these unfavorable-risk (UR) patients have a 5-year postrelapse survival rate of approximately 10%. In contrast, a more favorable-risk (FR) group is composed of those with botryoid histology or stage 1 or clinical group I ERMS treated at diagnosis with vincristine and dactinomycin, for whom the survival rate is approximately 50%.  3  The Soft Tissue Sarcoma Committee of the Children's Oncology Group (COG) chose to evaluate the activity of 2 schedules of irinotecan together with vincristine (VI) in a 6-week phase 2 window in those patients with UR and measurable disease at the time of first relapse followed by multi-agent therapy incorporating VI for patients who achieved Cancer August 1, 2019 at least a partial response (PR) at 6 weeks. We have previously reported the rationale, early response rates for the 2 VI schedules, and outcomes for UR patients treated with the VI window.  6 The study enrolled 2 additional categories of patients. The first category included UR patients without measurable disease at study entry, those who declined VI phase 2 window therapy, and those who did not achieve a radiographic response after 6 weeks of VI therapy. These patients received the same multiagent therapy without VI but with the addition of tirapazamine (TPZ), a hypoxic cell toxin. The second category included FR patients who received multi-agent therapy without VI or TPZ. Here, we report toxicities and outcomes for these 2 categories of patients.\n\nTPZ, a benzotriazine di-N-oxide anticancer drug that is activated to a toxic free radical under hypoxic conditions, was the first drug of this class to enter clinical testing.  7 In preclinical models, additive or greater than additive cytotoxicity was noted when TPZ was combined with cytotoxic chemotherapy, presumably by selective killing of hypoxic tumor cells.  8, 9 A phase 1 clinical trial in adults defined the maximum tolerated dose of TPZ as 330 mg/m 2 when administered intravenously once every 3 weeks as a single agent.  10 Reversible deafness and tinnitus were dose-limiting toxicities in this trial. In adult studies, TPZ was safely administered together with cytotoxic chemotherapy,  11  although patients experienced significantly more nausea and vomiting.  12 There were no differences in hematopoietic toxicity when TPZ was investigated in a randomized phase 3 clinical trial with cisplatin in adult patients with non-small cell lung cancer.  11 A pediatric phase 1 trial of the TPZ and cyclophosphamide combination demonstrated a maximum tolerated dose of 325 mg/m 2 for TPZ when it was combined with 1.5 g/m 2 of cyclophosphamide intravenously.  13 The dose-limiting toxicity was reversible ototoxicity. There were 3 responses, including 1 in a patient with RMS.\n\nThe majority of newly diagnosed patients with RMS in North America are treated with VAC chemotherapy. Phase 2 clinical trials with doxorubicin, ifosfamide, and etoposide for RMS  14  formed the basis for the risk-based multi-agent treatment regimens for patients with RMS with first relapse or disease progression investigated in this clinical trial."

Adequate organ function was required; this included a hemoglobin level \u226510 g/dL (transfusion allowed), an absolute neutrophil count \u2265750/mm 3 , a platelet count \u226575,000/mm 3 , a serum creatinine level \u22641.5 times the normal for age or a creatinine clearance/radioisotope glomerular filtration rate \u226570 mL/min/1.73 m 2 , a serum bilirubin level \u22641.5 times the normal for age, a serum alanine transaminase level \u22642.5 times the normal for age, and a left ventricular shortening fraction \u226527% by echocardiogram or an ejection fraction \u226550% by gated radionuclide scan. Any prior central nervous system toxicity had to be less than grade 2, and adequate control of any seizure disorder with anticonvulsants was required. Patients who had received more than 1 prior chemotherapy treatment regimen, those with prior exposure to anthracyclines, ischemic heart disease, myeloablative chemotherapy followed by hematopoietic stem cell rescue, or disease impinging on or within the brain and spinal cord, and those who were pregnant/lactating were excluded.

Consenting patients with UR features (stage 2-4, clinical group II-IV ERMS at the initial diagnosis; stage I or clinical group I ERMS at the initial diagnosis with distant recurrence after vincristine and dactinomycin or recurrence after VAC; and alveolar RMS at the initial diagnosis), with measurable disease (defined as 1 or more lesions with a diameter \u226510 mm) at study entry, and with no prior exposure to irinotecan were randomized to 1 of 2 VI treatment schedules followed by multi-agent chemotherapy that incorporated the assigned VI schedule for responding patients (regimens 1A and 1B; Table  1 ). Patients who did not respond to the VI phase 2 window were switched to multi-agent chemotherapy without VI but with TPZ at week 7 (regimen 2; Table  1 ). Patients with UR features at the time of first relapse or disease progression without measurable disease at study entry, those who had previous exposure to irinotecan, and those who declined randomization to the VI phase 2 window also received multi-agent Cancer August 1, 2019 chemotherapy without VI but with TPZ (regimen 2). TPZ was supplied by the NCI (IND #46525). Patients with FR features (botryoid histology at the initial diagnosis or stage 1 or clinical group I ERMS at the initial diagnosis not treated with cyclophosphamide, and who recurred locally or regionally) at the time of first relapse or disease progression received multi-agent chemotherapy without VI or TPZ starting at week 1 (regimen 3;  Table 1). Disease response was assessed with the NCI's Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors 15 at week 6 for patients on regimens 1 and 2. Patients on regimen 1 who did not respond to the VI phase 2 window at week 6 had a second disease response assessment at week 12 after 2 cycles of TPZ administered together with doxorubicin and cyclophosphamide.\n\nSurgical resection of disease at previously irradiated sites was strongly encouraged if feasible. Radiation therapy was administered (50.4 Gy for macroscopic disease and 41.4 Gy for microscopic disease) at sites of disease that were not previously irradiated at the discretion of the treating physician either during weeks 16 to 22 in regimen 1A and 1B or during weeks 10 to 18 in regimens 2 and 3. Intraoperative radiation therapy or brachytherapy was recommended after surgical resection for patients with disease at sites that were previously irradiated."

      "text": "Analyses comparing the response rates, toxicities, failurefree survival (FFS), and overall survival (OS) of patients treated on regimens 1A and 1B have been previously reported.  6 The primary endpoint for patients on regimen 2 was toxicity. Toxicities were reported with the NCI's Common Terminology Criteria (version 2.0). On the basis of known toxicities of TPZ, there was monitoring for ototoxicity, cardiotoxicity, stomatitis, hematopoietic toxicity, and grade 3 vomiting with stopping rules. A dose-limiting toxicity was defined as a grade 4 infection, a \u226540-db hearing loss at 2000 MHz lasting more than 5 days, grade 3 or higher vomiting, grade 3 or higher cardiac toxicity, or grade 3 or higher 3 stomatitis. An ototoxicity rate of 15%, a grade 3 or higher cardiac toxicity rate of 10%, a grade 3 or higher stomatitis rate of 35%, and an incidence of grade 4 infection or grade 3 vomiting of 25% were set as the acceptable upper bounds for these toxicities, above which enrollment would be suspended and modification of the treatment protocol would be considered. The response rate and the OS were the secondary endpoints for patients treated with regimen 2. A complete response (CR) was defined as the disappearance of all target lesions by cross-sectional computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging, a partial response (PR) was defined as a \u226530% decrease in the dimension used to define the target lesion, progressive disease (PD) was defined as a \u226520% increase in the measurement used to define the target lesion, and stable disease was defined as a decrease or increase in the tumor insufficient to be considered a PR or PD. The estimations of FFS and OS were performed with the Kaplan-Meier method. FFS was defined as the time of enrollment to disease progression or death.  16 Confidence intervals (CIs) for FFS and OS were estimated by the Peto-Peto method.  17 OS was defined as the time from enrollment to death from any cause. The primary endpoint for regimen 3 was FFS."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "There is no defined standard therapy for patients with relapsed or progressive RMS. In general, these patients are treated with intensive multi-agent chemotherapy with or without surgery and/or radiation therapy. Other therapeutic options include enrollment in phase 1 or 2 clinical trials with new agents. Before ARST0121, no clinical trial had prospectively investigated protocol-defined multi-agent chemotherapy exclusively for patients with RMS at first relapse or disease progression. In addition to comparing prolonged and shorter VI schedules in a phase 2 window, ARST0121 investigated risk-based therapy for patients with first-relapse RMS on the basis of previously defined UR or FR features. ARST0121 represents the largest clinical trial conducted for relapsed/refractory RMS. This clinical trial confirms the poor outcomes for patients with firstrelapse RMS and UR features. In addition, it confirms the favorable outcomes among the minority of patients with lower stage/clinical group disease and ERMS or botryoid RMS when they are treated with multi-agent therapy.\n\nThe toxicity in this trial was as expected and was similar to that of other regimens used for the treatment of pediatric solid tumors at diagnosis or after relapse.  [18] [19] 9] [20]  The response rate of 31.5% for VI was modest,  6  particularly in comparison with the 70% response rate seen in an upfront phase 2 window trial of previously untreated patients with metastatic RMS.  21 fter the investigation of the VI phase 2 window in the first-relapse setting for RMS, the combination was investigated with alternating cycles of VAC chemotherapy in newly diagnosed patients with intermediate-risk RMS by COG (ARST0531), but it failed to improve outcomes.  22 The objective response rate in this trial for TPZ, doxorubicin, and cyclophosphamide ranged from 22% to 54%. The lower response rate of 22% in the group of patients who did not respond to VI suggests that those patients had inherently more resistant disease at the time of first relapse in comparison with those treated with regimen 2 immediately at the   Cancer August 1, 2019 not support further investigation of TPZ in RMS and is consistent with the results of 2 phase 3 trials in adults with carcinomas, in which TPZ failed to improve outcomes.  23, 24 Patients treated on regimen 2 at initial relapse cannot be compared with patients treated on regimen 2 after no response to the VI window because the latter group is presumed to be inherently more resistant and thus a different population.\n\nLocal control with radiation therapy and surgery can be challenging in the management of patients with relapsed RMS, particularly if there is local tumor progression at previously irradiated sites. These data were not collected in ARST0121; therefore, its impact on outcomes could not be analyzed.\n\nPatients with botryoid RMS with first relapse and those with either stage 1 or clinical group I ERMS with local/regional recurrence who were not treated with cyclophosphamide at the original diagnosis had favorable outcomes when they were treated with multi-agent therapy. Such patients should, therefore, generally not be considered candidates for investigational therapy in single-agent phase 2 or 1 clinical trials at the time of first relapse. COG's recent low-risk RMS trial ARST0331 showed excellent outcomes with shorter duration (22-week) therapy with a modest cumulative cyclophosphamide dose (4.8 g/m 2 ), and this suggests that all low-risk patients with RMS might receive some cyclophosphamide in the future to allow shorter therapy.  25 It is unknown whether the same excellent outcomes seen with regimen 3 in patients without prior cyclophosphamide exposure will be seen in patients who relapse after modest cyclophosphamide treatment but otherwise have FR features.\n\nImportantly, this clinical trial showed prospectively a median FFS rate of 50% at 6 months in patients with RMS with UR features at first relapse/ progression. This establishes a survival benchmark that can be used in future investigations in patients with RMS with UR features at first relapse or progression. Given our increased understanding of the molecular basis of cancer and the availability of targeted therapy, COG investigated the combination of molecularly targeted therapy and a cytotoxic chemotherapy backbone in a randomized phase 2 clinical trial in the UR group of patients with RMS at the time of first relapse or disease progression. The mammalian target of rapamycin inhibitor temsirolimus improved progression-free survival in comparison with the vascular endothelial growth factor inhibitor bevacizumab (L. Mascarenhas, ASCO 2014).  26 To improve survival for patients with RMS, novel strategies are required either to improve the outcomes for patients with recurrent disease or to decrease the relapse rate in newly diagnosed patients. Optimizing treatment to improve FFS for newly diagnosed patients with RMS is thus of paramount importance because of the poor survival outcomes following relapse and the increased burden of therapy to cure those who survive. Genomic studies may provide further insight to inform further investigations into relapsed RMS, and other strategies such as immune check point blockade and epigenetic modification provide more avenues to explore.  27, 28 This clinical trial prospectively confirms risk features for RMS at the time of first relapse/progression and provides a unique model for clinical investigation in patients with relapsed RMS."
