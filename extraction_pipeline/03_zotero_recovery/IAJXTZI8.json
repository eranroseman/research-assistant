  "title": "The Empowering Role of Mobile Apps in Behavior Change Interventions: The Gray Matters Randomized Controlled Trial",
  "abstract": "Background: Health education and behavior change programs targeting specific risk factors have demonstrated their effectiveness in reducing the development of future diseases. Alzheimer disease (AD) shares many of the same risk factors, most of which can be addressed via behavior change. It is therefore theorized that a behavior change intervention targeting these risk factors would likely result in favorable rates of AD prevention. \n Objective: The objective of this study was to reduce the future risk of developing AD, while in the short term promoting vascular health, through behavior change. \n Methods: The study was an interventional randomized controlled trial consisting of subjects who were randomly assigned into either treatment (n=102) or control group (n=42). Outcome measures included various blood-based biomarkers, anthropometric measures, and behaviors related to AD risk. The treatment group was provided with a bespoke \"Gray Matters\" mobile phone app designed to encourage and facilitate behavior change. The app presented evidence-based educational material relating to AD risk and prevention strategies, facilitated self-reporting of behaviors across 6 behavioral domains, and presented feedback on the user's performance, calculated from reported behaviors against recommended guidelines. Results: This paper explores the rationale for a mobile phone-led intervention and details the app's effect on behavior change and subsequent clinical outcomes. Via the app, the average participant submitted 7.3 (SD 3.2) behavioral logs/day (n=122,719). Analysis of these logs against primary outcome measures revealed that participants who improved their high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels during the study duration answered a statistically significant higher number of questions per day (mean 8.30, SD 2.29) than those with no improvement (mean 6.52, SD 3.612), t 97.74 =-3.051, P=.003. Participants who decreased their body mass index (BMI) performed significantly better in attaining their recommended daily goals (mean 56.21 SD 30.4%) than those who increased their BMI (mean 40.12 SD 29.1%), t 80 = -2.449, P=.017. In total, 69.2% (n=18) of those who achieved a mean performance percentage of 60% or higher, across all domains, reduced their BMI during the study, whereas 60.7% (n=34) who did not, increased their BMI. One-way analysis of variance of systolic blood pressure category changes showed a significant correlation between reported efforts to reduce stress and category change as a whole, P=.035. An exit survey highlighted that respondents (n=83) reported that the app motivated them to perform physical activity (85.4%) and make healthier food choices (87.5%). \n Conclusions: In this study, the ubiquitous nature of the mobile phone excelled as a delivery platform for the intervention, enabling the dissemination of educational intervention material while simultaneously monitoring and encouraging positive",

      "text": "Health education programs have demonstrated their effectiveness in educating individuals with targeted knowledge relating to risk factors of various diseases  [1, 2] . With this knowledge, individuals are subsequently capable of making educated decisions regarding lifestyle choices, which may have a significant effect on their future health outcomes. Most health education programs target the leading causes of mortality  [3] , such as heart disease and stroke  [4] , cancer  [5] , diabetes  [4] , and respiratory diseases  [3, 6] . Nevertheless, only a limited number of studies have been conducted with a focus on health education for Alzheimer disease (AD) risk reduction, despite being the sixth leading cause of total mortality in the United States  [7]  and the first and second leading cause of mortality of females and males older than 80 years, respectively, in the United Kingdom  [8] ."

      "title": "Alzheimer's Disease Risk",
      "text": "Unfortunately, efforts to create a vaccine for AD have proven unsuccessful. Nevertheless, findings from clinical and epidemiological studies have suggested that behavioral, social, and environmental factors may delay or prevent the onset of AD  [9, 10] . At the G8 dementia summit held in December 2013, clinical AD experts called upon the governments of G8 countries to make the prevention of AD a major health aim, while highlighting the suggestion to study the risk factors associated with the disease  [11] . Currently, identified risk factors include dietary factors (food choices; body mass index, BMI; endocrine disorders; and diabetes)  [12] , cardiovascular factors (sedentary lifestyle, hypertension, and high cholesterol)  [13] , and psychosocial factors (education, higher work complexity, social participation, and intellectual activities). Importantly, these factors are modifiable and therefore have the potential to be useful targets for the prevention of cognitive decline and AD through behavioral change programs.\n\nThe health education interventions that individually targeted such factors for other conditions exhibited positive results, suggesting that a similar effort targeting AD would be likely to result in the desirable adoption of healthy behaviors  [14] . Given that many of the risk factors can be interdependent (eg, BMI and sedentary lifestyle), a multifactorial preventative intervention targeting several risk factors simultaneously presents the greatest likelihood of being effective  [9] . A study by Lin et al simulated the potential health and economic effects of addressing AD risk factors. Their simulated scenarios found that as each of the factors were addressed, additional unintended benefits were observed, such as lowering the risk of other chronic diseases (diabetes, heart disease, and stroke), accompanied with a 10% reduction in BMI in those who were overweight  [15] .\n\nIt is therefore hypothesized that a health education program that provides evidence-based information regarding AD risk factors and prevention methods may have the additional benefit of reducing risk for other health conditions, with particular improvement in cardiovascular functions."

      "text": "Although the risk factors for cognitive decline and AD have been identified and are natural targets for a behavior change intervention, there is variation in the literature as to when such interventions should take place. It has become widely accepted that the neuropathological processes involved in AD begin decades before symptoms emerge  [16] ; however, behavior intervention programs relating to AD have focused almost exclusively on an elderly population (65-80 years)  [17] , rather than introducing interventions in midlife  (40-64 years) . Numerous midlife health markers have been linked with higher late-life AD risk, such as obesity  [18] , hypertension  [19] , serum cholesterol levels  [20] , and physical activity during leisure time  [21] , all of which can be addressed simultaneously via a behavior change intervention to prevent the onset of the disease.\n\nIt is therefore further hypothesized that an intervention targeted at those in midlife holds the greatest potential for reducing future risk of developing AD."

      "title": "Delivery of Interventions",
      "text": "The term delivery encompasses both the psychological message of the intervention material and also the mode of distribution. Educational material for the purpose of behavior change can be designed to evoke certain emotional responses. Fear appeals, that is, the use of persuasive messages to stimulate fear based on harmful outcomes that are associated with dangerous lifestyle practices, have been used extensively for more than 60 years  [23, 24] . Perhaps not surprisingly, they have been found to be rather ineffective and can produce a polarizing effect within the intended cohort  [24] . Because most people wish to think of themselves as healthy, such threatening information can lead to a defensive response, motivating intended recipients to avoid exposure to the material in the future  [24] . An example of a public health campaign aiming to use fear appeal can be observed globally in tobacco packaging via the use of clear warning messages and graphic images of smoking-related diseases.\n\nThere are a number of ways in which an individual's behavior change can be theoretically modeled  [25] . These include the widely cited and applied Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB)  [26] , the Health Belief Model (HBM)  [27, 28] , and the Transtheoretical Model (TTM). The most apt models for planning a behavior change intervention, however, are the HBM and the TTM. The TPB is useful in predicting certain behaviors, and for retrospective analysis, but is not considered useful or effective in relation to designing and planning an intervention that should result in behavior change  [29] . The aforementioned example utilizing fear appeals, including cues to action and perceived threats, belongs to the HBM. The TTM, however, is a stage theory that is often used as a guiding framework for many health-related interventions. This model posits that an individual's willingness to make behavioral changes is driven by his or her readiness to change. Stages of readiness are described as precontemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance, with relapse to prior unhealthy behaviors possible between the action and maintenance stages (Figure  1 )  [30] .\n\nThis type of approach aims to empower an individual via education and introspection to create a positive feedback loop as behaviors are changed over time  [31] . For AD prevention, this TTM approach would be performed by educating an individual on specific behaviors, having the individual introspectively assess his or her own behaviors, and setting attainable future goals to target change. On completion of these goals, the individuals are affirmed of their efforts and subsequently reevaluate their goals, thus creating a positive feedback loop.\n\nUsing such an approach in a health care intervention would rely heavily on the ability to personalize the education material and the ability to set attainable goals. To achieve such an intervention in the physical world, using people, buildings, and paper, would require enormous resources and planning. Fortunately, Internet-based technologies can reduce this burden, by digitally delivering intervention material.\n\nMobile and Internet-based technologies have been accepted as suitable and sustainable methods to deliver intervention material in various studies. Mobile phone-based delivery, such as short message service (SMS), has been used extensively and successfully in the literature to support portable and widespread interventions  [32] . Internet-based services, such as email and website portals, have also been used extensively and with good success  [33] . The ability to digitally disseminate material offers many advantages to health care investigators and end users alike: notably, personalization of material, increased scalability, and reduced expenses."

      "title": "Maintaining Engagement",
      "text": "Evidence from Internet-based interventions suggests that repeated visits are necessary to achieve sustainable change  [33] . Nevertheless, visitor engagement with these interventions is typically lower than expected, with many users opting out before becoming fully exposed to all the intervention material, resulting in suboptimal outcomes  [33] . There is therefore the need to encourage and maintain engagement with interventions, while enhancing an individual's motivations to return at a later date.\n\nGamification is the application of game design techniques and mechanics to nongaming domains  [34] . To encourage engagement within a game, game designers utilize mechanics such as points, level systems, avatars, badges, and leaderboards. These reward systems encourage continual progression, with the ultimate aim of maintaining engagement. Recently, there has been a surge of interest in the use of gamification for behavior change studies, given that these reward systems help to promote engagement. Young adults and children are especially attracted to games, with virtually all young children having access to gaming consoles, computers, and mobile phone games  [35] . As such, gamification elements have been used to educate and encourage desirable behaviors in children, such as increasing intake of fruits and vegetables through the use of fictional avatars  [36] , preventative education on substance abuse and risk using mobile phone and tablet apps  [37] , and an obesity prevention intervention via mobile and Web platforms  [38] . The use of gamification in adult behavior change studies, however, is limited.\n\nFor health-conscious adults, commercially available mobile phone apps and activity tracker companies, such as Strava, Fitbit, and Nike, use gamification elements extensively in their efforts to maintain and promote continual engagement. Although each platform has its own approach, they all record health-related data; examples include monitoring physical activity levels, tracking meals, and monitoring sleep quality. From these data, various performance metrics are calculated from which achievements are rewarded, such as badges and trophies. In addition, a user can view, typically at a high level via interactive graphs, their performances across time, allowing them to become informed of their behaviors and their resulting outcomes. Social sharing of recorded data also plays a role in enabling gamification elements, such as leaderboards, allowing users to compare their efforts with those of others. Apple and Google, whose mobile phone platforms combined account for 96.3% of the worldwide market share  [39] , are now shipped with iOS HealthKit and Google Fit services preinstalled. The aforementioned services are proprietary to their platforms; however, they act to consolidate the available data of various health-related apps and activity trackers into one common interface. The inclusion of such services into the base functionality of the most extensively adopted mobile phone platforms in the world shows the market's anticipation of widespread adoption of health-related apps.\n\nIt is therefore hypothesized that the combination of constantly accessible, highly interactive, and individually tailored feedback, combined with gamification elements, such as rewards and leaderboards, would have the largest opportunity to maintain and encourage engagement with adults in a behavior change study  [40] , given the advantages that each element brings."

      "title": "Reporting Behaviors",
      "text": "To accurately assess the effect of a behavior change intervention, the validity of the reported behaviors must be accurate. There are numerous methods by which behaviors can be recorded within an intervention, including diaries, questionnaires, direct observation, and by proxy reports  [41] .\n\nDiaries present a low-cost, easily maintained, and time-efficient method of recording behaviors; however, they are open to cognitive bias due to subjective self-assessment and rely heavily on the person's ability to accurately recall past events  [42] .\n\nDirect observation offers health investigators an accurate portrayal of behaviors within the given window of observation  [43] . They are believed to offer more truthful recordings and can be used as a method to increase precision and accuracy for the purposes of validating self-reported behaviors. With regard to monitoring physical behaviors, total energy expenditure can be calculated using calorimetry (ie, doubly labeled water), heart rate monitors, and motion sensors  [43] . Although such approaches offer exceptional accuracy, they are intrusive, expensive, and time intensive. It is also the case that the Hawthorne effect, commonly referred to as the observer effect, may change how an individual behaves under direct observation, and observations made may not be a true reflection of their behaviors outside of the observation window  [44] .\n\nSelf-reported questionnaires are commonly used in large-scale longitudinal studies because of their uniformity in questioning, repeatability, and ability to extract qualitative and quantitative information  [45] . Quantitative oriented questionnaires, seeking to gather quantifiable information about past events, such as the \"number of glasses of water consumed today,\" can be at risk of cognitive bias and recall inaccuracy. Nevertheless, a comparative study seeking to validate previous day recall accuracy for active and sedentary behaviors when compared with direct observation found agreement of 85% or higher in certain conditions and suggests adults can accurately report their behaviors using previous day recall  [46] . Proxy reporting is typically used when the subject in examination is somehow dependent on another adult, such as young children and the elderly. A study assessing the level of agreement between 6425 children and their parents regarding dietary, physical, and sedentary behaviors reported a mean agreement rate of 43%  [47] . Similarly, studies assessing memory recall for the same events in children, young adults, and the elderly showed that the reports of the elderly were as complete as the children's but were the least accurate overall  [48] . This highlights both the potential inaccuracies of self-reporting within certain cohorts and the need for ground-truth data due to the rate of disagreement found in reporting utilizing a proxy.\n\nAlthough a variety of approaches can be employed to record behaviors, each has its own distinctive weaknesses relating to accuracy, repeatability, scalability, and cost  [43] . There is a need for an objective mediator to draw agreement across the various approaches. Pervasive computing may provide such a solution.\n\nThe widespread public adoption of mobile phones, smartwatches, and wearable technology has enabled computing to become truly pervasive. Wireless digital devices can enable the digitization of individuals' behaviors, often without the need for interaction. Wearable wrist-worn devices can be used to calculate an individual's energy expenditure and step count  [49] , current activity  [50] , sleep quality  [51] , and heart rate  [52] . Mobile phones, via the use of onboard accelerometers and the Global Positioning System, can also track physical activity levels  [53]  and sleep efforts  [54] , while various apps encourage self-reporting of food consumption  [53] , enabling immediate calculation of calorie consumption. In addition, social media websites contain a plethora of social interactions that can be analyzed for behavioral trends  [55] . There is an abundance of potential use cases for such technology in the self-management of one's health, yet the adoption of this technology for the purpose of public health education or behavioral change interventions is extremely limited. Eric Topol, a physician who has been heavily involved with wireless medicine since its inception, states in his book: \"Our health care approach is reactive, and, as a result, we have a world of chronic diseases, most of which are poorly managed, such as congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, and diabetes, or not managed at all, as in the case of Alzheimer's.\" He continues, \"Now comes a new wave of technology to not only improve the outlook for the chronic diseases of today but shift the capability, for the first time, to true prevention\"  [56] .\n\nTo leverage this opportunity, the Gray Matters study has designed a clinically focused, technology-driven intervention program. An interdisciplinary team of computer scientists, biomedical engineers, mathematicians, psychologists, gerontologists, epidemiologists, and statisticians designed the Gray Matters mobile phone app: an app intended to deliver health education material, promote and monitor behavior change, and encourage the motivations of the participants via gamification elements  [57] ."

A uniform random number generator (0,1) within SPSS v21 was used to randomize participants to treatment and control groups, with the aim of allocating 1/3 to control and 2/3 to treatment. The rationale for a 2:1 ratio for treatment and control was in consideration of the full autonomy given to each participant in the study. On recruitment, each participant was asked which behavioral domain or domains were of greatest interest to him or her to improve upon. In order to have a reasonably good power to study both the change in individual behavioral domains and its effects on those who wished to improve on particular domains, the ratio was adjusted to accommodate this. The intervention was delivered over a 6-month period, commencing in April 2014, with posttest collection performed at the close of the trial."

      "text": "To enable the dissemination of evidence-based educational material relating to AD risk and prevention strategies, more than 130 peer-reviewed journals and papers relating to AD risk were analyzed. From the analysis, it was identified that risk factors and their prevention methods could be categorized into 6 domains: food, physical, cognitive, social, sleep, and stress. For these 6 domains, fact and suggestion pairs were produced (hereafter referred to as daily facts). An example daily fact from the food domain is as follows: \"Consuming high amounts of processed foods is related to cognitive decline\"; \"Try a fresh salad for dinner instead of something from a box\". In total 164 succinct daily facts were produced across the 6 domains: physical  (23) , food  (66) , social  (27) , sleep  (14) , cognitive  (24) , and stress  (10) .\n\nIn addition to the daily facts, questions were designed for each domain to capture behaviors relevant to AD risk. All questions were quantitative in nature; however, they contained a mixture of subjective and objective questions. For example, a user may be asked to report the number of fruits and vegetables they consumed in a day (objective) and also rate their quality of sleep on a scale of 0-10 (subjective). In addition to the questions for the original 6 behavioral domains, a question was added to collect the activity data observed via a wearable device. In total 12 questions were designed for the domains: physical (2), food (3), social (1), sleep (1), cognitive (2), stress (2), and wearable activity monitor  (1) . For each question, a recommended value was extracted from external sources, such as the World Health Organization, the American Heart Association, the National Institutes of Health, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) recommended daily targets (see Table  1 ). The recommended value served two purposes: to act as an observable goal for the participant and as a means by which a participant's performance could be calculated, relative to other participants."

Initially the app was developed for iOS 7.x devices, including iPhone and iPad, as the analysis showed a favoring for these devices in the area. As technology screening during the recruitment phase progressed, additional demand appeared for an Android version, which was subsequently developed. The functionality and visual layout of both versions are virtually indistinguishable, yet allowing enough flexibility to adhere to each platform's user interface design guidelines  [59, 60] .\n\nAs the primary method to deliver health education material and track behavior change in the study, the app was designed to fulfill the following core functions:\n\n1. Presentation of educational material relating to AD risk and prevention strategies.\n\n2. Facilitation and recording of behavior self-reporting."

As seen in Table  1 , a total of 12 questions were designed to collect all relevant behavioral data for the study. During the requirements elicitation, it was specified that data entry for all questions should take no more than 2 minutes to complete, to reduce time burden for the study participants. As such, a time-efficient approach was developed. The questions are presented in a list, ordered by their domain (refer to Figure  3 ). Data entry is achieved by moving a fixed-width slider across the screen until the desired value is presented. As the questions were designed to be quantitative, the use of a slider allows data from the questions to be represented in a scale, using increments of 1. In most instances, for objective data types, the upper limit of the slider is twice the recommended value, facilitating those who wish to overachieve. The use of a recommended value is an observable target for the user, which when achieved acts to reward and reinforce the desired behaviors, as outlined in the action stage of the TTM  [30] .\n\nIn order to reduce subjectivity in the questions, a user who is unsure about the exact meaning of the question may tap on it to present an expanded and elaborated phrasing of the question, including examples. For example, the question \"How many minutes of moderate physical activity did you do today?\" may be considered subjective if the term \"moderate\" is not understood. To counter this, tapping on the question presents the description \"The CDC recommends 2 hours 30 minutes of 'moderate' activity per week. Examples of moderate activity are walking, skiing, raking leaves, washing the car.\" By answering each question, the users can longitudinally track their behaviors across all 6 domains, including their wearable device metrics. Answering all 12 questions is not compulsory; however, it is advantageous for both the participants and the study investigators as it increases the granularity of the data for each user and the study cohort as a whole. Answers are uploaded to a remote server via http protocols, using the open-standard JSON format to package the data."

      "text": "The performance tab is designed to present various summaries of the data collected from the log tab, while encouraging continual participation via rewards. The main mode of presentation is via star ratings (refer to Figure  4 ). These stars can be considered a variant of points-earning system, a system commonly used to encourage continual progression within behavior change programs  [61, 62] . Utilizing the concepts explored in gamification, a user can achieve a maximum of 5 stars for each behavioral domain each day. This is achieved by reaching the recommended value, for each question, in each topic. As such, all recorded values in the logs must be normalized to within a range of 0-5 in relation to the recommended value. To perform this necessary step, the authors developed the equation presented in Figure  5 .\n\nIn the equation, x is the user's answer value to a particular question, Q G is the goal value for the question, Q L is the lowest possible value for that question, R U is the upper boundary of the normalized result, and R L is the lowest boundary.\n\nThe stars are designed to encourage and reinforce a participant's effort to change his or her behavior. Because all domains can be viewed on screen at the same time, it provides a fast method to deliver visual feedback on the domains that require more effort and those that are under control. Users may also tap on each domain to receive additional pertinent information and an additional graphical representation of their efforts. The users may also view their performance aggregated across the previous 7 days in the form of a spider diagram or a bar chart. Again, this serves to visually assist the participants in understanding their behaviors for the purpose of self-affirmation."

This was performed through a launch event, in which attending participants were instructed how to sign up and download the app through the TestFlight platform. TestFlight is a platform by which developers can distribute apps to internal or external testers. This platform allowed the investigators to control visibility in the app marketplace, ensuring that only enrolled participants could see and install the app. By the end of week 1, a total of 31.7% (33/104) participants had installed the app on their iPhone and/or iPad. In week 3 (May 13, 2014), the first Android version of the app was released to the treatment group because of demand from Android users. Two weeks after this release, 19.2% (20/104) participants had installed the first version of the Android app. By week 10, a total of 86.5% (90/104) of participants from the treatment group had installed an iOS or Android version of the app on their mobile phone and/or tablet, with the remainder shortly afterward. Many users opted to install the Gray Matters app on both their mobile phone and tablet. Of the 104 users using the app, at the end of the study, 75.97% of all Gray Matters app sessions were on iOS devices (iPhone: 54.7%; iPad: 21.27%) and the remainder on Android devices (24.03%). Regarding self-reporting of behaviors, the average user answered 7.3 (standard deviation, SD 3.16) questions per day during their participation in the study. The average duration of each session with the app, across all devices, was 1 minute 55 seconds. This time is less than the originally specified goal of 2 minutes for a user's session duration. For further information on app usage statistics during the initial 10 weeks of the study please refer to the study by Hartin et al  [57] . Additional analytical tracking code was added to the app in week 18 to analyze the specific behaviors when answering questions in the log screen. The tracking code recorded the number of times the users altered their behavioral values (Figure  6 ). Across all users in the study, question 12 was altered a statistically significant amount more than the rest (z=3.054, P=.0023). Question 12 belongs to the wearable domain and relates to the number of NikeFuel points earned. It is assumed that users frequently updated this amount, more than the others, because of the variability in the data generated from the wearable device each day when they were active.\n\nThe app was distributed with two default notification times. The first notification was issued in the morning at 8 am by default, which reminded the users to check their daily fact every day. The second notification was issued at 6 pm by default, which reminded the user to complete the questions in the app's log tab. Analysis of app usage times (Figure  7 ) shows that the users do have a period in the morning around 7-9 am that they use the app. In the evening, however, app usage rapidly increases around 8 pm and declines sharply after 11 pm. It is believed that the users wait until the end of the day before entering their log data, so that it is the most valid representation of their day. This behavior may also be encouraged by the fact that users cannot alter their previous day's log once the day has passed."

These groups were then evaluated with various clinical and biometric measurements taken from the participants at the start and end of the study, along with the control group.\n\nFrom a high level, it is evident that increased app exposure had an observable effect on various clinical measurements, in particular for BMI (Figure  8 ) and systolic blood pressure (SBP; Figure  9 ).\n\nIt can be seen that the control group had undesirable increases over the intervention period, whereas the treatment group had sustained or reduced the measurements. Notably, those who looked at the app more than 7 times per week appear to have the largest reduction in BMI and blood pressure, whereas those who looked less than 7 times and more than 1 vary in their results. It is also interesting to note that those who looked at the app once or less per week also maintained favorable rates of decline. It is proposed that these users are self-sufficient in their efforts to effect behavior change and do not require the app to aid them. To further investigate the app's apparent effect, we analyzed various functions of the app in relation to clinical outcomes."

In addition, analysis of exit survey shows that the app facilitated stages 3-5 of the TTM, preparing participants for change, allowing them to accurately monitor and assess their actions, and encouraging continued maintenance and improvement of their desired behaviors. Results from the exit survey showed that most users wished to continue their behavior change efforts, which if maintained, are expected to yield superior outcomes in AD prevention.\n\nIn this trial, the recommended values for each behavior played a key role in the uniform assessment of participants' performance. Analysis of pre-post measurements from the treatment group showed clear physiological changes in those who achieved the highest in their attempts to meet recommended values. This was especially apparent in those who were previously underachievers in certain behavioral domains, before the study (based on the first week of observed behavior logs). Effects observed included a desirable lowering of BMI, improvements in HDL and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, improvements in SBP, lowering of resting heart rate, and improvements in perceived stress levels.\n\nRegarding user experience, most app users stated that they wished to alter their recommended values to be based on their \"current\" health status, whereas others wished to manually set their own target goals. Such a feature could improve engagement with the app, at the detriment of a true representation of progress. A compromise would be to present the user with their efforts against both personal and global targets (Figure  12 ).\n\nHalf of the users wished that their educational material was focused on a specific domain of interest, rather than evenly spread throughout all behavioral domains. Such a focus may be beneficial if the user requires extensive change in one particular domain, but for the purpose of a multidomain intervention the investigators decided it was of great importance to educate across all domains."

These false positives removed the opportunity to use the data to validate reported physical activity with the FuelBand's NikeFuel metric. In agreement with the participants' comments, a recent study assessing the validity of commercially available activity monitors found the FuelBand to be one of the weakest performers overall, undercounting daily step count, on average, by 2529 steps  [68] . There are now numerous commercially available alternatives that allow for greater granularity in their data, such as step counts, distance travelled, sleep quality, and resting heart rate. Many of these wearables allow for direct integration with apps via simple application program interface calls. Because of this feature, self-reported sleep and physical activity may be correlated against the data collected directly from the wearable device to examine validity. The future iteration plans to seek alternatives.\n\nAs discussed earlier, the users also had the burden of repeatedly entering their NikeFuel points via the log screen.

      "text": "A number of suggestions were provided by users of the app informally via email during the duration of the study. A familiar complaint included improving the distribution method of the app. The TestFlight platform, although useful for maintaining control of distribution, was developed for tech-savvy users, not for clinical interventions. As such, many users had problems registering with the platform and subsequently approving certificates and downloading the app. In the next iteration, all distribution will take place via the platform's official app repositories, iOS App Store and Google Play Store."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "The prevailing theme of this paper has been to express the benefit of using a mobile phone app as a core component of a behavior change intervention-to yield the advantages offered by the pervasive nature of the mobile phone within an individual's daily life and routines. In this study, the mobile phone offered the opportunity for clinical effect to occur through behavior change. The app excelled as a delivery platform for the intervention, enabling the dissemination of educational intervention material, while simultaneously monitoring and encouraging positive behavior change. Although the effect of behavior change in midlife, observed during the 6-month RCT, on future AD risk is still relatively unclear, it is evident that participants in the treatment group had favorable improvements across numerous physiological domains, suggesting that a sustained effort would yield superior outcomes in the future."
