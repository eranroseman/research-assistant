  "title": "The efficacy of smartphone-based mental health interventions for depressive symptoms: a meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials",
  "abstract": "The rapid advances and adoption of smartphone technology presents a novel opportunity for delivering mental health interventions on a population scale. Despite multi-sector investment along with wide-scale advertising and availability to the general population, the evidence supporting the use of smartphone apps in the treatment of depression has not been empirically evaluated. Thus, we conducted the first meta-analysis of smartphone apps for depressive symptoms. An electronic database search in May 2017 identified 18 eligible randomized controlled trials of 22 smartphone apps, with outcome data from 3,414 participants. Depressive symptoms were reduced significantly more from smartphone apps than control conditions (g50.38, 95% CI: 0.24-0.52, p<0.001), with no evidence of publication bias. Smartphone interventions had a moderate positive effect in comparison to inactive controls (g50.56, 95% CI: 0.38-0.74), but only a small effect in comparison to active control conditions (g50.22, 95% CI: 0.10-0.33). Effects from smartphone-only interventions were greater than from interventions which incorporated other human/ computerized aspects along the smartphone component, although the difference was not statistically significant. The studies of cognitive training apps had a significantly smaller effect size on depression outcomes (p50.004) than those of apps focusing on mental health. The use of mood monitoring softwares, or interventions based on cognitive behavioral therapy, or apps incorporating aspects of mindfulness training, did not affect significantly study effect sizes. Overall, these results indicate that smartphone devices are a promising self-management tool for depression. Future research should aim to distil which aspects of these technologies produce beneficial effects, and for which populations.",

      "text": "(World Psychiatry 2017;16:287-298)\n\nDepression is now recognized as a leading cause of global disability, impacting over 300 million people around the world  1  . In countries like the US, 9% of the population may have depression at any one time  2  . Beyond the personal suffering, depression is associated with unemployment, poor physical health, impaired social functioning and, in its most severe forms, suicide  3  . Thus, the disorder carries a high cost for both the individual and the society, particularly when considering the economic burden incurred through clinical care and lost productivity  4  .\n\nDepression is a potentially treatable condition, with a range of available medications and psychological interventions that are supported by robust clinical evidence. While the choice of pharmacotherapy or psychotherapy depends on many factors, for most individuals with mild or moderate depression they may be nearly equivalent  5  .\n\nHowever, there are many barriers towards both of these treatment methods. For instance, access to mental health care remains limited, as almost half of the world's population lives in countries where there is less than one psychiatrist per 100,000 people  6  , and continued shortage in mental health care staff is expected for both the near and long term future  7, 8  . Additionally, medications and psychotherapies may carry some level of stigma (particularly among younger people), which further limits their effectiveness  9, 10  .\n\nFurthermore, although these therapies demonstrate high clinical efficacy for reducing symptoms, they may not always bring about full and sustained remission in those treated. Finally, many people experience either subclinical depression or residual depressive symptoms even after achieving clinical response to treatment. Therefore, novel primary and/or adjunctive methods for reducing depression on a population scale are urgently needed.\n\nDigital technologies may represent a novel and viable solution. Mobile phones are among the most rapidly adopted innovations in recent history, and smartphone ownership continues to increase in both developed and developing countries  11  . Through providing ubiquitous Internet connectivity, along with the capacity to download and run externally created applications (\"apps\"), smartphone technology presents an opportunity to transform mobile phones into devices which could provide global, cost-effective and evidence-based mental health services on demand and in real time  12  .\n\nThis clear therapeutic potential has triggered a wave of interest and investment in mental health apps from governments, technology companies, advocacy groups, and research groups internationally  13, 14  . But in the enthusiasm to realize the potential of apps for depression, it has become difficult to separate actual efficacy from overzealous aspirational claims  15  . With thousands of mental health apps readily available through Apple or Google marketplaces, finding a useful tool supported by robust evidence to manage one's depression is clearly a challenge for a lay person  16, 17  . The increasing media promotion and accessibility of apps for mental health now presents a \"duty of care\" issue towards ensuring that people have information and understanding of evidence-based digital treatments for depression.\n\nRecent meta-analyses have documented that various smartphone interventions can have positive effects on physical diseases, such as diabetes  18  , and mental health conditions, such as anxiety  19  . However, the clinical effect of smartphone interventions on symptoms of depression has yet to be established. Thus, our aim was to examine the efficacy of delivering mental health interventions via smartphones for reducing depressive symptoms in both clinical and non-clinical populations. We also sought to use subgroup and meta-regression analyses in order to explore which aspects of smartphone interventions are associated with greater or lesser efficacy for depressive symptoms. The results of these meta-analyses provide the first overall estimate of effects from such interventions, along with informing treatment choices and future research in this area."

Eligible studies were all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) examining the effects of mental health interventions delivered via smartphone devices with at least one outcome measure for depressive symptoms. We aimed to examine the effects of smartphone interventions on primary depression, comorbid depression and subclinical depressive symptoms. No restrictions were placed on diagnosis or any other clinical or demographic characteristics of eligible samples.\n\nThree independent investigators judged article eligibility (JF, JN and JT), with any disagreements resolved through discussion. \"Smartphones\" were defined as mobile phones with 3G or 4G Internet connectivity, along with the ability to download, install and run external applications (\"apps\"). RCTs of interventions delivered solely or in part via smartphone devices matching this definition, aimed at improving mental health or wellbeing (with depression as a primary or secondary outcome), were included in the review.\n\nStudies using either \"inactive\" or \"active\" control groups were eligible for inclusion. \"Inactive\" control groups were classified as those in which participants received no intervention during the trial period (or were put into a waitlist until pre-andpost measures had been collected from both groups). \"Active\" control groups were categorized as those which attempted to control for the time and attention given to people in the smartphone intervention condition, by using apps not aimed at treating depression, in-person interventions, or other forms of activities or patient contact. RCTs comparing smartphone interventions to antidepressant medications were also eligible for inclusion. All eligible studies had a duration of at least one week (thus excluding studies measuring changes in mood following a single use of smartphone apps)."

For studies which used more than one measure of depression, a mean total change was calculated by pooling outcomes from each measure."

      "text": "All analyses were conducted by Comprehensive Meta-Analysis 2.0 22 , using a random-effects model  23  to account for between-study heterogeneity. The total difference in changes in depressive symptoms between smartphone interventions and control conditions were pooled to compute the overall effect size of the former (as Hedges' g), with 95% confidence intervals (CI). For RCTs comparing smartphone interventions to both inactive and active control conditions, the comparative effects with active control groups were used in the primary analysis. After computing main effects, a sensitivity analysis was applied to investigate effects of smartphone interventions in RCTs which used intention-to-treat analyses or had complete outcome data.\n\nTo quantify the degree to which statistical heterogeneity in the meta-analyses arose due to between-study differences, rather than due to chance, Cochran's Q (with p value) and I 2 were used. Included studies were also assessed using the Cochrane Collaboration's Risk of Bias tool. This examined study quality in six areas of trial design (sequence generation, allocation sequence concealment, blinding of participants and personnel, blinding of outcome assessment, incomplete outcome data, selective outcome reporting), ranking each area as high, low or unknown for risk of bias  24  .\n\nRisk of publication bias was examined using a funnel plot of study effect sizes, and Egger's regression test was applied to all aforementioned analyses. Furthermore, a Duval and Tweedie's trim-and-fill analysis was conducted to re-calculate the pooled effect size after removing any studies which may introduce publication bias (i.e., small studies with large effect sizes from the positive side of the funnel plot). Additionally, a \"fail-safe N\" was used to account for the file draw problem  25  , estimating the number of non-significant unpublished trials which would be needed to cause the observed p value to exceed 0.05.\n\nPre-planned subgroup analyses were conducted to examine whether effects of smartphone interventions differed when comparing them to inactive or active control conditions. Additionally, we carried out a range of exploratory post-hoc subgroup and meta-regression analyses in order to examine which factors may impact the effectiveness of smartphone interventions, particularly with regards to sample details (i.e., clinical population, age, gender) and treatment characteristics (i.e., psychological basis, technological features and length of smartphone interventions)."

Two papers reported outcome data in a format not suited for meta-analysis, but the corresponding authors provided the raw data to enable inclusion  26, 30  . Mean sample ages ranged from 18 to 59 years (median 39 years). All but two studies  32, 34  used some indication of mental health issues as inclusion criteria. For clinical populations, two studies World Psychiatry 16:3 -October 2017 recruited people with major depression  36, 43  , two individuals with bipolar disorder  28, 30  , one young people in primary care with any mental health condition  40  . Others recruited individuals from the general population with self-reported mild-to-moderate depression  26, 27, 39, 41  , suicidal thoughts/tendencies  42  , probable attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)  37  , anxiety disorders  29, 33  , insomnia  31  , or symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)  35  . One further study examined older adults with memory complaints  38  . Smartphone interventions lasted between 4 and 24 weeks. Depressive symptoms were measured as a primary outcome in 12 studies, and as a secondary outcome in six. The following tools were used: the Depression Anxiety Stress Scale  44  depression subscale in three studies  29, 39, 40  ; the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression scale  45  in four  31, 32, 38, 41  ; the Beck Depression Inventory II  46  in three  34, 36, 43  ; the Patient Health Questionnaire  47  in six  26, 27, 33, 35, 42, 43  ; the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression 48 in one  30  ; the Hospital Anxiety Depression Scale 49 in one  37  ; and the Montgomery-A \u02dasberg Depression Rating Scale 50 in one  28  .\n\nThe results from the Cochrane Risk of Bias assessments are displayed in Table  2 . This shows that the most frequent risk factor for bias was inadequate blinding of participants, with only five of 18 studies using intervention-matched comparators for which the participants would not be aware of their treatment/ control status or of the hypothesized outcomes of the trial. Although there was heterogeneity across the study data (Q580.8, p<0.01, I foot_3  574.0%), there was no evidence of publication bias (p50.255 in Egger's regression test), and the fail-safe N was 567 (estimating that 567 unpublished \"null\" studies would need to exist for the actual p value to exceed 0.05). A trim-and-fill analysis identified no outlier studies, and thus did not change the observed effect size."

The common features examined, and the results of all subgroup comparisons, are detailed in full in Table  5 .\n\nThese analyses showed that smartphone interventions which involved \"in-person\" (i.e., human) feedback had small, nonsignificant effects on depressive symptoms (g50.137, 95% CI: 20.08 to 0.35, p50.214), whereas those which did not use inperson feedback had moderate positive effects (g50.465, 95% CI: 0.30-0.63, p<0.001). The difference between these subgroups was statistically significant (p50.017).\n\nAdditionally, the effects of smartphone interventions which were delivered entirely via the smartphone device (10 studies, N52,178, g50.479, 95% CI: 0.27-0.69, p<0.001) appeared larger than those which were not self-contained smartphoneonly interventions (8 studies, N51,236, g50.241, 95% CI: 0.09-0.39, p50.002), although the difference between these subgroups fell short of significance (p50.07).\n\nSimilarly, interventions which provided \"in-app feedback\", such as summary statistics and progress scores, had greater effect sizes (g50.534, 95% CI: 0.26-0.81, p<0.001) than those which did not have in-app feedback (g50.266, 95% CI: 0.14-0.39, p<0.001), although again the difference between subgroups was non-significant (p50.082).\n\nThe only other notable finding was that the studies of cognitive training apps had a significantly (p50.004) smaller effect size on depression outcomes (four studies, N5836, g50.123, The use of mood-monitoring softwares, cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)-based interventions and mindfulness training did not appear to influence study effect sizes (all p>0.1 between subgroups with vs. without these features).\n\nA mixed-effects meta-regression of study effect size with intervention length (in weeks) found indication of a slight negative relationship between the two, with smaller effects observed from longer interventions, although this correlation fell short of statistical significance (B5-0.025, SE50.014, Z521.72, p5 0.086)."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis to examine the efficacy of smartphone interventions for depressive symptoms. Our systematic search identified 18 RCTs, examining 22 mental health interventions delivered via smartphone devices, across a total of 3,414 participants. Thus, the literature base for this particular area has evolved swiftly, and is considerably larger than that found for smartphone interventions in other conditions. Around twice the number of eligible interventions and participants were identified compared to recent metaanalyses of smartphone interventions for diabetes and anxiety  18, 19  . Furthermore, 14 of the 18 eligible studies were published within the last two years, which may reflect both the increased research interest in using apps for mental health  13  and the increased ownership, access and use of mental health apps by patients and health care organizations.\n\nThe main analysis found that smartphone interventions had a moderate positive effect on depressive symptoms, with no indication of publication bias affecting these findings. However, our subgroup analyses found that the effects of smartphone interventions were substantially larger when compared to inactive (g50.56) than active (g50.22) control conditions. The same pattern of effect sizes was observed in our metaanalysis of smartphone interventions for anxiety  19  . Previous reviews of other technological interventions for mental health conditions have reported similar findings, as a meta-analysis of virtual reality interventions for treating anxiety found significant effects in comparison to inactive controls, but no difference from traditional psychological treatments  51  . The extent to which the observed effects on depressive symptoms arise from using the device itself, rather than the psychotherapeutic components of the intervention, should be examined and quantified in future research, to further explore the notion of a \"digital placebo\" influencing findings  52  .\n\nWe also explored other factors which may drive the effects of smartphone interventions for depressive symptoms, using a range of post-hoc subgroup analyses. With regards to population type, significant benefits of smartphone apps were only found for those with self-reported mild-to-moderate depression. This may be due to variations in subgroup sample sizes, as the majority of studies were conducted in non-clinical populations, thus leaving the analyses for major depression and bipolar disorder underpowered to detect significant effects. Nonetheless, the nature of smartphone interventions does appear to position them as an ideal self-management tool for those with less severe levels of depression. The observed effects indicate that these interventions are well-placed for delivering lowintensity treatment within a stepped-care approach  53  , or even prevention of mild-to-moderate depression among the millions of people affected by subclinical symptoms  54  . The findings that neither age nor gender had any relationship with study effect size indicate that smartphone interventions may be applicable to a broad range of individuals.\n\nWith regards to intervention features, we found that those delivered entirely via smartphone devices had significantly greater effects than those which also involved other human/computerized aspects. Similarly, those using \"in-person feedback\" components had significantly smaller effects than those which did not. It seems counterintuitive that additional features/human feedback would decrease smartphone effectiveness. However, this relationship is likely due to the fact that apps not relying on external components have been designed as more comprehensive and self-contained tools. Indeed, we found some indication that studies which provided in-app feedback were more effective than those without. It should also be noted that the single study which compared a therapist-guided smartphone intervention to the same intervention without therapist support found equal effects across the two groups  33  .\n\nSmartphone interventions based on CBT significantly reduced depressive symptoms, as did those which incorporated aspects of mindfulness training or mood monitoring. However, we were not able to elucidate which of the features were most effective. A previous study which directly compared smartphone apps based on principles of either behavioral activation or mindfulness also found no overall difference between the two approaches  55  . Nonetheless, results showed that those with more severe depression experienced greater benefits from the behavioral activation app, whereas those with mild depression benefitted more from the mindfulness app. Understanding both which psychological interventions are best delivered via a smartphone and which patient populations will most benefit from smartphone-based interventions will require further research. As smartphone apps for mental health are becoming easier to create, focusing research on specific populations will enable more personalized and likely effective uses.\n\nThe trend-level negative correlation between effectiveness and length of intervention indicates that another factor to consider when designing optimal apps is user engagement  56  . Lower rates of user engagement over time have been found in numerous other mental health app studies  [57] [58] [59]  . Higher rates of engagement have also been associated with those apps designed for brief interactions  60  , suggesting the need to customize interventions to the ways people use smartphones. While there is early research on the optimal design and presentation of telehealth platforms  61, 62  , the impact on patient engagement and outcomes remains an area of nascent exploration. Understanding other factors related to app use, such as socioeconomic status, health literacy  63  , technology literacy and health status  64, 65  , also remain important targets for further research.\n\nA major strength of this meta-analysis is the strict adherence to a registered protocol which exactly described the search strategy, inclusion criteria, data extraction and analytic procedures. However, one drawback is that we only included smartphone interventions which have been evaluated in RCTs. Given the wide availability of mental health apps, ensuring that consumers and clinicians have access to evidence-based interventions is vital for informed decision making. While the sheer number of apps available, and their frequent updating  14, 66  , makes rating each impossible, research elucidating the components of effective apps and highlighting best practices may offer information immediately useful for clinical care. Of note, future studies must identify and report safety concerns regarding the use of smartphone interventions  67  . The ability of smartphones to immediately register entered mood data, compute if responses exceed a certain threshold, and if so activate emergency response systems, offer real time safety monitoring absent from traditional depression treatment.\n\nAnother limitation is the significant heterogeneity found across the analyses. Although this heterogeneity was statistically accounted for by the random-effects models when computing the effect size and respective p values, this still does indicate that significant between-study differences existed, even when subgrouping by sample/intervention type. Due to the extent of differences between studies, it was difficult to establish the single most effective components of smartphone interventions, or determine which populations these interventions are best suited for. Future studies which directly test alternative approaches against each other in non-inferiority controlled trials, while assessing outcome variation between subsamples of participants  55  , would add great value to our understanding of what would constitute the optimal smartphone app for depressive symptoms, and in which populations these methods may be most effective.\n\nIn conclusion, the evidence to date indicates that mental health interventions delivered via smartphone devices can reduce depressive symptoms. However, delivering treatments via a smartphone introduces several new aspects which need to be considered, beyond the platform change alone. Specifically, we have yet to establish the ways in which user engagement, feedback loops, expectancy effects, and individual patient characteristics influence intervention outcomes. Rather than a barrier, these variables represent new opportunities for further research to optimize and personalize smartphonebased interventions.\n\nGiven the early indication of efficacy, and rapidly growing empirical research base, it is possible to envisage that continued technological advances will ultimately lead to scalable and cost-effective digital treatments for depressive symp-toms  56, 68  .
