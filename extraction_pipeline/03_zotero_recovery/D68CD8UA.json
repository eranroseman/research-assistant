  "title": "The use of weekly text messaging over 6 months was a feasible method for monitoring the clinical course of low back pain in patients seeking chiropractic care",
  "abstract": "Objective: This study critically evaluates a new method of collecting frequent data using mobile phones and text messages. Fluctuating conditions such as low back pain (LBP) need frequent monitoring to describe the clinical course in detail and to account for individual and subgroup variations. Study Design and Setting: In this multicentre prospective observational study, 262 subjects with nonspecific LBP were followed with weekly text messages for 6 months, with the question ''How many days this previous week has your low back pain been bothersome?'' The text replies were instantly recorded in a data file to be merged with baseline and follow up data (age, gender, pain intensity, duration, and self-rated health) collected through ordinary questionnaires. The response rate, user-friendliness, and compliance of this method were evaluated. Results: The mean response rate for the text messages throughout the study was 82.5% and was unaffected by season. The method was found to be user friendly. Dropout was not affected by age and gender, but compliance was possibly somewhat affected by outcome.",

      "text": "In prospective studies, data are often collected only at a few instances, that is, at baseline and follow-up. A difference in the outcome measures at these time points is then considered a change in the condition. However, if the course is fluctuating, details of relapses and remissions cannot be captured by measuring only the two occasions. The measures may indicate stability, when in fact the patient has been feeling either worse or better between these two time points. Conversely, a difference could merely reflect a temporary fluctuation in an otherwise stable condition. To accurately describe the individual course in a fluctuating condition, a more dense data collection may be suitable.\n\nLow back pain (LBP) is considered to be a fluctuating condition, recurrent in a large proportion of cases and truly persistent only in some  [1, 2] . Several authors have pointed out the need for exploring the details of the course of LBP [2e4], as little is known about this subject. Frequent data collection would therefore be advantageous to increase our knowledge into the extent and frequency of LBP events. However, questionnaire surveys are not ideal for collecting frequent data as they often yield poor response rates  [5, 6] . To improve response rates, several mailings are often needed, which increase the cost.\n\nLBP is often measured by quantifying pain intensity or the resulting disability. However, recording only pain"

      "title": "What is new?",
      "text": "This study has tested a new method of collecting frequent data with mobile phones and text messages and found it feasible in a clinical setting.\n\nThe method yielded a mean response rate of more than 80% for weekly measures over 6 months.\n\nText messages as a data collection tool avoids the dropping out of younger men, which is common in surveys.\n\nWith this method, detailed information on individual variation and fluctuating conditions can be gathered at any desired frequency, instantly accessible to the clinician/researcher. Natural and clinical course can be evaluated in large population samples. intensity at two time points may neither adequately describe the impact to the patient nor the development over time  [7] . Furthermore, when respondents are asked to recall a past pain experience, memory decay inevitably biases the measure. Again, using dense data collection points, impact of the condition may be captured and recall bias would be minimized.\n\nData collection in clinical studies has now reached a new era. With mobile phones being ''everyman's'' property in many countries, data can be collected cheaply and very frequently by text messages (SMS). Using this technology, data collection is possible at a monthly, weekly, daily, or even an hourly basis. The method is promising also in terms of low costs, minimal time consumption, and minimal data handling  [8] . In a recent Danish study, the recall bias associated with this method was evaluated in a comparison with responses from a telephone interview  [8] , and agreement between the methods was found to be good for 1-week recall periods. Another Danish study found that text message responses concerning pain days and pain intensity followed a similar pattern over time  [9] .\n\nIn summary, collecting data frequently may be useful in fluctuating conditions as individual variation can be monitored at any desired rate. Using mobile phones is associated with little cost, accessibility to large populations, instant awareness concerning the condition on behalf of the clinician, and minimal data handling for the researcher.\n\nHowever, when a new method is introduced, it should be evaluated to ensure applicability. In the case of gathering data with text messages, the factors influencing the response rate and compliance have not yet been evaluated and neither has user-friendliness. Before this method can be reliably used in different settings, it needs further scrutiny."

      "text": "The data were collected in a prospective multicentre study that aimed to describe the clinical course of nonspecific LBP. In the present report, only variables relevant to the evaluation of the method are presented.\n\nTo recruit subjects with LBP, chiropractic clinics were chosen as LBP is the most commonly treated condition by chiropractors in Sweden  [10] . A convenience sample of chiropractors, all members of the Swedish Chiropractors' Association (in Swedish: Legitimerade Kiropraktorers Riksorganisation), was recruited in an earlier study  [11] .\n\nThe chiropractors were asked to recruit 10 participants each in the study. Subjects were included provided that they had nonspecific LBP with or without leg pain, were of working age (usually between 18 and 65 years old), and that they returned to the chiropractor for at least a second visit. Also, before the present episode of LBP, they should not have been under chiropractic care for the past 3 months. Patients were not recruited in the study if pregnant, unable to understand Swedish, if they did not have a mobile phone, or if they did not know how to text message. Subjects were enrolled from May to December 2008 and followed for 6 months. Patients with specific LBP (i.e., not to be included in the study) would be identified at the first chiropractic visit, which is not recorded in the study. To minimize the burden on the clinicians, subjects identified with nonspecific LBP were recruited in the study at the second visit."

They also received an information leaflet with details of the study's purpose, methods, and length. The text message question was clearly stated. At this visit, the subjects filled in the first questionnaire with a pain drawing  [12] , self-rated general health (''How would you rate your health?'' Answers given as a 5-point Likert scale ranging from Excellent  [1]  to Poor  [5] '')  [13] , pain intensity (numeric 11-point scale [numeric rating scale (NRS), anchors at no pain, and worst imaginable)  [14] , and the EuroQol, EQ-5D (scores ranging from 1.00 5 perfect health to 0 5 death)  [15] . They signed a consent form and sent it all to the research center where the respondents were entered into the computer system for the text message question. At the same visit, baseline data were collected by the chiropractor consisting of information on gender, age, and occupation, as well as area, intensity, duration, and frequency of the LBP. In addition, access to a mobile phone and knowledge of using text messages were noted by the chiropractor.\n\nTreatment was decided by the chiropractor in charge of the case and is not reported in this article. As studies have shown that most patients improve by the fourth visit  [3, 16, 17] , this was decided to be the first follow-up time in the clinic. At this visit, the chiropractor interviewed the subject and noted pain intensity (numeric 11-point scale, with anchors at no pain and worst imaginable) and self-reported improvement (descriptive 5-point scale, ranging from definitely improved to definitely worse). These questions are part of a normal clinic routine, and it was not logistically possible to let a research assistant perform these interviews.\n\nAfter 6 months, follow-up questionnaires with EQ-5D and a question on self-reported general health (5-point scale ranging from excellent to very poor) were sent to the respondents with a stamped return envelope. Nonresponders were called once by a research assistant and encouraged to answer."

      "text": "The software used for the text message data collection in this study was the SMS-Track Questionnaire  [18] . It allows for a high number of respondents receiving questionnaires as a text message via their mobile phones at a frequent rate  [18] . Text messages are sent automatically at the same time every week. The respondents answer by replying with a text message (in this study: by typing a number), which is then automatically transferred to a data file and stored under safe conditions. The responsible researcher can, in real time, view the answers from each respondent on line.\n\nQuestions suitable for text messages should be short and preferably answered in an equally short manner. When measuring pain, intensity can reliably be described with the visual analogue scale  [19]  and the NRS  [20] . However, several aspects of pain should be assessed  [21, 22] , and researchers have proposed that pain severity limiting daily activities should warrant attention  [22, 23] . Further, painmeasuring instruments need to be clinically applicable to encourage utilization  [23] , and user-friendliness and interpretability should be considered  [22, 24] . The measure ''bothersomeness'' has been shown to be associated with pain intensity, disability, and psychological health  [24]  and to predict outcome  [24] . In this study, this term is used as a proxy for the global effects of pain, both physical and psychological, on the subjects' everyday life.\n\nThe question used in our study was: ''How many days during this previous week has your low back pain been bothersome, (i.e. affected your daily activities or routines)?

If respondents could not be reached by phone, a reminder letter was sent.

      "text": "A specific concern was that people with a poor outcome, that is, where the LBP is persistent, might gradually feel less attached to the study, therefore eventually not bothering to answer, compared with those with a good outcome. On the other hand, also those with a good outcome might grow tired of answering weekly text messages, as they might feel the question would become irrelevant over time. Thus, it would be a source of bias if respondents with different outcomes had different response patterns. By stratifying the sample into more compliant (high) and less compliant (poor) responders, this potential bias was evaluated by comparing the baseline variables and the clinical course of the two groups. The cut point for good and poor compliers was arbitrarily set at 80% of the returned answers over the 6 months.\n\nThe missing responses scattered over the study period were also evaluated in relation to the answer of the previous week, as bias could result if data were missing as a result of respondents with different outcome courses answering (and missing) differently. Furthermore, the course of LBP of those subjects who were reminded by a personal telephone call were compared with those who responded without being reminded. By comparing the total number of days with bothersome LBP between the two groups, information on whether the reminded respondents had a different LBP outcome was obtained."

We consider the reasons given in the telephone interviews with the dropouts of the study as the basis for evaluating user-friendliness. Five of the dropouts did not offer an explanation, seven were impossible to reach by telephone and mail, two had neck pain as their primary complaint, one subject thought it silly to answer ''0'' all the time, one subject found the text messages too costly, one did not have the time to answer, and one could not remember the degree of bothersomeness from the previous week. Thus, no common problem was identified.\n\nThe baseline variables of these subjects are summarized in Table  1 .

For the high compliers, from week 9 there is a continuous decrease throughout albeit small after week 4. However, for the group of poor compliers, there is a small increase in the number of days with bothersome LBP from this point.\n\nWe also noted a visible tendency to fail to answer if the previous week's response was a high number of bothersome pain days (Table  2 ). Furthermore, 27 respondents were reminded to answer and 23 (85%) of these were also classified as poor compliers, that is, they answered less than 80% of the time.

This method provides detailed information in a fluctuating condition. As the respondents only have a predetermined and limited time to answer a question, the method is less biased by recall than other methods  [26] . Data handling is reduced with this method as responses are recorded directly in data files. Nonresponders can be instantly spotted and contacted, which should enhance compliance, and the method is far cheaper than sending out questionnaires by ordinary mail  [8] . Evaluation of the response rate, also in relation to seasonal variation, as well as the factors affecting compliance and user-friendliness indicates that the method is useful and that the results can be trusted. A similar method, using smart phones as the collection tool but the Internet (not text messages) to record the answers, was reported to have response rates in the range of 84e97%  [27] ."

      "title": "Evaluation of response rate, season, and userfriendliness",
      "text": "A limitation of this data collection method is that questions and answers have to be brief to make them acceptable to participants. Judging by the high response rate, our participants found the text message question in this study easy to answer. A similar result was obtained in a 12month Danish study, where the respondents stated that they would not have minded up to three questions each week  [8] . As our response rate is fairly constant over the study period, the method is avoiding seasonal bias, which may influence other methods of data collection.\n\nThe high response rate, low dropout rate, and the reasons given for stopping participation by the few dropouts suggest that the method is user friendly. More information on this topic could perhaps have been obtained if all participants had been asked how they perceived the method.\n\nIt should be noted that the respondents were paying themselves for the reply messages. Although informed of the estimated total cost before consenting to participate, one of the dropouts discontinued because of cost. Thus, in this study economy is probably not causing bias, but it may in a different setting. One limitation of the study is that no record of eligible patients was kept, thus it is possible that somedalready during the enrolment stagedthought it expensive or troublesome to answer weekly text messages and therefore declined participation.\n\nTwo unusual findings resulted from the evaluation process of this method of collecting data. First, the response rate in our study was high (82.5%) despite the fact that it was a longitudinal study that required respondents to react once a week over 6 months. A recent Danish study  [3]  using the same technology over a shorter period, 18 weeks, and without reminding calls, obtained a response rate of 63%. We conclude that the use of reminders in our study prompted participation by nearly 20%, although the reminded subjects remained poor compliers.\n\nTwo of the main advantages with this method to collect data (costs and time) would be compromised if participants have to be telephoned personally for reminders. In our study, the number of reminded subjects was small (11%). One will have to consider the effort and cost in reminding vs. the increased response rate; in our case, it was clearly advantageous to make the reminder calls.\n\nAnother unusual finding in our study is that the dropout is unaffected by gender and age. In recent Swedish, Dutch, and Danish studies on subjects with LBP in primary care, dropouts were predominantly younger  [1]  and men  [3, 28] . Thus, in our study, text messages as a data collecting method does not seem to generate dropouts observed in other studies.\n\nIt is interesting that dropouts had less severe and shorter duration of pain at baseline compared with subjects who stayed in the study, although caution is warranted when interpreting the results of such a small group. This is similar to the findings in the above-mentioned studies  [1, 3] . Maybe subjects with ''minor'' LBP cannot be bothered to answer research questions, regardless of data collection method. Possibly, this group would have reported few days with bothersome pain throughout, their exit leading to overreporting of the final number of bothersome days. However, Table 2. The association between the previous week's response and failing to report in the subsequent week by 244 patients with LBP Number of days with bothersome LBP, the week before missing to report Percentage of missing reports, the succeeding week (%) 0 8 1e2 1 3 e14 3e4 1 7 e18 5e7 2 2 e26 Abbreviation: LBP, low back pain.\n\nthe number of dropouts is small (!7%) and therefore not affecting the overall results in this study."

      "title": "Compliance",
      "text": "There were no differences in the baseline variables between those who diligently answered their text message every week and those who were less compliant. Nevertheless, the clinical course was somewhat less advantageous for the poor compliers. Two possible explanations are offered for this observation. First, the poor compliers may be a subgroup of subjects with a poorer prognosis. In support of this theory was our finding that missing responses often followed after a week of reporting a high number of bothersome days. Similarly, in a study on LBP from both chiropractic and medical care, subjects reporting high levels of pain continued so throughout  [29] , explained by the ''theory of stability,'' that is, that patients experiencing persistent severe pain believe that no improvement is possible. Assuming that such a subgroup exists among our subjects, they would likely be poor compliers.\n\nThe second possible explanation is that some subjects may simply be less motivated in answering research questions, only answering when the LBP get really bothersome, which could explain the less advantageous course over time for the poor compliers. Had they answered more conscientiously, their course might have been similar to that of the high compliers. To support this theory, the self-rated health at baseline, as estimated by EQ-5D, was not associated with compliance. Thus, poor compliance could be because of low interest in the study rather than representing a disadvantaged subgroup with poorer health and worse outcome.\n\nThe difference in number of bothersome days between high and poor compliers was minor and probably not relevant in this particular study. However, such a difference should be kept in mind in other studies, in studies of other illnesses and different clinical settings.\n\nThis study was based in a clinical setting where subjects received treatment. There might therefore be concern that the clinicians during treatment sessions could have boosted the compliance rates by reminding and encouraging subjects to answer the SMSs, which would not occur in a nonclinical setting. However, the text message data collection was initiated from the research center and continued far beyond the treatment periods. Therefore, we do not believe that the clinicians added any systematic bias concerning compliance."

      "title": "Generalizability",
      "text": "The external validity of the method will depend on the population under study. The similarity of subjects in this study to that of other Swedish samples was assessed by comparing their self-rated health scores (EQ-5D) to those of a normative sample  [30]  and a sample awaiting disc surgery  [31]  and found to be placed between them. Therefore, in terms of health level, this sample seems representative, placed between a ''normally healthy'' population and those presumed to be of poorer health. However, studies have shown that depression and anxiety, predictors of chronicity  [32] , are relatively rare in chiropractic patients, and when present, it was unimportant for outcome  [28, 33] . Whether such psychological factors influence the willingness of responding frequently is not known.\n\nThe rapid improvement seen in the beginning of the clinical course (Fig.  3 ) is similar not only to the results of a Danish study  [9]  on chiropractic subjects in primary care but also to the results of studies from other populations with acute LBP  [34] .\n\nHowever, also factors other than health and development of LBP would determine whether participants in other settings are willing and able to answer a text message repeatedly. Two concerns are mobile phone ownership and knowledge of text messaging. In Sweden, mobile phone penetration was 94% in 2008  [35] . Generalizability of this method will depend on mobile phone penetration and maybe socioeconomic status, as it is associated with some cost."

      "title": "Perspectives",
      "text": "With this method of collecting data several new research options arise. It will be possible to summarize the total number of days with bothersome LBP both for individuals and groups, suggested as a good estimate to capture the fluctuating course of LBP  [26, 36] . Also, frequent reporting of symptoms will make it possible to describe the duration of events and event-free periods, proposed to be an important research area  [4] . For LBP, it will be possible to link different course patterns with specific subgroups.\n\nIn the clinical setting, this system could be used to monitor patients ''at risk.'' Patients could for instance report their blood sugar level, blood pressure, or pain level on a regular basis or when the measure reach a predetermined level. The system will require an initial cost but will offer the possibility to keep track of large groups of patients at a marginal cost."

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "In relation to our study population, collecting data with weekly text messages for 6 months yields a high response rate, which seems unaffected by season. The method is user friendly. Dropout was not gender or age related. Compliance was not affected by baseline characteristics but possibly somewhat by outcome. Thus, subjects experiencing less severe and shorter duration LBP may be prone to drop out from such a study and individuals who experience improvement may be more inclined to continue participation.\n\nThe use of weekly text messages is recommended when studying conditions such as this, where details of fluctuation or periodicity are wanted, and where individual variation is important to consider. Obviously, this method should be useful for other purposes and in other settings, studying different conditions and populations."
