  "title": "mHealth Interventions in Low-Income Countries to Address Maternal Health: A Systematic Review",
  "abstract": "The wide availability and relative simplicity of mobile phones make them a promising instrument for delivering a variety of health-related interventions. Mobile health (mHealth) interventions have been tested in a variety of health delivery areas, but research has been restricted to pilot and small studies with limited generalizability. The aim of this review was to explore the current evidence on the use of mHealth for maternal health interventions in low-and low middle-income countries. M E T H O D S Peer-reviewed papers were identified from Medline/PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library via a combination of search terms. Quantitative or mixed-methods papers published in the English language between January 2000 and July 2015 were included. R E S U L T S Three hundred and seventy papers were found in the literature search. We assessed the full text of 57 studies, and included 19 in the review. Study designs included were 5 randomized controlled trials, 9 before and after comparisons, 1 study with endline assessment only, 3 postintervention assessments, and 1 cohort study. Quality assessment elucidated 9 low-quality, 5 moderate, and 5 high studies. Five studies supported the use of mobile phones for data collection, 3 for appointment reminders, and 4 for both appointment reminders and health promotion. Six studies supported the use of mHealth for provider-to-provider communication and 1 for clinical management. C O N C L U S I O N S Studies demonstrated promise for the use of mHealth in maternal health; however, much of the evidence came from low-and moderate-quality studies. Pilot and small programs require more rigorous testing before allocating resources to scaling up this technology.",

      "text": "(10.7%).  2  Nearly all (99%) maternal deaths occur in developing counties, reflecting inequalities in access to quality health services; these inequalities are further reflected in the disparities between high-and low-income women, and those living in rural versus urban areas in low-and middle-income countries (LMICs). Solutions for the prevention and management of complications of pregnancy exist, however, implementation of these solutions is constrained as overall access to quality care is lacking; health systems strengthening is necessary to address this critical context. mHealth has the potential to reduce inequalities in care through a variety of applications that aim to facilitate the communication between clients and providers, promote women's behavioral change, simplify and extend training, and assist in data collection; with the overarching aim to improve access to and quality of obstetric care. It is necessary to implement and evaluate these strategies in order to build the evidence-base that will enable the incorporation of mHealth into health systems and to improve access to quality maternal health care worldwide.\n\nmHealth is defined by the World Health Organization as \"medical and public health practice supported by mobile devices, such as mobile phones, patient monitoring devices, personal digital assistants, and other wireless devices,\" 3 and has been evaluated as a useful public health tool, particularly in underserved settings.  4, 5 The number of mobile phone subscribers in developing countries increased from 1200 million in 2005 to 5400 million in 2014.  6 The ubiquitous penetration of mobile phones surpasses infrastructure in many LMICs, including paved roads, electricity, and fixed Internet deployment, demonstrating the potential of mHealth to address geographical barriers to access care. It also has potential to address the human resource gap through technology designed to assist in clinical diagnosis and treatment adherence, and improve health care worker training and patient education, among others.  3 obile phone interventions have been tested in different areas including HIV, maternal and child health, family planning, malaria, and tuberculosis.  [7] [8] ] [9] [10] [11] [12]  A systematic review on the use of mHealth and community health workers (CHWs) reported multiple applications for these technologies, including field data collection, receiving alerts and reminders, facilitating health promotion, and communication between providers.  13 lthough mHealth is a very promising strategy, most of the current evidence comes from small pilot studies with limited scalability.  3, 5 Specific mHealth solutions are required for the field of maternal health, where death rates remain high due to limited access to quality care. Given the resource constraints in lowincome countries, understanding the true effect of these strategies is essential before funds can be allocated to larger-scale interventions. A few reviews were recently published exploring this topic, but differed from the scope of our study. Poorman's study did not restrict the search to LMICs, and included studies in the \"preconception period\" loosely related to maternal heath, such as notification of sexually transmitted infections and vitamin supplementation in men and women in high-income countries.  14 mportantly, this review did not assess the quality of the articles included and did not publish its search strategy in detail, as we have done here. Similarly, another systematic review included mHealth interventions targeted at increasing childhood immunization rates and interventions targeted at increasing obstetric care attendance; but not studies evaluating other uses of mHealth such as data collection or provider training in the obstetric setting itself.  15 The present systematic review builds on these efforts in a more rigorous and comprehensive manner by including a clear systematic search strategy and quality assessment of the literature, and by capturing and collating several studies not previously assessed thereby painting a more definitive picture of the state of evidence for mHealth interventions in maternal health care delivery."

      "text": "Search Strategy. We included peer-reviewed papers identified via Medline/PubMed, Web of Science, and Cochrane Library. The search employed a combination of terms describing mobile phones, maternal health, and LMICs, as defined by the World Bank development indices (Box 1).  16 apers published in English between January 2000 and July 2015 were considered. Included studies reported original data using quantitative or mixed-method designs evaluating the implementation of an mHealth intervention to improve maternal health outcomes. We decided to limit the scope of this review to quantitative research (purely quantitative or mixed methods) and therefore excluded descriptive studies, purely qualitative research, oral presentations, policy briefs, commentaries, and study protocols. Additionally, we excluded papers that described a software or application but did not evaluate its implementation (Table  1 ). Initial screening of titles and abstracts was followed by full-text assessment of eligible studies. References of included papers were screened for additional sources. Quality Assessment of Included Papers. Quality assessment of the studies was conducted using an adapted STROBE checklist for observational studies and CONSORT checklist for clinical trials.  17, 18 ncluded papers were assigned a rating of high, moderate, or low quality.  19"

Nine papers were graded low quality, 5 moderate, and 5 high. Nine papers described a before and after design with no control group, whereas 5 reported on randomized controlled trials (RCTs).  [20] [21] 1] [22]  One study used a historic control group.  23 Sample sizes ranged from 10 to 2,550, limiting comparability. Loss to follow-up (LTFU) was a challenge both in before and after studies and in RCTs; the study by Munro et al had an LTFU of 36.3%,  21 the RCT by Ngoc et al had significantly different LTFU in its 2 groups with 0.6% in the phone follow-up group and 8.1% in the clinic follow-up group,  24  and Adanikin et al had an LTFU of 21.3% in their intervention group and 42.8% in their historic control group.  23 The largest proportion of papers was classified as low quality. Of the 9 low-quality papers, 4 reported before and after studies, 1 reported an endline assessment, 3 reported on a postintervention assessment, and 1 reported on a cohort study with a historic control group. The 5 moderate-quality papers were all before and after studies. The remaining 5 highquality papers were RCTs.\n\nLabrique et al proposed a framework with 12 domains in which mHealth and information and communication technologies are commonly applied.  25 This review found 5 major domains where mHealth was used to address the continuum of care in maternal health: data collection, decision support and provider-to-provider communication, appointment reminder with or without health education, and clinical management. Table  2  describes the aggregated characteristics of the papers included in the analysis and Table  3  describes each study in more detail. Data Collection. Two papers reported on the same Liberian TBA (N \u00bc 99) data collection and pregnancy registration program. Non-and low-literate TBAs were trained to use a mobile phone to send a 10-digit message containing information on pregnant women.  21, 22 The early post-training assessment and the 1-year assessment showed significant improvement across a variety of mobile phone use indicators. A similar protocol was used in Ghana to train midwives (n \u00bc 2) and TBAs (n \u00bc 8) to use mobile phones to report cases of postpartum hemorrhage (PPH). Participants reported 13 cases of PPH during the study period; however, additional data on referral systems and specific health outcomes of those women were not provided.  12 nother study trained Ethiopian midwives (n \u00bc 18) and HEWs (n \u00bc 12) in data collection using smart phones.  26 The study reported that health workers felt confident using the device, required little assistance, and developed a sense of ownership and empowerment with unrestricted phone access; however, this was not quantified in their analysis.\n\nA 6-month study of electronic smartphone forms  27  reported 16 of 25 HEWs (69.6%) cited them as good protocol reminders. Identified barriers of consistent use of electronic forms included problems with username or password settings and freezing or locking up of smart phones."

Mobile phones were evaluated as means to support health workers in their clinical decisions, facilitate referrals, and promote providerto-provider communication.\n\nA study conducted in Rwanda used a short message service (SMS) to facilitate real-time reporting and communication between 432 CHWs and the formal health system.  20 Over a 1-year period, 100% of CHWs complied, resulting in >35,000 A n n a l s o f G l o b a l H e a l t h , V O L . 8 2 , N O . 5 , 2 0 1 6 Colaci et al.

SMS alerts also were sent to CHWs regarding pregnancy management resulting in a 27% increase in facility-based deliveries. The effect on referral processes or CHW facility feedback mechanisms were not described.\n\nCole-Ceesay et al implemented a package of maternal health interventions in The Gambia, which included a component that used mobile phones to link village health workers and TBAs with health providers and ambulances. The paper reported only the endline assessment without specifying the specific contribution of this component; 109 patients were transferred from communities to hospitals over a 3-year period.  28 Health also was used in Indonesia to facilitate communication among midwives and obstetricians. Midwives showed a significant increase in the confidence to solve difficult problems (P < .01) and store patient data (P < .01). 11 Mobile phone use was positively associated with access to institutional and peer-network resources (P < .05).  29  An mHealth initiative in Guatemala provided mobile phones to tele-community facilitators that enabled them to ask questions about consultations, send epidemiological and clinical data, and receive training. Between 2008 and 2012, there were 116,275 general consultations, 6,783 women were monitored, and 2014 emergency transfers were coordinated. There was a statistically significant reduction in maternal mortality (P < .05) in the intervention communities compared with control communities over the 4-year period. However, there was an overall reduction in maternal mortality in the whole department over the same period.  30 he m4Change project was designed to support the Nigerian government's initiative to promote the use of mHealth to improve maternal and child health.  31 A mobile phone application, including decision-support algorithms, data collection tools, and recorded health counseling messages, was developed to help CHWs to provide higherquality antennal care in 10 primary health centers. After 1 year of program implementation, client exit interviews showed a significant increase in the overall score of quality of care received (13.33 at baseline vs. 17.15 at endline; P < .0001), and significant improvement in technical aspects such as the provision of HIV test (67.5% vs. 82.2%). Client satisfaction with antenatal care significantly improved after the intervention, 83.3% satisfaction at endline versus 75.4% at baseline (P \u00bc .025). Appointment Reminders. Adaniki et al conducted a study in Nigeria where reminders to attend the postpartum visit were sent to women after delivery. Women in the intervention group attended more puerperal visits than a historic control group; failure to attend was 21.3% in the intervention group and 42.8% in the control.  23 deny et al conducted an RCT evaluating the effect of SMS appointment reminders among HIV-positive pregnant women.  32 Women in the intervention group (n \u00bc 195) received a text message every 2 weeks starting on week 28 of gestation and weekly during the puerperium; women in the control group received standard care (n \u00bc 193). Almost 20% of women in the intervention group attended postpartum visits compared with 12% in the control group (relative risk [RR], 1.66; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.02-2.70).\n\nA study conducted in the Thailand-Myanmar border equipped health care personnel with smartphones to use in data collection and to send automated text messages to clients.  33 Published results focused on the appointment reminder service; a text message increased the odds of attending the appointment by almost 3 times (odds ratio [OR], Table 3. continued Author Country Target of Intervention Goal Intervention Design Key Findings Quality d Frequencies of the messages: 2/mo before 36 wk gestation and 2/wk from week 36 until delivery d Women in the control group received standard care (ANC, skilled attendance at delivery, postnatal visit) health facilities, 1239 women d 59% of the women in the intervention group said text message influenced their decision to attend the antenatal visit d 71% felt that the educational messages helped them learn about danger signs in pregnancy and to feel that the health system cared for them Skilled birth attendance outcomes d Increased skilled birth attendance in the intervention group (60%) compared with the control group (47%) d Significant increase in skilled delivery attendance in urban areas (OR, 5.73;

Lund et al conducted a cluster RCT in Zanzibar, Tanzania within the program Wired Mothers.  34 Wired Mothers provided unidirectional text messages with appointment reminders and health education content, and women were given a voucher for bidirectional messaging with health providers. Forty-four percent of women in the intervention group received 4 antenatal care visits compared with 31% in the control group (OR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.03-5.55), and 71% of women felt that the educational messages were useful to learn about pregnancy complication signs. Lund et al also assessed the proportion of skilled birth attendance.  35 In urban areas, 60% of the women in the intervention group had a skilled birth attendant present compared with 47% in the control group (OR, 5.73; 95% CI, 1.51-21.81). Finally, the intervention was associated with a reduction in perinatal mortality (OR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.27-0.93), but there was no difference among groups in the number of stillbirths and deaths within the first 42 days of life.  35, 36  study conducted in Ethiopia assessed the use of community meetings and text messages as appointment reminders and to illicit behavioral change.  37 Researchers found an increase in postnatal care in women who attended 2 community meetings and had access to HEWs and mobile phones (OR, 4.86; 95% CI, 2.67-8.86). However, household cell phone ownership itself was not associated with attending postnatal care. Clinical management. Another potential use of mobile phones is to facilitate clinical management or follow-up, however, we only found 1 paper that described it. A Vietnamese study randomized 1,433 women seeking early medical abortion into 2 groups: medical treatment and phone follow-up or medical treatment and clinic follow-up.  24 The rate of ongoing pregnancy did not differ between study groups; phone follow-up and a semiquantitative pregnancy test done at the women's house were highly effective for screening ongoing pregnancy (sensitivity 92.8%; specificity 90.6%).\n\nTable 3. continued Author Country Target of Intervention Goal Intervention Design Key Findings Quality Results from follow-up study d MW cell phone use was positively associated with access to institutional and peer-network resources (P < .05) d Access to institutional resources had a direct positive effect on MW health knowledge (P < .05), whereas access to peer resources did not Low ANC, antenatal care; CHW, community health care worker; CF, community facilitator; CI, confidence interval; FTA, failure to attend; HCG, human chorionic gonadotropin; HEW, health extension worker; IEC, information education communication; MW, midwife; MWC, midwife coordinators; OB-GYN, obstetrician gynecologist; OR, odds ratio; PHC, primary health center; PPH, postpartum hemorrhage; RCT, randomized control trial; RR, relative risk; SMS, short message service; TBA, traditional birth attendant. Colaci et al. This systematic review found that mobile phone technology in the context of maternal health has been evaluated over a range of service delivery applications, such as data collection, provider-to-provider communication, appointment reminders, health education, and clinical follow-up. Studies showed promising findings for this technology, including health education and appointment reminder messaging significantly increasing postnatal care,  37  and being associated with reducing perinatal mortality  36  ; however, a large proportion of the evidence came from low-and moderate-quality studies emphasizing the need for higher-quality research in this field.\n\nFour reports described data collection interventions, but they were of low quality, the sample sizes were small, and the effect of the intervention was not rigorously quantified. Two other studies evaluated the use of mobile phones to support lay health workers in their clinical decision-making process and facilitate patient referral to a health facility; the quality of these studies was low, they lacked a control group, and in one case, it was unclear if the reported effect was due to the mobile phone or other components of the intervention. Limited evidence from this systematic review suggested that mobile phone technologies are useful for increasing attendance to clinic appointments and promoting behavior change.\n\nAlthough there is a lot of potential in the use of mHealth for clinical follow-up, we did not find substantial evidence to show the effect or lack thereof of this technology in clinical management as only 1 paper considering this topic met our inclusion criteria.\n\nAnother issue relates to challenges intrinsic to this technology. Studies in which part of the intervention was to provide mobile phones to health providers found the additional challenge of mobile phone cost, maintenance, and lack of electricity to maintain charge.  20, 21 Other limitations were related to phone sharing, where the fact that a message was delivered did not imply that the woman included in the study read it and her behavior was influenced by the SMS.  23, 34, 35 Another mHealth dimension that has not been deeply explored in maternal health programs is the delivery of provider training. We found evidence of mHealth used to support decision making and to communicate with other providers, but not specifically to deliver training. Given the global workforce crisis and the widespread deployment of task shifting as a way to address it, it is pertinent to explore the use of mHealth to deliver training to providers in the formal sector as well as to lay health workers.  38 ur findings are in agreement with previous literature on this topic. A 2012 systematic review on maternal health and mHealth technology agreed with our findings that mHealth has the potential to address maternal health in low-income settings, and that high-quality studies are required to yield stronger conclusions. Future evaluations in this field should address scalability of pilot projects and longterm sustainability of the interventions.  39 This study included 34 papers, 4 of which were quantitative reports and they did not restrict their inclusion criteria to peer-reviewed papers. The present study differs in that the inclusion criteria were more rigorous, focusing on measurable results from peer-reviewed quantitative studies, and included a quality assessment of the literature, which the above review did not.\n\nOther reviews explore this topic, but differed from the present study in the scope and the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Although there is some overlap, this systematic review explores the current evidence on the use of mHealth for maternal health interventions in low-income countries addressing the aspects that were not included in previous reviews and focusing specifically on maternal health interventions. The present review is in agreement with the others regarding the need of higher quality and more robust studies.\n\nThis systematic review has its strengths and weaknesses. To ensure a comprehensive search strategy, we used a literature search strategy adding specific terms for the 3 components we were interested in studying (mobile phone \u00fe maternal health \u00fe low-and low-middle income countries) and used clear inclusion and exclusion criteria. Although we included only papers published in peer-reviewed journals to improve the quality of the review, this may have resulted in the omission of outside reports from nonprofit organizations, white or gray literature, or papers published in technology journals. Another limitation is that we only included papers published in English. It is also worth noting that there is program overlap among some of the reports included in this review. Two of the 4 studies on data collection and 2 of the 4 on decision support corresponded to the same programs in Liberia and Indonesia, respectively. Similarly, 3 of the 4 studies on appointment reminders and health education correspond to the same program in Zanzibar, Tanzania. Increasing the quality of the studies as well as the diversification of programs and research groups would contribute to the generalizability of the findings.\n\nThis systematic review suggests that mobile phones offer a promising opportunity in the maternal health field to improve access to and quality of prenatal and obstetric health care, both from provider-facing technologies targeting practice behavior and performance and from patient-facing technologies focusing on adherence and education. This former is especially critical to reduce maternal mortality, as suboptimal obstetric care is directly responsible for the majority of maternal deaths, thus emphasizing the need for technologies to enhance provider performance and skills and other dimensions of quality including supply and commodity chains, provider motivation, and patient satisfaction. In general, this review again highlights the need for further higher-quality evidence to reinforce specific mHealth designs and applications to the health care delivery setting for maternal health. Additionally, larger-scale and more rigorous studies are needed to assess external validity across LMIC settings to guide health-sector resource investments into these technologies. Future research should explore new areas of application of mHealth interventions, such as the use of mobile phones to deliver training to health providers, and for supervision and quality improvement for health workers. Despite these research needs, mHealth has significant potential to alter the landscape of maternal health care in LMICs, and is worthy of attention and support."
