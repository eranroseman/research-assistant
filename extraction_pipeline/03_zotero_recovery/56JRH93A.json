  "title": "Preventing severe hypoglycemia in adults with type 2 diabetes (PHT2): Design, delivery and evaluation framework for a randomized controlled trial",
  "abstract": "Background: Severe hypoglycemia is a common and feared complication of medications used to lower blood glucose levels in individuals with diabetes. Psychoeducational interventions can prevent severe hypoglycemia in individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D). We aim to determine the effectiveness of this approach among adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) at elevated risk for severe hypoglycemia. Methods: Preventing Hypoglycemia in Type 2 diabetes (PHT2) is a two-arm, parallel, randomized controlled trial. Participants are eligible if they are adults with T2D receiving care at an integrated group practice in Washington state and have experienced one or more episodes of severe hypoglycemia in the prior 12 months or have impaired awareness of hypoglycemia (Gold score \u2265 4). Participants are randomized to proactive nurse care management with or without my hypo compass, an evidence-based, psychoeducational intervention combining group and individual self-management training. For this study, my hypo compass was adapted to be suitable for adults with T2D and from an in-person to a virtual intervention over videoconference and telephone. The primary outcome is any self-reported severe hypoglycemia in the 12 months following the start of the intervention. Secondary outcomes include biochemical measures of hypoglycemia, self-reported hypoglycemia awareness, fear of hypoglycemia, and emergency department visits and hospitalizations for severe hypoglycemia. The study includes a process evaluation to assess implementation fidelity and clarify the causal pathway. \n Conclusion: The PHT2 trial will compare the effectiveness of two approaches for reducing severe hypoglycemia in adults with T2D.",

      "text": "Severe hypoglycemia is a blood glucose low enough to require help from another person for recovery and is a common, feared complication of blood glucose-lowering medications. Severe hypoglycemia is associated with accidents  [1] , falls  [2, 3] , chronic and acute cardiovascular disease  [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] , dementia  [10] [11] [12] , and increased risk of death  [13] [14] [15] [16] . Older adults are particularly susceptible to injury from severe hypoglycemia due to coexisting frailty and other medical conditions  [17] . A systematic review of longitudinal studies found severe hypoglycemia reduces a person's confidence in their diabetes selfmanagement and perceived health quality, while frequent hypoglycemia reduces energy levels and emotional well-being  [18] .\n\nSevere hypoglycemia among adults with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is a growing concern for healthcare organizations and policymakers. Of the >37 million US adults with diabetes, 90-95% have T2D  [19] . Severe hypoglycemia affects 10% of these adults, with minimal difference in relative risk across HbA1c levels. [20]  Among older Americans, up to 25% of emergency hospitalizations for adverse drug events involve hypoglycemia related to insulins and oral hypoglycemia agents  [21] .\n\nImpaired awareness of hypoglycemia (IAH) and delayed or insufficient treatment of low blood glucoses are major modifiable risk factors for severe hypoglycemia. IAH develops after repeated or sustained exposure to hypoglycemia  [22] . Individuals with intact awareness can recognize their hormonal and/or neurologic response to low blood glucose, which manifest as symptoms such as weakness, shakiness or sweating. Individuals with IAH have lost or have reduced capacity to recognize the onset of hypoglycemia due to symptoms being reduced in intensity, experienced only at lower blood glucose levels than previously, or (rarely) completely absent. IAH occurs in approximately 10% of individuals managing their T2D taking insulin, and is associated with 17-fold higher risk of severe hypoglycemia compared to those with intact awareness  [22] . T2D tends to occur in older adults, who are less likely than younger people with T2D to experience typical hypoglycemia symptoms, and they may mistakenly attribute the weakness or unsteadiness to other causes  [17] . The National Committee for Quality Assurance, recognizing the importance of severe hypoglycemia risk in this population, added emergency department visits for hypoglycemia in older adults with diabetes as a healthcare quality measure in 2023. [23]  Structured diabetes education and pyschoeducation may enable preventive action, avoid severe hypoglycemia, and help restore hypoglycemia awareness in individuals with T2D. However, no established training programs exist for individuals with T2D and IAH that focus on reducing risk of hypoglycemia. In individuals with type 1 diabetes (T1D) at high risk for severe hypoglycemia, structured education, behavioral training and psychoeducation programs restores hypoglycemia awareness, facilitates effective action to reverse hypoglycemia and reduces severe hypoglycemia rates  [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . This training differs from standard diabetes self-management education, focusing specifically on the challenges of IAH and severe hypoglycemia associated with blood glucoselowering medications. Many individuals with T2D at high risk for severe hypoglycemia share characteristics with individuals with T1D at high risk such as multiple daily insulin injections, higher IAH rates and a need to balance insulin dose against carbohydrate intake and activity  [29] . Literature reviews and diabetes care leaders call for prospective trials to prevent severe hypoglycemia in high-risk individuals with T2D  [30] ."

For participants with intensive blood glucose targets (e. g., HbA1c <7% with history of severe hypoglycemia or multiple medical conditions), or IAH (Gold score \u2265 4)  [36, 37] , nurses work with physicians to adjust blood glucose targets, deintensify hypoglycemic medications, enhance blood glucose self-monitoring, provide glucagon kits and training, or refer for consideration of CGM  [31, 40] . For participants on blood glucose-lowering agents who need help with self-monitoring, nurses provide basic coaching on hypoglycemia symptoms and actions such as safely raising blood glucose, referring to dieticians as needed  [39, 41] .

For this study, the my hypo compass protocol was adapted to adults with T2D and for delivery over videoconferencing and phone. Participants unable to use video conferencing join by telephone. To reduce potential contamination across comparator groups, different nurses with the same training and experience perform proactive outreach management for the two trial arms, Proactive Care Management and Proactive Care plus my hypo compass. The my hypo compass curriculum is delivered by diabetes nurse educators (see Appendix A for details on training of nurses and diabetes nurse educators). The curriculum is standardized in facilitator and participant handbooks and uses behavioral intervention techniques to facilitate discussions on strict avoidance of hypoglycemia. The curriculum uses four key principles around compass points, North, South, East and West (Appendix A): Never delay appropriate treatment of hypoglycemia; recognize hypoglycemia by Subtle symptoms; Establish times of Extra risk; and be Watchful to detect and prevent hypoglycemia.\n\nEmphasis is on detection, including asymptomatic nocturnal hypoglycemia, with advice to perform a weekly 8-point blood glucose profile including a 4 a.m. check.\n\nThe individual-level causal model for the my hypo compass intervention is informed by the Biopsychobehavioral Model of severe hypoglycemia  [43] , Social Cognitive Theory,  [44]  and Self Determination Theory (Fig.  2 )  [45] .\n\nThe my hypo compass intervention facilitates reflection on past cognitions and behaviors, and generation of an individualized selfmanagement plan tailored for a person's risk factors. This activity increases awareness of hypoglycemia and acknowledgement of the importance of hypoglycemia self-monitoring, enhancing behavioral skills for monitoring and management. The gained knowledge is intended to increase confidence, motivation and self-efficacy to self-manage blood glucose to avoid severe hypoglycemia events. We hypothesize these improvements will lead to better management of severe hypoglycemia through recognition of low glucose and early and appropriate self-treatment, resulting in fewer severe hypoglycemia episodes (primary outcome). A process evaluation will determine the elements and pathway of the causal model.\n\nMy hypo compass intervention activities include a blood glucose/ hypoglycemia diary and two group behavioral-awareness training sessions interspersed with two one-on-one nurse calls for review and reflection (Fig.  3 ). Two diabetes nurse educators trained on the my hypo compass protocol lead group training of participants. A research staff member attends the group sessions to provide technical support. A nurse care manager also attends the sessions to document additional clinical information relevant for patient care. The nurse care managers are trained on the my hypo compass protocol and deliver the one-on-one nurse calls for review and reflection. Hard-copy handbooks with full course content and personal worksheets are mailed to all participants before the first group training. Details of the group training sessions, one-on-one calls and fidelity monitoring are in Appendix A.\n\nThe original my hypo compass protocol, developed by members of the research team (Shaw, Speight), was designed for individuals with T1D. Recommended changes for adapting to adults with type 2 diabetes and a virtual format were endorsed by the clinicians and investigators who developed and validated my hypo compass with T1D and are detailed in the intervention activities description (Appendix A)."

Following return of written consent, we mail participants a single-use sensor-transmitter CGM unit (Dexcom G6 Pro). A study nurse calls the participant to help place the device and checks in by telephone during a 10-day recording period. Participants mail the device back at the end of the measurement period. If a participant's CGM sensor does not have at least 70% of scheduled measures (every 5 min) over the 10-day period, we ask the participant to repeat the monitoring and we mail a new sensor-transmitter unit. CGM measures of blood glucose levels are masked to participants until the end of the study.\n\nFigure  4  shows the data collection points and their relation to the  intervention activities. Follow-up self-reported data are collected by telephone at 6, 10, and 14 months after baseline (4, 8, and 12 months after intervention start) to identify potential early and later intervention effects  [42] . At the 14-month time point, we gather the primary outcome data, encompassing a 12-month measurement window that excludes the 2 months after randomization but before intervention start. This approach captures complete treatment effect and prevents bias in treatment effect estimation. The timing of the 6-month interim measure is informed by studies showing that hypoglycemia symptoms return as soon as 3 to 4 weeks after avoiding hypoglycemia  [46]  and the my hypo compass intervention has early impacts on the percent time with blood glucose <54 mg/dL in individuals with T1D  [24] . At 14 months after baseline, participants collect 10-day CGM measurements using the same procedure as baseline measurements.

      "title": "Analysis plan",
      "text": "Comparative effectiveness analyses will apply intent-to-treat principles, with study participants analyzed based on randomization group, regardless of intervention received. We will summarize demographic characteristics and responses to baseline surveys by group. The primary outcome, occurrence of severe hypoglycemia, is assessed as a binary indicator for whether or not the participant self-reported having a severe hypoglycemia event in the prior 12 months. We will estimate the relative risk of severe hypoglycemia in the Proactive Care Management group versus the Proactive Care plus my hypo compass group by fitting a modified Poisson regression model with the binary self-report measure as the dependent variable and randomization group as the independent variable  [55] . Models will adjust for age, sex, risk score, and number of self-reported severe hypoglycemic events in the 12 months prior to baseline. Models will be fit using generalized estimating equations (GEE) and robust variance estimation to account for correlation due to patient clustering in clinics  [56]  and the misspecified mean-variance relationship in using Poisson regression for a binary outcome  [55] .\n\nPrior to conducting primary outcome analyses, we will look at the baseline distribution for the number of severe hypoglycemic events in the 12 months prior to baseline. If >60% of enrolled participants report 2 or more events in this time period, we will revise the primary outcome to be defined as the self-reported number of severe hypoglycemic events in the 12 months following intervention (i.e., a count rather than a binary outcome), and fit a Poisson regression model to estimate the rate ratio for severe hypoglycemia events for the my hypo compass group relative to the care management only group. We will assess model fit and consider zero-inflated models as an alternative if the number of participants reporting zero events violates distributional assumptions of the Poisson model. If primary analyses use the binary outcome measure (i.e., because fewer than 60% of participants report 2 or more events in the 12 months prior to baseline), but 40% or more of respondents report 2 or more events at 14 months, we will conduct a secondary analysis with the count variable as the outcome.\n\nGeneralized linear regression models estimated with GEE and robust sandwich errors will also be used to estimate intervention effects on m = months following randomization *study powered to detect significant difference secondary outcomes, with link function and error distribution appropriate for each outcome. For secondary outcomes measured at multiple follow-up time points (6-, 10-, and 14-months post baseline), we will fit a single regression model that includes outcome measures from all followup time points. Models will include indicator variables for time, intervention group, and interaction terms between these variables, to estimate intervention effects at each time point. Models will adjust for age, sex, risk score, baseline impaired hypoglycemia awareness, and the baseline measure of the outcome. For hypoglycemia-related healthcare utilization outcomes (urgent care and emergency department visits, hospital admissions), we will follow a similar analytic plan as the primary outcome, including the process to determine whether to model these outcomes as binary or count variables.\n\nOutreach with repeated calls maximizes the response rates of followup telephone surveys and minimizes missing outcome data. If attrition is >10%, statistical methods will account for potential missing data bias. We will compare baseline characteristics of responders and nonresponders and consider multiple imputation or inverse probability weighting methods to account for potential bias due to missing data.\n\nExploratory analyses will assess whether treatment effects vary by patient characteristics including age (under 75 years vs. 75 years and older), sex, race and ethnicity, comorbidities, insulin and/or sulfonylurea use, baseline presence of IAH, and baseline severe hypoglycemia history.\n\nIf significant differences (p < 0.05) between intervention groups are found for the primary outcome, we will perform mediation analysis to test the hypothesis that the possible causal pathway for reducing the occurrence of severe hypoglycemia is through improvements in hypoglycemia knowledge, hypoglycemia awareness, self-efficacy of hypoglycemia management, blood glucose testing, and hypoglycemic medication adjustment (Fig.  2 ). Potential mediators will be defined as the change in each measure between baseline and the 6-month survey. Mediation analyses will use a regression-based approach within the causal mediation framework  [57] , separating the total intervention effect into a natural indirect effect (effect occurring through the mediator), and a natural direct effect (effect through all other pathways). To estimate these effects, we will use either a log-linear or Poisson model for the outcome model (depending on whether the primary outcome is defined as a binary or count variable), and linear regression for the mediator model. The effect of each mediator will be estimated in separate models.\n\nA mixed methods process evaluation will evaluate the fidelity of implementation of intervention components, document the implementation process, assess patient experience, and clarify the causal pathway if intervention effects are found. We will use the Patient Centered Outcomes Research Institute's five domains for randomized controlled trials to guide the process evaluation: fidelity, dose, mechanism, reach and context. Qualitative analysis will complement quantitative, including the mediation analysis described above, by providing a diverse set of perspectives and an understanding of the operation of the intervention in the real world setting of the healthcare system.

Power calculations assume a type 1 error rate of 0.05 and are based on a test of two independent proportions. Assuming 60% of participants in the Proactive Care Management group self-report a severe hypoglycemia event in 12-month look-back, a trial with 204 participants (102 per group) will have 90% power to detect a 26.6% absolute difference between groups (i.e., 37.4% severe hypoglycemia rate in the my hypo compass arm) and 80% power for a 19.7% difference for the primary outcome. To account for 20% loss to follow-up, we are enrolling 256 participants. We are also powered to identify a 20% reduction in the secondary outcome of percent time with biochemical hypoglycemia (<54 mg/dL), with 90% power to detect a 1.6% difference and 80% power to detect a 1.4% difference between groups. Other studies evaluating my hypo compass in individuals with T1D reported similar or larger effects on severe hypoglycemia reductions  [24] [25] [26] [27] [28]  and biochemical hypoglycemia  [ 25, 43] .\n\nFor subgroups comprising approximately 30% of the study sample (e. g., minority racial and ethnic backgrounds), we have 90% power to detect a 39% difference and 80% power to detect a 35% difference in the rate of severe hypoglycemia between interventions within this subgroup. For subgroups comprising approximately 50% of participants (e. g., female, or age \u2265 75), we have 90% power to detect a 31% difference and 80% power to detect a 27% difference in the primary outcome. All these effect sizes are smaller than those associated with the my hypo compass intervention among individuals with T1D  [42] , indicating PHT2 should have adequate power to detect both average and subgroup treatment effects."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "The PHT2 study findings will inform future implementation of evidence-based strategies for preventing severe hypoglycemia among those with T2D most at risk. Currently, no interventions for preventing severe hypoglycemia have been tested in individuals with T2D. Severe hypoglycemia results in significant and possibly preventable negative impacts on quality of life, morbidity, mortality, healthcare utilization and costs. Adoption of an effective intervention would have positive health benefits for individuals with T2D and improved quality of care for healthcare systems.\n\nStructured psychoeducation, such as my hypo compass, is recommended for preventing severe hypoglycemia in at-risk individuals with T1D, including those with impaired awareness of hypoglycemia  [59] . All effective programs share educational components, though my hypo compass is briefer and, as implemented in this trial, is all virtual, focusing specifically on successful prevention of severe hypoglycemia  [42] . The protocol used in this trial has only two brief group intervention sessions with telephone follow-up in between and after sessions. Given the relatively modest commitment for both adults with type 2 DM and health professionals, my hypo compass has potential for wider adoption in healthcare settings.\n\nThe Proactive Care Management comparison group also fills a care gap for individuals with T2D at risk for severe hypoglycemia. This group receives evidence-based care that healthcare providers usually give after an acute severe hypoglycemia episode. This evidence-based standard follows ADA guidelines and while widely supported, frequently does not happen according to current evidence  [38, 60] . Since most severe hypoglycemia events are unreported to healthcare providers  [49] , most individuals with severe hypoglycemia and associated IAH never receive preventive education and care. To address this gap, we provide recommended care proactively  [30] . This comparison arm spreads the current standard of care to individuals often unrecognized as having risk for severe hypoglycemia.\n\nThe study has several limitations. Our intervention is limited to those with T2D who are willing and able to connect to group training sessions through either video conference or telephone. Generalizability of findings is also limited because we are currently unable to include individuals who do not speak or read English, are planning to become or who are currently pregnant, use a CGM at baseline, or have psychosis or cognitive impairment. Participants are limited to those receiving care within an integrated group practice. Independent practices may have more difficulty implementing the intervention.\n\nPHT2's novel, evidence-based protocols have potential to significantly reduce severe hypoglycemia-related morbidity and mortality of individuals with T2D. If my hypo compass is more effective than proactive care management alone, it will offer healthcare systems and providers a practical approach to effectively reducing severe hypoglycemia in at-risk individuals with T2D. If proactive care management results in similar severe hypoglycemia prevention as my hypo compass, we will have a tool and evidence-based protocol for preemptively providing this standard of care to individuals with T2D most at risk for severe hypoglycemia.\n\n\u2022 Monitoring for potential drift through audio recording sessions and observation. After 2 months of observation, a Fidelity Monitoring Research Associate randomly reviews 10% of sessions, coding for intervention adherence using a standard protocol and returning results to intervention leads if there is significant drift. If nurses \"drift\" from protocols, we will add training and supervision and monitor until fidelity is established.\n\nWe are requesting two corrigenda to the published paper:\n\n1. The authors regret there was an error in the description of the analytic methods for the primary outcome. In section 2.10, the last sentence of the first paragraph states, \"Models will be fit using generalized estimating equations (GEE) and robust variance estimation to account for correlation due to patient clustering in clinics and the misspecified mean-variance relationship in using Poisson regression for a binary outcome.\" This sentence should read, \"Models will be fit using generalized estimating equations (GEE) and robust variance estimation to account for correlation due to patient clustering in the intervention arm within group training session cohorts, and the misspecified meanvariance relationship in using Poisson regression for a binary outcome.\"\n\nThe original trial design was a cluster randomized trial, with randomization at the clinic level. The original text was based on the cluster randomized design, and this methodology would have been appropriate because training cohorts would have been nested within clinics. Unfortunately, this text was not corrected when the trial switched to an individual level randomization due to a change in how the delivery system structured diabetes care.\n\n2. The authors regret there was an error in one of the values describing the power to detect a difference in the study's primary outcome. In section 2.11, the sentence reads, \"Assuming 60% of participants in the Proactive Care Management group self-report a severe hypoglycemia event in 12-month look-back, a trial with 204 participants (102 per group) will have 90% power to detect a 26.6% absolute difference between groups (i.e., 37.4% severe hypoglycemia rate in the my hypo compass arm) and 80% power for a 19.7% difference for the primary outcome\".
