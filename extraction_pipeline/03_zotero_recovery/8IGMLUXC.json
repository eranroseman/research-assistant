  "title": "A meta-analysis of techniques to promote motivation for health behaviour change from a selfdetermination theory perspective",
  "abstract": "A systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted of the techniques used to promote psychological need satisfaction and motivation within health interventions based on selfdetermination theory (SDT;  Ryan & Deci, 2017) . Eight databases were searched from 1970-2017. Studies including a control group and reporting pre-and post-intervention ratings of SDT-related psychosocial mediators (namely perceived autonomy support, need satisfaction and motivation) with children or adults were included. Risk of bias was assessed using items from the Cochrane risk of bias tool. 2496 articles were identified of which 74 met inclusion criteria; 80% were RCTs or cluster RCTs. Techniques to promote need supportive environments were coded according to two established taxonomies (BCTv1 and MIT), and 21 SDT-specific techniques, and grouped into 18 SDT based strategies. Weighted mean effect sizes were computed using a random effects model; perceived autonomy support g=0.84, autonomy g=0.81, competence g=0.63, relatedness g=0.28, and motivation g=0.41. One-to-one interventions resulted in greater competence satisfaction than group-based (g=0.96 vs. 0.28), and competence satisfaction was greater for adults (g=0.95) than children (g=0.11). Meta-regression analysis showed that individual strategies had limited independent impact on outcomes, endorsing the suggestion that a need supportive environment requires the combination of multiple co-acting techniques.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "Much of the potential for reducing the world's disease burden in developed countries lies in changing people's health behaviours. Lifestyle behaviours such as diet and physical activity are implicated in the development of disease states such as obesity, Type 2 diabetes, and metabolic syndrome, and changing these health behaviours can have as powerful an effect on health and wellbeing outcomes as the best available medical interventions  (Djouss\u00e9, Driver, & Gaziano, 2009; Irwin et al., 2008) .\n\nHowever, behavioural interventions have largely not lived up to this promising potential in the longer term as they have struggled to bring about the maintenance of behaviour change  (Avenell et al., 2004; Dombrowski, Knittle, Avenell, Araujo-Soares, & Sniehotta, 2014) . Evidence suggests that interventions that are grounded in behaviour change theory are more effective than those that are not  (Prestwich et al., 2014) , and thus research that helps us to enhance the effective application of theory to practice are warranted. Theory also helps to ensure that a systematic and comprehensive set of determinants are addressed linking to evidence  (Michie et al., 2016) , and is thus endorsed as part of best practice in intervention design  (Craig et al., 2008; Moore et al., 2015) .\n\nSelf-determination theory (SDT;  Deci & Ryan, 2000; Ryan & Deci, 2017)  has been highlighted as relevant to understanding the maintenance of health behaviour change  (Kwasnicka, Dombrowski, White, & Sniehotta, 2016) . SDT provides a framework for intervention development by setting out the necessary mechanisms of change that underpin changes in long term health behaviour (e.g., autonomy support, basic psychological needs and motivational regulations), and proposes techniques through which to influence these malleable constructs  (Fortier, Duda, Guerin, & Teixeira, 2012) . There is strong evidence for the efficacy of interventions based on SDT across a wide range of health domains including environmental behaviours  (Pelletier & Sharp, 2008) , tobacco dependence  (Williams, Niemiec, Patrick, Ryan, & Deci, 2009) , healthcare treatment adherence  (Williams, McGregor, Zeldman, Freedman, & Deci, 2004) , and physical activity  (Edmunds, Ntoumanis, & Duda, 2008; Wilson et al., 2006) . However, insight into how such effects are brought about is limited by poor specification of the intervention techniques employed (i.e., investigators may state that they provided an autonomy supportive environment without stating how they did so), and by a lack of information about the impact of specific techniques on the mediators of change proposed within SDT (e.g., need support and motivation); that is, it is often assumed techniques will have the hypothesised impact on mediators without this being explicitly tested. As such, the aim of this paper is to synthesize findings across approximately five decades of empirical work to review the techniques used in SDT interventions and systematically identify their effect on specified mediators of change."

      "title": "Self-determination theory",
      "text": "According to SDT, health behaviours are driven by a variety of motivations that vary along a continuum of autonomy  (Deci & Ryan, 1985; Ryan & Deci, 2017) . Intrinsic motivation, (acting for the inherent enjoyment of the activity involved) is the most autonomous form of motivation.\n\nHowever, when the health behaviour is not inherently enjoyable, one may still be autonomously motivated acting through integrated regulation (e.g., acting in line with one's own goals and values) and identified regulation (e.g., acting to obtain personally valued outcomes). When behaviour is not autonomous but driven by external forces (e.g., to avoid guilt or shame through introjected motivation, or in response to reward and punishment through external regulation) long-term health behaviour change is unlikely (e.g., see  Ng et al., 2012) .\n\nEngaging in behaviours for more autonomous reasons results in more adaptive health outcomes, including more positive well-being, and better behavioural adoption and maintenance  (Deci & Ryan, 2008) . More autonomous motivation is facilitated through the satisfaction of three basic psychological needs; autonomy (feeling that one is empowered and has choice), competence (feeling that one can be effective and capable), and relatedness (feeling close to, and valued by others)  (Ryan & Deci, 2000b) . However, as with the application of all theories into pracitce, the challenge for practitioners is knowing how to facilitate need satisfaction most effectively in terms of the specific techniques and strategies. A step change in facilitating this process has been brought about over the past decade through the development of taxonomies of behaviour change techniques."

      "title": "Taxonomies of behaviour change techniques",
      "text": "Taxonomies of behaviour change techniques for different health behaviours have been developed to more systematically describe, develop and test the active elements of behaviour change interventions  (Abraham & Michie, 2008; Michie et al., 2016)  and to describe the content and relational-based techniques of inter-personal counselling styles (e.g.,  Hagger & Hardcastle, 2014; Hardcastle et al., 2017; Lane, Huws_Thomas et al., 2005) . Within this approach, a behaviour change technique can be defined as \"an observable, replicable and irreducible component of an intervention designed to alter or redirect causal processes that regulate behaviour; that is, a technique is proposed to be an \"active ingredient\" (e.g., feedback, self-monitoring and reinforcement)\"  (Michie et al., 2013, pp82) . By using a standardised description of techniques, researchers are able to conduct more meaningful comparisons of interventions according to the components they include, and thereby identify which techniques, or clusters of techniques, show the most promise in bringing about behaviour change in and across different health settings  (Dombrowski et al., 2012; Gagnon, Forter, McFadden & Plante, 2018; Michie, Abraham, Whittington, McAteer, & Gupta, 2009; Williams & French, 2011) . The systematic specification of SDT-based interventions, specifically in relation to how practitioners can create a need supportive environment, has not been a core part of this process. While some of the techniques specified within other taxonomies do describe what SDT-based researchers are doing (given that there is often overlap between theories), there is not currently a systematic and consistent way of describing and analysing the content of SDT-based interventions. This paper sets out to clarify the techniques that can be used to translate SDT-based interventions into practice exploring whether these can be captured using existing taxonomies, and whether there are techniques that are unique to this theoretical approach.\n\nTo develop the most effective health interventions, researchers and health practitioners not only need a clear taxonomy of the SDT-based strategies that can be employed, but also need to know the efficacy of these strategies. Knowledge of the impact that strategies have on the mediating constructs (i.e., need satisfaction and motivation) is also important for theory expansion. To date there has been no investigation of the efficacy of SDT-based intervention strategies across studies and contexts on the proposed psychosocial mediators of behaviour change. Systematic and meta-analytic reviews that have been published provide support for the efficacy of autonomy (and/or other needs) support in promoting positive outcomes (e.g.,  Ng et al., 2012; Teixeira, Carra\u00e7a, Markland, Silva, & Ryan, 2012; Webb, Joseph, Yardley, & Michie, 2010) , but there are none to date that address the efficacy of the strategies that can be used to create such autonomy-(or need-) supportive environments. The purpose of this systematic and meta-analytic review is to provide researchers and applied practitioners with the knowledge of how to operationalise SDT in an applied health setting. Specifically, we sought to (i) identify, synthesise and document the range of techniques that have been used to promote autonomous functioning, as defined within SDT, and (ii) meta-analyse the efficacy of SDT-based techniques in bringing about change in need satisfaction and motivation within health interventions.\n\nThere is no one-size-fits all solution to health interventions, and intervention fidelity, design and how an intervention is delivered can vary widely and be important in predicting outcomes  (Hoffmann et al., 2014) . Therefore a third aim is to explore the factors that facilitate or moderate the effects of the identified techniques on the psychosocial mediators. To this end, characteristics of intervention design that have previously been shown to moderate the effectiveness of health interventions will be investigated. We will test two hypotheses: First, that in line with work in other domains the inclusion of multiple techniques will enhance the impact of an intervention  (Webb et al., 2010) . Second, that perceptions of autonomy support and need satisfaction will be stronger in groupbased interventions that harness support from both a facilitator and other group members than in oneto-one delivery of interventions  (Jordan, Holden, Mason, & Foster, 2010) . Two exploratory analyses were also conducted: Past work with children and adolescents has demonstrated that they may have greater demand for structure (i.e., clear communication of rules and guidelines, opportunities to meet or exceed expectations, informational competence-based feedback and predictability) in order to perceive a genuine sense of autonomy than adults  (Jang, Reeve, & Deci, 2010) . Such elements of structure may be perceived as controlling by adults. Therefore, to examine this possibility and other potential differences in how social environments are experienced across different developmental periods  (Ryan & Deci, 2002)  we compared the effects of SDT-based intervention techniques when conducted with children (age \u2264 17 years) and adults (age \u2265 18 years). Finally, given discussion regarding the impact on outcomes due to choice of control group  (Williams, 2010) , we also planned to test whether type of control group also moderated outcomes."

    {
      "title": "Identification of Behaviour Change Techniques",
      "text": "All studies meeting the inclusion criteria were reviewed independently by two researchers (FG and PR) to identify and code the specific behaviour change techniques listed. Where available, we referred to protocol papers and supplementary data files for additional information, and where information was not clear the authors were contacted to provide a more detailed breakdown of intervention content. The descriptions provided were matched against the v1 93-technique behaviour change taxonomy  (Michie et al., 2013)  and the Motivational Interviewing Taxonomy (MIT)  (Hardcastle, Fortier, Blake & Hagger, 2017) , referring to the detailed descriptions published in relation to each taxonomy. Where there is overlap between taxonomies (e.g., BCT v1 1.7 Review Outcome Goal and MIT 37 Review Outcome Goal) both codes were allocated. Techniques not captured by either taxonomy were attributed a new descriptor as an SDT specific technique.\n\nInterventions described by the authors as 'motivational interviewing' were coded as this alone; no attempt was made to then apply  Hardcastle et al. (2017)  taxonomy as our aim was not to judge the quality of MI delivery but investigate its impact on SDT-related outcomes.\n\nThe coders met to identify differences in coding and resolve differences in interpretation after coding of the first five studies; we found the process of fitting author descriptions according to SDT conventions to taxonomies not devised with this in mind to be challenging. For example, a frequently used technique to promote an autonomy supportive climate within the SDT literature is the provision of structure, but this can be facilitated in ways described by many existing techniques (e.g., goal setting, graded tasks, demonstration etc) as well as more relational activities (e.g., providing parameters within which choice can be made, so that choice is not overwhelming). Similarly, some SDT descriptors may overlap with other techniques but not match descriptions completely, for example 'listening' to participants is implicit within the MIT (e.g., technique 1, Open-ended questions), but not explicit (i.e., only if the practitioner demonstrates they are listening to the response). Thus, we engaged in an iterative process of comparing and discussing independently coded studies to arrive at the agreed set of codes for each. Reviewer agreement was calculated from the final 24 independently coded studies (K = .68) accepting any alternative from the agreed similar codes (e.g., BCT 1.7 Review Outcome Goals or MIT 37 Review Outcome Goal).\n\nAs our intent was to highlight how need support is being operationalised within practical settings, to render the presentation of this data meaningful we clustered the techniques identified using other taxonomies around the descriptions commonly given by study authors to broader SDT 'strategies', relating to original theoretical SDT texts (e.g.,  Deci & Ryan, 1985; Deci et al., 1994; Deci & Ryan, 2008) . While we acknowledge that a technique that supports one basic need may also impact others, we considered it useful to map techniques to specific needs. This method aims to support researchers and practitioners looking for ways to bolster particular needs and ensure they have designed a comprehensive intervention. The allocation of particular strategies to needs was determined through expert consultation, initial theoretical publications  (Deci et al., 1994; Deci & Ryan, 1985) , and author intent in the studies downloaded."

      "title": "Analysis",
      "text": "All analyses were computed on SPSS version 22 using Macros for computing weighted mean effect sizes published by  Lipsey & Wilson (2001) . Mean change scores for each study were obtained by subtracting pre-from post-intervention scores, and calculating the pooled standard deviation of change. Where full information was not available, the corresponding author was contacted with a request to supply the remaining data. The effect size for each study was calculated as the standardized mean difference between the change in the experimental and control groups using Hedges bias correction for small or uneven sample sizes (i.e. pooled standard deviation;  Hedges & Olkin, 1985) . For studies with multiple time points, the time point closest to 3 months (the most common time-frame for intervention) was used as the primary outcome. A composite score for autonomous regulation was computed for studies reporting individual regulations only where this was not provided (i.e., mean of intrinsic and identified regulations). Effect size statistics were further weighted by the inverse of the sampling error variance to account for more accurate estimates stemming from larger studies  (Hedges & Olkin, 1985) . A final estimate of effect for the entire sample of studies was then estimated through calculating a mean of the weighted effect sizes using a random effects model  (Lipsey & Wilson, 2001) . In line with recommended approaches  (Osbourne, 2013)  extreme outliers were identified when the Z-score exceeded 3.29 (indicating that the probability of obtaining this through random sampling is less than one time in a thousand;  Tabachnick & Fidell, 2007)  and removed from the analysis (k =4 of 330 data points). Effect sizes were interpreted through applying Cohen's criteria of small (0.2) medium (0.5) and large (0.8).\n\nThe homogeneity of estimates was assessed through a Q test (sum of weighted square differences from the group mean, distributed on a \u03c7 2 distribution;  Lipsey & Wilson, 2001) , and the I 2 index was then calculated to quantify the degree of heterogeneity (Huedo-Medina, S\u00e1nchez-Meca,  Mar\u00edn-Mart\u00ednez, & Botella, 2006 ). An analogue to ANOVA was used to partition the variance between and within groups to establish whether homogeneity is improved (i.e. value of Q reduced) by accounting for a priori grouping characteristics, thus potentially reducing the degree of unexplained heterogeneity between studies.\n\nMeta-regression analyses were conducted to explore the association between the presence/absence of specific techniques and study outcomes. To provide the broadest perspective of what facilitated need satisfaction, given that techniques may support multiple needs, where possible we regressed all identified SDT strategies against need satisfaction and motivation. This was not possible for relatedness given the smaller number of studies reporting this outcome, so in this case we restricted the analysis to just those techniques designated as primary contributors to this need (Table  1 )All techniques were entered simultaneously. As most studies included a number of strategies, the odds ratios of success (i.e., a significant improvement relative to control group) were computed for when 2, 3 or 4 or more strategies were reported to be used."

As the effects were thus largely similar for higher and lower quality studies, all were included in the moderator analysis. <Figures 2 -6> There was significant heterogeneity in outcomes between studies for all mediators.

However, the effects of group vs one-to-one delivery persisted for studies involving adults only; one-to-one interventions resulted in a weighted mean effect size for competence satisfaction of 1.03 (CI: 0.57, 1.50; k=15) versus 0.74 (CI: -.01, 1.49; k=6) for group interventions.\n\nType of control group: Forty-two studies (57%) compared interventions against a standard care or wait list control (i.e., no additional input provided). Four (5%) compared against need thwarting or controlling control conditions, and the remainder (28, 38%) provided alternative motivationally neutral input (e.g., information or advice beyond usual practice provided, but not in an autonomy supportive fashion). As may be expected, larger effect sizes were found for autonomy support and satisfaction in studies comparing interventions against need thwarting control conditions (Table  3 ).\n\nEffect sizes were also stronger when outcomes were compared against a neutral alternative intervention then to standard care or no treatment, except for competence satisfaction where the difference neared significance in the opposite direction (i.e., comparisons against neutral conditions were weaker than standard care)."

Given the lower numbers for relatedness, it was not possible to run the full analysis with all 18 strategies (R 2 approached unity), so only those theoretically loading onto relatedness (as shown in Table  1 ) were entered into the equation. As expected, the direction and strength of associations between strategies and outcomes was similar across needs. Autonomy satisfaction was only significantly positively predicted by the use of non-controlling language (\u03b2=1.86, p<0.05), but negatively predicted by involvement (\u03b2=-2.56, p<0.01). The only significant strategy in predicting competence was facilitating group co-operative tasks, although this operated in a negative direction (\u03b2=-1.52, p<0.01).\n\nConversely, relatedness satisfaction was positively predicted by facilitating group co-operative tasks (\u03b2=0.58, p<0.05) but negatively by involvement (\u03b2=-0.69, p<0.01) Autonomous motivation was positively predicted by the inclusion of a rationale for behaviour change (\u03b2=1.07, p<0.01), but negatively by structure (\u03b2=-0.75, p<0.01) and the provision of information (\u03b2=-1.17, p<0.01)."

      "text": "This meta-analysis is the first to undertake an evidence synthesis of the effect of practical techniques to operationalise SDT within interventions in health domains. It indicates that the techniques currently used in behaviour change interventions grounded within SDT have large, positive effects on perceptions of autonomy support and autonomy satisfaction, and moderate effects on competence satisfaction and motivation. While many approaches can be described using existing taxonomies of behaviour change or counselling style, 21 distinct techniques grounded in SDT theory were also identified. The findings for competence satisfaction in particular were moderated by whether interventions were delivered to children or adults (competence satisfaction was greater in interventions delivered to adults), and in groups versus one-to-one settings (in adults one-to-one settings resulted in greater competence satisfaction). The type of control group used also influenced the size, but not direction, of effects.\n\nA final aim of this meta-analysis was to explore the independent effect of individual techniques, to explore which may be necessary components for successful SDT-based interventions, as has usefully been conducted with taxonomies relating to other theoretical techniques  (Michie et al., 2009; Michie, Hyder, Walia, & West, 2011; Michie et al., 2012) . Based on the present set of studies, there was limited evidence for the importance of specific strategies, although the use of noncontrolling language appeared to be important for promoting autonomy satisfaction and the provision of a rationale important for promoting autonomous motivation. However, contrary to theory, several strategies (encouraging group activities, demonstrating involvement with a client, providing information and structure) were significant negative predictors of at least one outcome as will be discussed later."

      "title": "Moderation Effects",
      "text": "Based on existing data, adults and children perceived similar benefits from the SDT-based interventions in terms of autonomy and relatedness satisfaction, autonomous motivation and perceived autonomy support, although adults reported greater gains in competence satisfaction compared with no meaningful gain in children. No studies provided a direct comparison of effects using the same intervention in both age groups, so it is possible that this finding relates to inherent differences between interventions delivered to adults and children rather than between their responses to a similar intervention; most child interventions took place in school in a similar format to, or even within, a school physical or health education class. As such, children's feelings of competence may naturally draw on contextual levels of need satisfaction relevant to these commonly encountered settings (particularly if interventions are delivered by children's existing class teachers) rather than reflecting a response to a novel setting. Many adult interventions involved an attempt to adopt new or unfamiliar behaviours, for example becoming physically active after years of inactivity, cutting down on alcohol or learning to take medication for which participants may have much less previous or contextual information to draw on. This fits with a hierarchical model of motivation, suggesting that children's perceptions of social climates may be driven by stronger contextual-level factors as opposed to situational-level factors  (Vallerand, 2007) , and thus their need satisfaction is more difficult to influence. In addition, as many interventions included in this review were delivered in a 'one off' format, children may also not have time to shift their contextual beliefs  (Gillison, Standage, & Skevington, 2013) . However, research is needed to test these suppositions, and explore whether the difference between adults' and children's competence satisfaction reflects differences beyond novelty of the task. Past work that has measured adult and child need satisfaction within the same study has reported children to have higher levels of need satisfaction than their mothers (child M = 3.89 SD=0.45 vs mother M=2.36 SD=0.91), but this relates to cross-sectional observations and not their propensity for change (van der  Kaap-Deeder et al., 2015) .\n\nIn relation to other moderated effects, we found that interventions delivered in one-to-one settings resulted in greater competence satisfaction for adults than those delivered within groups. Only three studies attempted one-to-one interventions with children, so there is insufficient data to test if this is also the case for children. It would be useful to test whether greater competence satisfaction in one-to-one settings stems from factors beyond the greater opportunity for tailoring and provision of personalised feedback. Further research may also be valuable in exploring how competence support could be strengthened in group settings, and whether the most effective techniques to achieve this differ between settings. Exploring the finding that the facilitation of co-operative group tasks had a negative effect on competence satisfaction in the final meta-analysis would be a good starting point.\n\nThe final moderation effect showed that the type of control group influenced the size of effects, suggesting that attention to the nature of control groups is needed when interpreting study outcomes. Larger effect sizes were seen when need thwarting environments were induced as a comparator, and providing an alternative 'neutral' condition (i.e., absence of need support) also had larger effects than no treatment (e.g., wait list) controls. This may be as the people delivering standard care (e.g., school teachers, fitness advisors or clinicians) may naturally provide some degree of need support through their practice, and thus the difference between this and the active intervention may be less exaggerated."

      "title": "Coding SDT interventions using existing Behaviour Change Taxonomies",
      "text": "The process of coding SDT-based interventions according to existing taxonomies served to provide additional detail on how SDT has been operationalised in past work. Through using two existing taxonomies to code techniques at a more granular level than usually attempted, we identified 70 individual techniques that mapped to the 18 broader 'strategies' to which SDT-research typically refers. This process revealed the wide range of ways in which the same broad SDT strategies are operationalised, providing insight to others as to how they can be achieved. For example, the commonly stated strategy of 'providing a meaningful rationale' could encompass four techniques within the 93-item Behaviour Change Taxonomy's Natural Consequences grouping (see Table  1 ), but also encompassed rationales unrelated to health outcomes that may be better described in relational terms (i.e., or the motivational interviewing technique of 'Coming alongside', or showing respect to a client by explaining processes). There were 21 techniques that we did not feel were adequately encompassed by these existing taxonomies for which we suggest SDT-specific descriptors are required. Further investigation would be useful to explore what this additional level of specificity adds to the efficacy of outcomes; for example going back to the example of providing a rationale, investigating whether it matters what type of rationale is provided, so long as a rationale of some sort is present. Similar breadth of techniques were observed for other SDT strategies.\n\nAs we coded a total of 70 different techniques across taxonomies (plus 18 SDT-specific techniques), this also brought challenges for analysis in relation to assessing which have a greater impact on intended outcomes. To manage this process we therefore grouped the techniques into the SDT broader 'strategies' for meta-regression analysis. This approach is not without its limitations, as it may mask effects (both negative and positive) of different individual techniques within each group.\n\nNonetheless, some SDT strategies (such as providing structure) are necessarily broad descriptors to allow for specification as appropriate to the setting. For example, the structure you provide to children and adults for similar tasks would be different according to their experience and ability, and similarly the structure needed for simple versus complex tasks would differ. It is also possible that the coding of behaviour change techniques without concurrent verification that the techniques are delivered in a need supportive manner moves the coding process away from what is most pertinent to what SDTbased interventions are aiming to achieve; many behaviour change techniques (e.g., goal setting) could be delivered in either a controlling or an autonomy supportive manner and thus the technique itself may not be relevant, instead the language and approach used. A similar tension exists in the coding of such techniques from a motivational interviewing perspective (see the separation of codes into relational vs content elements in the motivational interviewing taxonomy used in our coding process;  Hardcastle et al., 2017) . However, by not coding content-related elements we risk overlooking the compelling findings from meta-analyses predicting behavioural outcomes that show consistent support for some specific content techniques (e.g.,  Michie et al., 2011; Greaves, Shephard, Abraham et al, 2011) , which may very likely contribute to participants' feelings of competence (e.g.,  Williams & French, 2011 ) and be a means of facilitating structured choice (i.e., choosing one's own goals). There may also be interactions between the amount of structure found acceptable, and people's preferences and expectations for choice and autonomy (i.e., their autonomy orientation). Taking each of these considerations into account, we felt that an initial exploration of the effect of techniques clustered into SDT strategies was the most theoretically coherent, inclusive and parsimonious means of dealing with the amount of data generated by the coding process."

      "title": "Performance of SDT strategies in predicting need satisfaction",
      "text": "The findings relating to the performance of specific strategies in promoting need satisfaction and motivation demonstrated a limited effect. This is not unexpected as SDT proposes that interventions should create a need supportive climate in order to bring about the internalisation of behavioural regulations  (Deci, Eghrari, Patrick, & Leone, 1994; Ryan & Deci, 2000b; Ryan & Deci, 2017) , in which it is implicit that such a climate is achieved by a combination of actions and communication styles. As such, the meta-regressions were not conducted as a means to identify stand-alone successful strategies, but to explore whether certain strategies may be particularly important to include among those implemented. The finding of very few significant predictors among strategies further confirms the limitation to considering need supportive environments as something that can be brought about through individual strategies. There was also no evidence that simply increasing the number of strategies resulted in stronger outcomes. This finding is similar to the assumptions behind motivational interviewing, in that there is a certain 'spirit' of motivational interviewing that is important, that is more than just the sum of its parts.\n\nOf the strategies that did significantly predict outcomes, two were as predicted by theory; non-controlling language significantly predicted autonomy satisfaction, and provision of a rationale predicted autonomous motivation. Conversely, involvement with participants (i.e., showing a personal interest in a person, use of affirmation etc) negatively predicted both autonomy and relatedness satisfaction. It is possible that this results from participants becoming reliant on that individual, or alternatively the finding may mask different effects of the 10 techniques subsumed within the strategy; this warrants further exploration. Facilitating group co-operation showed some contrasting effects; it loaded negatively onto competence satisfaction, but positively onto relatedness satisfaction. This suggests that participants experienced the positive feelings of belonging when taking part and interacting with others, but doing so may have undermined their individual sense of competence when apart from the group. Finally, the provision of structure and the provision of information both negatively predicted autonomous motivation. This may reflect that both of these strategies could be done in either an autonomy supportive or controlling manner (implying that in some studies in the present analysis they were experienced as controlling), and/or that they endorsed the feeling of the practitioner's position of authority in directing the behaviour change.\n\nWe noted during the process of extracting the techniques from intervention descriptions that there was a lack of detail in the reporting of some studies, and as a result it is likely that some techniques were present in the intervention but not identified as such in the description provided (e.g., the provision of social support). This will have reduced the specificity of our analysis. Nevertheless, we believe it is still useful to attempt to identify the most useful components within interventions to better understand how need supportive climates can be fostered, and improve the match between theory and practice in SDT-based research. The recent interest in using motivational interviewing as a means to provide need support  (Markland et al., 2005; Patrick & Williams, 2012; Vansteenkiste & Sheldon, 2006)  illustrates that there is demand for a defined, testable and trainable approach with which to deliver interventions that promote autonomous motivation in practice. The approach has been shown to be effective in bringing about change in variety of health behaviours  (Armstrong et al, 2011; Lundahl et al., 2013; O'Halloran et al.,2014; VanBuskirk, 2014) , and is attractive as it is a recognised clinical approach for which regulated training programmes are available. That is, it is clear what is being delivered, and people delivering interventions can be required to demonstrate a level of skill or qualification that helps to ensure minimum standards are met. The same systematic and consistent level of training is not typically provided by research studies implementing other behaviour change or SDT-based techniques. Limitations with the use of motivational interviewing include its lack of a theoretical foundation, such that the interpersonal contexts that promote positive outcomes through motivational interviewing may be better understood via the processes within SDT (e.g., basic need satisfaction and autonomous motivation;  Ryan & Deci, 2017) , and challenges in delivering it outside one-to-one settings and longer-term interventions (e.g., during school lessons, in group-based interventions). Thus, the results of this review aim to contribute towards a similarly standardised set of styles and techniques that could be reliably taught and understood by people working to promote health behaviours."

      "text": "This meta-analysis was limited by the comparability of studies. The intensity of interventions varied widely, ranging from experimental lab-based studies involving just one contact, to weekly group based treatment sessions lasting up to 12 months. The behaviours targeted varied from a comprehensive lifestyle change for weight loss, to tooth brushing or participation in physical education classes. With sufficient numbers, separate analyses differentiating health behaviour and setting would be informative; this is particularly the case for exploring the efficacy of the types of strategy most effective for each.\n\nWe explored the impact of risk of bias on outcomes through two sensitivity analyses, however there are other practical markers of study quality that we could have used that may have been insightful. For example, quality in terms of the treatment that participants receive could be assessed through taking account of the implementation of interventions according to their fidelity to protocol, participant attendance, or skill level of delivery teams. However, although his type of information is important, it is typically less reliably reported. Finally, the quality of reporting of the techniques used was often weak. For example, some researchers assume that there is tacit understanding of what terms such as 'autonomy support' mean, so provided only examples of the types of strategies used rather than a full list, and other authors did not report them at all. While every attempt was made to contact authors for clarification, we were not able to obtain this information for all studies. * We acknowledge that the three needs are interrelated, and thus, techniques may support more than one need. However, we have highlighted the primary need targeted by each; it is also implied that strategies fostering need support would also foster autonomous motivation. ** Incentives are not typically an SDT-based technique, but have been coded as these can be theoretically associated with decreased autonomy support. \u00b1 Techniques labelled as \"SDT(N)\" refer to occasions when the technique is described by authors as in column 2, the technique is listed again in column 3 to allow inclusion of the number of times the technique was listed to compare alongside techniques listed by other taxonomies.

The analysis of 74 intervention studies shows that the techniques in current use have the potential to bring about changes in the theoretical mediators of health behaviour change of a small (relatedness satisfaction and autonomous motivation), moderate (competence satisfaction) and large effect size (autonomy support and satisfaction). Positive effects are achievable in both children and adults and across a wide range of health domains. Moderation effects for the satisfaction of competence highlight that there may be particular need to bolster the focus of this need support provided in group settings and in interventions delivered to children in particular. Within the limits of the research available, there was little evidence that any individual techniques are independently predictive of successful need support, endorsing the suggestion that a need supportive environment requires the combination of multiple co-acting techniques."

      "description": "This review is the first to examine the techniques delivered within interventions to promote need satisfaction and autonomous motivation for health behaviour change, and examine their efficacy, based on literature spanning five decades. The analysis of 74 intervention studies shows that the techniques in current use have the potential to bring about changes in the theoretical mediators of health behaviour change of a small (relatedness satisfaction and autonomous motivation), moderate (competence satisfaction) and large effect size (autonomy support and satisfaction). Positive effects are achievable in both children and adults and across a wide range of health domains. Moderation effects for the satisfaction of competence highlight that there may be particular need to bolster the focus of this need support provided in group settings and in interventions delivered to children in particular. Within the limits of the research available, there was little evidence that any individual techniques are independently predictive of successful need support, endorsing the suggestion that a need supportive environment requires the combination of multiple co-acting techniques."
