  "title": "The effectiveness of nudges in improving the self-management of patients with chronic diseases: A systematic literature review \u0b1d",
  "abstract": "In this systematic literature review, we identify evidence on the effectiveness of nudges in improving the self-management of adults with chronic diseases and derive policy recommendations. We included empirical studies of any design published up to April 12 th , 2018. We synthesized the results of the studies narratively by comparing statistical significance and direction of different nudge types' effects on primary study outcomes. Lastly, we categorized the nudges according to their degree of manipulation and transparency. We identified 26 studies, where 13 were of high or moderate quality. The most commonly tested nudges were reminders, planning prompts, small financial incentives, and feedback. Overall, 8 of 9 studies with a high or moderate quality ranking, focused on self-management outcomes, i.e., physical activity, attendance, self-monitoring, and medication adherence, found that nudges had significant positive effects. However, only 1 of 4 studies of high or moderate quality, analyzing disease control outcomes (e.g., glycemic control), found that nudges had a significant positive effect for one intervention arm. In summary, this review demonstrates that nudges can improve chronic disease self-management, but there is hardly any evidence to date that these interventions lead to improved disease control. Reminders, feedback, and planning prompts appear to improve chronic disease self-management most consistently and are among the least controversial types of nudges. Accordingly, they can generally be recommended to policymakers.",

      "title": "1.. Introduction",
      "text": "Since 2008 a growing number of international organizations and government bodies worldwide have begun to apply insights from behavioral science to public policy  [1] . At the same time, the number of studies conducted by governmental behavioral science departments, or \"nudge units\" as they are known mainly in the United Kingdom and United States, increased tenfold between 2010 and 2016  [2] . According to Thaler and Sunstein  [3] , who introduced the concept in 2008, a nudge \"is any aspect of the choice archi-tecture that alters people's behavior in a predictable way without forbidding any options or significantly changing their economic incentives\".\n\nNudges are attractive to policymakers because they attempt to steer individuals in a desired direction, but by definition should be easily avoidable and not impinge upon freedom of choice  [3] . These features distinguish them from behavioral economic-informed coercive measures by the government such as smoking bans (socalled 'shoves') and regulatory interventions against the 'behavioral economic-informed harmful manipulation of consumers by private organizations' (so-called 'budges')  [4] [5] [6] . While nudges are not a new policy instrument  [7] , they were not implemented as frequently or systematically, nor were they described using the term \"nudge\" or with explicit reference to behavioral economics, before 2008. Although the extent to which nudges do indeed fully preserve freedom of choice and are compatible with libertarian attitudes is subject to debate, they are generally thought to be less intrusive than conventional policy instruments, such as legal regulations, taxes, or other substantial financial incentives  [8, 9] .\n\nCost-effectiveness studies on nudges are still sparse. Nevertheless, some of the first assessments of this nature suggest that nudges can be highly cost-effective compared to other public policy tools  [10] . In addition, it has been shown that nudges can be effective in several different contexts, for example in increasing workplace pension savings, tax payments, organ donations, and vaccination uptake  [2, 11, 12] . Finally, nudges do not necessarily compete with conventional policy measures, but rather can be used as complements to them  [13] .\n\nThere is evidence that improving the self-management of people with chronic diseases can prevent deterioration in patients' health and, in doing so, decrease future healthcare costs  [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] . Interventions consisting exclusively of information provision and education have been shown to be effective at improving self-management in chronic disease only to a limited extent  [20, 21] . Behavioral scientists ,[e.g.,  [20] [21] [22]  assume that this is due to the many decision biases people with chronic diseases face, such as ambiguity aversion  [23, 24] , omission bias  [25] , status quo bias (inertia)  [26, 27] , unrealistic optimism  [28] , hyperbolic discounting (present bias)  [29]  and loss aversion  [30] , leading them to behaving irrationally (see appendix: Table  4 ). They consider nudges to be a promising solution to counteract the adverse effects of these biases.\n\nEvidence on the effectiveness of nudges in improving certain health behaviors is growing  [31, 32] . To date, however, systematic reviews of nudges have focused primarily on nudge interventions designed to improve individual health behaviors within the realm of primary prevention, such as healthy eating, smoking cessation, reducing alcohol consumption, or increasing physical activity  [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] . To our knowledge, empirical evidence on the effectiveness of nudge interventions for enhancing the self-management of people with chronic diseases has not been synthesized in a systematic way. Filling this research gap is therefore the first objective of this paper. While different chronic diseases are comparable only to a certain extent, they share some common features, such as the lack of a cure, gradual disease onset and progression, and long-term consequences with uncertain prognoses  [40] . People with chronic diseases must self-manage their disease continuously and at the same time deal with emotional distress and constant uncertainty. Due to these commonalities, we considered it meaningful to analyze studies that evaluated the effectiveness of nudges designed to improve the self-management of any chronic disease, with the exception of mental disorders, as including these in their complexity and heterogeneity would have gone beyond the scope of our analysis.\n\nThe second objective of our paper is to explore possibilities for policymakers to implement nudge interventions aimed at improving the self-management of people with chronic diseases. Accordingly, we not only give a comprehensive overview regarding the effectiveness of the identified nudge interventions, but, by mapping them according to their degree of manipulation and transparency onto an existing theoretical framework, we also take into account that the implementation of specific nudge types could be controversial in democratic societies."

      "title": "2.1.. Nudge definition",
      "text": "Thaler and Sunstein's  [3]  definition of a nudge is difficult to operationalize, as it states only that nudges (e.g., defaults, reminders or planning prompts) lead to predictable change in human behavior and are different from significant economic incentives (e.g., taxes, deductibles) or regulation  [7] . Hausman and Welch  [41]  add further detail to this definition by emphasizing that nudges represent intentional attempts to prevent irrational decisions (e.g., nonadherence to medication, failure to implement lifestyle changes) by positively transforming the behavioral biases and heuristics upon which these are based  [9] . We rely upon this definition of nudge in our systematic review.\n\nConsequently, we were interested in any kind of nudge designed to intentionally influence the behavior of individuals in a specific decision situation characterized by biases or heuristics through the use of stimuli (for a list of relevant biases and heuristics for the self-management of chronic diseases see appendix: Table  4 ). Predictable changes we expected to find through the use of nudges are improvements in chronic disease self-management tasks, such as regular blood glucose monitoring, adhering to medication regimens, or implementing lifestyle adjustments, such as keeping to diet and exercising regularly.\n\nIn compliance with existing research  [9, 42] , we do not consider the mere provision of factual information to be a nudge. Nudges we expected to find for improving self-management behaviors of individuals with chronic diseases included defaults, behavior contracts, reminders, feedback, planning prompts (e.g., asking someone about his implementation intentions or goals), peer comparisons, social norms, social support, and information design nudges (e.g., framing, priming, simplification) [e.g. , 43] .\n\nSince Thaler and Sunstein  [3]  only exclude \"significant economic incentives\" in their definition of nudges, it is debated in the nudge literature whether, and which, financial incentives can be regarded as nudges [e.g., 44]. In line with several other researchers [e.g.,  [45] [46] [47] [48] [49]  we consider small, non-substantial financial incentives (including lottery incentives, escalating incentives or fixed financial incentives) to be nudges if they aim to prevent irrational decisions by exploiting behavioral biases such as hyperbolic discounting  [29]  or loss aversion  [30] ."

      "title": "2.2.. Search algorithm",
      "text": "We developed our search algorithm based on the PICOS framework (population, interventions, comparator, outcomes, study design)  [50]  (see appendix: Table  5 ).\n\nTo identify the population of interest, i.e., people with a chronic disease, we searched for the umbrella terms chronic disease, chronic condition, chronic illness, noncommunicable disease, and NCDs. Furthermore, we included additional specific search terms for common chronic diseases, i.e., cardiovascular diseases, cancers, chronic respiratory diseases (such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and asthma), diabetes, and muscoskeletal diseases (such as rheumatoid arthritis and back pain)  [51] .\n\nFor the selection of search terms for the intervention category, we piloted the search with the terms \"nudg*\", \"e-nudg*\", \"choice architect*\" and \"behavioral economic*\". After realizing that, with this search strategy, we missed many relevant studies, we revised the search algorithm and decided to include relevant terms of nudge subcategories in combination with the umbrella term \"behavioral intervention\", in addition to the original search terms. The problem that many eligible studies do not refer to nudges, but instead use nudge sub-category terms has been identified previously by other authors of systematic literature reviews on nudge interventions [e.g.,  33, 38] .\n\nTo develop a better understanding of relevant additional search terms in order to identify these studies, we consulted the literature on existing categorizations of nudges  [43, 46, 49] . We consider the MINDSPACE (Messenger, Incentives, Norms, Defaults, Salience, Priming, Affect, Commitment and Ego) framework to be the most relevant for identifying nudge subcategory terms, as it is a popular policy 'toolkit' for the implementation of nudges, and the included terms for nudge subcategories are commonly used in the nudge literature  [46] . In addition, we consulted Sunstein's list of the ten most important nudges  [43]  and the list of M\u00fcnscher et al. on choice architecture techniques  [49] . When comparing these two lists to the MINDSPACE framework, many similarities can be found. Based on the comparison of these categorizations, as well as our knowledge of the existing nudge literature, we included the following additional terms for nudge subcategories in our search: incentives, defaults, salience, affect, norms, messenger, priming, reminders, commitment, ego, feedback, peer comparison, alerts, and framing.\n\nThe outcomes we searched for were changes in selfmanagement behaviors (intermediate outcomes) and subsequent changes in disease control (end outcomes). According to Corbin and Strauss  [52] , self-management behaviors include medication and monitoring adherence, attendance (e.g., at screening visits, checkups, exercise sessions), lifestyle changes (e.g., increased physical activity), and the processing of emotions that arise from having a chronic illness. Disease control parameters are objective endpoints (such as hospital admissions or disease-specific indicators like glycemic control) that provide meaningful information about the progression of a chronic disease. In addition to improving disease control, changes in self-management behaviors can also have an impact on patient-related outcomes, such as health-related quality of life [e.g., 53]. However, such outcomes are not the focus of this review.\n\nTo identify studies analyzing the effectiveness of nudges on chronic disease self-management we searched for relevant nouns and verbs associated with self-management behaviors or behavioral changes. We also searched for general adjectives indicating an improvement/increase or a reduction/worsening. The search terms for the outcome category built upon the search strategy of Hollands et al.  [35] .\n\nSearch limits were only applied for the Web of Science database, where we excluded articles of irrelevant Web of Science categories, such as chemistry, astronomy, engineering, biology, or physics, which use the term nudge in different contexts. In the appendix (Table  5 ) we present the detailed search strategy for the MEDLINE (PubMed) database. A full list of stepwise search results for each search engine is available upon request from the authors."

We only included empirical research papers reporting on studies of any design, such as randomized controlled trials (RCTs), quasi-experimental studies, cohort studies, longitudinal studies, and cross-sectional studies.\n\nWe excluded reviews of existing evidence, duplicate reports, studies with an ineligible study design (e.g., pilot trials, study protocols, feasibility, descriptive/qualitative studies), and studies that analyzed an ineligible population (e.g., children, people without a chronic disease), focused on irrelevant outcomes (e.g., enrollment in a trial), or evaluated interventions that did not qualify as a nudge. Thus, we excluded studies analyzing other behavioral economicinformed measures, such as 'budges' or 'shoves'. Furthermore, we excluded interventions that focused on providers.\n\nWe did not restrict our search to any geographical or social setting, language, or length of follow-up."

These were the Behavioural Insights Team in the UK, the Social and Behavioral Science Team in the US, the Behavioural Economics Team of the Australian Government, the Ministry of Manpower in Singapore, and the Behavioural Insights Network Netherlands  [2] .\n\nAfter removing duplicates, two researchers (MM and MZ) independently screened the titles and abstracts of the obtained records to determine which papers should be retrieved in full text and assessed. In cases where we were unable to access the full text, we requested this from the authors via ResearchGate or email. Disagreements about the inclusion or exclusion of a paper were resolved by consulting a third researcher (JS)."

In the event of uncertainties or missing information on study characteristics, we contacted the study authors by email.\n\nTo judge the relevance of the identified studies for the research question, two researchers (MM and MZ) independently assessed the quality of the studies using the Effective Public Health Practice Project (EPHPP) Quality Assessment Tool for Quantitative Studies  [54] . As one of the tools recommended by the Cochrane Collaboration for evaluating the quality of primary quantitative public health studies, the EPHPP comprises component ratings of the extent of selection bias, study design, control of confounders, blinding of assessors and study participants, data collection methods, share of withdrawals and dropouts, intervention integrity, and appropriateness of data analysis  [55] . In compliance with the EPHPP guidelines, we summed our assessments of each of these components to form an overall rating of each study using one of the three categories strong, moderate and weak."

Instead, we compare the studies to each other in terms of the type of nudge intervention they assessed and the statistical significance and direction (positive/negative) of the effects they report for the primary outcome measure and synthesize these in a narrative fashion.\n\nIt has been disputed in the literature whether studies that receive a weak quality rating should be categorically excluded from the evidence synthesis of systematic reviews. The Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions  [55]  generally recommends that they should not be included. Other researchers have criticized this approach, however, as such studies might still contribute to the topic of concern, even though they come with a high risk of bias  [56] . We decided to report the findings of these studies in our results section while highlighting their rating, and to exclude them from the evidence synthesis and evidence base from which we derive policy recommendations."

Serving as the basis for the policy recommendations we set out in this paper, this classification differentiates between four types of nudges within two dimensions. The implementation of these nudges is the least controversial.\n\nThe implementation of these nudges is highly controversial in democratic societies.

The first dimension distinguishes between nudge types 1 and 2  [9] . Although both types address automatic thinking processes, type 1 nudges influence automatic thinking in order to change automatic behaviors, whereas type 2 nudges influence reflective choices by drawing attention to their specific aspects or affecting subjective assessments and premises. The second dimension distinguishes between transparent and non-transparent nudges  [9] . While it can be assumed that people recognize a transparent nudge itself as well as the intention behind it, the opposite is true for non-transparent nudges."

      "text": "Of the included 26 studies, three explicitly use the term \"nudge\"  [57] [58] [59]  and two others refer to the broader concept of behavioral economics  [60, 61] . Although the remainder refer only to sub-categories of nudges, we chose to include these because they match our definition of a nudge.\n\nTable  2  provides an overview of the number of included studies sorted by intervention type and primary outcome category. Among these, the most commonly studied nudges are reminders (n = 11), planning prompts (n = 9), small financial incentives (n = 8) and feedback (n = 5). Because many studies (n = 11) analyze the effects of more than one nudge type in different intervention arms or of combinations of different nudge types, the total number of nudge types exceeds the number of included studies. The most common primary outcomes are physical activity, disease control, and medication adherence. Most of the studies are concerned with improving the self-management of people with diabetes mellitus (n = 11), heart problems (n = 6), or respiratory diseases, such as asthma (n = 2) or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) (n = 2). Other chronic diseases like stroke, multiple sclerosis, HIV/AIDS, or severe food allergies are covered by one study each.\n\nTable  6  in the appendix gives an overview of the general characteristics of the studies, of which the majority were conducted in the US (n = 19). Besides the US, studies from Denmark (n = 2), Jordan (n = 1), Kenya (n = 1), Pakistan (n = 1), the Philippines (n = 1), and Portugal (n = 1) are included in the review. Furthermore, the most frequently used study designs are randomized controlled trials (RCTs) (n = 19), or slightly modified forms like one open RCT, one randomized experimental-control design or one mixed-methods RCT. In addition, two quasi-experimental designs, one follow-up study, and one retrospective cohort study are included in the review.\n\nTable  7  in the appendix shows the detailed characteristics of the nudge interventions analyzed in the included studies. Note: The total number of nudge intervention types exceeds the number of included studies, as many studies analyzed the effects of more than one nudge type or the effect of combinations of nudge types."

      "title": "3.2.. Quality of the included studies",
      "text": "We rate the quality of most of the included studies as either weak (n = 13) or moderate (n = 11). Only two studies receive a strong quality rating (see appendix: Table  8 ). Overall ratings of weak are due primarily to weak component ratings for selection bias, blinding or withdrawals, and dropouts.\n\nSelection bias is a major concern for all of the included studies. The majority of these studies recruited participants from hospitals and office-based practices. Participants recruited in this manner may be less likely to be representative of the target population. In many of the other studies, there was also a potential for selection bias due to low participation rates when recruiting participants from more comprehensive sources, for example through registries or insurance claims data. Furthermore, we give many studies a weak component rating for blinding, because the assessors and participants were not blinded to the intervention or the blinding procedure itself was not reported. Blinding participants to the research questions appeared to be difficult in many of the studies as the researchers had to obtain informed consent from them. It is unclear, however, whether participants' awareness of the research question would be problematic to begin with. Indeed, many nudges are transparent by nature, and evidence suggests that nudges work even if the people being nudged are informed about the interventions in advance  [62] . Furthermore, in liberal democracies, it might be more acceptable to nudge people in a transparent way or to obtain consent before nudging them subconsciously in a particular direction (see policy recommendations). Weak component ratings for withdrawals and dropouts resulted, in almost all cases, from the failure to report the number of dropouts and reasons for them."

In this category, we include studies that examine effects on blood glucose levels (HbA1c) (diabetes mellitus) (n = 6), time until first vascular readmission (heart disease) (n = 1), and an out-of-range international normalized ratio (below or above target range) accounting for poor anticoagulation control (heart disease) (n = 1).\n\nIn studies that use this outcome category, we rate the quality of one study as high  [79] , three studies as moderate  [61, 73, 78] , and four studies as weak  [64, 66, 71, 81] . The studies assess the effects of small financial incentives (n = 4), reminders (n = 3), planning prompts (n = 2), social support (n = 3), feedback (n = 1), behavior contracts and commitments (n = 1), and information design (n = 1). The majority of the studies (n = 6) do not find statistically significant differences between the intervention and control groups in this regard.

Even though these are validated, reliable, and commonly used measures of medication adherence, one needs to take into account that no ideal measure of medication adherence exists and each of these methods has potential caveats, which have been investigated elsewhere  [85] [86] [87] . We included the carrying of an epinephrine auto-injector (food allergies) (n = 1) in the category of medication adherence, as it is important for patients with food allergies to have this available at all times.\n\nThe majority of the studies (n = 4) find that the tested nudge interventions had statistically significant positive effects on med-Table  3  Overview of study results according to nudge type and primary outcome.\n\nSource: Authors' own representation.

      "text": "This systematic review provides an overview of evidence on the effects of nudging on the self-management of chronic diseases. The studies we identified are highly heterogeneous, both in terms of the design of the nudge interventions and the primary health outcomes. The findings of the studies are also mixed: Just over half find that nudge interventions lead to statistically significant improvements in self-management compared to the control groups. None of the included studies report statistically significant negative effects. Thus, all of the nudges examined in the included studies led either to improved chronic disease self-management or had no statistically significant effect in this regard. We find no systematic differences between the results of the studies whose quality we rate as weak compared to those whose quality we rate as moderate or high.\n\nTo our knowledge, this systematic review is the first to summarize and synthesize evidence on the effectiveness of nudges in improving tertiary prevention behaviors. Other systematic reviews, that look at nudge interventions designed to improve individual health behaviors, are either broad scoping reviews of general trends in the use of nudges -either domain-general [e.g., 32], in the field of primary prevention (e.g., diet, physical activity, alcohol and tobacco use  [35] ), or indication specific (e.g., diabetes mellitus  [88] ) -and disregard study quality, or they focus on primary prevention behaviors  [33, 34, 36, 37, 39] . In addition, our review is one of the few to consider studies that use nudge principles without referring explicitly to nudges or nudge theory. While other systematic reviews [e.g.,  33, 38 ] also encountered difficulties in identifying studies that examine nudge interventions without making reference to nudge theory, they did not expand their search terms to include subcategories of nudges as we did in our approach."

      "title": "4.1.. Evidence synthesis",
      "text": "Excluding studies with weak quality ratings left 13 studies, eight of which find that the respective nudge interventions have statistically significant positive effects on chronic disease selfmanagement (physical activity: n = 4; medication adherence: n = 2; self-monitoring: n = 1; attendance: n = 1). Four studies of high or moderate quality, however, find no statistically significant effects in this regard (disease control: n = 3; physical activity: n = 1). Furthermore, one high quality study finds statistically significant positive effects on disease control for one intervention arm and statistically non-significant effects for another.\n\nA comparison of intervention types indicates that the nudges that have been studied the most are reminders, planning prompts, financial incentives, feedback, and social support. For reminders, planning prompts, and feedback, the number of studies reporting statistically significant improvements in chronic disease selfmanagement was greater than the number of studies that did not find statistically significant effects (reminders: 5 out of 6; planning prompts: 3 out of 5; feedback: 4 out of 5). For financial incentives a slightly higher number of studies find non-significant effects, as opposed to significant positive effects (i.e., 3 out of 5). For social support, the evidence is balanced, with two studies finding statistically significant improvements resulting from the intervention compared to the control groups and two studies not finding any statistically significant differences. Due to the small number of studies and the heterogeneity of study designs and interventions, however, we cannot draw any reliable conclusions about differences in the effectiveness between the nudge types under study.\n\nIn general, we find no clear pattern in the various nudge interventions' designs that could explain why some interventions led to improvements in chronic disease self-management whereas others did not. For example, reminders led to statistically significant improvements in chronic disease self-management when implemented alone to improve medication adherence in stroke patients  [58] , in combination with feedback and social support to improve medication adherence in patients with coronary artery disease  [59] , and in combination with financial incentives to improve attendance for glucose screening in patients with diabetes mellitus types 1 and 2  [63] . However, another intervention, consisting of reminders combined with feedback, financial incentives, and social support (for disease control in patients with heart disease)  [61] , did not lead to statistically significant improvements in self-management.\n\nWe do find a pattern in the outcomes under study. While statistically significant positive effects are reported by the majority of studies of high or moderate quality that analyze the effects of nudge interventions on medication adherence, self-monitoring, attendance, or physical activity, the opposite is true for almost all of the studies that look at disease control outcomes. This finding is critical, as one of the main goals of improving the selfmanagement of chronic diseases is the slowing or stopping of disease progression. The consideration of disease control parameters is crucial, as they are objective endpoints that provide meaningful information about the progression of a chronic disease. In addition, compared to the primary outcomes reported in the other included studies, disease control parameters can be associated most directly with healthcare costs. An explanation for this finding could be that improving disease control parameters, such as HbA1c, is ambitious, as these tend to be long-term outcomes that can further be influenced by confounders like stress or hormonal fluctuations. Because of this, the median follow up time of six months in the included studies, looking at disease control outcomes, might be too short and a measurement at only one point in time is unsuitable for capturing the full effects of nudge interventions."

      "title": "4.2.. Limitations",
      "text": "This study has several important limitations. First, there is no general consensus in the literature as to what kind of behavioral interventions should be regarded as nudges. Many of the studies that examine interventions that fit our definition of a nudge do not explicitly use this term or even refer to the broader field of behavioral economics. A major challenge of our review was, therefore, to develop a search algorithm that could identify all of the potentially relevant studies. We attempted to address this by including search terms covering sub-categories of nudges, but we cannot be certain that these covered all studies that have looked at interventions based on nudge principles. Second, the studies we ultimately include in our analysis and evidence synthesis are highly heterogeneous in terms of their design, the nudge types tested, and the outcome measures. As a result, we are unable to conduct a metaanalysis or compare effect sizes across studies. Third, we assign half of the studies that met our inclusion criteria (n = 13) a weak quality rating mainly due to high risk of bias in their selection of study participants, their blinding of participants and assessors to the study interventions, and missing information on reasons for withdrawals and dropouts of study participants. We did not consider these studies when drawing conclusions or deriving policy recommendations from the results of our review. Lastly, the evidence on nudge interventions to improve the self-management of chronic diseases is still very sparse. Our conclusions and policy recommendations have been developed with this caveat in mind, but they must nevertheless be interpreted with care."

      "title": "4.3.. Implications for future research",
      "text": "Research on the effectiveness of nudge interventions is still in an early phase, as the concept of nudges as an instrument of public policy only gained popularity in 2008. This is reflected in the small number of studies included in this review that explicitly linked their intervention to behavioral economics or nudge theory. Nevertheless, since Richard Thaler received the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences for his work in the field of behavioral economics in 2017, we expect that the amount of research in this area will grow quickly.\n\nTo explore the potential of nudges to improve the selfmanagement of chronic diseases further, future research may want to take the following points into consideration:\n\nFirst, researchers should try to test the effects of different nudges separately within the same context. Individual nudge interventions should be tested first and only then combined with different types of nudges, added in a stepwise fashion, to allow the effects to be disentangled. Furthermore, measuring outcomes continuously over a longer period of follow-up will generate stronger evidence, particularly for disease control outcomes. Long-term interventions can also lead to improvements in this regard.\n\nSecond, the studies we identified did not explore potential negative side effects, such as crowding out effects on intrinsic motivation, habituation effects, or effects occurring after the removal of nudges. Future studies of nudges and chronic disease self-management should consider that any intervention can have unintended consequences.\n\nThird, when designing and evaluating nudge interventions to improve the self-management of chronic diseases, it is important to understand disease control as a continuum. Different biases and heuristics are relevant at different stages of disease control  [21]  (see appendix: Table  4 ). Accordingly, nudge strategies will probably vary in their effects at different stages along this continuum. Evidence suggests that primarily a distinction needs to be drawn between the initial phases of disease control and continued disease control. Because insecurity and a lack of self-efficacy are common during the former, the corresponding nudge strategies might want to focus on planning prompts and social support, in order to help the individual realize that it is possible to gain control over their chronic condition  [21] . At a later stage, the main challenge is to keep the individual motivated so that they will continue the efforts needed to control the disease over the long term. In this phase, nudges should focus on reminders and feedback.\n\nLastly, it would be useful to gain a better sense of whether the effectiveness of nudge interventions differs according to personal and cultural characteristics such as gender, age, ethnicity or religion, and the extent to which the interventions are grounded in theory."

      "title": "5.. Policy recommendations",
      "text": "Although the evidence is still sparse, the results of our systematic literature review suggest that nudges may be an effective policy tool to improve the self-management of people with chronic diseases. When implementing nudges, however, there are a few things that policymakers might want to consider. Although surveys suggest that public acceptance of nudges is generally high in industrialized Western democracies like Australia, Canada, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, and the United States, ethical concerns remain, particularly in regards to the potential for manipulation  [89, 90] . In the literature on the ethics of nudges, it is disputed whether, and to what extent, nudges restrict the decisionmaking autonomy of individuals  [91, 92] . Although they generally preserve the individual's freedom of choice, nudges can also be designed to exert subconscious influence that goes unnoticed by the individual and may limit his or her decision-making autonomy  [93] . Health policymakers should therefore ensure that nudges are used in a responsible and transparent manner that is compatible with democratic values.\n\nWith this in mind, it is also important to consider that nudges differ in terms of their intrusiveness and the extent to which they can manipulate choices or behaviors  [9] . In Fig.  2 , we map nudge interventions from the moderate-and high-quality studies, included in our literature review, to the Framework for the Responsible Use of the Nudge Approach to Behaviour Change in Public Policy, which is explained in greater detail in the methods section of this paper. When sorting the nudge interventions according to their degree of transparency and the enabling of choice, we faced the problem of dealing with complex interventions that could not clearly be attributed to one category [cf. 9]. We addressed this by giving the more intrusive nudges more weight (e.g., an intervention including one transparent and one non-transparent nudge was classified as non-transparent).\n\nIt becomes apparent that all the identified studies focus on type 2 nudges designed to influence (reflective) choices of individuals. We categorize eight of the nudge interventions as \"nontransparent, type 2 nudges\". These consist of interventions that relied on fixed financial or lottery incentives. The lottery incentives, in particular, are considered by Hansen and Jespersen  [9]  to be manipulative, as people are likely to overestimate the chance of winning. While the fixed financial incentives are less manipulative in this regard, they still make use of subconscious decision biases such as the loss aversion \u00f6f individuals -i.e. the fact that individ-uals perceive losses worse than profits -at least in some contexts  [100] . In addition, fixed financial incentives can lead, unnoticeably, to a substitution of goals and could thereby undermine the individual's intrinsic motivation to manage their chronic disease. \"Non-transparent type 2 nudges\" are considered highly invasive and paternalistic (maybe even more so than traditional policy tools) because their influence is often not recognized  [9] . These nudges unconsciously manipulate reflective thinking processes and are therefore unavoidable. Implementing these nudges, especially the lottery incentives, cannot be recommended to healthcare policymakers as they are highly controversial in democratic societies.\n\nThe majority of the nudges we identify can be categorized as \"transparent type 2 nudges\", however, as they consist of interventions such as reminders, feedback, goal-setting and implementation plans, and behavioral contracts, they only draw the attention of individuals to their own behaviors and the consequences of these, and are the least intrusive as they do not impinge upon individuals' freedom of choice. These nudges are the least controversial and can be recommended to policymakers. Indeed they are so trivial that they are often not even recognized as nudges by nudge critics  [9] .\n\nIn conclusion, many of the moderate-and high-quality studies included in our systematic review find that the investigated nudges significantly improved direct self-management outcomes, such as increasing physical activity, attendance (e.g., at screening visits), self-monitoring, and medication adherence in people with chronic diseases. However, almost none of the included studies find that nudges had significant effects on disease control outcomes like HbA1c or rates of rehospitalisation. Thus, nudges appear to be effective for improving chronic disease self-management, but these changes might not be substantial enough to affect disease control within a short observation period. Reminders, feedback, and planning prompts have been shown to improve chronic disease self-management most consistently. They also belong to the least controversial category of nudges and can therefore be recommended to policymakers. However, unless the evidence base grows to prove otherwise, policymakers should not have overly high expectations of how effective nudges can be in improving chronic disease control."
