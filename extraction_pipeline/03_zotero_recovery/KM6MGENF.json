  "title": "Culturally adapting internet-and mobile-based health promotion interventions might not be worth the effort: a systematic review and meta-analysis",
  "abstract": "Health promotion interventions offer great potential in advocating a healthy lifestyle and the prevention of diseases. Some barriers to communicating health promotion to people of certain cultural groups might be overcome via the internet-and mobile-based interventions (IMI). This systematic review and meta-analysis aims to explore the effectiveness of culturally adapted IMI for health promotion interventions among culturally diverse populations. We systematically searched on Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL), EbscoHost/MEDLINE, Ovid/Embase, EbscoHost/PsychINFO, and Web of Science databases in October 2020. Out of 9438 records, 13 randomized controlled trials (RCT) investigating culturally adapted health promotion IMI addressing healthy eating, physical activity, alcohol consumption, sexual health behavior, and smoking cessation included. From the included studies 10,747 participants were eligible. Culturally adapted IMI proved to be non-superior over active control conditions in short-(g = 0.10, [95% CI -0.19 to 0.40]) and long-term (g = 0.20, [95% CI -0.11 to 0.51]) in promoting health behavior. However, culturally adapted IMI for physical activity (k = 3, N = 296) compared to active controls yielded a beneficial effect in long-term (g = 0.48, [95% CI 0.25 to 0.71]). Adapting health promotion IMI to the cultural context of different cultural populations seems not yet to be recommendable given the substantial adaption efforts necessary and the mostly non-significant findings. However, these findings need to be seen as preliminary given the limited number of included trials with varying methodological rigor and the partly substantial between-trial heterogeneity pointing in the direction of potentially useful culturally adapted IMI which now need to be disentangled from the less promising approaches.",

      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "Health promotion interventions are an effective way of disease prevention and improving overall health  1, 2  . Well-established approaches focus amongst others on healthy eating, exercising, avoiding excessive use of alcohol, quitting smoking, and sexual health behaviors, such as condom use  3, 4  . Promoting these health behaviors on a large scale by using health promotion interventions might be a promising mean for reducing the burden of disease  [5] [6] [7]  . However, these intervention offers do not always reach or fit populations equally between and within countries  8  .\n\nThe reach of these interventions could be expanded globally via the internet  9  using the Internet-and mobile-based interventions (IMI)  [10] [11] [12] [13] [14]  . IMI offers time and place flexibility, potential costeffectiveness, and scalability without necessarily losing effectiveness  15  . Thereby, IMI could reach a diverse group of people including minorities and people of a cultural background that is not yet well covered by the established health care systems  [16] [17] [18] [19]  . However, IMI also come with some substantial limitations, most prominently risk of low adherence and uptake  20, 21  . In order to tackle these issues, population-related factors such as the needs and expectations of the users should be taken into account  15  . Tailoring the intervention content and delivery method to the target group's culture can thus be a means for increasing engagement and effectiveness  22  .\n\nResearchers in the field of health promotion are encouraged by WHO to approach their practice and research considering diverse human experience and intersectionality of various factors, including culture, gender, immigration status, and ethnicity, which may be related to lower physical and mental health  [23] [24] [25]  . In order to offer an acceptable and relevant health service to people of a certain cultural background, health promotion interventions could be developed from scratch with cultural sensitivity or a less resource-consuming way can, for example, be tailoring an already existing intervention for specific cultural groups  26  . This process is defined as cultural adaptation  27  . Cultural adaptation could be adopted on surface structure modifications (pairing materials and messages to apparent features of the target population such as language) or deep structure modifications (concerning intersecting effects of social, cultural, and historical variables on the target behavior)  28, 29  . Culturally adapted face-to-face interventions are shown to be effective in smoking cessation  30, 31  , health education, and healthy eating  32  . Moreover, IMI developed for ethnic minorities and underserved populations are also shown to be accepted and effective in the promotion of various health behaviors such as physical activity  33  and healthy eating  16  .\n\nPrevious reviews included IMI for ethnic minority and historically underserved populations in developed countries  22, [34] [35] [36]  . However, none of them specifically examined culturally adapted IMI for health promotion. The number of studies exploring the development and dissemination of culturally adapted health promotion IMI is increasing and thus a systematic review and meta-analysis seems timely. Hence, this review aims to systematically identify culturally adapted IMI on health promotion and explore their effectiveness among populations that is different from the original intervention's target group."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review and metaanalysis that assessed the effectiveness of culturally adapted IMI on health promotion among populations which the intervention was originally not developed for. Our results suggested that culturally adapted IMI are not more effective in promoting health behaviors than active conditions in short-(g = 0.10) and long-term (g = 0.20), respectively. When regarding health promotion topics separately, health promotion of physical activity resulted in a small to moderate effect favoring culturally adapted IMI over active  control conditions in the long-term (g = 0.48). This is in line with a previous umbrella review of health promotion IMI for minority and historically underserved populations, which, however, not exclusively included culturally adapted IMI  22  . Similarly, another metaanalysis of IMI concerning physical activity did highlight the superiority of IMI over a control group or no-treatment condition, without a specific focus on culturally adapted interventions  14  . No other significant effect was revealed for the other addressed health promotion topics. Subgroup analyses aiming to detangle the substantial between trial heterogeneity were not feasible. Heterogeneity among the included studies was moderate to substantial, I 2 ranged from 0.36 to 0.66. Prior research points to differential effects on culturally adapted health promotion interventions in terms of different populations (age and ethnicity  51  ), different intervention features (professional vs. non-professional provider)  32  , intervention duration and follow-up times in culturally adapted face-to-face interventions  52  , interventions focusing on general population groups  53  , different methodological decisions (RCT methodology use, different control groups, e.g. tailored website, no-treatment controls  53  ) and cultural adaptation contents (inclusion of social support and/or family members  51  , integrating cultural beliefs and values  54  ). There might be further possible explanations for between-study heterogeneity, and future research needs to provide a better understanding of the impact such factors have on the effectiveness of culturally adapted IMI for health promotion. The present findings are inconsistent with previous meta-analyses on IMI in several ways. Among western populations, these meta-analyses yielded positive effects favoring IMI compared to a waitlist and/or active controls (e.g. other internet-based or face-to-face interventions): for smoking cessation and abstinence outcome  10, 55  , which is maintained at 12-month follow-up  56  and higher effects achieved with the use of tailored messages  10, 13  ; healthy eating  [57] [58] [59]  and weight loss  60  ; sexual health behavior promotion  61  and regarding HIV prevention and condom use  62  . Another meta-analysis found significant positive effects of tailored (based on personal relevance) web-based interventions on health behaviors compared to non-tailored web-based interventions  53  and a different meta-analysis of SMS-based interventions on various health behavior outcomes suggested that targeted and tailored (based on demographic and psychosocial factors) SMS yielded larger effect sizes, especially for physical activity interventions (g = .51), which yielded a similar effect size to our results (g = 0.48)  10  . Most surprisingly in this context is our null-finding regarding the effectiveness of culturally adapted IMI compared to waitlist control conditions, which are known to provide a rather upper benchmark of the benefit of interventions  63  , usually associated with significantly larger between-group effect sizes in IMI for health promotion as well  10, 13, 64  . Although some of the meta-analyses mentioned above concern tailored intervention contents, none of the above-mentioned meta-analyses were specifically examining culturally adapted IMI. Therefore, our results cannot be easily compared with prior meta-analyses. However, if culturally adapted IMI for health promotion are not effective at all, even when compared to waitlist controls, we might need to challenge the idea of providing culturally adapted IMI to populations for which the intervention was originally not developed for at large and examine whether IMI developed with cultural sensitivity are effective in the same target groups. Hence, explanations for this surprisingly limited effectiveness seem warranted.\n\nOne possible explanation of our results might be related to the quality of cultural adaptation of the interventions. The cultural adaptation processes were rarely well defined in the included studies. Therefore, it was not clear whether aspects of cultural adaptation were appropriate. In addition, the high dropout among included studies could be an indicator of cultural adaptation not\n\nTable 2 continued 1st author (year) Name Language Target group Ethnicity Health promotion Cultural adaptation theory Cultural adaptation components original IMI original IMI original IMI original IMI original IMI adapted IMI adapted IMI adapted IMI adapted IMI adapted IMI Montag (2015) e-CHUG English General population US American Alcohol consumption Focus groups Content (pictures, logo, color of the layout, example characters, myths) -added video (verbal tradition)language (not a translation but wording and simplifying) eCHECKUP TO GO English General population (women) American Indian/ Alaska Native (AIAN) Alcohol consumption Peiris et al. 49 QuitTxt English General population Australian Smoking cessation Formative research with the expert user group Adaptation of the content and tone of the messages based on the attitudes of the target group towards smoking Can't Even Quit' English General population Australian/Aboriginal/ Citizen of Torres Strait Island Smoking cessation\n\nworking as intended by the researcher. Moreover, only three studies based their cultural adaptation process on a theory, which might contribute to its quality. A tested theory of cultural adaptation of IMI is missing. However, there are guidelines developed for culturally adapting face-to-face interventions  28, 65  and researchers could implement these guidelines when adapting an IMI  66  . A recent taxonomy of cultural adaptation of IMI for mental disorders serves as a basis for future cultural adaptations of IMI  67  . Adopting a theoretical basis in intervention development is suggested to result in higher effects, as was shown in a metaanalysis  14  . However, this could not be shown in our results: only one out of the three IMI that utilized a theory of cultural adaptation resulted in an improvement in physical activity outcome  38  . In the future, culturally adapted intervention studies should consider supporting cultural adaption with an established theory and report the adaptation process in more detail to lead prospective cultural adaptations and replications. In the process of cultural adaptation, some of the included studies sought expert reviews, focus group feedback, and conducted a pilot study, and at least altered one aspect of the intervention. However, the majority of the changes were regarded as taking place only at the surface structure  28  , which might be one reason for the limited impact of culturally adapted IMI shown in the present review. Surface structure changes aim at improving feasibility while deep structure changes target program's effect for the participants  28  .\n\nImplementing deep structure changes involves core cultural values of a certain population, such as beliefs towards a health issue, or performing a behavior as a member of gender identity. A meta-analysis of face-to-face culturally adapted health interventions showed that incorporating family members and religious values, which are considered as deep structure changes, in the intervention was related to improvements  31  . Future research should consider exploring surface versus deep structure alterations on the effectiveness of IMI e.g. in the framework of dismantling and additive clinical trial designs aiming at detangling active components and mechanisms of change of the respective interventions  [68] [69] [70] [71]  . Moreover, culturally adapting interventions is not free from criticism. It should be taken into account that the majority of the interventions developed in the fields of psychology and behavioral medicine are for a rather homogeneous group (white, educated, middle to high socioeconomic status) but not representative for the majority  19, 72  . In the cultural adaptation process, the same intervention is often altered to cater to the needs of a different group of people that are non-white, occasionally less educated, and/or bilingual. This process could be seen as a form of assimilation for the target group because even the topic of the intervention might also be representative of western, white, educated humans  1  . Therefore, in order to avoid these issues, the first step of cultural adaption might include approaching the problem and defining it with the cultural sensitivity of its target group  73  . In addition, people of a certain cultural background are not homogenous within themselves, each member's experience is affected by intersecting factors  74  . Therefore, it might be more complicated than often expressed to adapt an intervention for a cultural group  75  . One possible solution might be to invest in adapting interventions to cultural specifics of the users, e.g. based on user needs assessments  76  or community leaders' input  77  . Another solution, especially for migrant/immigrant populations could be developing interventions based on the target groups' acculturation levels, i.e. a process on a spectrum of either orientation to the host culture or maintaining the native culture  1, 76  . It seems also worthwhile to pay attention to intersecting factors that might influence a member of a cultural group, namely gender and literacy. However, we first need to establish whether to culturally adapt health promotion IMI at all. The present findings at least suggest-except for physical activity IMI-a non-favorable cost-benefit ratio, a result that still is in need of stronger evidence.\n\nAnother topic of relevance to our findings is the reach, uptake, and intervention adherence of culturally adapted IMI. Even if such IMI would be effective, they still need to be used in order to exploit their full potential. Although internet technologies are widely used globally  78  , there are still barriers to utilizing these technologies, which cause inequalities in accessing the internet and mobile technologies and comprehending health information  16, 79, 80  . Moreover, pure mobile-based interventions are seemingly less effective than internet-based or combined interventions  [81] [82] [83]  , which might also affect for instance minority populations, where they are more likely to use a smartphone to access the internet than non-minority populations where multiple device (e.g. tablets, desktops) ownership is common  84  . To increase adherence, multimodal content and guidance (direct contact with the provider)  85  might be useful via diminishing issues of health literacy, motivational and volitional aspects, and the digital divide  71, 86, 87  . These aspects might be particularly important in people of certain cultural backgrounds living in a high-income country, people living in low-income countries, and/or vulnerable populations, such as immigrants, given the limited representation of many of these populations in the health research, and high rates of drop-out  86, [88] [89] [90] [91]  .\n\nThis review has some limitations. First, we included interventions concerning only five prominent areas of health promotion thus results might not be generalizable to other health promotion domains. Second, the definition of cultural adaptation varies, and our operationalization of culturally adapted interventions resulted in the exclusion of studies that investigated IMI that were developed newly in a culturally sensitive way. Comparison of culturally adapted vs. culturally sensitive interventions is an interesting further research topic. Moreover, comparing culturally adapted versus culturally sensitive IMI might present insights into whether it is worthwhile to develop a novel IMI for a group or adapt an already existing one. Third, we were able to pool data from only 13 studies, which further limit the generalizability of our results. Due to this limited evidence base, analyses were restricted to the main research questions while analyses were not feasible yet. Future updates might allow for exploring the between-study heterogeneity highlighted in the present review, while the findings reported here could guide researchers in what to examine next. In this context, we suggest adding generic outcomes such as health-related quality of life, daily functioning, or self-efficacy to domain/disease-specific outcomes to allow for Fig.  2  Risk of bias graph. Reviewers' judgments about each risk of bias item presented as percentages across all included studies. cross-trial cross health promotion domain comparisons in the future. Fourth, although the studies included in this meta-analysis were culturally adapted, the adaptation process was rarely well defined. Fifth, only three out of 13 studies used a theory to adapt the intervention. And last, none of the studies were comparing culturally adapted IMI to non-adapted IMI. This creates a difficulty to draw any firm conclusions about the differential effectiveness of culturally adapted interventions. Despite these limitations, this meta-analysis had some strengths. To our knowledge, this is the first meta-analysis concerning culturally adapted health promotion IMI. Moreover, this a-prior registered systematic review included mostly scientifically sound RCTs from a broad sample and health behavior topics. A summary of recommendations for future research is represented in Box 1."

      "text": "For each study, a standardized mean difference (SMD) and 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated with mean scores of intervention and control groups. In order to decrease the bias of small samples, Hedges' g was calculated  98  . Effect sizes were recoded when higher scores of an outcome assessment indicated worsening results (e.g. BMI and level of alcohol consumption). For continuous outcomes, Hedges' g and 95% CIs were reported; for dichotomous outcomes, odds ratios and CIs were reported. Random effects model was chosen for analyses due to an expected diversity among IMI of health promotion, sample size, and duration of intervention among studies  99  . Data were pooled to calculate a standardized mean effect size for each outcome and a forest plot with 95% CIs, in the case of at least three studies reporting the respective outcome. Otherwise, results were presented descriptively. Sensitivity analysis was planned to assess the impact of studies with a high risk of bias. Analyses were performed in R package meta and metafor, and Review Manager 5 100-103 . Continuous effect sizes were categorized along with Cohen's rule of thumb with 0.20 considered a small effect, 0.50 medium effect, and 0.80 large effects  104  . In order to assess publication bias, we planned to conduct funnel plots.\n\nStatistical heterogeneity among studies was analyzed with the I 2 statistics  97, 105  . Statistical heterogeneity refers to the variability among effect sizes in a meta-analysis 106 . However, the veracity of measures of heterogeneity is arguable; therefore, their interpretation should be made with caution  97  . Statistical heterogeneity was calculated with the I 2 test for each outcome domain. Heterogeneity I 2 \u2265 60% was regarded as substantial heterogeneity, in which case no pooled effect sizes are reported. Subgroup analyses were planned to explore possible sources of Fig.  7  Summary of culturally adapted IMI for smoking cessation vs. active controls in short-term. Three studies reported smoking cessation outcomes measuring short-term abstinence at the end of the intervention vs. active controls are presented on the forest plot.\n\nBox 1 Recommendations for future research 1. Improve evidence on whether culturally adapted IMI for health promotion are indeed not effective at all, even when compared to passive control conditions. 2. Provide a better understanding of the impact of population and intervention characteristics on the differential effects of culturally adapted IMI for health promotion.\n\nIf culturally adapted IMI are effective at least compared to passive control conditions (see 1.) and/or at least with regard to some subgroups (see 2.): 3. Improve evidence on whether culturally adapted IMI are effective compared to active control conditions. 4. Particularly compare culturally adapted IMI with the respective nonadapted versions or simple language translations of the IMI. Ultimately, the substantial effort necessary for adapting IMI culturally might only be justified in case of clinically significant superiority of the culturally adapted versions compared to active controls. In case this is given (see 3./4.)-at least with regard to some subgroups (see 2."
