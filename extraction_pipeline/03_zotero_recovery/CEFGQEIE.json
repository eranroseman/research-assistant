  "abstract": "IMPORTANCE COVID-19 has highlighted widespread chronic underinvestment in digital health that hampered public health responses to the pandemic. Recognizing this, the Riyadh Declaration on Digital Health, formulated by an international interdisciplinary team of medical, academic, and industry experts at the Riyadh Global Digital Health Summit in August 2020, provided a set of digital health recommendations for the global health community to address the challenges of current and future pandemics. However, guidance is needed on how to implement these recommendations in practice. \n OBJECTIVE To develop guidance for stakeholders on how best to deploy digital health and data and support public health in an integrated manner to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics. \n EVIDENCE REVIEW Themes were determined by first reviewing the literature and Riyadh Global Digital Health Summit conference proceedings, with experts independently contributing ideas. Then, 2 rounds of review were conducted until all experts agreed on the themes and main issues arising using a nominal group technique to reach consensus. Prioritization was based on how useful the consensus recommendation might be to a policy maker. FINDINGS A diverse stakeholder group of 13 leaders in the fields of public health, digital health, and health care were engaged to reach a consensus on how to implement digital health recommendations to address the challenges of current and future pandemics. Participants reached a consensus on high-priority issues identified within 5 themes: team, transparency and trust, technology, techquity (the strategic development and deployment of technology in health care and health to achieve health equity), and transformation. Each theme contains concrete points of consensus to guide the local, national, and international adoption of digital health to address challenges of current and future pandemics. \n CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE The consensus points described for these themes provide a roadmap for the implementation of digital health policy by all stakeholders, including governments. Implementation of these recommendations could have a significant impact by reducing fatalities and uniting countries on current and future battles against pandemics.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted weaknesses in global health care delivery systems and public health responses, particularly the long-term national underinvestment in digitization.  1 Many found it surprising that health care data still predominantly exist in silos and are not easily accessible among health care systems because of human and technical factors (ie, little collaboration between teams and a lack of interoperability) and a lack of integrity (thereby compromising trust in those data), and they are underpinned by redundant or not-fit-for-purpose technology. It also became clear that health care data are unequally available across the world, ultimately compromising the quality of health outcomes for individuals and society. At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, digital health care was highly fragmented in its support of population health, health systems, and individual patient management at the local, national, and international levels. The collection of data for public health surveillance was irregular owing to a historic lack of investment in digital technology,  2  and few countries or communities had pandemic preparedness plans that enabled them to rapidly expand their data capture abilities to accurately monitor and track key outbreak information.  3 Contact tracing had previously relied heavily on analog systems and could not be scaled up rapidly.  4 These shortcomings, in turn, limited countries' abilities to develop informed public health policies, plan appropriate and timely responses, or coordinate action. Illustrating this point, the New York Times called reliance on fax machines a \"bottleneck\" in the US's coronavirus response.  5 Similarly, in Australia, the second wave of infections sent Melbourne into strict lockdown when contact tracing teams were overwhelmed by a slow, manual, paper-based system of collecting, storing, and using health information.  6 In health care delivery systems (community, primary, and secondary), electronic health record (EHR) use varied widely and ranged from the most mature systems, in which a single EHR was used across a health care organization spanning many health care facilities, to organizations that used different EHRs in different specialties or those that remained paper based.  7, 8 The importance of interoperability between health care systems for the transfer (and reuse) of data was recognized and widely discussed but rarely implemented in practice.  9 us, the COVID-19 pandemic has focused the minds of health care professionals, policy makers, scientists, politicians, and citizens on these issues, highlighting the intertwined relationship of health care data, its management, and its impact on public health and generating widespread interest in digital health. Many of the shortcomings highlighted by the pandemic can be addressed through the application of data science and digital health,  10  which allow data to be effectively managed, shared, and used. Although there is no single agreed-on definition of digital health,  11  for the purposes of this consensus statement, we consider digital health to mean digital tools, technologies, and services that enable health teams (including all public, private, and academic organizations that provide or support health care) to transform care delivery and empower individuals and society to manage health and well-being.\n\nRecognizing the impact of health care data and data management on public health, in August 2020, an international interdisciplinary team of medical, academic, and industry experts formulated the Riyadh Declaration on Digital Health at the Riyadh Global Digital Health Summit, a Group of Twenty (G20)-related event that provided an international forum to discuss the role of digital health in addressing pandemics.  12 This declaration presents 9 recommendations on data and digital health (Box) for adoption by the global health community (health care professionals, hospital administrators, local or national politicians, policy makers, academics, and scientists) to address the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics. However, the declaration did not specify how to implement the recommendations in practice.\n\nWe therefore reconvened the expert panel to reach a consensus on how best stakeholders can deploy digital health and data and support public health in an integrated manner to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics. This consensus statement provides a roadmap for digital health policy implementation by all stakeholders, including governments. As a foundation for this consensus statement, we propose that stakeholders must consider digital health, data, and public"

Therefore, all evidence can Box. Recommendations From the Riyadh Global Digital Health Summit 1. Implement data-driven and evidence-based protocols for clear and effective communication with common messaging to build citizens' trust. 2. Work with global stakeholders to confront the propagation of misinformation or disinformation through social media platforms and mass media. 3. Implement a standard global minimum data set for public health data reporting and a data governance structure tailored to communicable diseases. 4. Ensure that countries prioritize digital health, particularly improving digital health infrastructure and reaching digital maturity. 5. Enable health care organizations by providing the necessary technology to collect high-quality data in a timely manner and promote sharing to create health intelligence. 6. Cultivate a health care workforce with the knowledge, skills, and training in data and digital technologies required to address current and future public health challenges. 7. Ensure surveillance systems combine an effective public health response with respect for ethical and privacy principles. 8. Develop digital personal tools and services to support comprehensive health programs (in disease prevention, testing, management, and vaccination) globally. 9. Maintain, continue to fund, and innovate surveillance systems as a core component of the connected global health system for rapid preparedness and optimal global responses.

Another existing and useful model for collaboration related to data is the Committee on Data (CODATA) of the International Science Council, which promotes international collaboration to advance open science and to improve the availability and usability of data in research. CODATA supports the principle that research data should be as open as possible and as closed as necessary.\n\nCODATA also works to advance the interoperability and the usability of such data, with the view that research data should be FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable). CODATA achieves these objectives through several standing committees, strategic executive-led initiatives, and its task groups and working groups. For example, in the related field of disaster risk reduction, the CODATA task group FAIR Data for Disaster Risk Research develops clear processes to ensure that data are accessible and available following the FAIR principles for disaster risk reduction and climate risk management, but as applicable to pandemic preparedness. 17"

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "Using a nominal group technique, we engaged a diverse stakeholder group across multiple sectors to reach consensus on how best to deploy digital health and data and support public health in an integrated manner to overcome the COVID-19 pandemic and future pandemics. In doing so, participants came to consensus on high-priority questions within 5 themes: team, transparency and trust, technology, techquity, and transformation.\n\nWorking in teams and public-private partnerships represents a critical foundation of accelerated science (ie, delivering results based on data in a timely manner), such as witnessed for the COVID-19 vaccine development and delivery. Our action points encourage partnerships that intertwine comprehensive ecosystems, a culture of collaboration and cooperation, and engaged patients and citizens with full knowledge, rights, and consent on how their data are used and processed. Adopting such an approach from discovery to development to the delivery of innovation in health care should accelerate the delivery of regulatory requirements. In practice, stakeholders should have a diverse set of interests, but each should fulfill a specific role in the health of citizens, and this collaboration will act to integrate and synergize the best knowledge, skills, and training that all health team stakeholders (especially patients and citizens) have to offer.\n\nHowever, engaging different stakeholders to effectively collaborate and share data and information relies on trust and transparency, without which they will be unwilling to share data to enable digital health technologies, such as digital surveillance, to address pandemics.  23 Our consensus action points specifically address the factors that erode trust, especially among the public, such as data generation in poorly secured systems  24  and restricting data sets to individual stakeholders in silos.  25 Our framework combines a public health response with a respect for ethical and privacy principles, which is fundamental for building trust and transparency in the use of digital tools,  26  because a lack of public trust may decrease compliance with public health advice or recommendations, adversely impacting health outcomes.  27 Community leaders should be enlisted at the grassroots level to bolster public trust in digital health care tools and systems wherever possible because it is difficult to build a trusting relationship through mobile technologies alone.\n\nDigital health technologies and consumer-generated data have the potential to provide timely and accurate data and information about disease, but this potential is hampered by aging systems, obligations to submit data to multiple programs in different formats (potentially an error-prone process), and underreporting that may affect data quality and, ultimately, the sensitivity and predictive value of a surveillance system. There was consensus that digital technologies can overcome these problems.\n\nHowever, the existence of technology and data does not necessarily equate to usable data. Although most industrialized nations have extremely high EHR penetration and use, these technologies presented a limiting factor throughout the pandemic. Data remained trapped within EHRs and subject to software vendors and proprietary relationships and burdens placed on the EHR user. Essentially, the capacity for health care professionals to provide public health authorities with needed data became almost intractable. Compounding the issue was the public JAMA Network Open | Health Policy Implementing Digital Health to Ensure Global Health Security During Pandemics JAMA Network Open. 2022;5(2):e220214. doi:10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.0214 (Reprinted) February 23, 2022 7/11 Downloaded from jamanetwork.com by guest on 08/14/2025 health authorities' absence of understanding and knowledge of clinical and laboratory operations and information systems, limitations that ultimately led to untenable policies and rule making. For future pandemic preparedness, this bottleneck needs to be anticipated through an already existing collaboration. Successful pandemic preparedness relies on uniform, global digital health capability and access.\n\nThe rate of mobile technology adoption is very high in developed countries (94%) and is rapidly increasing in developing nations (78%),  28  but barriers to access to internet connectivity and, consequently, to digital health care can reinforce serious inequalities. Groups that are digitally excluded have a greater risk of poor health.  29 Techquity means that specific people or groups should not be denied the means of achieving a state of health that is available to others through digital skills development, internet access, digital health literacy, and minimization of the effects of harmful digital marketing on health and well-being. Our consensus mitigates against digital exclusion at the global, regional, national, local, and individual levels and addresses the need to train and include those from disadvantaged populations to contribute to and participate in decision-making related to digital health.\n\nWill the COVID-19 pandemic be a tipping point for digital health? In 2022 and beyond, the inevitable transformation of health will be accelerated owing to a strengthened focus on the need for data and digital access to advance population health and wellness. The guidance provided in this consensus statement, if followed, would lay the foundation for much greater resilience to future pandemics.\n\nSimilar to our 5 themes, the WHO Global Strategy on Digital Health provides a blueprint for how to transform current systems to address future pandemics and has 4 main objectives: collaboration and knowledge transfer, implementation of digital strategy, digital health governance, and provision of human-centered health systems at the global level.  30 Furthermore, the recently published report of the Health Information Technology Advisory Committee (HITAC) Public Health Data Systems Task Force, which examined the effectiveness of public health data systems to support highconsequence public health threats, provides targeted actions and recommendations, including cross-cutting recommendations to create a preparedness plan and data standards for collecting public health information; working with federal partners to create a health data ecosystem that fully supports public health; working with payers to promote the adoption of health care information tehnology standards and secure data exchange; and supporting data modernization and standardization initiatives.  31 As such, our consensus statement complements the WHO Global Strategy on Digital Health and HITAC recommendations by providing actions specific to pandemic preparedness that create the preconditions at local and national levels on which the WHO action plan and HITAC recommendations can be implemented at supranational levels."
