  "title": "Digital and Mobile Technologies to Promote Physical Health Behavior Change and Provide Psychological Support for Patients Undergoing Elective Surgery: Meta-Ethnography and Systematic Review",
  "abstract": "Background: Digital technology has influenced many aspects of modern living, including health care. In the context of elective surgeries, there is a strong association between preoperative physical and psychological preparedness, and improved postoperative outcomes. Health behavior changes made in the pre-and postoperative periods can be fundamental in determining the outcomes and success of elective surgeries. Understanding the potential unmet needs of patients undergoing elective surgery is central to motivating health behavior change. Integrating digital and mobile health technologies within the elective surgical pathway could be a strategy to remotely deliver this support to patients. Objective: This meta-ethnographic systematic review explores digital interventions supporting patients undergoing elective surgery with health behavior changes, specifically physical activity, weight loss, dietary intake, and psychological support. Methods: A literature search was conducted in October 2019 across 6 electronic databases (International Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews [PROSPERO]: CRD42020157813). Qualitative studies were included if they evaluated the use of digital technologies supporting behavior change in adult patients undergoing elective surgery during the pre-or postoperative period. Study quality was assessed using the Critical Appraisal Skills Programme tool. A meta-ethnographic approach was used to synthesize existing qualitative data, using the 7 phases of meta-ethnography by Noblit and Hare. Using this approach, along with reciprocal translation, enabled the development of 4 themes from the data. Results: A total of 18 studies were included covering bariatric (n=2, 11%), cancer (n=13, 72%), and orthopedic (n=3, 17%) surgeries. The 4 overarching themes appear to be key in understanding and determining the effectiveness of digital and mobile interventions to support surgical patients. To successfully motivate health behavior change, technologies should provide motivation and support, enable patient engagement, facilitate peer networking, and meet individualized patient needs. Self-regulatory features such as goal setting heightened patient motivation. The personalization of difficulty levels in virtual reality-based rehabilitation was positively received. Internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy reduced depression and distress in patients undergoing cancer surgery. Peer networking provided emotional support beyond that of patient-provider relationships, improving quality of life and care satisfaction. Patients expressed the desire for digital interventions to be individually tailored according to their physical and psychological needs, before and after surgery. Conclusions: These findings have the potential to influence the future design of patient-centered digital and mobile health technologies and demonstrate a multipurpose role for digital technologies in the elective surgical pathway by motivating health behavior change and offering psychological support. Through the synthesis of patient suggestions, we highlight areas for digital",

      "text": "The introduction of digital technologies has influenced many aspects of modern living, including health care  [1, 2] . Digital health technologies (eg, wearable activity trackers and mobile phone apps) provide opportunities for effective patient care. They can improve communication between health care providers  [3] , facilitate connectivity with clinicians and peers  [4, 5] , enable remote health monitoring  [6] , and empower patients to play an active role in their long-term care  [3, [7] [8] [9] .\n\nIn the context of elective surgeries, there is a strong association between preoperative physical and psychological preparedness and improved postoperative outcomes  [10] [11] [12] . More specifically, improvements in physical activity levels  [13] , dietary intake  [14] , and smoking cessation  [15]  have been linked to improved recovery after surgery, reduced risk of complications, better tolerance of postsurgical adjunctive treatment, and prevention of long-term disease  [16] [17] [18] [19] .\n\nAlthough health behavior changes made in the pre-and postoperative periods can be fundamental in determining the outcomes and success of elective surgeries  [19] [20] [21] , there are variable amounts of support and education currently provided to patients undergoing elective surgery to motivate these health behavior changes  [22] [23] [24] . A recent study evaluating patient attitudes to health behavior changes found that although preoperative patients understood the health benefits of improved behaviors, they lacked the confidence to make such changes without intervention or support  [19] . Many physical and mental health interventions offered in elective care pathways use face-to-face, in-person delivery for individuals or small groups of patients. Such approaches are resource-and time-intensive for staff already working in high-pressure health care sectors  [25] [26] [27] . In addition, geographic isolation, travel costs, and the time burden of attending classes can all negatively affect patient engagement with postoperative appointments  [28, 29] . Understanding the potential unmet needs of patients undergoing elective surgery is central to motivating health behavior changes. Integrating digital technologies within the elective surgical pathway could be one strategy to remotely deliver behavioral change advice and lifestyle support, consequently improving patient engagement and postoperative success rates  [12, 30] ."

      "title": "Approach",
      "text": "This review uses a meta-ethnographic approach to analyze and synthesize qualitative findings. Meta-ethnography was originally developed by Noblit and Hare  [31] , but it has recently been used in health care-based social science research by Britten et al  [32] , Campbell et al  [33, 34] , Pound et al  [35] , and others. It is an inductive and interpretive approach involving the translation of papers into one another. Meta-ethnographies encourage researchers to understand and transfer ideas, themes, and metaphors across different studies to gain a deeper understanding or to inform the development of broader concepts  [31, 36] .\n\nThere are still unanswered questions relating to the optimization of digital technologies to support patients undergoing elective surgery, especially in the cohorts of bariatric, cancer, and orthopedic surgery. We seek to synthesize findings from existing qualitative research to determine whether digital technologies are effective in supporting patients undergoing elective surgery to change their health behaviors, specifically focusing on physical activity, weight, dietary intake, and mental health support (eg, cognitive behavioral therapy)."

Acute, unplanned surgeries and emergency trauma procedures were excluded from this review.\n\nOnly the studies that had encompassed the use of digital health interventions to support behavior changes (such as weight changes, dietary intake, physical activity levels, and/or mental health strategies) in adult patients undergoing elective surgery (>18 years) during the pre-or postoperative period were included. There were no restrictions placed on participants' sex, ethnicity, or nationality. The included studies must be qualitative or mixed method studies containing a significant qualitative component to analyze participant perspectives (eg, patient interviews or focus groups).\n\nExclusion criteria included studies employing behavior changes achieved by nondigital interventions; participants who were not scheduled to undergo an elective bariatric, cancer, and orthopedic surgery; studies where the intervention was mainly focused on perspectives of health care professionals; nonqualitative studies (eg, quantitative studies, systematic reviews, or protocols); and studies in languages other than English."

Noblit and Hare  [31]  suggested that phase 5, where findings are translated into one another, follows something like \"one case is like another, except that...\". This phase of a meta-ethnographic approach is termed \"reciprocal translation,\" and it enables the development of themes and subthemes for interpretive synthesis  [31, 33] . According to this, we developed 4 overarching themes (or third-order constructs) and subsequent subthemes that were consistent with the original results but also extended beyond them.\n\nWhen translating the studies into one another to develop themes (and subthemes), we arranged each paper chronologically and compared the themes from paper 1 with those of paper 2, then those of paper 2 with those of paper 3, and so on. As we compared each study, we grouped similar themes and continually reviewed and refined them until they were coherent and distinctive. Two reviewers (UO and AR) were involved in the study translation at all times; however, if agreement was not reached between these, discussions with a third author (AH) helped to establish a consensus.\n\nTo adhere to recommendations for conducting meta-ethnographies, we used the term \"theme\" to describe the third-order construct and subthemes to describe third-order construct subthemes  [36] . The development of these overarching themes enables meta-ethnographies to delve further into a topic as compared with a traditional systematic review and contribute new insights to the literature  [32] .\n\nWe report on the overall effectiveness of digital health technologies to support behavioral change in patients undergoing surgery through 4 established themes: (1) motivational support, (2) patient engagement with interventions, (3) the facilitation of peer networking, and (4) intervention specificity to meet patients' individual needs."

A lower threshold for information seeking via digital technologies was reported by patients undergoing bariatric surgery, with sensitive questions being asked more readily  [53] . Das and Faxvaag  [53]  evaluated the impact of an online forum on interactions between health care professionals and patients undergoing bariatric surgery. The authors recognized that the connectivity provided an easier access to evidence-based advice as well as offered a convenient and geographically independent platform to promote patient engagement  [55] : I could ask questions through the app regarding my medical condition. I could upload the lab results through your program. Then I received corresponding advice from experts. I felt followed up. When I knew more about my medical condition, I felt more likely to gain control of my life.\n\nI live far away from the hospital and I have no doctor close to me. When I had questions about my medical condition, I could not find the answer in the internet. Then I asked questions through the app. Aha, the professor or expert responded.\n\nAlthough this increased connectivity with health care professionals was reported to be beneficial in supporting postoperative recovery, patients undergoing cancer still felt that technologies should not replace traditional face-to-face appointments with clinicians. Concerns were raised by this cohort, with patients reporting that they may miss out on vital interactions, such as displays of empathy, which come from face-to-face communication."

However, some patients appreciated low-effort strategies during the surgical journey to manage symptoms and improve relaxation  [38] :\n\nThe very end of your treatment when you finished your chemo and...the doctor says \"Ok, see you in six months.\" That would be the time to offer it. \"Cause you feel so unwarned  [sic] .\"\n\nInterestingly, there was a general agreement among cancer patients that the best time to begin an intervention is \"when you recognise that you have a problem ... and that you want help.\""

Puszkiewicz et al  [45]  noted preferences for individualization of digital interventions according to patient lifestyles rather than a disease on the whole:\n\nThe issues I might have as a colorectal cancer survivor are very different from the ones than someone who had breast cancer or prostate cancer.\n\nAnyone with any condition could use this program, which is beneficial, but it could be more beneficial [...] more tailored to the type of cancer or disease you had, to your lifestyle and fitness goals. I think it could be more fine-tuned to your circumstances, lifestyle, then that would be really helpful.\n\nIn the virtual reality-based rehabilitation study, participants expressed positive views on the personalized task difficulty, where the varied level of difficulties helped them to choose the exercise program according to their needs, and subsequently increased their satisfaction with the intervention  [45] ."

      "text": "Participants across all 3 surgical cohorts suggested design and technical improvements for the future development of digital and mobile interventions. Although these varied depending on the delivery method, a user-centered design was identified as a key solution to enhance and maintain engagement and to motivate behavior changes  [39] : I think that it needs to be aimed towards survivors. That would be the first component. There's a lot on the Internet that gives you a lot of exercises but it's not aimed towards survivors.\n\nPatient-reported design improvements for wearables included higher accuracy of the devices  [39, 50]  different aesthetics (such as the tone of the prompt and color scheme)  [47, 50, 51]  and personal goal setting  [50] : So I'll give you a case. I filled my laundry, and it's logged I walked 2,000 steps. I did not walk 2,000 steps 43. I'd get a little vibration to say let's go do 250 steps, it was much more polite than  MOVE 51. I like that the colour scheme was NOT pink  ! 48  In online forums for patients undergoing bariatric surgery or cancer surgery, fear of self-disclosure was a recognized barrier that affected user engagement. Full anonymity would make it easier to share sensitive issues and ask difficult questions  [49, 55] :\n\nOn other forums, even though you don't have your name, with a nickname, you can find out who the person is anyway. You have to be very careful if you want to be anonymous 53.\n\nParticipants also suggested adding search tools to locate information and save time  [55] , as well as the inclusion of diet recommendations and/or self-monitored food intake  [55] :\n\nThe program can be improved by adding search engine in the Learning forum. If I search for \"nausea\" then all the knowledge related to nausea will come out. Search engine will help save my time  [55] .\n\nWe are in a dilemma on what we should eat. The apps can provide detailed information on food choice, the time of food intake, the cooking methods, etc...Such practical information would be very helpful.\n\nOlder users appeared more likely to experience usability issues with interventions  [55] . To overcome this, patients reported preferences for open access so that family members or caregivers can offer support  [55] :\n\nI was overwhelmed by the information each time I opened it. Some people, like me, 40 or 50 years old. Well, this group believe the apps is a little bit troublesome. They feel challenged to use the new technology... If this program can be available for their family members, such as their son or daughter, it would be helpful."

      "title": "Comparisons With Previous Work",
      "text": "Digital and mobile technologies act as a catalyst to engage with healthy behaviors, such as loss of weight, improved dietary intake, and increased physical activity levels. Messages of positive reinforcement were viewed as useful, particularly when tailored to an individual's surgical type and readiness to make behavioral change. Existing literature suggests that individualized goal setting helps combat sedentary behavior  [57] [58] [59] ; personalized feedback and messages of encouragement provide a sense of accomplishment  [25, 39] ; and visual tracking of step count has been reported as motivational  [50, 58] . Recent contributions to the health behavior change literature have cited the importance of empowered patient-centered strategies and use of self-regulation  [60]  and self-determination theoretical frameworks  [61, 62]  to improve patient motivation. Digital technologies underpinned by behavior change theory can promote a proactive and holistic strategy to influence behavior change in a modern health care system such as the UK National Health Service  [21] .\n\nIn the context of patients undergoing surgical cancer, internet-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (iCBT) was associated with numerous benefits  [40, 44] . Following digital intervention usage, there have been improvements related to fatigue, sleep  [63] , depression  [64] , and psychological distress  [65] . In addition, our findings suggest that iCBT can also educate participants around various coping strategies to manage fears of treatment and disease recurrence  [40] .\n\nTechnologies enabling connectivity to health care professionals have been positively acknowledged. Two-way telemedicine consultations, emails, and text message discussions facilitated improved information delivery, real-time goal setting, psychosocial outcomes, and decision making  [66] [67] [68] . Participants felt motivated, reassured, and encouraged to adhere to postoperative advice through remote monitoring. Having access to health care professionals behind a screen also helped patients overcome their personal barriers and raise unmet needs beyond routine clinical questioning  [53, 67] . From the perspective of clinicians, digital and mobile health technologies provided them with a means to monitor patient progress, which enabled individualized advice to be given to reinforce beneficial behavior change  [43, 69] .\n\nDespite the benefits of digitally enabled communication, it is worth considering social norms with patient-professional relationships  [70] . For some, the continuity of face-to-face appointments is essential to provide empathetic interaction and social support  [70, 71] . Empathy, rapport, and compassion through nonverbal behavior and body language is difficult to establish when communicating digitally. Despite this, Kairy et al  [48]  reported close relationships and trust between the therapist and patients when communicating via telerehabilitation. Perhaps, complementing traditional face-to-face appointments with digital health interventions could be a way to maintain patient-professional relationships.\n\nUsability has been reported as a key determinant to induce and maintain health behavior change, where interventions should be easy to use as well as aesthetically and visually appealing. Patient preferences should be taken into account when it comes to the design and tailoring of interventions  [50, 72, 73] . It is worth considering ways to overcome digital health literacy barriers to further promote usability and engagement. Additional technical support might be beneficial when targeting older adult populations to increase their engagement and thus better support health behavior change  [50, 74] .\n\nOne reported advantage of digital interventions is the accessibility they offer  [29, 51, 75] . Postoperative breast cancer survivors living in rural settings experienced greater depressive symptoms compared with those with shorter commutes owing to the long travel distances required to access health services  [76, 77] . Where telerehabilitation was implemented for postoperative orthopedic follow-ups, participants reported improved continuity of care with the same physician and improved ability to control the timing of appointments and intensity of the rehabilitation service  [78] .\n\nIn addition to bridging access to health services, digital and mobile health technologies are being increasingly used as networking and peer-support tools. Patients undergoing similar procedures or diagnosed with similar conditions are able to communicate and share personal experiences and coping strategies with others  [53] . Peer support and behavior change have been previously reported in elective care  [50, [79] [80] [81] [82] , where increased social support and decreased patient isolation are associated with postsurgical success  [81, 83] . Although digital technologies offer opportunities to interact with peers on an educational level, concerns have been raised about the accuracy and credibility of shared information  [79, [84] [85] [86] . Health care professionals should caution patients when interpreting discussions on forums or online groups, given the potential detriments that may arise from following inaccurate information  [53, 86, 87] .\n\nThe optimal time point in the surgical pathway to initiate digital and mobile technologies remains uncertain, with findings suggesting that this may vary depending on the type of surgical group. Despite this, what remains clear is the potential benefit of capitalizing on a teachable moment to empower and educate patients about the underlying benefits of health behavior changes  [88] [89] [90] . Evidence suggests that preoperative interventions based on education of lifestyle changes are significantly more effective in managing postoperative complications and patient expectations  [91] .\n\nOur research has synthesized numerous design considerations that should be examined when producing future interventions to support patients undergoing surgery. It was found that internet-based interventions may benefit from adding a search tool to locate target information  [38] , the comfort of wearable technologies should be addressed  [43, 50] , and negative connotations with using the color pink for patients undergoing cancer builds on the cancer culture divide  [92] . The possible benefits of incorporating open-access features within interventions were also discussed. Previous research has shown that opening care access, to include relatives or caregivers, provided patients undergoing an increased sense of pre-and postoperative support  [93] [94] [95] . This approach has strengthened bonds with family members, improved patient experience, resulted in effective engagement with digital interventions, and therefore supported superior outcomes in lifestyle changes  [96] [97] [98] . This review synthesizes existing research to gain a deeper understanding of the ways in which digital tools can support elective surgical cohorts and identify key design features that support elective surgical patients to change their health behaviors, and thus have a greater impact on postoperative health. Considering the rapidly progressive nature of digital health interventions and digital assistive technology research, cocreation of a person-centered digital support network may help surgical patient cohorts to benefit from pre-and postoperative behavior changes on both a short-and long-term basis  [19, 99] ."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "This meta-ethnographic synthesis developed 4 key themes that are important in determining the success of technologies to support behavior change. Our novel findings have the potential to influence the future design of patient-centered digital and mobile health technologies. This study demonstrates the important role of digital tools in the elective surgical pathway; not only can they help to motivate physical behavior change, such as improved activity levels and dietary intake, but they can also successfully provide psychological support. By synthesizing patient-informed suggestions, we have identified key areas for improvement, both to meet the general desires of patients undergoing surgery and to meet more specialized surgery-specific needs throughout the perioperative pathway. In particular, digital technologies should optimize the inclusion of tailored content specific to individual patients, with the inclusion of self-regulatory features such as goal setting to provide structured and individualized support. We believe that there is a significant rationale for involving patients in the cocreation of digital health technologies to enhance engagement, better support behavior change, and improve overall surgical outcomes for patients."
