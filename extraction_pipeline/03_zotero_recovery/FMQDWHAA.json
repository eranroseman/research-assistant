  "title": "The Effectiveness of Mobile-Health Technology-Based Health Behaviour Change or Disease Management Interventions for Health Care Consumers: A Systematic Review",
  "abstract": "Background: Mobile technologies could be a powerful media for providing individual level support to health care consumers. We conducted a systematic review to assess the effectiveness of mobile technology interventions delivered to health care consumers. \n Methods and Findings: We searched for all controlled trials of mobile technology-based health interventions delivered to health care consumers using MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Global Health, Web of Science, Cochrane Library, UK NHS HTA (Jan  1990-Sept 2010). Two authors extracted data on allocation concealment, allocation sequence, blinding, completeness of follow-up, and measures of effect. We calculated effect estimates and used random effects meta-analysis. We identified 75 trials. Fifty-nine trials investigated the use of mobile technologies to improve disease management and 26 trials investigated their use to change health behaviours. Nearly all trials were conducted in high-income countries. trials had a low risk of bias. Two trials of disease management had low risk of bias; in one, antiretroviral (ART) adherence, use of text messages reduced high viral load (.400 copies), with a relative risk (RR) of 0.85 (95% CI 0.72-0.99), but no statistically significant benefit on mortality (RR 0.79 [95% CI 0.47-1.32]). In a second, a PDA based intervention increased scores for perceived self care agency in lung transplant patients. Two trials of health behaviour management had low risk of bias. The pooled effect of text messaging smoking cessation support on biochemically verified smoking cessation was (RR 2.16 [95% CI 1.77-2.62]). Interventions for other conditions showed suggestive benefits in some cases, but the results were not consistent. No evidence of publication bias was demonstrated on visual or statistical examination of the funnel plots for either disease management or health behaviours. To address the limitation of the older search, we also reviewed more recent literature. \n Conclusions: Text messaging interventions increased adherence to ART and smoking cessation and should be considered for inclusion in services. Although there is suggestive evidence of benefit in some other areas, high quality adequately powered trials of optimised interventions are required to evaluate effects on objective outcomes.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "Each year, worldwide, over 22 million people die from diseases such as cardiovascular disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, HIV, lung cancer, and diabetes mellitus  [1] . The majority of deaths (83%) occur in low-and middle-income countries; however, these are also important causes of mortality in highincome countries, accounting for about 39% of deaths  [1] .\n\nHealth care consumers adopting healthy behaviours can prevent the onset of many of these leading causes of mortality. Ten years after stopping smoking, the risk of lung cancer is half of that of those continuing smoking and 15 y after stopping smoking the risk of cardiovascular disease is similar to that of those who never smoked  [2] . HIV can be prevented by adopting safer sexual practices  [3] . In people who are overweight, weight loss can reduce the incidence of diabetes  [4] .\n\nOptimal treatment of existing diseases can also reduce mortality and morbidity. In patients with existing coronary heart disease long term anti-platelet therapy reduces major vascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, or vascular mortality) by about a quarter  [5] , ACE inhibitors reduce cardiovascular mortality by just under a fifth  [6] , beta blockers reduce mortality by almost a quarter  [7] , and lipid lowering therapy reduces coronary mortality by about a fifth  [8] . Antiretroviral medication delays the progression of HIV infection  [9] . Good control of diabetes reduces the onset of retinopathy by half and reduces the onset of nephropathy by two-thirds  [10] .\n\nOptimal treatment of existing diseases requires the involvement of health care consumers in managing aspects of their disease. Health care consumers decide whether to adhere to prescribed medication and determine when they seek health care  [11] . Involving health care consumers in self-management of diseases such as in monitoring their health/disease status and adjusting their medication dosage (e.g., insulin or asthma medications) can improve health outcomes  [12] [13] [14] .\n\nAn important function of health care services is therefore to encourage and support health care consumers to adopt healthy behaviours and to self-manage chronic diseases. However, the amount of information, encouragement, and support that can be conveyed during consultations, within existing service infrastructures or through other traditional media (such as leaflets), is limited.\n\nMobile technologies are a means for providing individual level support to health care consumers. Mobile health interventions for health care consumers have been designed to increase healthy behaviour (for example, to increase smoking cessation or activity levels) or improve disease management (for example, by increasing adherence to prescribed medication, improving management of diabetes or asthma, or delivering therapeutic interventions).\n\nMobile technologies include mobile phones; personal digital assistants (PDAs) and PDA phones (e.g., BlackBerry, Palm Pilot); smartphones (e.g., iPhone); enterprise digital assistants (EDAs); portable media players (i.e., MP3-players, MP4-players, e.g., ipod); handheld video-game consoles (e.g., Playstation Portable [PSP], Nintendo DS); handheld and ultra-portable computers such as tablet PCs (e.g., iPad), and Smartbooks.\n\nThese devices have a range of functions from mobile cellular communication using text messages (SMS), photos and video (MMS), telephone, and World Wide Web access, to multi-media playback and software application support. Technological advances and improved computer processing power mean that single mobile devices such as smart phones and PDA phones are increasingly capable of high level performance in many or all of these functions.\n\nThe features of mobile technologies that may make them particularly appropriate for providing individual level support to health care consumers relate to their popularity, their mobility, and their technological capabilities. The popularity of mobile technologies has led to high and increasing ownership of mobile technologies, which means interventions can be delivered to large numbers of people. In 2009, more than two-thirds of the world's population owned a mobile phone and 4.2 trillion text messages were sent  [15] . In many high-income countries, the number of mobile phone subscriptions outstrips the population  [16] . In lowincome countries, mobile communication technology is the fastest growing sector of the communications industry and geographical coverage is high  [17] [18] [19] [20] .\n\nMobile technologies are mobile and popular, such that many people carry their mobile phone with them wherever they go. This allows temporal synchronisation of the intervention delivery and allows the intervention to claim people's attention when it is most relevant. For example, health care consumers can be sent messages designed to sustain their motivation to quit smoking throughout the day. Temporal synchronisation of the intervention delivery also allows interventions to be accessed or delivered within the relevant context, i.e., the intervention can be delivered at any time and extra support can be requested wherever and whenever it is needed. For example smokers trying to quit can send text messages requesting extra support while they are experiencing cravings due to withdrawal from nicotine, or those with asthma can access advice regarding how to increase the use of inhalers during an exacerbation of asthma.\n\nThe technological capabilities of mobile technologies are continuing to advance at a high pace. Current technological capabilities allow low cost interventions. There are potential economies of scale as it is technically easy to deliver interventions to large populations (for example, mobile technology applications can easily be downloaded and automated systems can deliver text messages to large numbers of people at low cost). The technological functions that have been utilised for health care consumers include text messages (SMS), software applications, and multiple media (SMS, photos) interventions. The technology supports interactivity, which allows people to obtain extra help when needed  [21, 22] . Motivational messages, monitoring, and behaviour change tools used in face-to-face support can be modified for delivery via mobile phones. Interventions can be personalised with the content tailored to the age, sex, and ethnic group of the participant or to the issues they face  [21, 22] .\n\nExisting systematic reviews of M-health interventions focus on the application of specific devices (e.g., mobile phones  [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] , specific mobile technology functions (e.g., text messaging  [28] [29] [30] ), or individual diseases or types of illness (e.g., diabetes care or chronic disease management  [26, 30, 31] ). These reviews require updating. Some types of interventions for health care consumers targeting healthy behaviour or disease management have not been covered by previous reviews. A comprehensive review of interventions delivered to health care consumers is lacking and provides a valuable overview of the existing evidence.\n\nThis systematic review aimed to quantify the effectiveness of mobile technology-based interventions delivered to health care consumers for health behaviour change and management of diseases."

      "text": "We adhered to our published plan of investigation as outlined in the study protocol  [32] .\n\nParticipants were men and women of any age. We included all controlled trials employing any mobile technology interventions (mobile phones; PDAs and PDA phones [e.g., BlackBerry, Palm Pilot]; smartphones [e.g., iphone]; enterprise digital assistants [EDAs]; portable media players [i.e., MP3-players and MP4players, e.g., ipod]; handheld video-game consoles [e.g., Playstation Portable (PSP), Nintendo DS]; handheld and ultra-portable computers such as tablet PCs [e.g., ipad and Smartbooks]) to improve or promote health or health service use or quality. Trials were included regardless of publication status or language.\n\nWe included studies in which the intervention delivered by mobile technology was the primary intervention component under evaluation. We excluded studies evaluating either mixed mobile technology and non-mobile technology based interventions in which the treatment and control group both received the mobile technology-based component or interventions in which treatments between the treatment and control groups differed in additional ways besides the components delivered by mobile technology, such as interventions involving face-to-face counselling with a text message intervention compared to a control group receiving information only. We included trials of immunisation reminders; trials of general appointment reminders are reported elsewhere  [33] .\n\nThe interventions in trials meeting the inclusion criteria and targeting health behaviour change or disease management interventions for health care consumers are reported here. Other trials identified targeted data collection or health care delivery processes, such as those directed to health care providers (e.g., for diagnosis and management) or those involving communication between health care services and health care consumers (e.g., appointment reminders, test result notification). These are reported in two separate articles  [33] . No trial was excluded from the review based on the type of health or health care service targeted.\n\nPrimary outcomes were defined as any objective measure of health or health service delivery or use. Secondary outcomes were defined as the following: self-reported outcomes related to health behaviours, disease management, health service delivery or use, and cognitive outcomes. Outcomes reported for any length of follow-up were included.\n\nWe searched the following electronic bibliographic databases MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Global Health, The Cochrane Library (Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials [CENTRAL], Cochrane Methodology Register), NHS Health Technology Assessment Database, and Web of Science (science and social science citation index) from 1990 to Sept 2010 and the reference lists of included trials. The list of subheadings (MeSH) and textwords used in the search strategy can be found in Text S3. All of these terms were combined with the Cochrane Library MEDLINE filter for controlled trials of interventions.\n\nTwo reviewers independently scanned the electronic records to identify potentially eligible trials.\n\nTwo reviewers independently extracted data on number of randomised participants, intervention, intervention components, mobile devices employed, mobile technology functions used, sequence generation, allocation concealment, blinding of outcome assessors, completeness of follow-up, evidence of selective outcome reporting, any other potential sources of bias, and measures of effect using a standardised data extraction form. The authors were not blinded to authorship, journal of publication, or the trial results. All discrepancies were agreed by discussion with a third reviewer. The behaviour change techniques used in behaviour change interventions were classified according to Abraham and Michie's taxonomy of behaviour change techniques  [34] . Risk of bias was assessed according to the criteria outlined by the International Cochrane Collaboration  [35] . We assessed blinding of outcome assessors and data analysts and we used a cut off of 90% complete follow-up for low risk of bias for completeness of follow-up. We contacted study authors for additional information about the included studies, or for clarification of the study methods as required.\n\nAll analyses were conducted in STATA v 11. We calculated risk ratios and standard mean differences. We used random effects meta-analysis to give pooled estimates where there were two or more trials using the same mobile technology function (e.g., SMS messages) and targeting the same disease (e.g., diabetes control) or behaviour (e.g., activity) and reporting the same outcome. We examined heterogeneity visually by examining the forest plots and statistically using both the x 2 test and the I 2 statistic. We assessed evidence of publication bias using Funnel plots."

There were 26 randomised controlled trials with parallel groups, and one non-randomised controlled trial. There were five trials aiming to increase smoking cessation (Table  1 ), seven trials aimed to increase physical activity (Table  2 ), three trials aimed to reduce calorie intake (Table  2 ), seven trials aimed to increase physical activity and reduce calorie intake (Table  2 ), three trials aimed to increase safer sexual behaviour (Table  3 ), and one trial aimed to reduce alcohol consumption (Table  3 ).\n\nAll trials were conducted in high-income countries. Disease management. The 49 disease management trials recruited 6,832 participants with sample sizes ranging from 16 to 273 participants. Thirty-four were randomised controlled trials with parallel groups, three were cluster randomised controlled trials, five were crossover trials, and seven were non-randomised parallel group trials. Nine trials aimed to improve the management of illnesses presenting acutely. Of these nine trials, seven provided cardiopulmonary resuscitation instruction (Table  4 ), one provided the information required by a lay-helper to manage an emergency, and one provided accident and emergency department discharge information for sprains and lacerations. For chronic conditions six trials aimed to increase adherence to medication (Table  5 ). Thirteen trials aimed to improve diabetes control (Table  6 ), six aimed to improve asthma control (Table  7 ), and two aimed to improve hypertension control (Table  8 ). Seven interventions provided psychological support (Table  9 ). One trial aimed to increase self-care behaviours in patients following a lung transplant, one trial aimed to improve monitoring and provide appropriate advice regarding chemotherapy-related toxicity symp-toms, one trial aimed to monitor vital parameters (e.g., blood pressure, heart rate, weight) and provide appropriate advice to people with heart failure, one trial aimed to monitor home care blood transfusions in people with severe haemophilia so the clinic could be alerted regarding ''significant'' bleeds. One trial aimed to improve the recall of rehabilitation goals in people with acquired head injury by sending text messages regarding their goals. These varied trials are described in Table  10 . The SMS system was fully automated and a computer algorithm was used to match the SMS sent to the participant characteristics. Duration: 26 wk.\n\nParticipants only received one text message every 2 wk, thanking them for being in the study, providing study centre contact details, informing them that those who completed follow-up would be rewarded with a free month of text messaging (whether they quit or not), and reminding them of the time until their free month at the end of follow-up.\n\nVidrine 2006 [114] Parallel group RCT Country: USA; Device: Mobile telephone; Media: Voice 95 HIV positive adult smokers aged $18 y.

Behaviour change interventions are described according to the study authors' descriptions of the behavioural change theory underpinning the intervention and behaviour change techniques employed. Further details of each intervention, as described by authors, are provided in Tables  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 .\n\nHealth behaviour change. Sixteen of the health behaviour change interventions used mobile phones, of which 13 used the SMS function, one used the MP3 function, one used the MP4 function, and one used the telephone function. One intervention was delivered using a PDA phone using application software, SMS, and telephone functions. Five interventions were delivered using PDAs using application software, two used hand held computers employing application software or MP4/video functions, one used the audio functions provided by a MP3 audio players.\n\nOf the 26 studies, seven reported using behavioural theories to underpin their intervention. The maximum number of techniques reported by any intervention description was 18  [21, 22, 36]  and the median number was six. The most commonly used behaviour change techniques were the following: provide feedback on performance (  13      To investigate the effect of a pocket computer assistance in the intensive (meal related) insulin therapy. The intervention was a specialized pocket computer that can register patient-entered data. An adaptation of the insulin doses to the current metabolic situation of the patient is achieved through continuous recalculations of individual patient data, such as insulin sensitivity, insulin-BG-and insulin-carbohydrate-equivalents. The intervention patients were asked to follow the dose recommendations given by the computer. Nevertheless, they had the opportunity to make their own decisions or ask their physician about the dose in case of doubts and critical situations. Duration: 6 mo\n\nThe control group patients were asked to document the following data: BG values, carbohydrate intake, sports, events, and injected insulin dosages. To examine whether a UCDC system using both the internet and cellular phones could facilitate chronic disease self-management and improve multiple metabolic parameters in overweight patients with both type 2 diabetes and hypertension. Patients in the intervention groups received a cellular phone with a modular blood glucose measuring device, strips, and l ancets. They also received an automatic blood pressure monitoring device as well as body weight scales. First, the UCDC system sent out an alarm on the cellular phone to remind the participant to measure their blood glucose, blood pressure twice a day, and body weight once a day. The Anycheck device attached to their cellular phone conducted the glucose measurements and automatically sent the results to a central study database-participants immediately received messages of encouragement, reminders, and recommendations according to a pre-defined algorithm. The system automatically recorded participant's exercise time. Participants received information via SMS three times a day regarding healthy diet and exercise methods, along with general information about diabetes, hypertension, and obesity. Furthermore, physicians could follow participant's trends in blood glucose levels, blood pressure, and body weight changes, allowing them to send individualized recommendations to patients when needed. Duration: 3 mo Patients in the control group visited their clinic according to their routine schedule and received the usual out-patient treatment from their physicians during the study period."

SMS-based smoking cessation interventions more than doubled biochemically-verified smoking cessation at 6 months  [21, 36]   Mean Age: Control = 62.8 y (SD: 12.5); Intervention = 62.1 y (SD: 11.9).\n\nTo determine whether the patient-GP interaction based on the study protocol is sufficient to improve the control of hypertension achieved in primary care and without the intervention of any specialized setting. Also, to evaluate the improvement in hypertension during follow-up, the impact on patient quality of life and anxiety, and certain economic aspects concerning the viability of the telemedicine system in this context. The intervention equipment in this project consists of a cellular phone with WAP-GPRS capability and a sphygmomanometer. During the 6-mo follow-up period, the intervention patients sent their mean sSBP and sDBP, based on three measurements made at 3-min intervals under fasting conditions in the morning and at night, four times a week, and their pulse rate and weight once a week. During each WAP session, they had the option of responding to a simple questionnaire. At some later moment, the GPs accessed the data sent by their patients via the web. According to his or her own criteria, the GP could send an SMS regarding any related issue to the patient's phone. Duration: 6 mo\n\nThe control patients followed the same SBPM protocol, with the exception that the results were recorded on paper in a data collection notebook; they sent no data to the computer system, and thus, had no interaction with their GPs. For other trials, of three smoking cessation trials reporting biochemicallyverified smoking cessation outcomes, two showed statistically significant improvement  [36, 39] . There were no statistically or clinically significant changes in weight for trials using SMS messages to reduce calorie intake and increase physical activity (standard mean difference [SMD] 22.14 [95% CI 27.05 to 2.77] kg) or for trials using application software to reduce calorie intake (SMD 20.10 [95% CI 20.49 to 0.69] kg). One trial of a diet and physical activity intervention and one other trial of an intervention targeting diet only showed statistically significant reductions in waist circumference  [40, 41] . The other 13 anthropometric outcomes for trials targeting physical activity only, diet only, or diet and physical activity showed no statistically significant effects (Table  18 ). One trial  [42]  targeting physical activity reported four disease control outcomes: one showed a statistically significant benefit in diabetes control (HBA1C)  [42] , one showed no effect on insulin requirements  [42] , and two showed no change in systolic and diastolic blood pressure. One objective measure of physical activity showed a statistically significant increase in the number of steps taken per day as assessed by a pedometer. There were no primary outcomes reported for sexual health or alcohol consumption  [42] ."

For 12 other diabetes control outcomes, six showed statistically significant benefits. Two trials  [44]  reported two blood pressure outcomes; neither showed reductions that were statistically significant. One trial reported three lipid profile outcomes, of which one showed a statistically significant reduction  [45] . One trial reported no effect on weight loss  [46] . No trials reported outcomes of hypoglycaemia.\n\nFor patients with asthma, one trial  [47] reported three lung function outcomes, of which one showed a statistically significant improvement and none showed statistically significant negative effects. For patients with hypertension, of four blood pressure outcomes reported in two trials, one showed a statistically  significant reduction  [48]  and none showed statistically significant negative effects.

      "text": "This review of randomised controlled trials for mobile technology interventions delivered to health care consumers found 59 trials that investigated the use of mobile technologies to improve disease management and 26 trials that investigated their use to change health behaviours. The trial demonstrated mixed evidence regarding the benefits of interventions, and nearly all trials were conducted in high-income countries. Four trials had a low risk of bias. One trial with low risk of bias reported clinically important reductions in viral load from an intervention that used text messages to maintain contact, monitor, and respond to medication issues with patients prescribed antiretrovirals in Kenya  [37] . Trials demonstrate that automated multifaceted smoking cessation support delivered by text message more than doubles biochemically verified smoking cessation  [21, 36] . However, our meta-analyses show that, to date, mobile technology-based interventions for diabetes control that have statistically significant effects are small and of borderline clinical importance. Simple medication reminders delivered by SMS message show no benefits. The effect estimates for diet and diet with physical activity interventions on weight were consistent with no or small benefits. There is suggestive evidence of benefit for reminders for vaccine appointment attendance and cardiopulmonary resuscitation training. There is suggestive evidence of short-term benefits for interventions for asthma control, physical activity, and psychological support interventions, which could be clinically important if these effects were demonstrated in the long term. Our review found that few trials were at low risk of bias in all areas assessed. Few trials were conducted in low-or middle-income countries.\n\nStrengths and weaknesses of the systematic review in relation to other systematic reviews. To our knowledge, this is the first systematic review of all mobile technology interventions delivered to health care consumers. Our review updates earlier reviews and expands them either by using a more exhaustive search strategy, by presenting effect estimates and 95% confidence intervals for all reported outcomes  [28, 29, 31] , or by conducting meta-analysis, where sufficient trials report similar outcomes  [28, 29, 31] . Nineteen trials (25%) did not provide sufficient data to calculate effect estimates and authors did not respond to requests for data; this could have resulted in bias in the systematic review findings. It was beyond the scope of our review to review all internet or video-based interventions, which in principal can be viewed on many modern mobile phones. Our review aimed to examine the effects of interventions delivered by mobile technologies alone, so we excluded interventions combining mobile technologies with other interventions such as face-to-face counselling. These interventions could be subject to a separate systematic review. A wide range of factors could influence the effectiveness of mobile technology interventions including trial quality  [50] ; participant factors such as demographics (gender/ age) or disease status (disease management/disease prevention interventions); the setting (low-/middle-or high-income country), intervention factors such as components, intensity, timing, type of mobile device (e.g., PDA or mobile phone); or the mobile   technology function used (e.g., SMS, video, application software).\n\nIt was not possible to explore the factors influencing heterogeneity statistically, as there were few trials of similar interventions reporting the same outcomes, resulting in limited power for such analyses. The examination of funnel plots in exploring publication bias was limited. as few trials contributed to some pooled analyses. We used Abraham and Michie's typology  [34]  of behaviour change tools to code the intervention content according to author descriptions in the papers or protocols. The typology could be improved by modifying it for mobile technology-based interventions and specific behavioural domains, as has been done for smoking cessation  [51] . We coded the authors' descriptions of the interventions as reported in the papers, which varied in the level of detail provided. The coding of intervention content would have been more complete and accurate if the text message and other intervention content was obtained and directly coded, as has been done for the txt2stop intervention  [51] . There was inadequate power to explore the impact of different behaviour change tools in specific behavioural domains on effect estimates.\n\nSystematic review findings in relation to findings from trials published since our search was completed. On 1 November 2012, we re-ran our search to identify new trials published since the search conducted for the systematic review was completed."

Secondary outcomes were as follows: Three trials reported statistically significant increases in adherence to antiretroviral medication with text message reminders  [81] [82] [83] , and one trial reported increases in adherence that were not statistically significant  [84] . One trial has demonstrated improved quality of life for patients with heart failure receiving a mobile phone based telemonitoring intervention  [85] . Two trials reported increases in emotional self-awareness in young people receiving risk assessment and management of youth mental health problems: one reported benefits in mild depressive symptoms  [86, 87] , and another reported that delivering cognitive behavioural therapy messages by mobile phone was feasible and acceptable  [88] . One trial reported improved recall of goals in a trials delivering text messages to patients undergoing brain rehabilitation  [89] . One trial reported that an educational package of text messages increased continuation of the combined oral contraceptive pill  [90] , but simple daily reminders regarding taking the combined oral contraceptive has no effect in another trials  [91] . One trial reported an increase in self-efficacy for self-managing cystic fibrosis  [92] . A mobile phone-based map did not shorten the time taken to retrieve an automated external defibrillator in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest victims  [93] . Three trials reported short term increases in physical activity in those receiving a text messagebased intervention designed to increase activity  [94] [95] [96] . Four trials reported benefits in cardiopulmonary resuscitation processes with mobile phone-based audio instructions  [97] , video instruction  [98] , and a feedback application  [99] . One trial reported improved quality of life with a mobile phone-based asthma selfcare system [100], and another reported increases in self-reported adherence to asthma medication  [101] . In summary, while interventions using mobile technologies for patients are a fast-moving field, the findings of many trials published since the search for the systematic review was completed are generally consistent with the reported results of trials in the systematic review, particularly for primary outcomes. Trials report benefits in adherence to antiretroviral medication and smoking cessation; one small trial reported a significant reduction in HBA1c for a diabetes control intervention, and there were no or small effects of interventions on weight and no reported benefits of daily medication reminders. There is suggestive evidence of benefit for attendance for vaccination and cardiopulmonary resuscitation interventions. There are short term benefits for physical activity interventions and psychological support interventions that could be clinically significant if sustained.\n\nNovel trial findings published since our search for the systematic review was completed suggest that text messages can increase the proportion of women receiving skilled delivery in urban areas in Kenya. There are now mixed results for asthma control interventions, with some trials reporting benefits. There is suggestive evidence that multifaceted adherence interventions can increase adherence to the combined oral contraceptive pill and TB medication resulting in increased TB cure rates. There is suggestive evidence that a heart failure intervention can improve quality of life and that tele-monitoring data sent by mobile combined with text message advice can reduce blood pressure and HBA1C. There is suggestive evidence that sexual health interventions can increase testing for HIV and sexually transmitted infections."

      "text": "Multifaceted adherence interventions demonstrate an increase in adherence to anti-retrovirals and a decrease in viral load when evaluated in Kenya  [37]  Table 17. Cont. The majority of the research to date has been conducted in high-income countries, so trials of interventions in low-and middle-income countries are required, particularly in view of the high coverage of mobile technologies in these settings. Editors' Summary Background. Every year, millions of people die from cardiovascular diseases (diseases of the heart and circulation), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (a long-term lung disease), lung cancer, HIV infection, and diabetes. These diseases are increasingly important causes of mortality (death) in low-and middle-income countries and are responsible for nearly 40% of deaths in high-income countries. For all these diseases, individuals can adopt healthy behaviors that help prevent disease onset. For example, people can lower their risk of diabetes and cardiovascular disease by maintaining a healthy body weight, and, if they are smokers, they can reduce their risk of lung cancer and cardiovascular disease by giving up cigarettes. In addition, optimal treatment of existing diseases can reduce mortality and morbidity (illness). Thus, in people who are infected with HIV, antiretroviral therapy delays the progression of HIV infection and the onset of AIDS, and in people who have diabetes, good blood sugar control can prevent retinopathy (a type of blindness) and other serious complications of diabetes."

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "Why Was This Study Done? Health-care providers need effective ways to encourage \"health-care consumers\" to make healthy lifestyle choices and to self-manage chronic diseases. The amount of information, encouragement and support that can be conveyed to individuals during face-toface consultations or through traditional media such as leaflets is limited, but mobile technologies such as mobile phones and portable computers have the potential to transform the delivery of health messages. These increasingly popular technologies-more than two-thirds of the world's population now owns a mobile phone-can be used to deliver health messages to people anywhere and at the most relevant times. For example, smokers trying to quit smoking can be sent regular text messages to sustain their motivation, but can also use text messaging to request extra support when it is needed. But is \"mHealth,\" the provision of health-related services using mobile communication technology, an effective way to deliver health messages to health-care consumers? In this systematic review (a study that uses predefined criteria to identify all the research on a given topic), the researchers assess the effectiveness of mobile technology-based health behavior change interventions and disease management interventions delivered to health-care consumers.\n\nWhat Did the Researchers Do and Find? The researchers identified 75 controlled trials (studies that compare the outcomes of people who do and do not receive an intervention) of mobile technology-based health interventions delivered to health-care consumers that met their predefined criteria. Twenty-six trials investigated the use of mobile technologies to change health behaviors, 59 investigated their use in disease management, most were of low quality, and nearly all were undertaken in high-income countries. In one high-quality trial that used text messages to improve adherence to antiretroviral therapy among HIVpositive patients in Kenya, the intervention significantly reduced the patients' viral load but did not significantly reduce mortality (the observed reduction in deaths may have happened by chance). In two high-quality UK trials, a smoking intervention based on text messaging (txt2stop) more than doubled biochemically verified smoking cessation. Other lower-quality trials indicated that using text messages to encourage physical activity improved diabetes control but had no effect on body weight. Combined diet and physical activity text messaging interventions also had no effect on weight, whereas interventions for other conditions showed suggestive benefits in some but not all cases.\n\nWhat Do These Findings Mean? These findings provide mixed evidence for the effectiveness of health intervention delivery to health-care consumers using mobile technologies. Moreover, they highlight the need for additional highquality controlled trials of this mHealth application, particularly in low-and middle-income countries. Specifically, the demonstration that text messaging interventions increased adherence to antiretroviral therapy in a low-income setting and increased smoking cessation in a high-income setting provides some support for the inclusion of these two interventions in health-care services in similar settings. However, the effects of these two interventions need to be established in other settings and their cost-effectiveness needs to be measured before they are widely implemented. Finally, for other mobile technology-based interventions designed to change health behaviors or to improve selfmanagement of chronic diseases, the results of this systematic review suggest that the interventions need to be optimized before further trials are undertaken to establish their clinical benefits.\n\nAdditional Information.

An automated texting intervention for smoking cessation support was effective when evaluated in the UK.Both interventions may require some adaptation as well as translation for use in other countries.Health services should consider implementing similar interventions in similar settings.The finding that simple SMS reminders for adherence to medication have at best small effects is consistent with the findings from existing adherence research, which has previously demonstrated that uni-faceted interventions have very modest benefits [102-104]. Likewise, it is unsurprising that interventions delivered by mobile technologies appear to have small effects on weight, given the paucity of effective behavioural change interventions for obesity [105,106]. There is currently insufficient high quality evidence of beneficial effects on clinical outcomes to warrant implementation of interventions for other areas of health behaviour change or selfmanagement of diseases. The benefits of text message support on adherence to antiiretrovirals and smoking cessation should be established in high-, middle-, and low-income countries. The cost-effectiveness of antiretroviral adherence interventions should be established. A cost-effectiveness analysis of mobile phone text messaging interventions for smoking cessation showed that the intervention is costeffective [107]. Further high quality trials should robustly establish the effects of multifaceted text messaging interventions on medication adherence in other areas, TB cure rates, and on the proportion of births with a skilled attendant at delivery in urban areas in low-and middle-income countries. Adequately powered high quality trials of optimised interventions are required in areas of health behaviour change and self-management of diseases where there is currently suggestive evidence of benefit. In areas where, to date, interventions have shown small benefits of borderline or no clinical importance future research should focus on improving interventions, drawing on existing guidance for the development of complex interventions, prior to considering further evaluation by randomised controlled trial [108]. There is a considerable body of existing research regarding effective face-toface interventions for self-management of diseases, and much of this literature suggests multifaceted interventions are required [104,109-111]. Mobile technology-based interventions for health care consume rs developed to date may not be optimal; some are uni-faceted and may need to incorporate additional components Cont."

For health behaviour change interventions, further research is required to elucidate the effects of different behaviour change tools on behaviours and to explore if interventions, which include a wider range of behaviour change tools, have greater effects. A range of questions regarding the effects of mobile technologies remain open to question including which functions are most effective (SMS, video, oral instruction, application software), which behaviour change techniques are effective, and whether the effectiveness of interventions is influenced by setting or participant demographics."
