  "abstract": "The metabolic outcomes of metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) remain controversial. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of physical activity on the cardiovascular disease (CVD) outcomes of MHO. The study included participants who were followed for 10 years and recruited from the Korean Genome and Epidemiology Study (KoGES), a population-based cohort study. Participants with previously recorded CVDs or cancer, or who had received steroids or anticoagulants at baseline were excluded. A total of 8144 participants (3,942 men and 4,202 women) fulfilled inclusion criteria. In a multivariate Cox regression model adjusted for age and sex, MHO participants were not at elevated risk of CVD compared with their metabolically healthy non-obese (MHNO) counterparts (HR, 1.28; 95% CI, 0.96-1.71), although both the non-obese (HR, 1.50; 95% CI, 1.19-1.90) and obese (HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.48-2.30) participants with metabolic abnormalities were at elevated risk. However, in the subgroup analysis by physical activity, physically inactive MHO participants had a significantly higher HR for CVD events compared to active MHNO participants (HR, 1.54; 95% CI, 1.03-2.30), while active MHO participants were not at elevated risk (HR, 1.15; 95% CI, 0.70-1.89). Physically inactive MHO participants had significantly increased risk of CVD compared to physically active MHNO participants whereas physically active MHO participants did not.",

      "text": "The incidence of obesity is increasing and the worldwide prevalence of obesity more than doubled between 1980 and 2012  [1] . In Korea, the prevalence of obesity has increased over the past 10 years (20.6% to 24.6% in men, 16.2% to 17.3% in women from 2006 to 2015)  [2] . These changes are particularly important given the known association between obesity with cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, and death  [3] .\n\nIntriguingly, obesity is not synonymous with metabolic disease, as people who are overweight or obese do not always have no metabolic dysfunction, especially cardio-metabolic dysfunction. These populations have been called the metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) phenotype. The underlying mechanisms which cause MHO phenotype among obese people are multiple and complex. This phenotype is the result of complex interaction between genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors  [4] . The absence of genetic traits associated with fat distribution, reduced visceral fat mass and ectopic fat accumulation in liver, muscle, and pancreatic beta cells, and low systemic inflammation all contribute to metabolically healthy obesity  [4] .\n\nThe diagnostic criteria for MHO is controversial, and therefore the prevalence of MHO is difficult to quantify and varies according to the definition used  [5] . The prevalence of MHO has been reported to be 10-25% worldwide  [6, 7] , while the estimated prevalence among middle-age men in Korea is 24.2-28.5%  [8] . A recent review article reported that the prevalence of MHO showed a large variation from 6% to 75%  [9] .\n\nAlthough, by definition, people with MHO are metabolically 'healthy', the metabolic outcomes of MHO remain unclear. Regarding cardiovascular outcomes in this group of patients, Hamer et al.  [10]  observed 22,203 subjects without CVD for more than 7 years. This observational study revealed that MHO did not increase the risk for all-cause or cardiovascular mortality. Furthermore, MHO has little association with heart failure  [11]  and with coronary atherosclerosis  [12] . On the contrary, several large observational studies reported that MHO is a significant risk factor for CVD. Ogorodnikova et al.  [13]  conducted a 12-year observational study and demonstrated patients with MHO had high risk of CVD compared to metabolically healthy normal weight individuals. Kramer et al.  [14]  reviewed 8 studies about all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events and concluded that obesity is an independent risk factor for CVD in patients with and without metabolic disorders.\n\nThese discrepancies suggest that MHO alone is not sufficient to predict metabolic outcome and patients with MHO likely represent a heterogeneous group. Therefore, it remains important to identify the key factors that determine healthy outcomes in MHO and to re-define metabolically healthy obesity.\n\nIn this study, we focused on physical activity (PA) as a key factor, since it is well known to influence obesity, and because physical inactivity contributes to the development of metabolic disorders such as heart disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM)  [15] . The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that adults should perform at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity (PA) or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic PA throughout the week  [16] . The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services also recommends at least 150 minutes of PA for major health benefits  [17] .\n\nMany studies have reported that the amount of PA has inverse dose-response associations with coronary heart disease and CVD  [18]  and regular exercise improves insulin sensitivity and reduces glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in T2DM patients  [19] .\n\nIn the present study, patients with MHO were divided into four groups based on their level of PA, and we evaluated the risk of CVD in a Korean population-based cohort. The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of PA on CVD outcomes of MHO and to re-define the concept of \"real\" metabolic health."

A total of 10,038 participants were examined at baseline in 2001-2002 and the biennial follow-up examination is ongoing. The design of the cohort study and the demographics of participants have been described elsewhere  [20] .\n\nThe 10-year follow-up data are included in the present study. The following participants were excluded from the present study: those with incomplete data (demographic, anthropometric, or laboratory), those with a clinical history of CVD or cancer at baseline, and those who had received steroids or anticoagulants.

Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) level was measured using high-performance liquid chromatography (Variant II; BioRad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA)\n\nThe questionnaire included questions on sociodemographic information, lifestyle, personal and familial medical history, smoking status and alcohol consumption.

      "text": "There is no consensus regarding the diagnosis of metabolically healthy obesity. In the present study, non-obese participants were defined as those with a body mass index (BMI) of 18-25 kg/m 2 and obesity as a BMI of !25 kg/m 2 according to Asia-Pacific BMI criteria, which are defined by the WHO Western Pacific Region  [21] . Metabolic risk was based on an adaptation of the Adult Treatment Panel-III (ATP-III) definition of metabolic syndrome, and defined as two or more metabolic risk factors, including hypertension (a systolic blood pressure (BP) at least 130 mmHg and/or a diastolic BP at least 85 mmHg, or on antihypertensive treatment), impaired fasting glucose (fasting plasma glucose at least 100 mg/dL), triglycerides (TG) at least 150 mg/dL, and adverse high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (1.03 mmol/L in men and 1.30 mmol/L in women). The waist circumference (WC) criterion was not used because of its collinearity with BMI. According to these criteria, participants were categorized into one of four groups consisting of metabolically healthy non-obese (MHNO); metabolically healthy obese (MHO); metabolically unhealthy non-obese (MUNO); and metabolically unhealthy obese (MUO). All participants completed a structured questionnaire that included healthrelated questions concerning PA. The PA categories included a physically active group (at least 30 minutes per day of PA) and an insufficient group (fewer than 30 minutes per day of PA). Because there was no data about average minutes of PA per week in the baseline data, we were unable to use the WHO recommendation  [16] . However, the intensity and average minutes per week of PA were investigated at the first follow-up survey and we conducted subgroup analysis of participants with the first follow-up data using the WHO definition which recommends at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic PA or 75 minutes of vigorousintensity aerobic PA throughout the week. CVD events were investigated with a structured questionnaire and defined as any of the following: myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, or peripheral arterial disease."

Interestingly, despite being obese, the prognosis of physically active individuals with MHO did not differ significantly from that of MHNO individuals. These results show that metabolically healthy obese populations are not homogenous. This heterogeneity of 'obesity' is due to a limitation in the classification of obesity by BMI. First, obesity is defined as excess body fat mass, but BMI does not accurately reflect body fat mass  [22] , since bodyweight cannot distinguish between excess fat and excess muscle or bone mass. Second, extra fat is not always bad. Adipose tissue is a complex organ composed of white, beige, and brown fat. The beige/brown fat has many beneficial effects on metabolism  [23] . Furthermore, the metabolic effects of fat differ according to its location. For example, excess visceral fat mass has deleterious effects on metabolism and is an independent risk factor of metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, CVD and cancer  [24, 25] , whereas subcutaneous fat has beneficial effects on metabolism  [26] . In one animal study, subcutaneous fat transplantation improved metabolic dysfunction in an obese mouse model  [27] .\n\nIn order to overcome this limitation of obesity classification according to BMI, many studies tried to evaluate obesity using other body index parameters such as waist circumference, waist hip ratio or waist height ratio  [28, 29] , and reported that these other indexes explained\n\nTable 3.

However, these indexes are still an indirect reflection of excess fat mass, and therefore additional clinical data accumulation is required to replace BMI. To measure regional body fat composition accurately, we can measure body composition or fat mass using computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance imaging, DXA and PET-CT  [30, 31] . Unfortunately, these methods are expensive, and have limited availability and accessibility for long-term follow up in a large-scale cohort study. Therefore, the degree of PA is an easily measured and inexpensive alternative to the methods described above which is useful in predicting the CVD risk of obesity and a suitable alternative to overcome the limitation of BMI. In our data, the degree of PA acts an independent prognostic factor on the CVD outcome even in the same metabolic comorbidity. In fact, PA has been reported as a protective factor against the development of CVD in many clinical studies  [18] . Jian Li et al.  [32]  reported that PA reduced the overall risk of CVD among men and women by 20-30% and 10-20% percent, respectively. PA is an independent regulator of body fat percent and body composition  [33] , and is associated with the activity of brown adipose tissue  [34] .\n\nIn our study cohort, physically active individuals comprised 39.9% of the MHO group (Table  1 ). More than half of the participants in the MHO group were physically inactive. When assessing the CVD outcome of the overall MHO group, this ratio resulted in an increased, but not statistically significant risk (HR 1.280, p> 0.05). Therefore, PA can provide a convincing explanation for the discrepant results of previous longitudinal studies about the risk of developing CVD in MHO  [35] [36] [37] [38] . Taken together, these findings demonstrate that the degree of PA should be considered alongside other determining factors such as obesity and metabolic comorbidity when predicting cardiovascular risk.\n\nThe main strength of this study is that this was a long-term population-based cohort study (10-year follow up) from a single ethnic group. This study also has several limitations. First, we were unable to analyze fat distribution or use other demographic indexes associated with obesity such as waist circumference. Therefore, we did not account for all of the important factors associated with CVD risk. Second, since we could not assess mortality data, we may have missed fatal CVD events.\n\nIn conclusion, we analyzed the CVD outcomes according to obesity and metabolic health status in a Korean population. Physically inactive MHO participants had significantly increased risk of CVD compared to physically active MHNO participants, whereas physically active MHO participants did not. Further studies are required to re-define MHO in view of PA status in order to better characterize 'real' metabolically healthy obesity."
