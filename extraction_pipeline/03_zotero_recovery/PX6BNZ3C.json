  "title": "Transtheoretical Model for Physical Activity in Older Adults: Systematic Review",
  "abstract": "Healthy aging makes the practice of physical activity (PA) a necessity. However, PA guidelines achievement in older adults is scarce. The use of behavioral theories such as Transtheoretical Model (TTM), helps in older adults PA promotion. The aim of this review was to identify the use of TTM for PA in older adults (>60 years). PubMed, SPORTdiscus, and Medline databases were used to conduct the search. All steps of the process followed the recommendations of the PRISMA flow-diagram. We identified eight studies: Six were descriptive cross-sectional studies, one prospective-cohort study and one with a quasi-experimental design. Only two papers evaluated the four behavior change dimensions within the same study, three evaluated the processes of change and the decisional balance, four evaluated the exercise self-efficacy and all assessed the stages of change for PA behavior. From this review, we can conclude that TTM is a useful and suitable behavior model in creating, developing, and evaluating interventions with the aim of acquiring and improving PA habits in the older adults. However, there is paucity of research in this area, and more studies including the four behavioral change dimensions are needed to analyze the effect of TTM on the promotion of PA in the older adults.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "Physical activity (PA) is considered as one of the most effective strategies to promote healthy aging  [1] . Regular PA practice in older adults is associated with improvements in functional fitness (maintains muscle strength and balance), chronic diseases risk prevention (coronary heart disease, diabetes, and stroke), improvement of mental capacity (self-esteem, maintenance of the cognitive function, reduce anxiety, and depression), and improvement in social response  [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . PA is a good predictor of healthy aging and decreases the probability of disability in people over 65 years  [8] .\n\nRecommendations for adults and older adults state the need to achieve at least 150 min of PA at moderate intensity per week, together with muscle strength activities for an improvement in bone mass and activities to improve flexibility, at least 2-3 days per week  [9] .\n\nHowever, despite the important health benefits of PA, a little proportion of the population over 65 years meet World Health Organization (WHO) PA guidelines  [10] . In fact, this group is the least physically active out of all  [11] . According to WHO  [12] , having a sedentary lifestyle is the fourth primary risk factor of non-communicable diseases. The good news are that those who practice regular PA can reduce their risk of pathologies at a rate between 20 and 30%  [1] .\n\nOlder adults' exercise adherence is a multifactorial process, influenced by: Program characteristics (preference of exercise type), personal factors (demographic, health related, physical, and psychological factors)  [13, 14] , social determinants, and environmental factors  [15] . It is important that interventions to promote physical exercise in older adults are based on theories that explain the behavior change, tailored to individual characteristics of the participants  [15] . Theory-based interventions to promote PA behavior seem to have a more successful effect than interventions without an established theoretical base  [16, 17] . In addition, interventions based on a single theory reported greater impact on PA behavior than those interventions with a combination of theories  [17] .\n\nOne of the models that better understands and predicts the behavioral-cognitive changes in the adoption of PA/exercise behavior, is the Transtheoretical Model of Change (TTM), proposed by Prochaska and Di Clemente  [18] . The TTM is a most comprehensive and integrated model of behavioral changes among health behavioral models  [19] , this model began to be used in smoking cessation studies  [18] , but over time its use has extended to the study of healthy lifestyle promotion, including PA, to become one of the most popular models to understand the PA behavior  [20] . This model is a cyclical model and explains the behavior change as a dynamic process, through a temporal dimension by describing them as a sequence of stages and processes by which the individual progress to adapt a regular behavior  [21] .\n\nThe model is composed of different dimensions, summary (Table  1 ): Analyze how the physical inactivity affects to your interpersonal relationships."

      "title": "Stages of change (SoC):",
      "text": "The SoC are the levels of motivation to change, from no intention to change to actually making behavior change. This construction does not explain when people change, rather where people are in their motivation to change. There exist five stages of readiness for change: Pre-contemplation, contemplation, preparation, action, and maintenance  [18] . Different studies have shown the relationship between PA levels and SoC, and advanced SoC (action and maintenance stages) tends to present better levels of PA  [23] [24] [25] [26] .\n\nProcesses of change (PC) describe how people change. The PC are the strategies and techniques that people use to change or modify their behavior. The PC can be divided in two categories: Cognitive processes (thinking, attitudes, awareness) and behavioral processes (actions). All processes are important for all SoC, the pattern of use of cognitive versus behavioral PC across the SoC does not change by the stages in PA behavior, in other words, it seems that all PC can be used indistinctively regardless the particular SoC  [25, 26] . Both behavioral and cognitive PC act together, increasing their combined use across SoC  [25, 27] . This construct has been considered as one of the key moderators of TTM-based interventions to improve PA behavior  [28]  Decisional Balance (DB) determines the belief that people have about the advantages and disadvantages (pros and cons) of making a behavior change, this construct is derived from decisional-making theory  [29] . The DB compare the positive and negative aspects of change, differences in the DB, tends to corresponds to different SoC, people in earlier SoC (precontemplation and contemplation stages) perceive more barriers than benefits and people in the later stages (preparation, action, and maintenance stages) perceive more benefits than barriers for change  [30] .\n\nSelf-Efficacy (SE), is the ability to perform specific behaviors in specific situations. This dimension was adapted from Bandura's Social-Cognitive Theory in 1977  [31] . Exercise SE is an important construct: It is a predictor and a moderator of the adoption and maintenance of PA behavior  [28, 32] . People with high score in exercise SE tend to be more active  [22] . High levels of exercise SE leads to sustain and increase levels of PA in older adults  [33] .\n\nThere is a need to understand the adoption and maintenance of exercise behavior in older adults, since the current levels of PA participation of this group are insufficient compared to the positive effects derived from their practice  [10] . The TTM is a useful tool within this procedure, since it provides us a detailed vision of the process of acquisition of a new habit. This model has demonstrated to be one of the most effective models within the process of behavior change, with a significant impact in the promotion of PA  [17] . Up to date, the TTM has been applied for different behaviors and in different age groups, but there is paucity of research in promoting PA in older adults. Therefore, the objective of this review is to identify the relationship between the different TTM constructs: Stages of change, processes of change, decisional balance, and self-efficacy in relation to PA in the population over 60 years. This review will increase the knowledge about the recent applications of TTM in the promotion of PA in the group of people over 60 years."

All authors participated in the analysis and interpretation of findings for each topic. A bias risk calculation was included in the process. All authors work individually first prior to elaborate the main results/findings. Furthermore, an adaptation of the STROBE checklist was used  [34] . We used it to evaluate the quality of the articles included in our study. STROBE checklist contains 15 items of analysis. The cut-off points established for quality classification were as follows: 0-5 points = low quality; 6-10 points = moderate quality; and 11-15 points = high quality.

The most common reason for excluding studies was that they did not meet the inclusion criteria, mainly by the age.\n\nThe main characteristics, TTM dimensions, outcomes, and key findings for each of the 8 articles included in this review are listed in Tables  2  and  3 . Of these eight articles, six studies were descriptive-cross-sectional studies  [37] [38] [39] [40] [41] 44] , one was a prospective cohort study  [42]  and one was a quasi-experimental design  [43] . Two of the studies originated from Ireland  [37, 41] , two more from Taiwan  [42, 43]  and individual studies from Iran  [38] , Korea  [39] , Japan  [44] , and Italy  [40] . According to the study population, the review gather a total of 2304 participants, included both men (51.65%) and women (48.35%). Only three of the studies (37.5%) worked with healthy older adults  [38, 43, 44]  and the rest with pathologies (62.5%) (bronchiectasis  [37] , non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis  [41] , physical disability or brain injury  [39] , type II diabetes  [40] , and patients after open heart surgery  [42] ). Regarding to TTM-interventions characteristics, we can find the following topics: Measuring PA levels  [40, 42] , to identified daily patterns of PA  [41] , to understand the levels of PA and sedentarism  [37] , to identify knowledge of muscle strength exercise recommendations  [44]  to create PA-interventions tailored to specific SoC  [39, 43]  and to corroborate the usefulness of this model in older adults  [38] .

      "text": "The aim of this review focused on identifying the recent applications of TTM (2014-2019) and the relationship between its different constructs (stages of change, processes of change, decisional balance, and self-efficacy) with the levels of PA in the older adults over 60 years old. After completing all the recommended procedures for systematic reviews (PRISMA flow-diagram, conference by three researchers independently and finally quality of articles checklist adapted from the STROBE instrument), 8 original articles were included in the analysis. This is the first study that reviews the use of the TTM for physical activity in older adults. The study encourages the use of TTM for physical activity in clinical practice as part of the older adults health screening at General Practice practices. Moreover, the use of TTM for physical activity can also lead to more suitable PA programs and/or intervention aimed to improve healthy aging, precisely because this group is the most vulnerable due to their low levels of PA  [45] .\n\nTheory-based interventions are more effective to improve PA behavior than non-theories based ones  [17] . Similarly, one theory-based approach seem to be more effective than multiple theories approach or a combination of theories  [17] . All papers included in this review have included a single theory and have been based on the TTM theory.\n\nThe TTM is composed of differences constructs: SoC, PC, DB and SE  [21] . From the eight papers included in our review, only two  [37, 41]  evaluated the entire TTM in older adults. The number of constructs used within an intervention determines its chances of success. A recent meta-analysis determined that using at least three of the constructs from the TTM, improved the chances of increasing PA by three times  [28] . The use of more constructs from the TTM has already been reported by previous studies in which it was highlighted that many of the researches are inspired by the theory but they were not theory-driven  [26, 28] . The evaluation of all the constructs of behavioral model will allow the researchers to understand more precisely the specific characteristics of this population and their behavior change processes, thus favoring the sustainability and adherence of participants to exercise interventions.\n\nMotivation for change is the basis of this behavioral model (TTM) and it is determined by the SoC. This construct has been evaluated in all the articles of this review, in order to categorize the subjects according to their intention to behavior change and to evaluate the results that occurred throughout an intervention. The relationship between levels of PA and sedentary time with the SoC has already been reported in other reviews  [25, 26, 46] , determining that the initial SoC were related to longer periods of sedentary lifestyle and advanced SoC showed higher levels of PA. It is important to highlight how two articles  [39, 43] , focused their research on the initial SoC (precontemplation, contemplation and preparation stages), this approach seems to be an opportunity to focus strategies to promote PA within non-active or sedentary population. Previous researches determined that SoC were not considered moderators of the efficacy of TTM-based interventions in promoting PA behavior, so they suggest not focusing future researches exclusively on SoC  [26] [27] [28] .\n\nOn the other hand, PC are a very useful tool in the design of \"tailored\" interventions since they will allow us to know the strategies that individuals use to make a behavior change. This construct has been considered one of the successful moderators of TTM-based PA interventions  [28] . PC have been measured in 3 of the 8 articles evaluated, encompassing only the population with specific pathologies (bronchiectasis, non-cystic fibrosis bronchiectasis, physical disability and brain injury). In particular, specific recommendations for the precontemplation, contemplation and preparation stages in patients with physical disabilities and brain injury were designed on-demand  [39] , this work reflects a practical application of this model in the development and adaptation of interventions aimed at the promotion of adapted PA in the older adults. According to the use of PC in relation to SoC, we cannot establish a clear relationship with the results obtained. The current scientific literature suggests that there are no differences between patterns of use of PC and SoC  [26] , the cognitive and behavioral PC act together, increasing their use across to SoC  [25, 27] . In addition, It has been observed how the use of PC in PA interventions doubles the chances of success in the acquisition of PA behavior  [28] . SE has been the second most evaluated variable after the SoC. Self-efficacy provides us with information about the ability that individuals have to maintain behavior when faced with diverse and difficult situations. Within the review, SE has been measured both in a healthy and with pathologies population, considering 2 of the 4 articles that evaluated it as a predictor of the practice of PA  [38, 40] . These results supported the existing literature on the need to enhance SE to favor the adherence of older adults to PA promotion programs  [26, 28, 33] .\n\nAnother construct of TTM in the promotion of PA in the older adults, are all those implicit and explicit decisions that the individual weighs (i.e., DB). In this review, we have seen that it has been evaluated in 3 of the 8 selected articles  [37, 38, 41] , where it has been reflected that older adults perceive more benefits and lower barriers in the stages of action and maintenance against the initial stages. Knowing the aspects that the individual perceives as potentially favorable or dangerous in their practice of PA, will help the development and sustainability of interventions focused on the encouragement and promotion of PA in the older adults.\n\nThe group of older adults is considered a heterogeneous group because of the great variety of characteristics among them. Therefore, it would be interesting to explore other mediating and moderating variables of the exercise interventions  [47, 48]  such as social support, outcome expectation, perception of the environment, and resilience among others, in order to achieve a more complete vision of this process  [49]  Our findings are in line with the results reported by recent reviews focusing on TTM-interventions to promote PA in adults  [26] [27] [28] , our results contribute to increase the evidence about the positive effect of this behavior model in promoting healthy habits of PA in older adults, but more research is needed to understand the use of PC, their relationship with SoC and their relationship in the process of promoting and maintaining PA behavior in people over 60 years old. In addition, more studies encompassing the entire constructs of TTM are needed to fully understand PA behavioral change in this population. Finally, it would be interesting to extend the use of TTM to promote PA behavior to other groups of older adults with specific characteristics or pathologies.\n\nThe present study has some limitations. Firstly, many of the studies did not evaluate all the constructs of the behavioral model, so that we do not have enough information to understand its true effectiveness. Secondly, the use of the language restriction as an exclusion criterion (only documents in English) could limit the articles found. Finally, it is possible that relevant TTM-based interventions may not have been included in our review due to our search strategy or due to a poor description of the behavioral model in the original paper."

However, it is recommended to evaluate the behavioral model in its entirety in order to obtain a more complete and integrated view of behavioral change, in addition, more research is needed to understand the use of PC and their relationship with SoC in the PA behavioral in older adults. Finally, we recommend applying this behavioral model to other groups of older adults with specific characteristics and pathologies in order to determine its validity in that population."
