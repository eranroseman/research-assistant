      "title": "INTRODUCTION",
      "text": "T he Department of Defense (DoD) received 6,769 reports of military sexual assault (MSA), including both restricted (confidential) and unrestricted reports, from male and female active service members in 2017.  1  Survivors of MSA report a number of adverse consequences, psychological trauma, and lower job satisfaction and commitment.  [2] [3] 3] [4] [5] [6] [7]  Those in the armed forces face the additional trauma of experiencing a violation in the military ethos of trust and reliance on one another for survival.  8 These consequences extend beyond primary victims to impact overall unit cohesion.  9 Taken together, these studies suggest that the consequences of MSA are far-reaching, negatively impacting individual survivors and having deleterious effects on military functioning. Owing to these consequences, beginning in the early 1990s, Congress mandated the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to address the trauma associated with MSA.  10  Since the mid-2000s, there has been renewed interest in understanding the prevalence and causes of sexual assault in the military. Understanding these factors is crucial to developing tailored programs/policies to prevent victimization and interventions to address the consequences of MSA for individual victims, military functioning, and overall community health.\n\nThe social-ecological model is widely used by researchers to understand the causes of violence, including sexual assault. Advocated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and WHO, this framework underscores the importance of considering individual, relational, community, and societal contributing factors for violence.  [11] [12] 2] [13]  However, most of the research on MSA focuses on individual-level factors.  14, 15 This focus on individual-level factors stems from the availability of data and a history of victim-blaming that is reflected in research focusing on the behavior of victims rather than organization and community-level causes. The most consistent individual-level finding from the research is that rates of MSA, including harassment and sexual assault, are higher for women.  [16] [17] 7] [18]  Alcohol and drug use is common among these incidents, for both perpetration and victimization, which parallels the dynamics of sexual violence in the civilian population.  5, 19 Experiences in the military, including deployment and combat exposure, have also been found to increase rates of MSA, particularly for women.  18, 20, 21 In qualitative interviews, women attributed MSA during deployment to a combination of stressors associated with deployment and military culture.  21 Individual-level factors are important as they point to differential risk among military personnel, but they do not address systematic structural conditions that influence MSA. Although prevention programs can address behaviors (e.g., intoxication) that increase individuals' risk of victimization, these efforts alone are unlikely to be effective without addressing risk factors found on the other levels of the social-ecological model.\n\nExplanations for MSA beyond the individual-level emphasize the roles of hypermasculinity and military structure in fostering a climate that supports MSA.  14, 17, 19 or example, half or more of sexual assaults are perpetrated by higher-ranked military personnel, and assaults against men are more likely to involve multiple offenders and are attributed to humiliation or hazing.  9 Studies also demonstrate differences in the prevalence of MSA across branches, which are often attributed to branch-specific norms.  9, 14, 20 In addition to cultural differences, differences in MSA may reflect institutional structural factors that influence sexual assault. For example, a low ratio of women to men and the proportion of men that outrank women increase the risk of MSA for women.  14, 21 esearch also indicates that the prevalence of MSA varies considerably across bases.  22 Whereas factors unique to the military may contribute to a heightened risk of sexual assault compared with civilian populations, variation between bases points to the possibility of structural conditions that shape the risk of MSA, such as the size and type of installation. Likewise, research has found that the broader community context shapes outcomes related to the well-being of service members.  23 Community economic disadvantage, residential mobility, population density and change, and racial heterogeneity are all associated with quality of life outcomes for military personnel and with the rate of sexual assault and victimization among civilian populations.  [24] [25] 5] [26] [27] [28]  Taken together, this research suggests that the community level of the social-ecological model may also be associated with the occurrence of MSA. The objective of this research was to leverage recently published data to examine whether base characteristics (e.g., branch) and the characteristics of the surrounding communities (e.g., economic deprivation) contribute to the prevalence of MSA."

      "title": "METHODS Study Sample",
      "text": "Data for this study were compiled from a number of sources. Information for sexual assaults on military bases was drawn from the DoD Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office's 2017 report, \"Sexual Assault Received At Military Installations and Combat Areas of Interest.\" 1 Reported sexual assaults for fiscal years 2013-2016 for every U.S. military installation are included in this document. The analysis concentrated only on domestic bases. Information on base characteristics was compiled from DoD Base Structure Reports for 2012 and 2013.  29, 30 These reports reflect an inventory of property owned by the DoD and provide information (e.g., location, population, branch, composition) on all military bases. Auxiliary locations (e.g., training grounds, annexed airfields) were excluded from analysis because they did not have permanent personnel or MSA reporting. Community characteristics were compiled from the U.S. Census Bureau's American Community Survey 5-year (2008-2012) estimates  31  and correspond with the counties most closely associated with each military base (as specified in the 2013 Base Structure Report)."

      "title": "Measures",
      "text": "This study measured MSA as the average number of sexual assault allegations by bases between 2013 and 2016. This included both restricted and unrestricted reports by male and female service members. Unrestricted reports refer to sexual assault allegations that were reported through the military chain of command and were subject to criminal investigations. Restricted reports are cases disclosed to sexual assault response coordinators, victim advocates, or healthcare providers. These cases remain confidential and are not subject to a criminal investigation.\n\nBase information was drawn from the DoD's Base Structure Reports (2012-2013). Characteristics of these covariates are shown in Table  1 , including (1) total acres, (2) base density (personnel/acres), (3) percentage of personnel that is military, (4) August 2020 branch in control (Air Force [ref], Army, Marines, or Navy), and (5) joint base control.\n\nCommunity covariates were extracted from the American Community Survey files and included (1) total population, (2) economic disadvantage (a=0.91; factor of percentage living below poverty, the percentage on public assistance, and inverse of median income), (3) percentage unemployed, (4) percentage female-headed households, (5) residential mobility (a=0.87; percentage moved in the past year and percentage new residents since 2010), (6) percentage residents who are black, (7) percentage residents who are Hispanic, (8) percentage married, and (9) percentage veterans aged >25 years."

      "title": "Statistical Analysis",
      "text": "As expected in studies of violence, especially sexual assault, a large proportion of bases (52%) reported an average of 0 sexual assaults in the study period. This study used negative binomial regression, which takes into account the overdispersion in the dependent variable, to regress MSA on base-and community-level predictors. Likelihood ratio tests confirmed that a negative binomial model, as opposed to a zero-inflated negative binomial, was the appropriate model.  32, 33 To adjust for geographic homogeneity on the state level, this study used robust SEs clustering on the U.S. states. To account for differences between bases in population, which correspond to risk exposure, the population of each base was used as an offset in the model. The analysis also assessed model fit, including analyses for outliers, confounders, and multicollinearity. Analyses were conducted in 2019 and estimated in Stata, version 15."

      "title": "RESULTS",
      "text": "The average number of sexual assaults reported over this study's time period was 14.23 (SD=33.00), with a wide range (0-265). Reported sexual assaults increased from 2013 to 2014 (mean=12.26, SD=30.46 and mean=14.79, SD=35.09, respectively; t=4.31, p<0.001) and stabilized in subsequent years. The reason for this increase is unknown, though the DoD credited an increased willingness of victims to come forward rather than an actual increase in the number of assaults occurring.  34 he unadjusted incident rate ratios (IRRs) and their associated CIs are presented in Table  2 . Base density was negatively associated with MSA. The more densely populated the installation was, the lower the reported prevalence of sexual assault. Conversely, the percentage of personnel that were military (compared with civilian) was positively associated with MSA. For every 1% increase in military personnel, there was a corresponding 1% increase in the prevalence of sexual assault reports. With regard to branch characteristics, compared with Air Force bases, both Marine Corps-and Navycontrolled bases were associated with an increase in reported sexual assaults, to a relatively comparable degree (IRR=2.38 and IRR=2.22, respectively). Military veterans in the surrounding community also resulted in increased MSA. For every percentage increase in veterans aged >25 years, the rate of MSA increased by 13%. Taking other community-level measures into consideration, economic disadvantage was inversely related to MSA. For every unit increase in the disadvantage index, sexual assault reports on military bases decreased by a factor of 0.69. Conversely, residential mobility was positively related to MSA such that every 1% increase in residential mobility increased the rate of MSA by 7%. Finally, percentage black and Hispanic residents were also positively related to the prevalence of MSA and to a comparable degree (IRR=1.02 and IRR=1.03, respectively)."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "These findings suggest that structural characteristics of military bases and the larger community context in which they are found are important considerations for understanding MSA. In line with previous research, MSA varied as a function of military branch: the Navy and Marine Corps were associated with a greater prevalence of MSA.  20 The concentration of military personnel, relative to civilian employees and base density were associated with more MSA. Programmatic efforts should be cognizant of these and other base-specific risk factors. Many of the existing sexual violence prevention programs in the military have been developed for civilian populations and have not been rigorously examined for their effectiveness in reducing MSA among active service members.  35 Furthermore, those that are developed specifically for the military are applied branch-wide. Programs and wider efforts to combat MSA, such as the policies and programs offered by the Sexual Assault Prevention and Response Office, need to be thoroughly evaluated across a wide range of bases with varying structural characteristics.  19, 36 ough previously not extended to MSA, most of the findings for the community indicators included in this study parallel the findings found for civilian populations. Residential mobility and percentage of racial minorities positively predict MSA. However, this study found that economic deprivation was associated with less MSA. It is possible that economic deprivation in the surrounding community influences base security/organization (e.g., higher levels of installation security). However, future research should explore this potential relationship. Structural factors that serve as protective factors are important as they can also be integrated into prevention efforts.\n\nParalleling the finding regarding the concentration of military personnel within a base, the percentage of veterans in the surrounding community was also associated with MSA. Efforts to prevent MSA and support both active service members and veterans who are victims should involve a comprehensive approach that is tailored to the military context, include coordination between the DoD and VA, and leverage strong community partnerships. Compared with prevention, there has been a more comprehensive response in supporting victims. Through the VA, service members who are victims of MSA can access both community-and military-based services. For example, the Office for Victims of Crime works with communities that have a large military presence with the intention of facilitating and strengthening military-community partnerships. These partnerships may provide the basis for more comprehensive approaches to prevention and trauma-informed care. However, these programs such as MSA prevention programs have not been extensively evaluated regarding processes or outcomes.\n\nThere are a number of other potentially relevant base characteristics that should be explored in future research. Extending the finding that the overall concentration of military personnel on an installation increases MSA, the composition of the military population may differentially contribute to MSA. For example, some bases may feature a higher proportion of combat veterans. Combat exposure, at the individual level, is associated with an increase in MSA for both men and women.  18, 20 Likewise, leadership characteristics have been associated with MSA in surveys of service members.  37 The composition of military personnel may not be evenly distributed among bases, and future research should explore the extent to which that variation contributes to MSA. Furthermore, this study found that structural characteristics impact MSA and that MSA varies by military branch. The extent to which structural factors differentially impact military branches should be explored. Additional community-level factors should also be examined in future research on MSA. For example, measures of land usage such as the density of alcohol outlets are associated with violent crime (including sexual assault) in the community among civilian populations.  38 Other measures of community health that have been shown to influence military retention and re-enlistment, such as transportation infrastructure, may also have a relationship with MSA. Likewise, concepts that are generally associated with violent crime, such as collective efficacy, may also extend to sexual assault among service members.  39 Furthermore, the impact of changes in community health and more relational measures between the base and the larger communities in which these bases are embedded should be examined.\n\nFuture research should also explore factors related to social inequality, particularly as they relate to the societal level of the social-ecological model. Previous research has found that structural factors related to gender inequality (e.g., ratio of men-to-women service members) is associated with MSA.  21 Comparable structural factors related to inequality in the community may also influence rates of MSA on bases. Extending beyond structural factors, the prevalence of MSA is thought to stem from hypermasculine cultural norms within the armed forces.  14 Although these cultural factors may in part be unique to the military context, they exist in a larger system of cultural norms that perpetuate sexual violence.\n\nAs noted by previous research, community-level studies often do not explore the potential differential impact of these factors on specific subpopulations.  23 This is an important avenue for future research. Individual-level research suggests that the prevalence of MSA varies by sociodemographic characteristics such as gender, age, and race. This study found that the racial composition of communities impacts MSA.  16 Evaluations of prevention efforts should assess whether these sociodemographic characteristics moderate the effectiveness of programs and tailor the content and format of these programs accordingly. Furthermore, given that the military is stratified along with these same demographics and research has found that organizational power and climate impact MSA, future research should disentangle these structural conditions conducive to violence and the mechanisms through which they impact MSA.  37, 40"

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "This study is an important step in examining how structural factors shape MSA, but it is limited by the public availability of data. This study focused on sexual assault, which is only one form of sexual violence that service members may experience, but the one that is available with information disseminated by the DoD. The VA uses the term military sexual trauma to encompass both sexual assault and harassment. Sexual harassment also has deleterious effects on the well-being of service members. Though sexual harassment may be a precursor for sexual assault, it also has a unique etiology.  2, 15 Data and more research are needed to explore both the overlapping and distinguishing factors for these forms of sexual violence.\n\nLikewise, DoD counts of sexual assault on military bases do not include victims who are not members of the armed forces. The extent to which installation factors and characteristics of the surrounding community impact estimates of sexual assault of civilian employees or those residing in military housing (e.g., nonmilitary spouses) is unknown. Although this study found that the proportion of military employees, relative to civilian employees, increased MSA, future research should explore the risk factors of sexual violence for civilian personnel on military bases.\n\nLike sexual violence in general, MSA is under-reported. For example, Campbell and Raja 36 found that only 59% of assaults were reported to military legal personnel. Although this study included both unrestricted and restricted reporting, the estimates are still conservative. Research suggests that official reporting does not vary by branch characteristics but by situational dynamics of the assault, including location and injuries, and factors that may lead to misconduct violations for behavior (e.g., drinking) do influence reporting.  19 The extent to which under-reporting may vary as a function of the included base and community characteristics in this study is unknown and should be explored in future research.\n\nIn addition to the definition and reporting of MSA, there is a constellation of other potentially relevant base characteristics that were not included in this study because they did not appear to be systematically collected or disseminated by the DoD. Efforts should be undertaken to expand the information collected on installations, both in terms of aggregate base characteristics and more detailed information on MSA victims. In doing so, future research can examine variation in risk among service members and a wider range of structural characteristics.\n\nFinally, this study included community-level indicators because the nearest city may be geographically distant from the base, and socioeconomic and demographic data were more consistently available at the community level than the Census tracts. However, counties are heterogeneous, with the potential for substantial variation regarding the included variables. Future research should examine these relationships using information on the immediate surrounding areas compared with the larger communities in which the bases are embedded."

      "title": "CONCLUSIONS",
      "text": "Consistent with the social-ecological model, base and community characteristics are associated with the prevalence of MSA. Given this recognition, military-specific programs and services alone are likely insufficient to address the sexual assault of service members. Thus, community partnerships should be strengthened to provide a comprehensive approach to prevention and victim services. The federal government and associated agencies should develop a plan to systematically collect and disseminate information on base characteristics that may be related to MSA so that future research can more thoroughly articulate how institutional-and community-level factors, including structure and culture, contribute to the persistence of MSA."
