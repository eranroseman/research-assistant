  "title": "Effect of Behavioral Weight Management Interventions Using Lifestyle mHealth Self-Monitoring on Weight Loss: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis",
  "abstract": "Alongside an increase in obesity, society is experiencing the development of substantial technological advances. Interventions that are easily scalable, such as lifestyle (including diet and physical activity) mobile health (mHealth) self-monitoring, may be highly valuable in the prevention and treatment of excess weight. Thus, the aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to estimate the following: (i) the effect of behavioral weight management interventions using lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring on weight loss and (ii) the adherence to behavioral weight management interventions using lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring. MEDLINE via PubMed, EMBASE, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and the Web of Science databases were systematically searched. The DerSimonian and Laird method was used to estimate the effect of and adherence to behavioral weight management interventions using lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring on weight loss. Twenty studies were included in the systematic review and meta-analysis, yielding a moderate decrease in weight and higher adherence to intervention of behavioral weight management interventions using lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring, which was greater than other interventions. Subgroup analyses showed that smartphones were the most effective mHealth approach to achieve weight management and the effect of behavioral weight management interventions using lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring was more pronounced when compared to usual care and in the short-term (less than six months). Furthermore, behavioral weight management interventions using lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring showed a higher adherence than: (i) recording on paper at any time and (ii) any other intervention at six and twelve months.",

      "text": "Overweight and obesity are the fifth highest risk factors for global death, which corresponds to about 3.4 million deaths yearly, making them a global public health priority and a health challenge  [1] . According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the obesity rate has tripled since the 1980s. In 2014, 39% of the adult population was classified as overweight and 13% as obese  [2, 3] , with an estimated one billion people classified as overweight and 573 million people as obese  [4]  in 2030 if there is no attenuation of the current weight gain trends.\n\nThe increase in the prevalence of overweight and obesity and their association with many chronic diseases, namely cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes and some cancers, has sparked the interest of researchers and scientific institutions looking for effective ways to promote a healthy lifestyle and weight control  [1] . Among behavioral weight loss approaches, lifestyle (including diet and physical activity) and behavior strategies (including self-monitoring) have been consistently related to short-and long-term weight loss management  [5]  The lifestyle self-monitoring approach consists of registering all food and beverages consumed, portion sizes and methods of preparation, as well as the amount of physical activity performed throughout the day, making individuals aware of their current behaviors  [6] . Although, the use of self-monitoring in behavior change has a strong theoretical foundation, completing daily paper records appears to be quite tedious for most individuals  [7] .\n\nAlongside the increase in obesity, society is experiencing the development of substantial technological advances. While it is true that the boom in new technologies could be involved in the increased availability of energy dense and processed foods as well as the growing prevalence of sedentary behaviors, it is also true that they could play an important role in the management of health problems  [8]  Interventions based on new technologies could be easily developed and accepted for the management of weight disorders, since they represent an interesting tool to increase individuals' awareness of the quantity and quality of food consumed and the physical activity performed  [9]  Additionally, lifestyle mobile health (mHealth) self-monitoring  [10]  appears to have a greater effect on self-efficacy, patient motivation and adherence to treatment, in such a way that it may elicit a greater weight loss than conventional methods  [11] . A recent systematic review concluded that mHealth applications may represent an effective strategy for weight loss, and, since the review included both observational and experimental studies, the authors called for an update, including a meta-analysis, when the number of intervention studies allowed for the pooled effect size (ES) of the effect of mHealth applications on weight loss to be estimated  [12] .\n\nAt the present time, considering that obesity prevalence rates do not appear to be decreasing, interventions that are easily scalable, such as lifestyle (diet and physical activity) mHealth self-monitoring, are increasingly valuable in the prevention and treatment of excess weight. However, because no previous meta-analysis has synthesized the effect of lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring as part of behavioral weight management approach, the aims of this systematic review and meta-analysis were to estimate the following: (i) the effect of behavioral weight management interventions using lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring on weight loss and (ii) the adherence to behavioral weight management interventions when lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring was used."

The criteria for the exclusion of studies were as follows: (i) non-eligible publication types, such as review articles, editorials, comments, guidelines or case-reports; and (ii) duplicate reports-when this was the case, we extracted the data from the different reports and included in this systematic review the one providing the most detailed data."

The evaluation of six domains is included in this tool: randomization process, deviations from intended interventions, missing outcome data, measurement of the outcome and selection of the reported result. Each domain could be assessed as having a low risk of bias, some concerns or a high risk of bias.\n\nFor non-RCTs, the ROBINS-I tool was used  [16] . This tool evaluates the risk of bias according to seven domains: bias due to confounding, bias in the selection of participants for the study, bias in the measurement of interventions, bias due to deviations from intended interventions, bias due to missing data, bias in the measurement of outcomes and bias in the selection of the reported result. Overall bias could be considered as \"low risk of bias\" if all domains were classified as \"low risk\", \"moderate risk of bias\" if all domains were classified as \"low risk\" or \"moderate risk\", \"serious risk of bias\" if there was at least one domain rated as \"serious risk\", \"critical risk of bias\" if there was at least one domain rated as \"critical risk\" and \"no information\" if there was no clear indication that the study had a serious or critical risk of bias and there was a lack of information in one or more domains.\n\nThe literature search, data extraction and quality assessment were conducted by two independent reviewers (IC-R and RF-R), and a third reviewer (CA-B) was included when inconsistencies remained after discussion. Kappa statistics was calculated to assess the agreement rate between reviewers."

      "text": "To compute the pooled estimate of the ES and its 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for weight change, we used the DerSimonian and Laird method  [17] . A standardized mean difference score was calculated, using Cohen's d index as the ES statistic, in which negative ES values indicate a weight loss in favor of behavioral weight management interventions using lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring. Cohen's d values represented the following: (i) weak effects when values were around 0.2, (ii) moderate effects when values were around 0.5, (iii) strong effects when values were around 0.8 and (iv) very strong effects when values were greater than 1.0  [18] . Additionally, a pooled estimate of the mean weight change difference in kg was calculated.\n\nAdherence to behavioral weight management interventions using lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring was calculated as the risk of dropping out of the lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring group versus other interventions or the control group. Relative risk (RR) was used as the risk estimate.\n\nThe heterogeneity of the results across studies was assessed using the I 2 statistic. I 2 values were interpreted as: might not be important (0-40%); may represent moderate heterogeneity (30-60%); substantial heterogeneity (50-90%); or considerable heterogeneity (75-100%). The corresponding p-values were also considered.\n\nSubgroup analyses were performed based on the type of mHealth intervention (PDA, smartphone or web-based), the type of comparison group (usual care, paper record or wait-list) and the length of the intervention (\u22643 months, six months and \u226512 months). Sensitivity analyses were conducted to assess the robustness of the summary estimates and to detect whether any particular study accounted for a large proportion of heterogeneity. Random-effects meta-regressions were used to investigate whether the results were associated with the age of participants and the baseline means of weight, BMI or WC, since these variables may explain the observed heterogeneity.\n\nFinally, the Egger test  [19]  (p < 0.10 considered as statistically significant  [20] ) and a visual inspection of the funnel plots were used to assess publication bias. STATA SE software, version 15 (StataCorp, College Station, TX, USA), was used for the statistical analyses."

The mHealth interventions were delivered through PDAs, smartphones and web-based approaches, while comparator groups included usual care, paper records and wait-lists. The length of the interventions ranged from one to 24 months. Eight studies performed analyses for more than one time point  [24, 27, 28, 33, [35] [36] [37] [38] . Three studies included two intervention arms  [24, 31, 39] . Additionally, 16 studies specified the application used for lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring: Lose It!

      "text": "This systematic review and meta-analysis provides an overview of the evidence supporting lifestyle (diet and physical activity) mHealth self-monitoring, as part of a behavioral weight management approach, as a suitable intervention for weight management in adults with overweight or obesity, resulting in a moderate decrease in weight and higher adherence to intervention, greater than with other interventions. Additionally, this meta-analysis shows that interventions delivered through smartphones are the most effective mHealth approach to achieve weight management in adult populations with overweight or obesity. The effect of behavioral weight management interventions using lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring interventions was more pronounced when they were compared to usual care and in the short-term (less than six months). Furthermore, behavioral weight management interventions using lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring interventions showed a higher adherence than: (i) paper records at any time and (ii) any other intervention at six months and twelve months.\n\nA previous systematic review on the effect of mHealth applications on weight loss highlighted that the use of these interventions is widely accepted, easy to use and helpful in achieving weight loss goals  [12] . Additionally, there is evidence for the consistent and significant positive relationship between lifestyle (diet and physical activity) and behavior (self-monitoring) strategies and successful weight management  [5] . Likewise, our systematic review and meta-analysis supports the notion that mHealth self-monitoring interventions have a moderate effect on reducing weight, which may represent a mean weight loss of 1.78 kg greater than with other intervention types.\n\nOur results not only show a positive effect on weight loss but also fewer dropouts of subjects included in mHealth interventions in the short and long-term. The mechanisms through which behavioral weight management interventions using lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring are effective may be explained from two perspectives: the user and the clinical setting  [41] . For users, mHealth interventions enhance patients' self-efficacy and empowerment and improve daily life autonomy and adherence to treatment  [42] . Moreover, the mHealth approach reduces contact with the clinical setting and, as a consequence, decreases the workload for health care workers (physicians, nurses and nutritionists, especially in primary care)  [43, 44] .\n\nThere is a variety of devices that could be used for mHealth. Our subgroup analyses support the notion that smartphones, a technology available to a high proportion of the population worldwide  [45] , are the most effective mHealth devices for weight management. This, along with the high prevalence rates of both physical inactivity and obesity, has triggered a growing interest in the development of smartphone applications for health, fitness and diet, which have increased exponentially in the last few years  [46] . More than half of smartphone users may have downloaded a health application  [47] ; however, the use of these applications for clinical outcomes is still very limited and even non-existent in most contexts  [48] .\n\nThe limitations of this study are as follows: (1) the risk of bias assessment showed that a few studies presented some concerns or moderate risk of bias, while most showed a high or serious risk of bias. It should be noted that the main reason behind the high risk of bias in the included studies was the impracticality of blinding interventions, but this limitation is difficult to overcome in this type of intervention. (2)  The lack of studies using devices that did not allow for comparison between them, with reliable results only being obtained for smartphones. (3)  The intervention groups could be very different considering that they used different types of applications; however, they have the common characteristic that they were carried out through an mHealth device. (4) Many of the studies did not control for the effect of other covariates which could affect the results, such as educational or socioeconomic level. (5)  Regarding the analysis of adherence, it cannot be assumed that lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring is the only reason for participants to dropout, since these interventions are usually part of a broader behavioral weight management approach. (6) Finally, this meta-analysis showed publication bias, mainly due to the lack of studies with small sample sizes.\n\nEven with the risk of being branded as opportunists, we are not reluctant to emphasize the importance of mHealth interventions in times when face-to-face contact must be limited, such as those we are living in currently, particularly in clinical settings, in which the transmission of infectious diseases, namely Influenza or Sars-CoV-2, may be greater. Additionally, everything appears to indicate that the current concept of treatment will lead to an increase in the use of mHealth in daily clinical practice  [49] ."

      "text": "In summary, our study demonstrates that lifestyle mHealth self-monitoring interventions, as part of a behavioral weight management approach, are suitable interventions for short-term weight management in adults with overweight/obesity. Considering our results and the population's accessibility to smartphones, this type of device could be a useful and largely scalable tool for weight management. Thus, future well designed RCTs and controlled clinical trials with higher statistical power are essential in order to reinforce the evidence, which is still weak, to demonstrate that effective mHealth interventions could eventually change the current paradigm of lifestyle prescription, increasing patients' self-management of disease, developing new clinical practice guidelines and facilitating workflow in everyday clinical consultations."
