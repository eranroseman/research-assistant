  "title": "Drivers for emigration among healthcare professionals: Testing an analytical model in a primary healthcare setting",
  "abstract": "This paper aims to contribute to the discussion on health workforce migration, notably by testing an analytical model of the individual drivers for a professional to decide to emigrate. A large database was obtained from all primary health care units on mainland Portugal. A professional satisfaction survey was conducted and information on social-economic, labour and job satisfaction characteristics, including burnout, was obtained. Results showed that healthcare professionals who reported intention to emigrate are mostly male, young, not married, and more educated; they consider their income insufficient for their needs, and show higher levels of burnout at work and professional dissatisfaction. This profile is slightly different for GPs and nurses. The results obtained contribute to the discussion on what motivates primary health care professionals, including GPs and nurses, to emigrate. They also provide insight into the design of policy measures that may mitigate the intention of these healthcare professionals in general to emigrate.",

      "text": "Migration is a key aspect of the mobility of Human Resources for Health (HRH)  [1] , and according to the forecasts by the WHO  [2]  the number of migrant health professionals will continue to raise  [2] . For instance, across the US, UK, Australia and Canada together, foreign nurses and doctors account for 72 % and 69 % of all health professionals, respectively  [3] .\n\nHRH migration poses several challenges to health systems, including the planning of workforce needs  [4] . It is also known that it causes imbalances in workforce distribution by regions, specialities and services, which in turn undermine the quality of healthcare provision and compliance with universal health coverage (UHC)  [5, 6] . It may also be a symptom of imbalances in the transition from the education sector to the labour market and of ineffective policies of workforce retention  [7, 8] .\n\nOn the one hand, emigration among the more qualified health professionals, physicians and nurses in particular, is a loss for the home country where resources were used to train them and often the supply of these professionals is below the demand to ensure UHC and/or timely access to care  [9] .\n\nOn the other hand, immigrant health professionals usually face worse labour conditions and career opportunities compared to non-migrants (e.g. lower wages, difficult career progression and less skill differentiation), in addition to wider issues that echo on global health dynamics (e.g. predatory recruitment or protectionist policies against foreign workers)  [10] .\n\nTraditionally, the main migration flows of health professionals were from the global south to the global north, which generally describes the displacement from low to high-income countries. However, north-to-north migration that increased after the 2008 economic and financial crisis shows the extent to which the developed countries also deal with challenges of HRH planning, recruitment and retention, and blurs the dividing line between traditional categories of 'sending' and 'receiving' countries  [11] [12] [13] .\n\nSeveral efforts have been made to better understand the 'push factors' underpinning the professionals' decisions to emigrate, in particular those related to physicians and nurses. These factors include individual motivations, experiences and expectations; features of the health services such as working conditions; the legal framework for foreign professionals to practice; and the countries' social-political-economic circumstances. Changes in these factors will certainly affect the professionals' willingness to stay or leave, and where to live and work.\n\nHowever, it remains not entirely clear how professionals actually balance these factors in their decisions to work abroad, that is, which are the emigration drivers for health care professionals. This study aims to contribute to this discussion by testing an empirical model of the drivers of emigration that builds on: 1) better exploring the articulation between personal motivations and external factors; and 2) comparing the results among different professional groups. The model is tested in one EU country (Portugal) and in a particular healthcare service (primary health care).\n\nThe results aim to feed the discussion so that the model may be tested in other countries and health services, and therefore improve the understanding of HRH migration from a global perspective, in particular, concerning emigration decisions."

      "title": "Theoretical background",
      "text": "According to previous studies  [14, 15]  the interplay between multi-level factors underpinning professionals' intention to emigrate needs further attention. Perhaps unsurprisingly, political interventions aimed at preventing healthcare workforce emigration and better integrate immigrant health professionals continue to show poor results  [16] .\n\nFurthermore, the prevailing theoretical understanding of this issue builds on a binary vision between personal and external reasons. Personal reasons (i.e. those intrinsically related to the individual) are regarded as being of an arbitrary nature to politics, while the external ones (i.e. those related to services, the legal system, and the political and economic environment) as if they are decisive for individual preferences.\n\nIn this paper, we adopt a different perspective. Building on the core sociological premise, the personal-external dichotomy that has prevailed in the debate is artificial and less able to understand how individual choices operate. This can be explained first because the preferences of individuals are always linked to their surrounding contexts. Second, because these surrounding contexts on their own do not perfectly explain individual preferences (see  Correia (2016)    [17]  for a synthesis). The way health professionals decide to emigrate is by setting and managing individual preferences in relation to surrounding contexts, be they related to personal life or work contexts and experiences. In this perspective, personal and external factors stand out interrelated in the sense that organizational, legal, political and economic circumstances simultaneously shape and are shaped by individual interpretation and assessment.\n\nThe external factors that are likely to influence the professionals' decision to migrate can be grouped as follows: the architecture of health systems, the features of health services and professional belonging.\n\nThe influence of health systems regards aspects such as whether professional careers exist and in which terms (e.g. job security, exposure to market competition, and external assessment and accountability), as well as the characteristics of the labour market, which includes wages and working conditions  [18, 19] . Given that public, for-profit and not-for-profit private actors play different roles in the governance of the health system  [20] , notably in workforce training and employment, their influence on the institutional features of health systems highlights country-based differences in professional roles, the division of work  [23] , and institutional practice and collaboration cultures  [21, 24] . Country-based differences in HRH policies were particularly visible in the European region during the 2008 economic and financial crisis  [22]  which naturally influenced the health care professionals' perspectives concerning their careers.\n\nHealth services reflect service-level differences due to the nature of the care delivered (e.g. patient turnover, technological involvement), and the communities' epidemiological patterns and social-economic characteristics (e.g. burden and causes of diseases). At stake are different institutional features of health services that limit intra and inter-profession relationships (also known as 'organizational cultures' or 'work environment')  [25] .\n\nProfessional belonging speaks to profession-based impacts on the performance of work due to different compositions by age, gender, qualifications and income. The standpoint is that belonging to a certain profession is likely to influence the professionals' expectations and experiences with work-life balance, labour conditions, autonomy and accountability. Although the studies on HRH migration often include different professional groups and generally report inconclusive results, reflections on these findings remain somewhat limited  [25] ."

      "title": "Study design",
      "text": "This study was designed to be conducted in a single country and health service, given that the analytical model builds on understanding the influence of professional belonging on individual preferences. The relevance of professional belonging for workforce emigration relates to the argument that professions are likely to expose individuals to specific social-economic opportunities and constraints and work-related expectations and experiences.\n\nIntra-profession variations are also explored in the model through seniority and social-economic conditions. Seniority differentiates professionals' expectations with their work  [26] , motivation and exhaustion  [27] [28] [29] , which generally reflects in their satisfaction and well-being. The professionals' socialeconomic conditions relate with work-life balance and the available income."

      "text": "The selected setting was the primary health care in Portugal due to the convenience of data collection. Primary care units are part of the National Health Service (NHS), thus are publicly funded and their employees are civil servants. Nevertheless, several reforms aligned with quasi market-competition and labour deregulation over the last 15 years contributed to change the characteristics of public employment in the health sector  [30] . Nowadays, different contract types coexist for civil servants with variations of duration, wages and supplementary benefits. These changes call for the inclusion in the model of labour-related variables."

      "title": "Instrument and sample",
      "text": "Data were collected through an online questionnaire addressed at health professionals, composed of four groups of questions: i) social-demographic and labour characteristics, ii) job satisfaction, iii) burnout; and iv) opinions and attitudes.\n\nSocio-demographic data included gender, age, literacy and family status. The labour features encompassed professional category, regular working hours, experience coordinating, managerial or leadership functions, and seniority of the professionals in the unit and in the profession.\n\nMeasurement of job satisfaction was based on the questionnaire 'Hospital Employee Judgment System'  [31]  and was developed by the Centre for Health Studies and Research of the University of Coimbra, in Portugal, and validated for the Portuguese context  [32] . It measures the dimensions 'quality of the workplace', 'quality of services provided' and 'continuous quality improvement'.\n\nBurnout was measured by the Portuguese validated version of the Copenhagen Burnout Inventory  [33]  that encompasses three scales of burnout: personal, work-related, and patient-related  [34, 35] . According to the authors, personal burnout measures the professional's perception of psychological fatigue and exhaustion; work-related burnout refers to the extent to which a professional attaches his/her perception of physical and emotional fatigue and exhaustion to his/her work; and patient-related burnout measures how much he/she attributes his/her perceived feelings of physical and emotional fatigue and exhaustion to working with patients.\n\nThe questionnaire was applied to all 19,563 healthcare professionals in all 1,212 primary healthcare functional units in mainland Portugal, during four months, between January and April of 2018. The questionnaires were answered in a private access e-platform (LimeSurvey), using a password system to ensure anonymity, nonduplication and answers only from the target population. The questionnaire has been approved by the ethics commission called the National Commission for Individual Data Protection and the approval number is 103/2018. The professional groups included are general practitioners (GP), nurses, technicians and administrative staff. The type of data obtained are therefore cross-sectional."

      "title": "Variables",
      "text": "The dependent variable was obtained from the question about the intention to emigrate: \u1e26ave you emigrated or thought about emigrating? \u00a8. The possible answers were (i) \u00cf have emigrated and I came back to Portugal \u00a8, (ii) \u00cf am preparing to emigrate \u00a8, or (iii) \u00cf have not thought about emigrating \u00a8. The professionals who provided the first answer were excluded, because they have already pursued that intention and for some reason regretted it.\n\nFor the analysis, we considered a binary variable that captures the self-reported intention to emigrate: 1 for the respondents who provided the second answer, and 0 for all other (meaning the professionals who gave the third answer and those who did not answer). We have included the professionals who did not answer, because it may be the case that professionals who felt that they could not emigrate for family or health reasons were not able to find the right answer in the questionnaire.\n\nThe set of independent variables include social-economic variables, professional and labour variables, well-being variables and satisfaction indicators. These variables are described in Table  1 .\n\nThe variable that captures the effect of burnout in this study was the work-related burnout because the three dimensions (work, personal, and patient) were strongly correlated: r(personal, work) = 0.91; r(personal, patient) = 0.68, and r(work, patient) = 0.72, where r measures the pairwise correlation coefficient, all of which are significant at 5%.\n\nThe variable OS measures the overall satisfaction of professionals. It results from the aggregation of the measurement of the different independent variables: human resources (HR), morale (MOR), financial and technological resources (FTR), quality of services provided (QS) and continuous quality improvement (CQI). Since the variable OS results from the linear aggregation of the other variables, they cannot be used jointly due to multicollinearity. So two separate estimates were obtained: one includes the independent variable OS and the other several dimensions of OS. The strong correlation between age and professional experience (r = 0.84) also implies that we can only use one of the variables due to multicollinearity. We kept variable age, which measures age and it is a proxy for professional experience.\n\nThe variable FTR measures the level of satisfaction with salary received and technological equipment of the unit. It accounts for satisfaction dimensions such as responsibility, experience and accomplishment. We have estimated the linear relationship of the different components of this variable and income satisfaction accounts for about 50 % of the measure. Therefore, FTR measures the satisfaction with the pay-check received by professionals.\n\nFTR is different from the variable family income, which measures how professionals evaluate sufficiency of the income earned to satisfy their personal and family needs."

      "title": "Results",
      "text": "The number of valid questionnaires obtained amounted to 9.097 (46.4 % response rate). The sample includes all five regions of mainland Portugal, with a response rate ranging from 35.4 % in the Lisbon and Tagus Valley Region to 57.0 % in the North; and it includes all professional categories with a response rate varying from 37.2 % of GP and 54.1 % of administrative staff. This sample is representative of the primary care health professionals.\n\nThe sample includes 19 % of GPs, 32 % of nurses, 5% of technicians and 45 % of administrative staff. The majority are women (81.3 %), about 46 years old, with 21 years of professional experience; 76.6 % are married with children; 71.4 % report being in good or very good health and in general they hold a tenure contract (80.3 %). The mean value for education shows that on average the professionals have college degrees. The descriptive statistics of independent variables are displayed in Table  2 .\n\nThe dependent variable shows self-reported intention to emigrate of professionals: it is around 6.2 %, although GPs and nurses represent a slightly higher figure (see Table  3 ).\n\nThe results obtained from the estimation of our probit model for all healthcare professionals are presented in table S1 (in supplementary material).\n\nThe estimated coefficients of the two models show identical results, as expected. Thus, professionals who emigrate are young males, have less professional experience, are not married, have higher education degrees, are dissatisfied with the salary that does not meet the household needs, and are also the ones who present higher levels of burnout at work and lower levels of job satisfaction.\n\nTable  S2  (in supplementary material) displays the results for the estimation of the model, considering the dimensions of OS separately. For a simplified view of the results, Table  4  shows the summary of the significant results.\n\nThe results estimated show that when accounting for all professionals, they tend to find that their household income and their salaries are insufficient. Work-related burnout also increases the intention to emigrate. These individuals show overall low professional satisfaction, notably regarding human resource policies set by their managers and the quality improvement in the unit. Overall, social-economic factors, burnout and professional satisfaction predict the professionals' intention to emigrate; while children, contract type, self-assessed health and dissatisfaction with moral issues at work do not influence emigration intention.\n\nObserving the results by professional group, some differences are relevant. The intention to emigrate of GPs depends on their own and family income and conditions to perform their work (e.g. technological and those related with HRH policies), which includes self-assessed burnout. However, this intention is gender and agedependent (i.e. more common among younger men).\n\nNurses tend to afford similar importance to their own and the household income, as well as to burnout, technological conditions and HRH policies for performing their work. Also the decision is gender-sensitive, being more common among male nurses. Unlike GPs, marriage or living together, and the level of education limits the intention of nurses to emigrate: higher among not-married and the more differentiated professionals.\n\nThe 'push factors' for technicians are slightly different. These professionals tend to give more importance to the available household income than to their own salary. The more educated professionals also emigrate more easily. GPs, nurses, and technicians give importance to continuous quality improvement, but statistical significance is only observable for technicians. The fact these professionals are usually not involved in such decisions -that mostly depend on physicians and nurses -may help explain this result. To put it simply, they are hardly ever heard and must comply with decisions they do not control. Administrative staff follow the previous group in terms of the importance given to the available household income and the satisfaction with the quality of services provided.\n\nThe marginal effects are also presented in the supplementary material -Table  S3 . As a rule, the marginal effects of probits represent the impact on the dependent variable from a unit change in the independent variable, or the change from the base reference category, for the average of the individuals in the sample. The strongest positive influence arises from being male while the strongest negative comes from the sufficiency of the household income and the overall professional satisfaction."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "The discussion of HRH migration can be based on micro-and macro-level analyses. Developments in both levels are necessary to characterize migration flows, challenges and needs, as much as the professionals' willingness to leave or stay in their countries. It is also known that individual preferences are attached to the functioning of health systems, which includes looking at the interface with the education sector and the labour market  [53] .\n\nPrevious findings have already shown that migrations aim at pursuing different goals (e.g. skill development, escape from traumatic events, improvement of professional or personal living conditions), and thus lead to differences in the length of stay and conditions of integration in the destination countries  [36] . Improved working and employment conditions, training opportunities, and career progression are part of the solutions that have been pursued either to prevent unintended emigration among health professionals or to improve the wellbeing of immigrant health professionals  [15] . However, there has not been a precise understanding of how health professionals assess the array of factors in their decision to emigrate, and the extent to which these factors are common or specific among professional groups. This study aimed to foster knowledge on the micro-macro link underpinning health workforce migration.\n\nThe results confirm that the push factors can either include more narrowly work-related experiences or social-demographic and financial issues can mediate this influence.\n\nOther result is that there are common trends that cut across health professions, while others are specific to professional groups. One common trend is the importance of the available household income. According to  Glinos and Buchan (2014)    [36]  the 'livelihood migrant type' is the common migration flow from the south to north Europe. These migrants are driven by better living conditions, meaning that income is the main drive for migration. The fact that our results show the same trend for all professional groups, including the better educated ones, and in a high-income country suggests that the relevance of family income is not specific to the southnorth migration and needs to be better understood in consolidated health systems. One should not forget that the surveyed professionals work in the NHS and under relatively stable labour conditions. This result was already found in previous studies conducted in Portugal, specifically referring to junior doctors. Ramos and Alves  [37]  surveyed first-year general medical residents and found that men were more likely to consider working abroad mainly due to the income in the NHS. Several other studies in other European countries corroborate the importance of income as a driver for emigration regardless of differences of health professionals' remuneration among countries and the average wage level in the different countries  [15, [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] . The missing link is what bounds the importance of household income between low educated (and less remunerated) and high educated (and more remunerated) health workers. Is this missing link related to the analogous employment conditions? It may be that low and high educated health workers share a mismatch between their personal expectations and the labour conditions. In this sense, could this mismatch be a symptom that the trade-off between salary and effort is underestimated? Further research on this issue is needed.\n\nAs to the emigration drivers specific to professional groups, the evidence shows that differences exist between nurses and GPs. The main difference is the education factor. Nurses with higher levels of education are more likely to emigrate, but this factor is not relevant for GPs. This result has been found before for hospital nurses, as nurses with a specialty degree were more likely to report intention to emigrate than others with standard qualification  [15] .\n\nWorking conditions and environment are factors that contribute to professional satisfaction, which has been found to influence the decision to emigrate in several studies  [15, 39, 40] . Our results are partially in line with this trend. Both GPs and nurses have pointed out that their professional dissatisfaction was also encouraging them to emigrate. Physicians and nurses may be sensitive to human interaction and may be trained to take care of others. So they may feel particularly dissatisfied with the working conditions and suffer from burnout due to the inability to respond well to patients' needs. On the other hand, professional dissatisfaction among technicians and administrative staff is not such a clear driver for emigration, perhaps because these professionals do not feel such heavy pressure for taking care of others and so they are not so motivated by working conditions.\n\nWe found that women are less likely to report the intention to emigrate in all professional categories except technicians, which is in accordance with other studies  [37, 39, 40, 42] . Interestingly, we also found that being married mitigates the intention to emigrate, but having children was not a significant driver.\n\nIn short, the added-value of this study is two-fold. First, it brings empirical evidence, supported by a large sample, on the 'push factors' in different health professions, which proves the need to adopt a nuanced understanding of the reasons underpinning professionals' intention to emigrate that brings to closer attention the role of professional belonging. Second, it proves the relevance of the theoretical assumptions underpinning the analytical model, as the 'push factors' cannot be assumed as if they are of an arbitrary nature in the professionals' intention to stay or leave. Those contributions can help policy makers to design policies aimed at retaining professionals in a country that uses its own resources to create human capital for healthcare.\n\nWe tested this model in one health system and setting (primary health care) to better understand the role of professional belonging in the intention to emigrate. The application of this model in other settings and in other countries could contribute to expand of our knowledge on this topic. To develop the model in these directions, it is important not to forget the need to avoid institutional and political biases related to specific economic, political, social and epidemiological circumstances  [16] . Also important when testing the model in other countries is the inclusion of the Erasmus Program as another possible emigration driver. Even though in Portugal it is little used by other than students and academic staff, its relevance in the decision to emigrate needs to be tested. One limitation of the study emerges from the confidentiality of the participants' social-economic characterization. The list of characteristics does not include their nationality, which may be a relevant driver for migration, in particular, in Europe. Another limitation regards the possibly bias of respondents' decision to not complete the questionnaires. However, with a 46.4 % response rate, representing a sample size of 9,097 professionals, it provides a consistent picture of the primary healthcare professionals in mainland Portugal. Finally, since data obtained from the questionnaire were crosssectional, no direct or explicit causality can be inferred between independent variables and the intention to emigrate. In order to test causality, the questionnaire would need to be applied over different years, which is not possible due to the scarce resources available for this project. Causality analysis can be a way to foster the evidence presented in this study."

      "title": "Conclusion and policy recommendation",
      "text": "The political implication of this study supports the idea that policy response designed to retain or better integrate the workforce must be best suited to the intended target audience. This is aligned with the debate about the improvement of workforce governance. A good workforce governance provide proper responses to new healthcare needs arising from demographic, epidemiological and socio-cultural changes  [43] [44] [45] [46] .\n\nThis study advances in this direction to consider that the adjustment of policy response to migration of the HRH has to be much closer to the needs and expectations of health professionals. It is not a matter of advocating policy response capable of dealing with individuality, but to realize that there are lower levels of analysis closer to health professionals that make it possible to identify smaller groups that share needs and expectations.\n\nHuman resources for health is closely related to sub-functions and types of relationships inside health governance  [47] [48] [49] [50] . The critical importance of strengthening the health workforce as a strategy to improve the performance of health service system has been widely recognized  [51] . This strategy is supported by the idea that good and well-trained health workforce is a vital resource for health service delivery and for the ability to respond to the population's health needs  [47] . From the perspective of workforce governance, this paper contributes to understanding and improving the factors needed to support good workforce governance in the health system.\n\nFrom a policy recommendation perspective and taking into account previous proposals on retention strategies in healthcare  [52] , the results found here point to measures aimed at the organizational factors, in particular employment, work and organizational quality. The major factor that influences employment is remuneration. Improving monetary compensation will have a visible impact on the intention to emigrate by health care professionals. Improvements of the work quality aimed at promoting work satisfaction and burnout control are also expected to contribute to the retention of professionals. Measures focusing on the decrease of administrative burden, high workload, and work stress levels may contribute to enhancing work quality. Finally, a better quality of the organization is achieved by applying measures that enhance leadership in the primary care units. Measures like these may be expected to reduce the reported intention to emigrate and to guarantee the sustainability of and accessibility to health care services."
