  "title": "Development and Validation of a Safety Scale Perceived by the Witness of Prehospital Emergency Care",
  "abstract": "Objective: The aim of the study was to design and validate a new tool to measure the security perceived by witnesses of patient care and hospital transfers, after requesting urgent assistance via the \"061\" phone number. Methods: This is a descriptive observational, cross-sectional, design, and validation study of a scale conducted by telephone interview. Witnesses of urgent assistance and transfers by prehospital emergency medical services in the province of Cadiz, in the south of Spain, were the subjects of study. A questionnaire was designed after focus groups with patients, witnesses, and professionals. It consisted of 10 items, with Likert-type answers, and a range of 0 to 50 points. In addition to basic criteria (frequency of endorsement and ability to discriminate between groups), their validity (content and construct) and reliability (stability and homogeneity) were evaluated. Stability was evaluated by test-retest and homogeneity by means of two properties: internal consistency of items (corrected item-scale correlation coefficient) and internal consistency of the scale (Cronbach \u03b1 coefficient). Results: A total of 849 questionnaires were obtained, with scores between 0 and 50 points, with an average of 47.31 (median of 50). The exploratory factor analysis detected a component that explained 61.1% of the total variance. The intraclass correlation coefficient was 0.933 with 95% confidence interval between 0.900 and 0.954. The corrected item-scale correlation coefficient was greater than 0.596, and the Cronbach \u03b1 coefficient was 0.927 (95% confidence interval, 0.919-0.934). \n Conclusions: The ESPT10 Witness Perceived Safety Scale is valid and reliable for quantifying the safety perception of witnesses of emergency assistance and transfers.",

      "text": "T he World Health Organization launched the World Alliance for Patient Safety in 2004 to improve healthcare safety worldwide focusing on patient safety research and self-involvement in patient safety.  1  The Research Programme was created to encourage countries to include research in this field as one of their priorities,  2  as well as the Patients for Patient Safety initiative, to ensure that the views of patients/families were present: \"Patients and their lay carers see things that are often overlooked by busy healthcare staff.\"  3  In the Spanish context, the Strategy for Patient Safety of the National Health System also involved the Autonomous Communities, which developed the same strategic lines.  4, 5 In Andalusia, the most populated Autonomous Community of Spain with 8,379,820 inhabitants, the prehospital emergency teams belong to the Public Company for Health Emergencies (EPES-061). EPES-061 was founded in 1994 by the Ministry of Health of the Regional Government of Andalusia, to provide assistance to healthcare emergencies throughout the Autonomous Community of Andalusia via the telephone number \"061\".  6 It has eight emergency coordination centers, one in each Andalusian province, with a total of 30 ground emergency teams (made up of health emergency technician, nurse and doctor), five advanced coordination teams (consisting of health emergency technicians and nurses), and five airborne emergency teams with emergency helicopters (consisting of nurses and doctors). In 2017, 1,224,496 requests for healthcare assistance were attended by the emergency coordination centers, of which 63.30% were classified as vital emergencies (8.68%) or urgent assistance (54.62%). The different teams of EPES-061 attended 66,969 patients throughout the year.  7 n recent years, research based on the opinion of patients/ families has shown that the concept of safety is different for them.  8, 9 To learn their opinions, perceptions and experiences of clinical safety in hospitals, qualitative studies investigating the meaning of feeling safe have been published. The responses differed from what professionals traditionally understood; for patients,\"safety\" was not equal to \"absence of errors,\" but other aspects such as trust, communication, information, continuity of care, and psychological support are essential to ensure safety in the clinical setting.  [10] [11] 1] [12] [13]  Thus, the Ministry of Health of Spain proposed to develop and validate a questionnaire to measure the perception of safety in relation to health care, for which it reviewed the literature published until then by evaluating the questionnaires related to the subject.  14 Although the questionnaire designed to measure the concept of \"feeling safe in the hospital setting\" was very generic, several studies have therefore evaluated, using different methodologies, the perception of safety in more specific care settings such as nephrology,  [15] [16] [17]  surgery,  18  intensive care,  19, 20  oncology,  9, 21, 22  and hospital emergencies.  23 Questionnaires adapted to the field of prehospital emergency care could not be found. The only questionnaire referring to prehospital emergency medical services (EMS) aims to measure the safety culture among professionals.  24 n addition to the intrinsic complexity of health emergencies, the risks arising from the variability of the environment in which we work (homes, roads, public roads, etc), the key time factor (tasks and decisions in the shortest possible time), working with verbal orders (drugs, doses, infusions, etc), or the fact that a single team sometimes assists several patients with a multitude of simultaneous tasks is to be taken into account. In addition, under circumstances of confusion, stress, illness, ignorance of the environment, a sense of threat, and loss of autonomy for mobilization,  25, 26  the person is more vulnerable to physical or psychological risks.  27, 28 For all these reasons, years ago, it was decided to design and validate a new tool to quantify the perception of security. The study published by our team demonstrated the psychometric properties of the ESP16 Perceived Safety Scale for patients transferred to hospital after prehospital emergency care.  29 owever, it felt necessary and complementary to have an alternative scale to use when the patient himself was unable to respond, such as in cases of altered level of consciousness, previous or subsequent cognitive impairment, or intellectual disability. As already suggested by the World Health Organization, the witness of the assistance would be a key actor who could provide his or her own perception. Thus, a study with the hypothesis that it would be possible to know the perception of security of the witnesses of the assistances in emergent demands was designed, by means of a valid and reliable scale. Taking into account our previous experience, the security perceived by the witness should not be associated with the age or sex of the witness but should be associated with the level of studies, the type of transfer (whether or not assisted by a doctor and nurse), the degree of satisfaction, and the perceived safety of the patient himself.\n\nThe objective in this study was to design and validate a new tool to measure the perceived safety of witnesses present in patient care and transfers to hospital by prehospital EMS, after demanding urgent medical care, which can be used as an indicator of patient safety quality  30  complementary to the adverse event notification systems and the ESP16 Perceived Safety Scale."

      "text": "This is a descriptive observational, cross-sectional, design, and validation study of a scale conducted by telephone interview. Witnesses (whether family members or not) of assistance and transfers to the hospital by prehospital EMS of patients who requested emergency medical assistance via \"061\" phone number, in the province of Cadiz (Andalusia, Spain), were the subjects of the study. Underaged, persons with communication barriers (language, sensory, perceptual) or intellectual disabilities were excluded.\n\nFocus groups were used to design the questionnaire: one of patients and witnesses to learn about their experiences and another of expert professionals. Based on the information obtained, a first questionnaire was designed with 13 items, with alternative Likerttype answers, from 0 (total disagreement) to 5 (total agreement). A pilot test was carried out in an intentionally selected sample of 40 cases (mean \u00b1 SD age, 46.1 \u00b1 13.9 y; 60% women; 42.5% with primary education). The validity of the appearance (to debug errors and control design defects) and sociocultural (understanding of questions and completion) were evaluated, and then, the wording of two items was modified, eliminating three, and changing the order, resulting in a questionnaire with 10 items called the ESPT10 Witness Perceived Safety Scale.\n\nFor the validation of the definitive questionnaire, the subjects were selected by consecutive sampling, among all the assistances of the province of Cadiz, in such a way as to ensure the representation in the sample of the different types of assistance and transfers that appear daily, with a variability similar to that of the population under study. The selected subjects were given the questionnaire 20-30 days after the emergency care. A single person, previously trained, contacted by telephone, requesting informed consent so that the answers and data could be used for this investigation, guaranteeing the anonymity and confidentiality of the data. In addition, sociodemographic data were collected, as well as the degree of satisfaction with the assistance. To determine the patient's perceived safety, the ESP16 scale was used when the patient could also be contacted. The variable type of transfer was obtained from the Information System of the Public Company for Health Emergencies. All data were collected in a Microsoft Access 2016 database and further processed for statistical analysis with SPSS Statistics, Version 24.0 for Windows (IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY).\n\nFor descriptive analysis, means, medians, and SDs were calculated in quantitative variables and absolute and relative frequencies in categorical variables. In addition to the basic criteria for the validation of the questionnaire (frequency of endorsement and capacity for discrimination of each item), an evaluation of the validity and reliability was carried out.\n\nThe validity was evaluated according to two of its dimensions: content and construct. The validity of the content was assessed by means of a \"judges' test,\" with opinions and input from expert professionals. They were asked to review the final questionnaire and assess its suitability in our context, ensuring that the items were representative of the construct.\n\nThe validity of the construct was evaluated by analyzing the factorial structure of the scale, which allowed us to determine whether the items reflected different gradations of a single dimension or whether they were distributed in a multidimensional space. An exploratory factorial analysis of the unweighted items was performed, using as extraction method the analysis of main components with Varimax rotation, including the items with auto values of greater than 1. In addition, for hypothesis testing, bivariate analysis was performed by calculating Spearman \u03c1 correlation coefficient for quantitative variables and the Mann-Whitney U and Kruskal-Wallis H tests for categorical variables. A value of P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.\n\nThe assessment of the reliability of the questionnaire was based on stability and homogeneity. To evaluate stability, the test-retest technique was used, and the same questionnaire was passed 3 weeks later to a 10% subsample. The reproducibility of the questionnaire was established by comparing the scores obtained in the two interviews and calculating the intraclass correlation coefficient. Homogeneity, or internal reliability, was examined through two properties: internal consistency of its items (determining the corrected item scale correlation coefficient) and internal consistency of the scale (determining the Cronbach \u03b1 coefficient)."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "The results of this work reveal that the ESPT10 Witness Perceived Safety Scale can be a valid and reliable tool to measure the perceived safety of out-of-hospital care when the patient is unable to respond and can complement other indicators that measure adverse events or safety incidents. Upon completion, its feasibility is noteworthy because all subjects were able to answer all questions. It meets basic validation criteria, with endorsement frequencies within recommended limits, and all items with discriminant capability with the total scale. When validating its structure, there is only one component that would explain a large part of the total variance of the scale.\n\nRegarding the construct, the hypotheses previously presented, in accordance with the Questionnaire on the Perception of Safety Of Healthcare in the Hospital Setting 14 and the ESP16 Perceived Safety Scale 29 was compared. The results indicate, in line with these studies, that the perceived safety of the witness does not depend on the variables age and sex. These are independent variables. On the contrary, as was already the case in the validation of ESP16, the level of studies does relate to the scale score, so that the group of illiterate people scores below the other levels of study. This did not happen in the Ministry of Health of Spain questionnaire because they did not have patients who could not read or write.\n\nFurthermore, Type of transfer is not a variable related to the safety perceived by the witness, contrary to when the patient  himself responded. In this way, when the witness tells us about his or her perceived safety, he or she does not distinguish between the transfer being assisted (by a doctor and a nurse) or not, obtaining the same scores in both cases. This discrepancy could be explained by the fact that during the assisted transfer the witness is not with the patient, but in the driver's cabin, and therefore does not really know what is happening in the assistance cabin, contrary to what the patient perceives. With regard to the degree of satisfaction, as in the validation of ESP16, a strong positive association was found with the score on the scale. This relationship is in line with the results obtained in the satisfaction survey carried out by EPES-061 since 1998 among the patients assisted, where the results in 2017 were 9.54 of 10. 6 On the other hand, the patient's perceived safety was also positively related to that of the witness, although with a weaker relationship than the previous one. This is reasonable, because these are two different views of the same concept.\n\nAs for the reliability of the scale, the results suggest good stability after retesting weeks later (intraclass correlation coefficient greater than the recommended 0.75), with no significant differences between the scores of the two interviews. From the subsequent homogeneity analysis, we can highlight the excellent internal consistency of each of the items with the total scale (correlations over 0.40 recommended) and of the scale itself (Cronbach \u03b1 much higher than 0.70 recommended).\n\nIt is noteworthy in relation to the collection of data that the timing of the interview of these witnesses conditioned the choice of the type of administration of the questionnaire. It was not considered opportune to give a questionnaire moment after the  The professionals had the necessary equipment to assist the patient properly 0.596 0.925 07. I believe that the professionals did all their tasks correctly during the assistance 0.768 0.916 08. The professionals protected the patient sufficiently to prevent falls during transport 0.688 0.921 09. The patient was covered by the professionals during the care 0.689 0.921 10. If I needed assistance, I would trust on the same professionals who assisted the patient. 0.818 0.913 assistance, so as not to incur a possible classification bias, because the health professional could be influencing the witness's answers.\n\nA heteroadministered questionnaire was chosen by telephone interview, in which the figure of the interviewer was acknowledged to avoid this bias. A period of 20 to 30 days was considered for the interview to avoid a possible selection bias, caused by inability to interview witnesses of patients who were still hospitalized, and might have had a more serious process than those who were not hospitalized.\n\nCompleting the questionnaire by telephone was a known difficulty of previous studies, when it is necessary to contact users: in many cases, we do not have the contact telephone number of the patient/family member to be able to communicate. Normally, the alertor's telephone number is reflected, and he or she usually witnesses the event (a citizen, a policeman, etc) but does not have to be a witness to the assistance. However, there is no reason to believe that this information could be manipulated by collecting data selectively from witnesses, so the selection bias seems unlikely.\n\nFinally, it has not been possible to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the scale, because there is no external criterion to the instrument that could be used as a reference standard in this analysis, a criterion standard."
