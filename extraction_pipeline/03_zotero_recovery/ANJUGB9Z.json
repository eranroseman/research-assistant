  "title": "Active Choice and Financial Incentives to Increase Rates of Screening Colonoscopy-A Randomized Controlled Trial",
  "abstract": "Behavioral economic approaches could increase uptake for colorectal cancer screening. We performed a randomized controlled trial of 2245 employees to determine whether an email containing a phone number for scheduling (control), an email with the active choice to opt in or opt out (active choice), or the active choice email plus a $100 incentive (financial incentive) increased colonoscopy completion within 3 months. Higher proportions of participants in the financial incentive group underwent screening (3.7%) than in the control (1.6%) or active choice groups (1.5%) (P [ .01 and P < .01). We found no difference in uptake of screening between the active choice and control groups (P [ .88). The $100 conditional incentive modestly but significantly increased colonoscopy use.

      "text": "R outine screening is an established cost-effective approach for reducing mortality from colorectal cancer (CRC), the second leading cause of cancer death. Screening is low despite efforts to increase uptake.  1  Behavioral economics offers the potential to increase screening by harnessing predictable biases to encourage people to make more rational choices.  2  Behavioral economic approaches have been shown to improve health behaviors in a variety of settings,  [3] [4] [5]  and they may be particularly applicable to CRC screening.  6 roviding an \"active choice\" leads people to actively choose or decline, thus making the screening decision more salient and mitigating the tendency to put off the decision until later.  7 \"Enhanced active choice\" favors one of the options by highlighting the losses associated with the nonpreferred choice. Financial incentives can also provide immediate and certain benefits that might encourage participation among those insufficiently motivated by the future health benefits of screening.\n\nThe majority of large employers in the US offer financial incentives, typically greater than a hundred dollars, for employees to adopt healthier behaviors. This study evaluated if an enhanced active choice prompt with or without patient financial incentives increased participation in screening colonoscopy.\n\nA total of 2,250 employees between the ages of 50-64 were randomly allocated to receive an email containing a phone number to schedule screening colonoscopy (control), an email with the active choice to opt in or opt out of scheduling (active choice), or the active choice email plus an offer of a $100 conditional incentive to participate (financial incentive); 2,245 were included in the analyses because 5 participants had undeliverable emails (Table  1 , Supplementary Figure  1 ). The primary outcome was the percentage of participants who completed colonoscopy within 3 months. See Supplementary Materials and Methods section for details.\n\nThere was no statistically significant difference in colonoscopy completion between the active choice (1.5%) and control arms (1.6%) (P \u00bc .88) (Table  2 ). The financial incentive arm had a higher colonoscopy completion rate (3.7%) than both the control and active choice arms (P \u00bc .011 and .006, respectively). Appointment scheduling had comparable rates for the control (2.1%), active choice (2.0%), and financial incentive (4.8%) arms. There was a greater proportion of participants who said 'yes' to screening in the financial incentive arm (15.5%) as compared with the active choice arm (8.7%) (P < .01). The additional 16 screened individuals in the financial incentive arm (as compared with control) cost $2800 in incentives, which translates to an incremental cost of $175 each.\n\nThis study evaluated behavioral economic approaches to increasing employee participation in screening colonoscopy. The active choice approach did not increase participation, but the $100 conditional incentive led to a statistically significant, but small in magnitude, increase in colonoscopy completion at a cost of $175 for each additional employee screened.\n\nActive choice has been used to make decision-making more immediate to participants.  7 In this study, the choice of selecting 'no' required endorsing a statement emphasizing the harms of that choice, which is called enhanced active choice.  7 We found greater initial response rates in the active choice arm than the control arm, but the rate of scheduling was the same because it was often difficult for the scheduling representatives to reach the participant on the phone. The benefits of active choice may have been offset by the requirement for two separate touchpoints, increasing the friction of scheduling for what is already a complex event.\n\nFinancial incentives have been shown to increase participation in health-promoting behaviors such as smoking cessation, medication adherence, and weight loss.  [3] [4] 4] [5]  In the case of stool testing for CRC screening, $5 and $10 incentives did not increase rates, but a lottery with a 1 in 5 chance of winning $50 was effective.  8, 9 No published studies have evaluated if financial incentives could increase screening colonoscopy rates. Indeed, the most substantial financial approach has been the elimination of patient cost-sharing for CRC screening under the Affordable Care Act, which in some populations included a reduction of $500.  10  However, no increase in CRC screening followed the elimination of cost-sharing.  10, 11 he success of the financial incentive in this study might be because of the magnitude or design of the incentive.\n\nColonoscopy is challenging for patients, requiring a day off from work, a bowel cleansing preparation, and transportation, in addition to the non-financial costs of anxiety and discomfort. Smaller incentives may be insufficient to overcome those challenges. Although a $100 incentive seems relatively large, this amount is comparable to what employers offer for completion of health risk assessments or biometric screening activities, which in the absence of behavior change interventions, arguably have smaller health benefits. Colonoscopy navigator programs can range in cost from $50 to $500 per patient.  12, 13 Screening colonoscopy is also widely considered cost-effective as compared with other screening activities.  14 Because the intervention used email communication and existing call center operations, it would require minimal additional staff resources. Finally, this incentive was offered through the employer (who was also the health care provider) and was situated in the context of scheduling, which increased the trust and convenience of the activity, but may limit generalizability to other settings.\n\nThis study has limitations. First, it was conducted in an employee population, so we did not have access to clinical or claims data, and could not target only those who were not up-to-date with screening. This dilutes the impact of the intervention, but this applies to all arms in the randomization, and the call center asked screening questions before scheduling the procedure. Second, the intervention was less of a true active choice where participants cannot progress until they make a selection, so they could still choose not to respond at all. Third, the effect of the financial incentive was modest in impact, but because the target population included a significant portion who had already been screened, those response rates are artificially low. For example, 20%-22% of the target population responded to the email as being already screened, and internal analysis estimated about a 60% screening rate before this intervention, from which we could extrapolate a 9% response rate in the financial incentive arm among those that were due for screening. Fourth, we only offered colonoscopy and not the choice of stool testing, which has been shown to increase response to colon cancer screening outreach.  15 trengths include its prospective design and patient-level randomization to account for unobserved variables.

All participants received email communication describing the importance of colorectal cancer screening and offering direct access scheduling of screening colonoscopy. We compared the following approaches: 1) Direct access phone line for scheduling (control); 2) a web-based active choice intervention (active choice); and 3) the active choice intervention and a $100 incentive to participate (financial incentive). Approval was obtained from the University of Pennsylvania Institutional Review Board. The protocol was registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02660671)."

Participants were identified in February 2016 and recruited by study staff from February 2016 through May 2016. Eligible participants were 50-64 years old at the time of identification who lived within 30 miles from the primary screening sites and had not received prior outreach from this program. Consistent with a pragmatic trial, there were no other exclusion criteria. Before the intervention, no attempt was made to identify or exclude those employees who were upto-date with colorectal cancer screening recommendations because many employees received prior screening at other institutions and we could not access electronic health record data before the outreach. From this group, 2,250 employees were randomly selected to meet power requirements."

      "text": "Eligible participants were randomized to the 3 arms in a 1:1:1 allocation ratio, in a permuted block design with block sizes of 250. Informed consent was waived because the research posed no more than minimal risk to participants, as colonoscopy is considered standard of care for colorectal cancer screening and the research could not be practicably carried out without the waiver. To accommodate the capacity of the call center, we conducted outreach in 3 batches, every 6 weeks. All participants received an email describing the importance of colorectal cancer screening and describing a VIP service to schedule screening colonoscopy without a referral from a provider. These emails were sent by research staff who were not blinded to allocation arms. The investigators were blinded to patient data and randomization.\n\nThose in the control arm received an email containing information about the importance of colon cancer screening and a phone number to call to schedule screening. Those in the active choice arm received a similar email with 3 hyperlinked options to click on: 1) Sign up now; 2) I do not wish to reduce my chances of dying from colon cancer; and 3) I have already been screened. Upon clicking \"sign up now,\" employees could opt for a phone call from the VIP scheduling service or choose up to 3 time slots on a calendar when they would like to be scheduled. The form also allowed them to choose the time (morning or afternoon) and the endoscopy center location for the procedure. The financial incentive arm followed the procedure for the active choice arm and also offered a $100 gift card that would be given after completing colon cancer screening. Each participant who did not respond was sent a follow-up email with similar language 1 week after initial outreach, and another 2 weeks after initial outreach.\n\nResearch staff collected the data from the active choice and financial incentive arms weekly and sent the names and phone numbers of those opting for appointments to the call center. Staff from the call center called those who had indicated interest in participating up to 3 times to schedule the appointment. In addition, the call center sent the study team weekly updates of employees from the control arm who scheduled screening. Call center staff followed existing protocol for scheduling open access screening colonoscopy, which included asking about prior screening status. Upon completion of screening, participants in the financial incentive arm received a $100 gift card because this is comparable to wellness incentives that are offered in this population."

With 750 participants in each of the 3 arms, and considering a 2-sided P value <.05 as statistically significant, the study was designed to have 80% power to detect a difference between all 3 arms with a response rate of 1% in the control arm, 3% in the active choice arm, and 6% in the financial incentive arm. Those participants with deliverable emails were included in the analyses. Analyses were performed using c 2 test of proportions with STATA version 13.0 (Stata Corp LP, College Station, TX). We also performed cost analysis from the perspective of the employer or insurer to offer financial incentives.
