      "text": "Background: Insufficient sleep duration is highly prevalent in childhood and is associated with obesity, especially among middle school-aged children. The primary care setting has enormous potential to promote sleep, but limited time and sleep resources at in person appointments are key barriers. Digital health innovations offer solutions to these barriers. Mobile health platforms can be developed to deliver behavioral sleep promotion remotely in the home setting, with tailoring to individual and contextual factors to help ensure equitable effectiveness across sociodemographic groups. This paper presents the protocol for a randomized optimization trial using the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) to develop a mobile health platform for the pediatric care setting to promote longer sleep duration for childhood obesity prevention.\n\nMethods: This is a single-site study being conducted at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. We will randomize children, aged -y, with a body mass index (BMI) between the th-th percentile, and who sleep < . h per night. The Way to Health mobile platform will facilitate remote communication and data collection. A sleep tracker will estimate sleep patterns for -months (week run-in; -month intervention; \u2248 . -month follow-up). A randomized factorial design will assess four components: sleep goal (\u2265 h or \u2265 min above baseline sleep duration), digital guidance (active or active with virtual study visits), caregiver incentive (inactive or active), and performance feedback (inactive or active). Fat mass will be measured at baseline, -, and -months using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry. Total energy intake and the timing and composition of meals will be measured using -h dietary recalls at baseline, -, and months. Sociodemographic data (e.g., sex, race, ethnicity) will be measured using self-report and home addresses will be geocoded for geospatial analyses.\n\nDiscussion: We anticipate that this innovative optimization trial will identify optimal component settings for sleep promotion in children, with clinically meaningful improvements in fat mass trajectories. Importantly, the platform will have broad impact by promoting sleep health equity across sociodemographic groups. With the optimal settings identified, we will be able to determine the effectiveness of the final intervention package under the evaluation phase of the MOST framework in a future randomized controlled trial.

      "text": "In the 1960s the prevalence of obesity among U.S. children was 5%  (Troiano et al., 1995) , and it increased three-fold to 15% by the late 1990s  (Ogden et al., 2002) . The prevalence increased further to 18% by the late 2000s  (Ogden et al., 2010 (Ogden et al., , 2012) )  and has remained at this excessively high level into the present  (Ogden et al., 2014) . Childhood obesity affects both sexes equally but is disproportionally higher among Black children and children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds  (Ogden et al., 2018) . Childhood obesity is associated with multiple co-morbidities and chronic diseases in later life, especially cardiovascular diseases  (Bjorge et al., 2008; Tirosh et al., 2011; Steinberger et al., 2016; Twig et al., 2016) . Further, childhood obesity tracks into adulthood  (The et al., 2010; Rundle et al., 2020) , and if left unchecked an estimated 57% of children born today will be obese when they are 35 years old  (Ward et al., 2017) . A key Healthy People 2030 goal is to reduce the prevalence of childhood obesity to 15.5%  (Healthy People 2030 , 2021b) . Meeting this goal will require a multi-sector approach and the pediatric healthcare setting has a critical role. Indeed, an American Academy of Pediatrics Clinical Report detailed the pediatrician's role in preventing childhood obesity and highlighted sleep promotion as a preventive measure that is needed in pediatric healthcare  (Daniels et al., 2015) ."

      "title": ". . Sleep and pediatric obesity",
      "text": "In 2008, two independent meta-analyses of cross-sectional studies reported that shorter sleep duration was associated with childhood obesity as defined by body mass index (BMI)  (Cappuccio et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2008) . The meta-analysis by Chen et al. included 10 cross-sectional studies and reported that shorter sleep duration was associated with a 1.58 (95% CI: 1.26-1.98) increased odds of childhood obesity  (Chen et al., 2008) . The meta-analysis by Cappuccio et al. included 11 cross-sectional studies and reported that shorter sleep duration was associated with a 1.89 (95% CI: 1.46-2.43) increased odds of obesity  (Cappuccio et al., 2008) . Meta-analyses involving longitudinal studies have been completed and provide evidence of temporality, with shorter sleep duration leading to childhood obesity  (Fatima et al., 2015; Ruan et al., 2015; Miller et al., 2018) . Indeed, the latest meta-analysis of longitudinal studies reported that shorter sleep duration was associated with the incidence of overweight and obesity across all ages in childhood, with the strongest association observed in middle school aged children (RR = 2.23, 95%CI: 2.21-2.27) (Miller et al., 2018) .\n\nShorter sleep has been associated with other obesity phenotypes in childhood, including waist circumference and estimates of fat mass using bioelectrical impedance, dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, and skinfold thickness techniques  (Garaulet et al., 2011; Cespedes et al., 2014; Martinez et al., 2014; Mcneil et al., 2015; Collings et al., 2017; Derks et al., 2017; Nam et al., 2017; Cespedes Feliciano et al., 2018 , 2019) ."

      "title": ". . Sleep and obesity: biological plausibility",
      "text": "It has been proposed that shorter sleep leads to a positive energy balance by increasing energy (calorie) intake and/or decreasing physical activity energy expenditure  (Taheri, 2006) . For the latter, the logic is that shorter sleep leads to tiredness and fatigue and therefore less physical activity, but evidence for this mechanism is mixed  (Ortega et al., 2010 (Ortega et al., , 2011;; Foti et al., 2011; Mitchell et al., 2016; Hart et al., 2017; Vincent et al., 2017; Armstrong et al., 2021; Jindal et al., 2021) . In contrast, there is compelling evidence that shorter sleep duration is associated with increased energy intake  (Weiss et al., 2010; St-Onge et al., 2011; Markwald et al., 2013; Spaeth et al., 2013; Fisher et al., 2014; Hjorth et al., 2014; Kjeldsen et al., 2014; Franckle et al., 2015; Hunsberger et al., 2015; Al Khatib et al., 2017; Martinez et al., 2017; Rangan et al., 2018; Mi et al., 2019) . The simplest explanation is that more time awake allows for more opportunities to eat. However, more complex biology may be involved. First, the majority of the additional calories are consumed in the late evening  (Markwald et al., 2013; Spaeth et al., 2013) . Night eating may be particularly obesogenic and restricting food intake to be aligned with circadian rhythms could help to prevent obesity  (Arble et al., 2009; Panda, 2016; Xiao et al., 2019; Chow et al., 2020; Phillips et al., 2021) . For instance, mice fed a high fat diet gained excessive weight only when they were free to eat throughout their 24-h sleep-wake cycle and not when food access was restricted to the dark period (equivalent of daytime in nocturnal humans)  (Hatori et al., 2012) ; and there are emerging data that time restricted feeding improves weight and cardiometabolic health in humans  (Chow et al., 2020; Wilkinson et al., 2020; Phillips et al., 2021) . Second, experimental sleep restriction in adults has been shown to cause changes in hormones that regulate energy homeostasis in the hypothalamus that could promote increased energy intake (e.g., reductions in leptin and increases in ghrelin)  (Spiegel et al., 2004a,b) ; however, this hormonal hypothesis is not universally supported  (Hitze et al., 2009; Nedeltcheva et al., 2009; St-Onge et al., 2011; Hart et al., 2013; Markwald et al., 2013; Boeke et al., 2014) . Third, shorter sleep may alter how the brain processes food cues, increasing temptation to eat  (St-Onge et al., 2012 , 2014; Demos et al., 2017) . Functional magnetic resonance imaging has revealed that brain regions associated with reward are more active upon viewing unhealthy foods after sleep restriction, compared to healthy sleep conditions  (St-Onge et al., 2014) . It has also been proposed that shorter sleep can up-regulate the odorprocessing region of the brain and this heightened sense of smell may lead to increased consumption energy-dense foods  (Bhutani et al., 2019) . Finally, sleep-restriction impairs cognition, which may affect rational decision-making, including decisions about foods consumption  (Pardi et al., 2017) ."

      "title": ". . Behavioral sleep promotion strategies in childhood",
      "text": "The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends that children  (6-12y)  and adolescents (13-18y) sleep for 9-12 h and 8-10 h per day, respectively  (Paruthi et al., 2016) . However, data from the Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Survey revealed that most middle school (53%) and high school students (65%) do not meet these recommendations  (Wheaton et al., 2016 (Wheaton et al., , 2018)) . A Healthy People 2030 goal is to reduce the prevalence of insufficient sleep in childhood to 30%  (Healthy People 2030 , 2021a) . Emerging data demonstrate that it is feasible to increase sleep duration among children using behavioral strategies. A meta-analysis revealed that behavioral sleep promotion interventions effectively increase sleep duration by an average of 35 (95% CI: 9, 61) minutes per night, in adolescents and young adults  (Griggs et al., 2020) . There is not yet a consensus on the specific behavioral components that are needed to promote sleep in children, but common elements include: setting a sleep goal, limiting sleep barriers, and enhancing sleep facilitators  (Hart et al., 2016; Perfect et al., 2016; Meltzer et al., 2021a) . Further, there is evidence that providing financial incentives can facilitate behavior change  (Patel et al., 2016; Wong et al., 2017) , and this needs to be considered for child sleep promotion efforts."

      "title": ". . . Sleep goal",
      "text": "Setting a sleep goal is a key intervention component for sleep extension  (Hart et al., 2016; Perfect et al., 2016; Van Dyk et al., 2017) , but the best approach to setting a sleep goal is unknown. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine recommends that middle school aged children sleep for 9-12 h each day  (Paruthi et al., 2016) , so in this age-range a guideline-based goal within this range is logical. However, Self-Efficacy Theory predicts that children will be more motivated to increase their sleep duration if they believe that they can attain the sleep extension goal  (Bandura, 1977) . Accordingly, a 7-h per night sleeper would likely have lower selfefficacy for a guideline-based goal than an 8-h per night sleeper. A personalized goal approach would minimize any differential selfefficacy arising from baseline sleep duration and may be more effective for childhood sleep promotion.\n\nProviding feedback based on sleep goal achievement and other sleep metrics may be critical. Timely, personalized, and performance feedback on goal achievement may help to increase enjoyment and competence and thereby intrinsic motivation. Further, providing performance feedback to participants and the primary care improved the effectiveness of an obesity treatment intervention in adults  (Spring et al., 2020) , and this needs to be tested in the context of childhood obesity prevention."

      "title": ". . . Barriers and facilitators",
      "text": "Barriers to optimal sleep duration include evening electronics usage, caffeine intake, excessive extracurricular schedules, and a lack of parental oversight regarding consistent bedtimes. Electronic screens emit blue wavelength light and when exposure is high in the evening it inhibits melatonin secretion that is needed to induce sleep  (Lee et al., 2018) . Television viewing is common in children, but with the increasing availability of streaming services and social network platforms, a large proportion of youth now use computers, tablets, and smartphones  (Li et al., 2010; Ogunleye et al., 2015; Yland et al., 2015; Brunetti et al., 2016; Council on Communications Media, 2016; Dube et al., 2017; Twenge et al., 2017) . Children and adolescents spend in excess of 7 h per day engaged in electronic media  (Rideout et al., 2010) . Not related to school work, 43% of children in the U.S. spend \u22653 h per day using a computer (including for texting and using social media)  (Kann et al., 2018) . Experimental studies suggest that targeting reductions in screen time can help youth extend their sleep in the home setting  (Perfect et al., 2016; Hart et al., 2017; Van Dyk et al., 2018; Perrault et al., 2019) . Indeed, exit survey data from one experimental study revealed that removing electronics from bedrooms and recording TV shows were useful strategies to extend child sleep  (Perfect et al., 2016) . In a qualitative study, youth reported being aware that excessive technology use is a sleep barrier, and were open to curbing use to improve sleep  (Paterson et al., 2019) .\n\nCaffeine is a stimulant that promotes wakefulness and has been associated with insufficient sleep  (Pollak and Bright, 2003; Calamaro et al., 2009 Calamaro et al., , 2012;; Li et al., 2010; Franckle et al., 2015) . Children are encouraged to limit their caffeine intake to no more than 100 mg per day (Committee on Nutrition the Council on Sports Medicine Fitness, 2011), and to especially limit caffeine intake in the late afternoon and evening  (Bryant Ludden and Wolfson, 2010) . In the U.S., 75% of children consume caffeine daily  (Branum et al., 2014) . Caffeine is often a \"hidden\" ingredient in food products; for example, sports drinks are often caffeinated and regularly consumed by children who play on after-school sports teams (Committee on Nutrition the Council on Sports Medicine Fitness, 2011;  Bernstein et al., 2018) . Reducing/removing this stimulant from diets would help address insufficient sleep  (Buxton et al., 2015) .\n\nChildren are more likely to go to bed earlier and sleep sufficiently if their parents set consistent bedtimes  (Li et al., 2010; Short et al., 2011; Appelhans et al., 2014; Buxton et al., 2015; Pyper et al., 2017) . However, only 6% of parents in the U.S. have bedtime rules for their child  (Short et al., 2011 (Short et al., , 2013)) . In a sleep extension study, families reported that doing homework earlier, setting bedtimes and planning ahead were useful strategies to help increase sleep duration  (Perfect et al., 2016) . Children should gain autonomy as they mature, but parents should remain committed to setting consistent bedtimes  (Haines et al., 2016) .\n\nYouth in the U.S. spend more than 2.5 h per night engaged in extracurricular activities that can delay bedtimes and reduce sleep duration  (Short et al., 2013) . In contrast, youth in Australia spend 1.4 h per night engaged in extracurricular activities  (Short et al., 2013) . Planning ahead and adjusting these activities could benefit child sleep duration  (Haines et al., 2016) ."

      "title": ". . . Incentives",
      "text": "Despite best intentions, individuals are often non-adherent to prescribed medications, treatments, and preventive guidelines  (McNally et al., 2009; Asch et al., 2012; Yoon et al., 2015; Rotenberg et al., 2016; Xanthopoulos et al., 2017; Hall et al., 2018; Biederman et al., 2019) , including for childhood obesity prevention  (Frank et al., 2020) . This is predictable and behavioral economists have devised strategies, or nudges, to counteract such behavior  (Frank et al., 2020) , including the delivery of financial incentives to motivate behavior change  (Loewenstein et al., 2012; Thirumurthy et al., 2019) . The strategy used to deliver financial incentives can have a large impact on effectiveness. For example, loss-framed incentives have been shown to be more effective than gain-framed incentives, of equal value, to help promote physical activity levels in adults  (Patel et al., 2016) . Further, a loss-framed incentive increased glucose monitoring in adolescents with type I diabetes at a rate more than two times higher than the control arm  (Wong et al., 2017) . Under gain-framed incentive structures, financial rewards are accumulated if behavior change goals are achieved. Whereas loss-framed incentive structures provide an upfront endowment with financial deductions applied if behavior change goals are not achieved. Based on Prospect Theory, the loss-framed structure is more motivational because we are loss averse  (Tversky and Kahneman, 1981) . The incentive should also be delivered promptly to provide immediate gratification  (Thirumurthy et al., 2019)  and has the potential to have lasting behavioral effects through habit formation  (Loewenstein et al., 2016) . A number of states have received waivers to enact Healthy Behavior Incentive Programs  (Huf et al., 2018) , and private insurers are increasingly offering enrollees discounted premiums if behavioral targets, measured by wearable devices, are achieved  (Raber et al., 2019) . These data indicate that incentives for adhering to behavior goals can be implemented into our healthcare system if they are effective."

      "title": ". . Sociodemographic context",
      "text": "In the U.S., most children do not meet the recommended sleep duration guidelines, but the extent of this problem is not equally distributed across sociodemographic groups  (Guglielmo et al., 2018; Jackson et al., 2020) . The state of Pennsylvania, and the city of Philadelphia, are among the lowest ranked in the nation with 79% and 83% of high school students sleeping insufficiently  (Wheaton et al., 2018) . Black children sleep less than White children  (Biggs et al., 2013; Matthews et al., 2014; Guglielmo et al., 2018; Hoyt et al., 2018; Yip et al., 2020) , and Hispanic/Latinx children sleep less than non-Hispanic/Latinx children  (Combs et al., 2016) . There is some evidence that male children sleep less than female children  (Moore et al., 2011; Matthews et al., 2014; Mitchell et al., 2020) , but other studies report shorter sleep in female children  (Hysing et al., 2013; Keyes et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2018; Kocevska et al., 2021) . In addition, sleep duration is typically shorter among children living in households with lower incomes  (Biggs et al., 2013)  and lower parent education levels  (Marco et al., 2011; Komrij et al., 2021) . The reasons for these disparities in sleep duration are multi-factorial and may be explained in part by family and neighborhood factors  (Billings et al., 2021) . Parental support will be needed if children are to successfully increase their sleep duration using behavioral strategies  (Spilsbury et al., 2005; Heerman et al., 2017; Tsai et al., 2018; Martinez et al., 2019) ; this may be more challenging in singleparent households  (Troxel et al., 2014)  and in the context of poor parent-child relationships  (Rojo-Wissar et al., 2020) . There is also evidence that sleep duration is shorter in neighborhoods with lower socioeconomic status  (El-Sheikh et al., 2013; Troxel et al., 2017; Bagley et al., 2018; Sheehan et al., 2018) , higher crime  (Bailey et al., 2005; Bagley et al., 2016; Heissel et al., 2018; Philbrook et al., 2020) , lower social cohesion  (Pabayo et al., 2014; Hawkins and Takeuchi, 2016; Troxel et al., 2017; Williamson et al., 2019) , higher noise levels  (Tiesler et al., 2013; Skrzypek et al., 2017; Weyde et al., 2017) , lower tree canopy cover  (Mayne et al., 2021) , and lower air quality  (Husain et al., 2023) . These neighborhood factors may impact the success of sleep promotion strategies. These data indicate that sleep interventions should be tailored to individual and contextual factors and evaluated for effectiveness across sociodemographics to address sleep health equity  (Guglielmo et al., 2018; Jackson et al., 2020) ."

      "title": ". . Digital solutions for sleep promotion in the pediatric healthcare setting",
      "text": "Pediatric healthcare clinicians adopt a prevention-and familycentered care model  (Alley et al., 2019) . The vast majority of families seek age-appropriate preventive care at annual well visits  (Uddin et al., 2016) . Pediatricians endorse the importance of assessing sleep habits and providing sleep-related guidance to families at well visits  (Faruqui et al., 2011; Owens and Jones, 2011) . However, sleep problem screening and preventive care are severely lacking  (Honaker and Meltzer, 2016) . Time is a key barrier for pediatric care teams  (Honaker and Meltzer, 2016) . Digital health solutions could overcome this barrier, with sleep promotion delivered remotely, using mobile health approaches, at regular intervals between annual well visits when sleep is actually taking place in the home setting  (Asch et al., 2012) . It is increasingly feasible to use wearable devices to track sleep patterns  (Meltzer et al., 2015; de Zambotti et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2019) , which can be incorporated into mobile health platforms  (Asch et al., 2012; Sim, 2019) . This allows children to self-monitor sleep patterns and goals. There is accumulating evidence that mobile health systems and telemedicine can deliver effective pediatric healthcare  (Singh et al., 2014; Fedele et al., 2017; Zieve et al., 2017; Byrne et al., 2018; Fiks et al., 2018; Foster et al., 2019; Kenyon et al., 2019; Marcus et al., 2019; Novick et al., 2019) , especially if parents are actively engaged in the remotely delivered care  (Fedele et al., 2017) . Furthermore, digital delivery of incentives-designed using behavioral economic theories-has been shown to enhance the effectiveness of mobile health interventions (e.g., physical activity promotion and blood glucose monitoring)  (Patel et al., 2016; Wong et al., 2017) . Incentives provide a source of immediate gratification directly related to behavior change, which is more motivating than waiting months-to-years for improvements in obesity and related cardiovascular health. Despite this promise, we do not know if digital approaches can be combined to improve sleep duration in childhood for obesity prevention  (Allman-Farinelli et al., 2020; Fowler et al., 2021) . In fact, a recent systematic review was not able to make any conclusions on mobile health interventions to promote sleep and obesity prevention in children, because the only studies in this area are based on adults  (Allman-Farinelli et al., 2020) ."

      "text": "We have successfully deployed a mobile health platform with an integrated sleep tracker, digital messaging, and a behavioral economic inspired incentive for sleep promotion among typically developing children, aged 9-12y, at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia  (Mitchell et al., 2021) . The digital messaging components provided feedback on sleep goal achievement and included general sleep health information (i.e., information about bedtime electronics usage)  (Mitchell et al., 2021) . The behavioral economic component delivered financial incentives to parents based on child sleep goal achievements  (Mitchell et al., 2021) . We specifically explored the effectiveness of a gain-framed incentive (i.e., accumulated money if sleep goals were achieved) and a loss-framed incentive (i.e., money deducted from an upfront endowment if sleep goals were not achieved)  (Mitchell et al., 2021) . Based on Prospect Theory, the loss-framed structure should be more motivational because of loss aversion  (Tversky and Kahneman, 1981) . Interestingly, compared to the control arm, the loss-framed incentive arm increased sleep duration by an average of 34 min per night and increased the probability of sufficient sleep (\u22659 h per night) by an average of 18 percentage points  (Mitchell et al., 2021) . There was no change in sleep duration in those randomized to the gain-framed incentive. Importantly, qualitative data revealed that barriers to sleep extension were primarily related to competing academic and extracurricular demands, as well as sibling activities and caregiver work schedules  (Mitchell et al., 2021) . In addition, families reported challenges around creating consistent rules related to electronics usage  (Mitchell et al., 2021) . Facilitators were also noted for future intervention. Children desired more personalized messaging to target their specific sleep habits, while parents suggested enhancing sleep health messaging content  (Mitchell et al., 2021) ."

      "title": ". . Optimizing intervention components for sleep promotion",
      "text": "The Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) is an engineer-inspired framework for developing multi-component interventions. MOST has informed a number of multi-component interventions, including: smoking cessation  (Piper et al., 2016 (Piper et al., , 2018;; Bernstein et al., 2018; Engle et al., 2019) , mental health promotion  (Watkins et al., 2016; Uwatoko et al., 2018) , physical activity promotion  (Celano et al., 2018; Phillips et al., 2018) , adult obesity treatment  (Pellegrini et al., 2014; Spring et al., 2020), and HIV treatment (Collins et al., 2016; Gwadz et al., 2017) . It is ideally suited to determine if digital approaches can be combined and harnessed to improve child sleep duration for the prevention of obesity.\n\nThe MOST framework has three phases: (1) the preparation phase, to pilot test intervention components; (2) the optimization phase, to determine candidate component settings that achieve optimization criteria; and (3) the evaluation phase, to determine if the final optimized intervention package is effective using a randomized controlled trial study design  (Collins, 2018) . With our successful deployment of a mobile health platform to promote sleep in children, we have already completed the preparation phase and are poised to complete the optimization phase  (Mitchell et al., 2021) . The optimization phase is especially important for developing multi-component interventions as it provides insight into how candidate intervention components operate with respect to primary outcomes. Using highly innovative, efficient and fully powered experimental designs  (Collins et al., 2014) , optimization trials can determine if each candidate component associates with the primary outcome of interest and can determine if there are interactions between the candidate components with respect to the primary outcome of interest. The extensive knowledge gained provides an opportunity to remove ineffective components, or adjust component settings, so that the final intervention package has been optimized before it is evaluated in expensive randomized controlled trials."

This is an optimization trial designed to determine the optimal component settings for a mobile health platform, for the pediatric care setting, to promote longer sleep duration for childhood obesity prevention. The conceptual model is provided in Figure  1 . Under aim 1, we will determine the optimal settings for sleep promotion by assessing four candidate intervention components, using a randomized 2 4 factorial design: (1) a sleep goal component, (2) a digital sleep guidance messaging component, (3) a caregiverdirected incentive component, and (4) a performance feedback component. We hypothesize that we will identify component settings that effectively increase sleep duration. Under aim 2, we will determine if the optimal settings for sleep promotion improve fat mass trajectories. Fat mass will be measured at baseline, 6-, and 12-months, and diet intake and behavior will be measured for mechanistic insights. We hypothesize that component settings optimal for sleep will lower gains in fat mass. Finally, under aim 3, we will determine if the optimal settings for sleep promotion are equally effective across sociodemographic groups, including the neighborhood context. We hypothesize that component settings that are optimal for sleep will be equitable across sexes, racial/ethnic backgrounds, and neighborhood contexts. Our proposed research will greatly advance the field of behavioral sleep medicine and reimagine how insufficient sleep duration is managed, and obesity is prevented in pediatric healthcare. .

Sleep quality metrics will also be captured from the sleep tracker on weeknights and weekend nights: sleep efficiency (percentage of time spent asleep during overnight sleep periods), sleep onset latency (time to fall asleep), and wake after sleep onset (time awake during overnight sleep periods).\n\nSecondary outcomes also include sleep disturbance and sleep impairment measured using the Patient-Reported Outcomes Measurement Information System (PROMIS) item bank for pediatric sleep  (Forrest et al., 2018) . This validated survey generates a sleep disturbance T-score based on items related to sleep onset, sleep continuity and sleep quality in the past week. The survey also generates a sleep-related impairment T-score based on items related to daytime sleepiness, cognition, affect and behavior, and daytime activities in the past week. Higher T-scores indicates poorer sleep quality  (Forrest et al., 2018) . Participants will complete this survey at baseline and at the end of each month during the intervention and follow-up phases.\n\nSecondary outcomes will also be considered with respect to body composition and size. These include visceral body adipose tissue area (cm 2 ), waist circumferences (cm), and BMI (kg/m 2 )."

A potential immediate next step will be to complete the evaluation phase of the MOST framework, where we will conduct an RCT to determine if our optimized intervention package causes improvements in sleep duration and lower gains in fat mass over time, equitably across sociodemographic groups. We will also remain committed to the MOST framework and the related continuous optimization principle. All behavioral interventions can be improved, and we will seek to complete another cycle of optimization for equitable sleep promotion in other obesity related disease areas."
