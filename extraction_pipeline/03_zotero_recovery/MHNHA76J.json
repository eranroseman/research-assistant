Systematic reviews suggest telehealth or electronic (e)-based counselling programs may be well-suited to meet this challenge.  2, 3 eta-analytic reviews indicate that patient education, exercise training, and diet modification, provided by conventional programs or by e-based or telehealth protocols, significantly decrease cardiovascular risk factors.  [4] [5] 5] [6]  In the context of hypertension, these reviews report that systolic blood pressure is lowered in the range of 3.0-8.7 mm Hg relative to controls. However, a commonly reported observation is that there is significant heterogeneity in clinical outcomes due to substantial differences in the content or clinical method of e-based or telehealth interventions. Currently, these protocols can include several optional components: (1) supplementary patient-provider contact, (2) utilization of devices for home-based monitoring of symptoms such as blood pressure, (3) automated messaging that provides advice, education, and support for behaviour change, (4) self-assessment tools to monitor progress in behaviour change, and (5) patient-controlled menus to navigate counselling materials, in order to promote motivation and efficacy in behaviour change skills. A priority advocated by our team is to work toward establishing a core protocol for preventive e-counselling by incorporating key components from established, evidence-based behavioural therapies that have been shown to (1) improve patient motivation for change, and (2) reduce psychological distress, which is a barrier to sustained change.\n\nThe primary objective of this trial (the Internet-Based Strategic Transdisciplinary Approach to Risk Reduction and Treatment [I-START]) was to evaluate whether a standardized protocol of e-counselling, with key features to augment motivation for behaviour change, independently lowered systolic and diastolic blood pressure as well as pulse pressure in hypertensive individuals, independent of both medications and validated measures of psychological distress. Secondary outcomes included change in self-reported exercise and diet, as well as lipoprotein cholesterol. We recently reported that e-counselling in the present trial independently evoked therapeutic change in exercise and diet.  7 Therefore, this report presents the main results for I-START, which include an evaluation of the independent effect of e-counselling on blood pressure and cholesterol."

Subjects were randomized to e-counselling or to a wait list control group and assessed at baseline and at 4-month follow-up. Randomization was blocked within our 3 recruitment sites in Ontario, Canada (Greater Toronto Area, London, and the Grey Bruce Region) and stratified according to sex and age by means of a computer program. The randomization codes were hidden in sealed, opaque envelopes that were sorted by stratification features at each site. Research assistants who conducted the assessments were blind to the research design and randomized status of subjects. All patients completed informed consent prior to participating in the study, and approval was obtained from the Research Ethics Board of each institution.\n\nRecruitment was conducted by self-referral after subjects logged onto the website of the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada. Subjects were asked to indicate whether they (1) were diagnosed with \"high blood pressure\" by their doctor, (2) resided in our 3 recruitment areas, and (3) were willing to provide contact information in order to participate in the present research project. A telephone screening interview was administered to eligible subjects. Those meeting inclusion criteria were mailed a study information package and a patient profile form. The latter form requested their family physician to confirm their diagnosis of hypertension. Subjects who met inclusion criteria after physician confirmation were then scheduled for an assessment at a local I-START clinic. These clinics were located in family medicine outpatient clinics, a behavioural cardiology research unit in a tertiary care hospital, and a university-based neurovascular laboratory (urban sites), and 1 public health unit (rural site) in Ontario, Canada.\n\nThe e-counselling intervention was designed to proactively deliver 8 e-messages over the 4-month interval according to the following schedule: weekly e-mails in month 1, bi-weekly e-mails in month 2, and monthly e-mails in months 3 and 4. These e-counselling messages were sent from the \"Blood Pressure Action Plan\" (BPAP) (Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada, 2011), which was a beta version of the Heart and Stroke Foundation e-platform to promote blood pressure control ( http://www.heartandstroke.on.ca/site/c.pvI3IeNWJwE/  b.3582093/k.8AB3/Blood_Pressure_Action_Plan.htm ). This program initially guided subjects to report their stage of motivational \"readiness\" to adhere to Health Canada guidelines for tolic, diastolic, and pulse pressures, and total lipoprotein cholesterol after treatment. Results: Intention to treat analysis did not find a significant group difference in outcomes due to contamination across the 2 arms of this trial. However, per protocol analysis indicated that subjects receiving \u0546 8 e-counselling messages (a priori therapeutic dose) vs 0 e-counselling messages (control) demonstrated greater reduction in systolic blood pressure (mean, \u03ea8.9 mm Hg; 95% confidence interval [CI], \u03ea11.5 to \u03ea6.4 vs \u03ea5.0 mm Hg; 95% CI, \u03ea6.7 to \u03ea3.3, P \u03ed 0.03), pulse pressure (\u03ea6.1 mm Hg; 95% CI, \u03ea8.1 to \u03ea4.1 vs \u03ea3.1 mm Hg; 95% CI, \u03ea4.3 to \u03ea1.8, P \u03ed 0.02) and total cholesterol (\u03ea0.24 mmol/L; 95% CI, \u03ea0.43 to \u03ea0.06 vs 0.05 mmol/L; 95% CI, \u03ea0.06 to 0.16, P \u03ed 0.03), but not diastolic blood pressure.

As previously reported,  7  readiness for change was operationally defined for each behaviour according to the conventional algorithm of Prochaska's Transtheoretical Model 8 (Precontemplation, Contemplation, Preparation, Action, and Maintenance). In an effort to reinforce motivation and efficacy for self-directed change, 9 subjects were then prompted to actively choose their priority for lifestyle change from the above-noted behaviours associated with diet, exercise, and smoke-free living. Moreover, the program provided key messages to promote motivation by validating the effort of subjects to work toward goals for change that were tailored to the self-reported stage of readiness for each behaviour that was selected as a change priority. The BPAP also provided numerous menus that were linked to educational material and self-help tips for lifestyle change. This feature further permitted subjects to self-direct their change plan, which was consistent with cognitive-behavioural guidelines to reinforce motivation and efficacy for initiating and maintaining behaviour change.  10 In contrast, subjects randomized to the control condition received He@lthline e-newsletters from the Heart and Stroke Foundation that contained general information and advice for heart-healthy living. In addition, they agreed to refrain from logging onto the Heart and Stroke Foundation BPAP over their 4-month interval of participation in this study."

Both intention to treat and per protocol analyses were conducted due to a contamination of the randomized conditions during the early phase of this trial. Specifically, it was discovered in the latter phase of this trial that 35 controls (18%) had accessed the e-counselling intervention despite agreeing to wait until the end of the trial to do so. In addition, only 82 e-counselling subjects (42%) received \u0546 8 emails over the 4-month interval, which was defined a priori as a \"therapeutic\" dosage. This latter issue was due to a programming problem in which the schedule of proactive e-mails was reset when subjects repeatedly logged into the Heart and Stroke Foundation BPAP and re-entered their registration information. Therefore, a per protocol analysis was conducted with 3 groups according to whether subjects received \u0546 8 emails (a priori \"therapeutic\" dosage of e-counselling), 1-7 emails (subtherapeutic dosage of e-counselling), or 0 e-mails (control). Analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) for change in blood pressure and total cholesterol at the 4-month follow-up adjusted statistically for baseline blood pressure and cholesterol (respectively), sex, age, antihypertensive or lipid-lowering medications, and baseline psychological distress (depression  11  and psychological stress  12  ).

Mean systolic/diastolic blood pressure was 140/80 mm Hg (95% CI, 113-172 and 63-99, respectively). Systolic blood pressure was controlled (\u03fd140 mm Hg) among 54% of the sample, while diastolic blood pressure was controlled (\u03fd90 mm Hg) among 83% of subjects. Finally, 72% of subjects were prescribed at least 1 antihypertensive drug. Mean total cholesterol was 5.3 mmol/L (95% CI, 3.7-7.0) while 21% were prescribed a lipid-lowering drug.\n\nThere were no group differences in withdrawals: control, n \u03ed 35, 18.1%; e-counselling, n \u03ed 45, 23.2%; P \u03ed 0.18.

Total cholesterol was significantly reduced among the e-counselling group vs controls (\u03ea0.13 mmol/L; 95% CI, \u03ea0.26 to \u03ea0.01 vs 0.05 mmol/L; 95% CI, \u03ea0.07 to 0.17; P \u03ed 0.04); however, this outcome was not included in the priori hypotheses.\n\nAs noted in Table  1 , the e-counselling groups (0 e-mails, 1-7 e-mails, and \u05468 e-mails) did not differ significantly with regard to age, income, BMI, waist circumference, and cardiovascular risk factors. However, there was a higher prevalence of females in the groups receiving 1-7 e-mails and \u0546 8 e-mails. Systolic blood pressure did not differ significantly between controls (0 e-mails) and the groups receiving e-counselling messages. However, systolic blood pressure was significantly lower in the e-counselling group who received 1-7 e-mails, vs \u05468 e-mails.\n\nIn contrast, diastolic blood pressure differed significantly between the 3 e-counselling groups, but post hoc comparisons between controls (0 e-mails) and each of the groups who received e-counselling messages were not statistically significant according to Bonferroni criteria. Table  2  shows that antihypertensive and lipid-lowering medications did not differ significantly between the e-counselling groups.\n\nThe per-protocol analysis demonstrated a significant and incremental association between e-counselling support and therapeutic changes in systolic blood pressure (P \u03ed 0.02), pulse pressure (P \u03ed 0.02), and total cholesterol (P \u03ed 0.002).

      "text": "We evaluated the efficacy of a standardized protocol of e-counselling that was designed to contribute to blood pressure reduction among persons diagnosed with hypertension by means of increasing adherence to self-management behaviours for exercise and diet. This trial was distinct insofar as it incorporated key features of motivational interviewing  9  into our e-counselling protocol. For example, subjects randomized to e-counselling received validating feedback to work toward goals that were matched to each subject's self-assessed stage of readiness for change, in relation to recommended guidelines for exercise (daily activity and formal exercise), diet (fruits, vegetables, fat, and salt) and smoke-free living.  13, 14 Our major finding was that e-counselling was independently associated with decreased systolic blood pressure, pulse pressure, and total cholesterol after adjusting for potential confounding factors such as medication. Similarly, we have previously reported that adherence to exercise and diet also improved significantly with e-counselling.  7 his study contributes to the growing body of evidence which indicates that e-counselling may contribute significantly to community-based programs aimed at reducing cardiovascular risk factors among persons with hypertension. Our abovenoted findings are consistent with previous trials of lifestyle counselling,  15, 16  particularly those that have utilized a telehealth or e-based strategy to modify lifestyle.  [17] [18] 8] [19]  Our team previously demonstrated that it is feasible to use an evidencebased model of motivational interviewing within a telehealth protocol for persons at high risk for a primary or secondary cardiovascular event.  20 We found that this telehealth intervention significantly reduced systolic and diastolic blood pressure, while improving adherence to exercise and diet.\n\nNeubeck et al.  5  recently reported that it was not possible to provide a summary index following meta-analysis of telehealth or internet programs for exercise or diet behaviour due to the heterogeneity in reporting procedures and assessment methods. Nevertheless, among 5 out of the 7 randomized controlled trials, significant improvement in physical activity as measured by functional capacity during exercise treadmill testing or psychometric assessment of self-reported activity was observed,  19, [21] [22] [23] [24]  although only 1 out of 4 trials showed improvements in dietary behaviour measured by a validated food frequency questionnaire.  24 The above-noted findings by our team and others underscores the need to develop a standardized e-counselling protocol that is grounded in an evidence-based model of behavioural counselling. This trial as well as our previous trial  20  demonstrated that an e-counselling behavioural program combined with key features of motivational interviewing can significantly augment blood pressure reduction independent of the benefit of antihypertensive medications.\n\nPreventive e-counselling may fill critical gaps in communitybased strategies to promote blood pressure reduction. A recent survey of Canadians with hypertension has shown a monotonic relationship between the number of health care providers who provide advice for therapeutic lifestyle change and increasing levels of adherence to these recommended lifestyle behaviours.  25 However, 20%-43% of this cohort reported that they did not receive health behaviour advice to change diet, exercise, or smoking as a means of blood pressure control.  25 In addition, long-term adherence to recommended standards for exercise, diet, and smoke-free living is only low-to-moderate following conventional behaviour change programs.  [26] [27] 7] [28]  Nonadherence to antihypertensive medication is also considerable, ranging from 15%-50%,  29, 30  while persistence with antihypertensive medications diminishes over time for approximately 22%-50% of patients.  29, 31 Preliminary evidence suggests that e-counselling may promote long-term improvement (over 24 months) in body weight and aerobic fitness.  15 These data combined with the present findings suggest that preventive e-counselling Data are presented as mean (95% confidence interval).

Analysis of covariance for blood pressure (BP) and cholesterol adjusted for baseline BP or cholesterol, sex, age, antihypertensive or lipid-lowering drugs, and psychological distress (symptoms of depression and stress).

Within Canada, increased adherence to recommended guidelines for diet, exercise, and smoke-free living is associated with improved longevity and quality of life among individuals with uncontrolled hypertension who are currently prescribed medication, as defined by 0.5-3.4 life years gained, and 1.0-2.5 years free of cardiovascular disease.  32  limitation to the present study is that the subjects who were enrolled had demonstrated an initial level of motivation to obtain preventive health information from our recruitment website: Heart and Stroke Foundation BPAP. Therefore, our findings may generalize only to individuals who are already engaged in health information-seeking behaviour, which corresponds to 58% of home internet users in Canada. 33  Nevertheless, the potential feasibility of using e-counselling to promote blood pressure reduction is underscored by the observation that 80.3% of the Canadian population reports personal access to the internet, which includes 70%-76% of Canadians in the 2 lowest income quartiles, and 71% of older Canadians (aged 55-64 years). 34  A more serious limitation of this trial concerns the inability to appropriately evaluate outcomes with the intention to treat analysis, due to contamination of the randomized treatment groups associated with an unforeseen e-programming problem. As noted above, the present trial served as a beta test to formally evaluate the BPAP, which was an initial version of the Heart and Stroke Foundation e-platform to promote blood pressure control. Arguably, the lack of appropriate evidence for a difference between the original randomized groups is not the same as appropriate evidence of a lack of difference. 35  Therefore, we suggest that it is reasonable to consider the per protocol analysis in I-START as a credible evaluation of the primary outcomes. Future trials of e-counselling can prevent a similar problem of treatment contamination by restricting public access to the experimental e-counselling intervention, and by regularly monitoring (1) web site utilization and (2) the schedule of e-mails that are sent proactively to the e-counselling group vs controls.\n\nIn summary, the current findings suggest that there is merit in conducting additional trials of preventive e-counselling to determine long-term benefit (of at least 12 months) for the reduction of blood pressure and other cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, a follow-up trial of e-counselling is needed to establish whether this approach increases adherence to selfmanagement behaviours as measured by objective physiologic measures and validated assessments such as accelerometers and 24-hour urinary sodium analysis. The findings from the current study suggest that it may be feasible to use an e-counselling program to achieve (1) a reduction in blood pressure that is independent of the therapeutic benefit of medications, and (2) increased adherence to self-management behaviour for diet and exercise, independent of baseline levels of psychological distress."

      "text": "In March/April 2012 issue, there was an error in the article \"Focused 2012 Update of the Canadian Cardiovascular Society Atrial Fibrillation Guidelines: Recommendations for Stroke Prevention and Rate/Rhythm Control\" by Skanes et al. (Can J Cardiol 2012;28:125-36). On page 129, in the second and fourth paragraphs, information provided about AVERROES trial was incorrect. The AVERROES trial included 5599 patients and compared apixaban to ASA only, not apixaban to ASA plus clopidogrel. The corrected paragraphs appear below with changes in bold.\n\nIn the Apixaban Versus Acetylsalicylic Acid (ASA) to Prevent Strokes in Atrial Fibrillation Patients Who Have Failed or Are Unsuitable for Vitamin K Antagonist Treatment (AVERROES) trial, 21 5599 AF patients (mean CHADS 2 \u03ed 2.0) unsuitable for warfarin therapy were randomized double-blind to apixaban 5 mg twice daily (2.5 mg twice daily in selected patients) or to ASA (81-324 mg per day), and followed for a median of 1.1 years. The trial was stopped early because of marked outcome differences. Principal outcome rates (stroke or STE) were 3.7% per year with ASA vs 1.6% per year with apixaban (RR vs ASA 0.45; 0.32-0.62; P \u03fd 0.001). The rates of major bleeding were 1.2% per year with ASA vs 1.4% with apixaban (RR vs ASA 1.13; P \u03fd 0.57), with no significant differences in intracranial or GI bleeding.\n\nIn summary, compared with warfarin, both dabigatran and apixaban are more efficacious than warfarin for the prevention of stroke and STE, while rivaroxaban is noninferior to warfarin. Apixaban and dabigatran 110 mg causes less major bleeding than warfarin, while in comparison with warfarin there is no more major bleeding with either dabigatran 150 mg or rivaroxaban. There is significantly less intracranial bleeding with each of the new agents than with warfarin.\n\nThe recommendations made by previous national guidelines exercises were based upon a total of 2900 patients in the randomized trials of warfarin vs control, 3990 patients in the trials of ASA vs control and 3647 patients in the trials of warfarin vs ASA. The 3 recent trials randomized over 50,000 subjects to 1 of the new agents vs warfarin, and 5599 to apixaban vs ASA. The 5 major primary prevention trials of warfarin compared with control showed an absolute risk reduction (ARR) for stroke of 2.7% per year, and a number-needed-to-treat (NNT) of 37 to avoid 1 stroke during 1 year of treatment.22 In RE-LY, the ARR for dabigatran vs warfarin was 0.58% per year (NNT \u03ed 172) and in ARISTOTLE the ARR for apixaban vs warfarin was 0.33% per year (NNT \u03ed 303). For intracranial hemorrhage, the ARRs are small (dabigatran ARR 0.44% per year, NNT\u03ed227; rivaroxaban ARR 0.2% per year, NNT \u03ed 500; and apixaban ARR 0.47% per year, NNT \u03ed 213)."
