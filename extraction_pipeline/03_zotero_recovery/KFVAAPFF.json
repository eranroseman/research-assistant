  "title": "Daily Motivational Text Messages to Promote Physical Activity in University Students: Results From a Microrandomized Trial",
  "abstract": "Background Low physical activity is an important risk factor for common physical and mental disorders. Physical activity interventions delivered via smartphones can help users maintain and increase physical activity, but outcomes have been mixed. Purpose Here we assessed the effects of sending daily motivational and feedback text messages in a microrandomized clinical trial on changes in physical activity from one day to the next in a student population. Methods We included 93 participants who used a physical activity app, \"DIAMANTE\" for a period of 6 weeks. Every day, their phone pedometer passively tracked participants' steps. They were microrandomized to receive different types of motivational messages, based on a cognitive-behavioral framework, and feedback on their steps. We used generalized estimation equation models to test the effectiveness of feedback and motivational messages on changes in steps from one day to the next. Results Sending any versus no text message initially resulted in an increase in daily steps (729 steps, p = .012), but this effect decreased over time. A multivariate analysis evaluating each text message category separately showed that the initial positive effect was driven by the motivational messages though the effect was small and trend-wise significant (717 steps; p = .083), but not the feedback messages (-276 steps, p = .4). Conclusion Sending motivational physical activity text messages based on a cognitive-behavioral framework may have a positive effect on increasing steps, but this decreases with time. Further work is needed to examine using personalization and contextualization to improve the efficacy of text-messaging interventions on physical activity outcomes. ClinicalTrials.",

      "text": "Insufficient physical activity (PA) is one of the leading global risk factors of death  [1] . It is associated with many common chronic diseases  [2]  and mental disorders including depression  [3] . The World Health Organization recommends 2.5 hr of moderate intensity PA weekly  [1] . However, in 2018, less than half of American adults met this goal  [4] . Adolescents and university students show even lower PA  [5, 6] . There is a need for interventions that help people to increase and maintain PA. Behavioral interventions via mobile devices, such as text messaging and/or smartphone apps, hold great promise for PA promotion. They can help identify the benefits of, and opportunities for, exercise, and aid with goal setting and accountability  [7] . Mobile health (mHealth) interventions can also be widely disseminated at relatively low cost  [8] . mHealth interventions increase PA, with effect sizes up to 3.10 (Cohen's d) after 3-month follow-up (though null effects were also reported)  [7, [9] [10] [11] . In a systematic review, 16 of 27 reviewed interventions increased PA in university students  [12] . In another review, PA interventions decreased depression and anxiety in young people  [13] .\n\nHowever, the effects of mHealth PA interventions are mixed  [14] , and not sustained over longer periods of time  [11] , which is partly because they do not adapt their messaging content and frequency to participants' changing behaviors  [15] . Furthermore, because most mHealth studies evaluate the whole intervention, it is unclear which intervention components most effectively increase daily PA. The microrandomized trial (MRT) is a state-of-the-art experimental design for testing the effects of mHealth the intervention components  [16] . In an MRT, individuals are repeatedly randomized to intervention options. This allows researchers to test the effects of separate components, such as categories of text messages (in the current study), on steps within a short time (24 hr in this study).\n\nIn an MRT, we tested a mHealth application that sends daily text messages, within categories based on a cognitive-behavioral change model: Capability, Opportunity, Motivation, Behavior (COM-B)  [17] . COM-B proposes engaging in a particular behavior depending on the capability (physical and psychological), opportunity (social and physical), and motivation to engage in the behavior more than in other behaviors. Interventions should target at least one of these components for long-lasting behavior change. Researchers have used COM-B to identify PA barriers  [18]  and design PA interventions  [19, 20] .\n\nWe originally planned to randomize participants to random messaging or a Thompson sampling (TS) condition. TS is a multiarmed bandit technique, used to more intelligently select and personalize messages based on the expected outcome of interest (here increase in steps)  [21] . Because of technical difficulties (execution errors in the algorithm), we only enrolled a subset of participants after we fixed the errors in the TS condition. Therefore, we altered the study's main aims by focusing on the MRT. The main aims of this study were (i) to examine the overall effect of sending a text message versus no message over time on PA and (ii) to assess the effectiveness of different types of text messages (motivational and feedback) on PA from one day to the next. Our secondary aims are to examine (i) differences in increases in step count over the course of the study between the TS and uniform random group and (ii) the changes in the depression, anxiety, and behavioral activation (tracks behaviors underlying depression  [22] ) scores from baseline to follow-up and between groups."

      "text": "This study examined the effectiveness of motivational text messages on daily step changes in university students. Receiving a message was initially associated with step increases, but this disappeared over time and effects were small (Cohen's d < 0.2), Messages may not have tailored contextually (i.e., to participants' daily contexts) and personally (i.e., to fit with a person's personality) enough. Messages that adapt to factors such as time, day of week, and work schedules may be more effective than generic messages  [34] . For instance, in an MRT, contextually tailored walking suggestions led to an average increase of 496 daily steps  [35] . Comparable to our results however, the effects decreased over time. We had low drop out (3%), but participants may have paid less attention to the messages as the study continued. Future work should focus on measuring and sustaining engagement with (unsupported) texting interventions.\n\nWe found that motivational messages may increase PA more than feedback messages. Self-efficacy: the belief that one is capable of behavior change, and opportunity: identifying possibilities for exercise in the current context, showed positive trend effects (exploratory analysis). These two behavior change categories based on the COM-B may be more important than messages about the benefits of exercise for university students-an educated sample who may already be aware of the advantages of exercise. Of note, these effects were small, decreased over time, and disappeared when we removed days that participants were not randomized. This may be due to insufficient power to detect small effects (see our Supplementary Material-post hoc power analyses). Thus, our results need to be confirmed by future work.\n\nFeedback on individuals' steps and goal completion had no effect on step change. Systematic reviews showed that feedback should be actionable (e.g., when, how, and where can you exercise  [36] ). In addition to feedback, future interventions should therefore give concrete actions for goal completion.\n\nWe did not observe differences between the participants who received microrandomized messages, or messaging chosen by a TS algorithm. Our study period may have been too short for the algorithm to start learning, especially with sparse data  [21, 37] . To date, mHealth studies using machine learning methods have shown promise, but the small number of studies impedes a rigorous evaluation  [38] . Our MRT design examines intervention components (here types of messages), as opposed to the whole intervention. We therefore need RCTs with a long follow-up to assess TS's benefits. To examine this, we are currently conducting a larger RCT in a patient population  [23] .\n\nThe nature of the college semester may explain the unexpected increased depression and anxiety scores from baseline to follow-up. At the end of the study, participants' stress and depression may have increased with exams, which may also have contributed to the messages losing effect over time. Our findings underline that university students are vulnerable for mental health issues  [39]  and that they may need more tailored mental health support to cope with the pressures of college life during exam periods."

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "This is a convenience sample (university students), with various levels of baseline PA. Although the majority of the participants wanted to exercise more, they may have been more interested in other PA (e.g., the gym or team sports). Furthermore, we experienced technical issues such as our server not sending messages, and missing steps when participants lacked Internet connectivity, or forgot their phones  [40] . Furthermore, (small) measurement error related to phone pedometers may influence our findings. We used in-built phone pedometers because of their wide availability-anyone with a smartphone can use our app. They also seem to be as, or more, accurate than wrist or hip worn accelerometers  [41] . For instance, the mean absolute percentage of errors was small for iPhone SE and Samsung Galaxy for walking in natural conditions (<3%) compared with a wrist-worn ActiGraph (17%-47%)  [41] . However, phone pedometers may underestimate steps  [41]  and are less accurate when placed further from the body  [42] . In addition, as we examine steps over 24 hr, carry-over effects of previous messages may influence step changes. We lack reliable data to assess hourly steps. Because we randomized messaging however, we that we provide a reasonable approximation of messages' effects on steps."
