  "title": "Usability and Effectiveness of eHealth and mHealth Interventions That Support Self-Management and Health Care Transition in Adolescents and Young Adults With Chronic Disease: Systematic Review",
  "abstract": "Background: With advances in medical technologies, more children with chronic diseases are now living on into adulthood. The development of proficient self-management skills is essential for adolescents and young adults to transition from pediatric to adult health care services. An innovative way to improve the current care model and foster self-management skills could be through eHealth or mHealth (mobile health) interventions, in particular, when considering the rising ownership of digital technology by adolescents and young adults. Objective: This systematic review aimed to evaluate the features, acceptability, usability, engagement, and intervention efficacy of eHealth and mHealth interventions that support self-management and health care transition in adolescents and young adults with chronic disease. Methods: This review followed the PRISMA (Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses) reporting guidelines (registration number CRD42023378355). We systematically searched the MEDLINE complete, Embase, Cochrane Library, CINAHL complete, and ProQuest Health & Medical complete. We considered only articles published in or since 2019, as we aimed to extend the data collected by 2 previous systematic reviews. Results: A total of 16,752 studies were screened. After removing duplicates, 14,507 studies were excluded based on the title and abstract. Ultimately, 22 studies were included. The interventions ranged from simple text messages to complex interventions involving web-based games and engagement of health care providers, which were summarized into 6 themes: medication monitoring and reminders, symptom tracking and monitoring, management goal setting, knowledge education and self-management skills training, incentives and reinforcement, and communication. Most adolescents and young adults felt the eHealth and mHealth interventions were feasible, as they were convenient, easy to use, and accessible in the context of helping manage their health. However, user engagement was variable and presented a gradual decline in youth engagement with these apps over time. Barriers that prevent user engagement are diverse, such as time-consuming video uploads, noncontinuous access to a phone, reading literacy levels, language, and false impressions. Moreover, adolescents and young adults had different preferred styles of message delivery and functions, especially the engaging elements, disease-specific information, and opportunities to communicate with peers, health care providers, and app teams. Conclusions: There remains limited data about the effectiveness of eHealth and mHealth interventions facilitating the self-management and health care transition of adolescents and young adults with chronic diseases. Based on the available evidence, they were receptive to and interested in receiving information and managing their health using mobile apps or websites. Considering",

      "text": "Chronic diseases in childhood refer to children aged 0-18 years who endure incurable diseases diagnosed by reproducible and valid methods according to professional standards, with a duration of longer than three months or a frequency of more than three times during the past year and will probably reoccur  [1] . In recent years, the incidence of chronic diseases in children has significantly increased, which has become a major global public health issue affecting children's physical and mental health  [2, 3] . Research showed that approximately 10% to 20% of children currently endure chronic diseases, including asthma, epilepsy, diabetes, chronic kidney disease, etc  [4] . Due to development of the advanced medical technologies that support disease management and longer life spans, more children with chronic diseases are now living into adolescence and young adulthood  [5] . To receive age-appropriate care, adolescents and young adults need to transition from pediatric to adult health care, which involves a significant shift in the care model from chronic disease supervision and management to self-management  [6, 7] . Pediatric providers tend to prefer a family-centered model of care, with parental involvement in disease management and daily care for children; while adult care, is patient-centered, emphasizing patient independence and personalized care  [5, 8] . Therefore, the health care transition from child-centered to adult-oriented health care systems is a period of increased risk and vulnerability.\n\nTransition readiness, as a key element of health care transition, refers to the abilities to prepare, enter, continue, and complete the transition. Such preparation mainly reflects self-management ability, including the knowledge, skills, and experience required for disease management  [9] . Self-management is an important skill for adolescent chronic disease patients to take over responsibility for their own health care and ensure good disease control  [10, 11] . Research has shown that inadequate self-management can lead to reduced adherence to treatment, decreased follow-up, and increased risk of mortality among adolescents and young adults with chronic diseases, thus placing a heavy economic burden on adolescents and young adults, their families, and even society  [12] [13] [14] . Therefore, it is crucial to encourage and promote the improvement of adolescents' and young adults' self-management behaviors to ensure the continuity of their health management. However, changes in self-management behavior entail dynamic, continuous, and complex processes that are influenced by multiple factors, and these changes are often difficult to maintain  [15] . Therefore, it is very important to find suitable methods to use in adolescent development to encourage and promote the improvement of self-management behavior among young people.\n\nAn innovative way to improve the current care model and foster self-management skills could take the form of digital health interventions, especially in light of the changing landscape of internet use and increasing ownership rates of digital technology among young people. Digital health intervention refers to the use of the internet, smartphones, social media, and mobile apps to provide health care information support and treatment to a target population  [16] . Such interventions have come to represent an emerging mode of chronic disease health management due to the advantages of convenience, interactivity, accessibility, and low cost, which can effectively provide personalized and continuous web-based medical assurance  [17] . Digital media have come to represent an indispensable aspect of young people's lives, as young people rely on digital media to seek different forms of mental health support, relaxation, and distraction  [18] [19] [20] . The use of eHealth or mHealth (mobile health) interventions to promote self-disease management among adolescents and young adults is an emerging field that is worthy of exploration, and this approach represents an innovative way to develop adolescents and young adults' self-management skills and prepare them for the health care transition process  [21, 22] .\n\nTo date, there has been little evidence produced about the effectiveness and usability of eHealth and mHealth interventions aimed at supporting self-management and health care transition in adolescents and young adults with chronic diseases. A systematic review conducted by P\u00e9rez et al  [23]  examined the literature published from 2015 to 2018 with the goal of evaluating the utility and effectiveness of mobile and web-based health apps that support self-management and transition among young people with chronic diseases, and 6 studies were ultimately included in that review. However, only a limited number of studies on this topic have been published, and it is difficult to draw comprehensive conclusions concerning the effectiveness and usage of mobile and web-based apps. Low and Manias  [24]  examined the usability of technology-based tools for supporting adolescents and young adults with chronic diseases by searching for data published between 1967 and 2019 in 3 electronic databases. However, among the included studies, most were published before 2015. Due to the rapid development of mobile medical technology and the increasingly mature forms of chronic disease management developed for adolescents and young adults, new interventions that are more suitable for self-management skill development may have emerged. In addition, although a meta-analysis was conducted in this study, the quantitative data was insufficient as it focused on the experiences and perspectives of adolescents and young adults  [24] ."

In addition, to understand and optimize the users' experience, we attempted to evaluate the acceptability, perceived level of usefulness, and user engagement of mHealth and eHealth interventions."

A score of 24 to 28 was graded excellent, 19 to 23 was graded good, 14 to 18 was graded fair, and <14 was graded poor. Additionally, we assessed the explicitness of reporting of each qualitative or quantitative questionnaire study to provide contextual details for readers to assess the transferability of this study's findings to their own settings. The 21-item standards for reporting qualitative research (SRQR) checklist was used for qualitative research  [28] , with a total score of 0-21 (yes=1, partially=0.5, and no=0), and a higher score indicates higher quality. A 16-item tool developed by Tong et al  [29]  was used for questionnaire research, with the highest possible score being 16, and a higher score indicates higher quality. Two reviewers (RB and YY) assessed the quality of the included studies independently. Any disagreements between these two authors were resolved through discussion among the research group and re-examination of the studies."

      "title": "Principal Findings",
      "text": "This systematic review examined 22 articles that were published between 2019 and 2023 and focused on adolescents and young adults aged 9 to 25 years. Despite the proliferation of eHealth and mHealth interventions during the past 5 years  [57] , the overall evidence regarding the efficacy, cost-effectiveness, and long-term health benefits of these interventions is minimal, as most of the interventions identified were in the usability testing stage.\n\nUsing the qualitative data, this systematic review revealed most adolescents and young adults felt the interventions delivered by mobile apps or websites were feasible, acceptable, and useful, as they were convenient and easy to use in the context of helping adolescents and young adults manage their health  [32, 35, 36, 39, 43, 45, 49, 50, 52] . Low and Manias  [24]  confirmed that adolescents and young adults were receptive to receiving health information electronically. In fact, multiple studies have shown that most adolescents and young adults have access to mobile phones that they keep with them at all times and they are interested in using mHealth and apps to manage their health and facilitate the health care transition  [58, 59] . However, engaging adolescents and young adults in research could be difficult. In this system review, we found that the overall levels of engagement during the intervention were variable  [32, 35, 39, 40, 43, 48, 52 ] and tended to decrease over time  [40, 52] . Some adolescents and young adults could be defined as \"super users\" who logged into the app nearly every day, while others engaged with the app infrequently  [37, 39] . Previous studies have shown that early involvement promotes better engagement  [60, 61] , and when making choices among many apps, users prefer certain features tailored to their needs and preferences  [62, 63] . This finding highlights the importance of stakeholder involvement in the design process, as adolescents are undergoing a critical period concerning the development of routines and self-management skills, and digital interventions designed for adults may not address the unique developmental and psychosocial barriers faced by adolescents  [64] . In addition, a previous study indicated that increasing caregiver involvement can effectively improve the engagement of adolescents and young adults in digital interventions  [65] . Considering the high risk that adolescents and young adults will not comply with the intervention, allowing them to designate people other than their caregivers (ie, older siblings or friends) to increase accountability may help them assert their independence from their caregivers.\n\nAdolescents and young adults had different preferred styles of message delivery and functions. Specifically, adolescents and young adults have partiality for more engaging elements (such as visually appealing features, customization options, or fun or entertaining functions)  [35, 36, 39, 49, 50] , disease-specific information  [35, 39] , and opportunities to communicate with their peers, health care providers, and app teams  [35, 36] . Education is an important aspect of the task of promoting the development of self-management skills  [66] . The continuous highlighting of disease-specific educational themes via a web-based device using video or text can enable patients to easily access reliable information. Interacting with peers and health care providers via social media may promote better outcomes  [67] . Adolescents and young adults would prefer to network with their peers, which would enable them to share their experiences and offer each other emotional and informational support. Previous studies have proved that face-to-face support groups and peer guidance were underused but highly anticipated resources among adolescents and young adults with chronic diseases, which should be fully explored in the self-management and health care transition in the future  [68] . In addition, some adolescents and young adults preferred to share information or discuss their concerns with their health care providers. Dwyer-Matzky et al  [69]  found that 59% of adolescents and young adults with chronic diseases would like to establish close connections with medical teams, which has been proven to effectively improve treatment adherence.\n\nFrom the perspective of intervention effectiveness, although digital health interventions have great potential in the context of adolescent disease management, some results have indicated insufficient evidence of improvement in terms of adolescent self-management behavior and biomedical outcomes. For example, some fair-to-good-quality randomized controlled trials showed that compared to the control group, there were no significant improvements in asthma control scores  [31] , quality of life  [31] , disease knowledge  [33] , and self-efficacy  [33, 43]  at postintervention (P\uff1e.05). A meta-analysis conducted by Low and Manias  [24]  did not reveal any differences in the impact of interventions provided through mobile apps and websites on quality of life, self-management, which could mainly be attributed to the lack of high-quality randomized controlled trials. Due to the small number and heterogeneity of the studies, meta-analysis was precluded in this study. Therefore, we cannot draw a conclusion about the efficacy of the eHealth and mHealth interventions on symptom control, self-reported medication adherence, quality of life, disease knowledge, and self-management development from this review. Future large-scale, high-quality randomized controlled trials and investigations of the efficacy and sustainability of eHealth and mHealth interventions should be conducted. In addition, among the included studies, only one study  [52]  focused on the health care transition process and evaluated transition readiness. In the systematic review conducted by P\u00e9rez et al  [23] , none of the studies measured the transition process as an outcome. Evaluating transition readiness has been widely regarded as an important component of optimizing transition outcomes due to its ability to identify obstacles to transition, individually plan for treatment, and monitor progress over time  [70] . More attention should be paid to the transitional outcomes especially transition readiness of adolescents and young adults with chronic diseases to facilitate smooth health care transition and optimize patient health outcomes.\n\nFrom a cost-effectiveness perspective, eHealth and mHealth technologies may exhibit greater cost-effectiveness than face-to-face consultation or clinical medical care. Due to its ability to overcome spatial limitations, this approach can greatly reduce the time and transportation costs for both users and professional medical personnel  [71] . Nevertheless, little is known about the cost-effectiveness of developing and maintaining such technology-based interventions. The World Health Organization strongly recommends that cost analyses of interventions should be conducted  [72] . Relevant costs include long-term direct and indirect costs, ranging from digital health intervention development to training and implementation, as well as the ultimate benefits for patients and health care systems, such as improving patient health outcomes and reducing human resource costs. However, no studies included in this review evaluated the economic characteristics and cost-effectiveness of digital interventions, while only one study made a reference to cost in the review by P\u00e9rez et al  [23] . Two systematic reviews indicated a lack of economic data to support eHealth and mHealth interventions among adolescents and young adults with chronic diseases  [22, 73] . Butler et al  [22]  suggested considering costs as early as possible during the process of prototype development to help make strategic decisions, while Badawy et al  [73]  highlighted the need for a comprehensive economic evaluation of technology-based interventions to facilitate more evidence-based assessments of the scalability, sustainability, and benefits of broader investment of such technology tools among adolescents and young adults with chronic diseases."

As the heterogeneity was observed across different studies and the different stages of intervention development (feasibility, usability, efficiency, and effectiveness) on which they focused, we used a descriptive synthesis-based methodology. This form of analysis can be subjective, and it faces the risk of reporting bias. To mitigate this risk and improve transparency, all the authors reviewed all the stages of the data analysis. Finally, some relevant studies might have been missed because only studies published in English were included. It was acknowledged that a search including foreign language databases may reveal additional studies published in languages other than English in low-and middle-income countries. Given these limitations, the findings of this systematic review should be interpreted with caution."

      "title": "Conclusions",
      "text": "This systematic review revealed that adolescents and young adults were receptive to and interested in receiving information and managing their health using a mobile app or website. It should be noted that adolescents and young adults had different preferred styles of message delivery and functions. Therefore, to provide an age-appropriate, reliable condition-specific resource and improve patient engagement during the transition process, the best approach would be to involve adolescents and young adults early in the design process to identify their specific needs and preference. This would be better to be coupled with or followed by obtaining suggestions from health care providers and app teams. As most of the studies remained in the early stages of exploration, there remain limited data about the effectiveness of eHealth and mHealth interventions facilitating self-management and health care transition of adolescents and young adults with chronic diseases. Large sample, multicenter randomized controlled trials should be conducted in the future to verify the effectiveness of eHealth and mHealth interventions. Moreover, future studies could pay more attention to the transitional outcomes (especially transition readiness), and cost-effectiveness of developing and maintaining eHealth and mHealth interventions."
