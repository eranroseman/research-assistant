  "title": "Development and Evaluation of a Digital Health Intervention to Prevent Type 2 Diabetes in Primary Care: The PREDIABETEXT Study Protocol for a Randomised Clinical Trial",
  "abstract": "Background: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is a highly prevalent disease associated with an increased risk of comorbidities, premature death, and health costs. Prediabetes is a stage of glucose alteration previous to T2DM, that can be reversed. The aim of the study is to develop and evaluate a low-intensity, multifaceted, digital intervention to prevent T2DM. The intervention comprises: (1) the use of mobile health technology to send tailored text messages promoting lifestyle changes to people at risk of T2DM and (2) the provision of online education to primary healthcare physicians and nurses about management of prediabetes. Methods: In stages 1-4 we will design, develop and pilot-test the intervention. In Stage 5 we will conduct a phase II, six-month, three-arm, cluster randomized, clinical trial with 42 primary care professionals and 420 patients at risk of T2DM. Patients will be allocated to a control group (usual care), intervention A (patient messaging intervention), or intervention B (patient messaging intervention plus online education to their primary healthcare professionals). The primary outcome will be glycated haemoglobin. All the procedures obtained ethical approval in June",

      "title": "1.. Introduction",
      "text": "Chronic diseases are increasingly prevalent and pose an enormous burden on patients and the healthcare system. Not surprisingly, primary prevention has emerged as a key priority internationally  [1] .\n\nRecent advances in the area of implementation research show that, even when effective, most interventions frequently fail to be translated into routine healthcare practice due to deficiencies in the implementation strategies. It is estimated that, on average, around 17 years are needed for evidence-based interventions to be integrated into clinical practice, and that almost two-thirds of the organizations' efforts to implement changes are unsuccessful  [2] . Implementation scientists have suggested that nurses could play a key role in streamlining the implementation of healthcare interventions, given their dual role in clinical practice and research  [3, 4] .\n\nThe implementation of successful interventions to prevent type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is particularly challenging. Recommendations for supporting T2DM prevention through healthy lifestyles are now widely incorporated in clinical practice guidelines  [5] . However, strategies for providing effective continuing support and motivation are not well developed, and facilitating sustained behaviour change is a key challenge. A number of barriers, both at the patient and at the healthcare professional level, limit the uptake of these interventions. At the patient level, the uptake of lifestyle interventions is influenced not only by intrapersonal participant factors, but also by external determinants related to healthcare professionals or the environment  [6] . At the healthcare professional level, their participation in lifestyle-based prevention programs is generally scarce, mainly due to a lack of confidence in the effectiveness of the prevention programs, poor communication skills, lack of time with each patient, lack of specialized staff (nutritionists, sports scientists, psychologists, etc.), lack of training on brief counselling techniques, and limited organizational support  [7] .\n\nOne potential solution to this complex problem could be the use of interventions delivered via mobile devices (mHealth interventions), as a way of offering a new approach to support lifestyle changes  [8, 9] . Automated messages delivered via such tools can potentially target an extensive range of beliefs and behaviours over a long period of time, being the interventions wide-ranging and low cost. The content of mHealth interventions can also be personalized based on data from electronic health records and patient-generated data, having a great potential for delivering personalized health services. Previous trials showed that brief text messages (e.g., SMS) delivered via digital health systems added to usual care can be effective in improving T2DM risk factors such as overweight  [10, 11] , hypertension  [12] , hyperlipidemia  [13] , and high levels of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c)  [10, 14] . Several trials have evaluated the impact of mHealth interventions in people at high risk of diabetes, with positive results in reducing T2DM incidence  [15] , glucose tolerance  [16] , and weight loss and HbA1c  [11] . However, a recent study in India and UK, showed no significant reduction in the progression to T2DM in 2 years by lifestyle modification using SMS messaging  [17] . This highlights the need for future studies to analyse the effectiveness of mHealth interventions within other populations, carefully analysing the content of the messages, the behavioural change techniques applied, and the topics that are covered, as well as other characteristics of the intervention, such as the duration or frequency of the messages sent.\n\nType 2 diabetes mellitus is a common, life-long condition affecting around 4 million people in Spain  [18] , being one of the largest public health problems worldwide  [19] . People with T2DM are at high risk of developing serious complications (e.g., blindness, lower-limb amputations, kidney disease, and cardiovascular disease), which reduce their quality of life and life expectancy. T2DM and its complications are the cause of major expenditure for the Spanish National Health System (SNS): yearly, 8% of total SNS expenditure is spent on direct costs, in addition to other indirect costs of diabetes-related complications. Type 2 diabetes mellitus complications also affect not only the health status of the individual but also their ability to work during their productive life: in Spain, labour productivity losses attributable to T2DM are around \u20ac2.8 billion  [20] . Furthermore, T2DM and its risk factors disproportionally affect socially vulnerable populations: in Spain, the prevalence of T2DM in the lowest (most deprived) socio-economic status (V to VI) is 9.3%, compared to 4.5% in the upper class (I and II)  [21] .\n\nPrediabetes, defined by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)  [22]  and the Working Group of the Spanish Diabetes Society  [23]  as HbA1c from 6% to 6.4% or fasting plasma glucose 110-125 mg/dL, or both, approximately affects 7.3% of the population worldwide  [19] . However, in Spain, the prevalence of prediabetes is higher, around 13-15%  [24] . Prediabetes is a high-risk state for diabetes, with an annualized conversion rate of 5-10%; with similar proportion converting back to normoglycaemia  [25] . In addition, people with prediabetes have a higher risk of developing cardiovascular diseases  [26] . For people with prediabetes, lifestyle modification focusing on a healthy diet alongside the promotion of physical activity, is the cornerstone of diabetes prevention, with evidence of a 40-70% relative-risk reduction  [24, 25] .\n\nDespite the observed large benefits of lifestyle modification, the implementation in the healthcare setting of interventions to support lifestyle changes in people with prediabetes remains an important challenge: patients' knowledge about diabetes and its prevention is still insufficient among the Spanish population  [27] , and indicators used to evaluate the efficacy of preventive diabetes interventions have not improved over the last fifteen years  [28] . MHealth interventions can reach a wide range of people with a small investment of time and resources, allowing more time to be spent on other healthcare needs. Therefore, it is important to find highly implementable and effective digital interventions to promote healthy lifestyles in people with prediabetes. In Spain, the impact of digital health interventions to promote lifestyle changes in people with prediabetes has not been trialled. Digital health interventions have the potential to be a low cost, highly scalable, and sustainable strategy for Health Systems. Spain is one of the countries with the highest mobile phone use rates in the world, with 98% of users  [29] . According to the Spanish National Institute of Statistics latest figures, the proportion of older (>65 years) people who used a mobile phone in the last three months increased from 64% to 89% between 2010 and 2018. Therefore, an intervention based on the use of short, automated messages (SMSs) to promote healthy lifestyles has the potential to reach a very large proportion of the Spanish population. Unlike social media platforms, such as WhatsApp, SMSs have the advantage that information security is guaranteed, does not require Internet access, and it is accessible and usable by socially vulnerable population.\n\nThere is an important knowledge gap about the impact of digital interventions to support healthy lifestyles in patients with prediabetes, particularly in Spain. Taking into account the potential for digital interventions to prevent T2DM and its complications, methodologically robust research is needed to develop and evaluate evidence-based digital interventions to support lifestyle change in people at risk of T2DM."

Exploring patient perspectives about brief messages supporting lifestyle change behaviour: interviews with 15 patients (diverse in terms of socioeconomic level) at risk of T2DM (HbA1c 6-6.4% over the last three months, two consecutive values of fasting plasma glucose 110-125 mg/dL over the last 12 months, or both) will be conducted to understand the way messages might work in supporting lifestyle changes. Interviews will be audio-recorded, transcribed and analysed using the thematic analysis technique  [31, 32] .\n\nSub-stage 1.2. Exploring healthcare professionals' perceived barriers and facilitators to intervention implementation: interviews with 15 primary healthcare general practitioners (GP) and nurses will be conducted to identify barriers to the implementation of the intervention. The interviews will be analysed using thematic analysis  [32] .\n\nSub-stage 1.3. Producing the library of messages: The SMS library created for the DIABE-TEXT study  [33]  will be used as a starting point and the messages will be adapted for the pre-diabetes population. The DIABE-TEXT library was created from an expert workshop with endocrinologists, nutritionists, sports scientists, nurses, psychologists, GPs and pharmacists, which generated up to 500 messages using different behaviour change techniques  [34] . A team of nutritionists and sports scientists will adapt the messages from DIABE-TEXT study and create new messages with the aim of having messages covering all the relevant topics (motivation, type of food, portions, physical activity, sedentary lifestyle, etc.) adapted for the pre-diabetes population. Once the new SMS library has been created, other professionals will review the messages and make suggestions for improvement. Once we have the final SMS library, we will move on to the design of the delivery strategy. A team of nutritionists and sports scientists will arrange the messages in the order in which they will be sent to patients, taking into account the variety of messages (motivation, pre-diabetic education, nutrition, physical activity and sedentary lifestyle), progression in complexity, progression in intensity, frequency and volume in the case of physical activity, and personalisation (smoking and weight loss). 2.3.1.

In terms of nutrition, recommendations will be given on the type of carbohydrates that are most suitable to prevent glycaemic peaks, portions, and frequency of consumption of food groups, ultraprocessed foods and others for occasional consumption, alcohol consumption and energy drinks, as well as recipe examples  [39] [40] [41] . In terms of physical activity, messages will include recommendations to increase the frequency, intensity and duration of physical activity, strategies to reduce sedentary behaviour, and strategies to replace sedentary time with physical activity time  [42, 43] . In addition, we will include motivational messages, as well as other personalized messages for participants who need to lose weight or who are smokers.\n\nIn the intervention B group, patients will receive the same text messaging intervention as in group A, and in addition, their primary healthcare professionals will receive online education on the management of patients with prediabetes at the primary healthcare level. The online education for healthcare professionals will consist of written material on how to achieve behavioural changes and what recommendations are appropriate for a population with prediabetes in terms of diet, exercise and diabetes prevention.

      "title": "3.. Discussion",
      "text": "In Spain, more than 4 million people suffer from T2DM. It is well established that T2DM can be effectively prevented through lifestyle changes, but patients at risk of T2DM do not always receive adequate advice on recommended changes in diet and physical activity. Moreover, strategies to provide ongoing and effective support and motivation are not well developed and facilitating sustained behaviour change remains a major challenge.\n\nThe interventions proposed in this study have the potential to contribute to addressing this important problem. Two systematic reviews by members of our team show that automated brief text messages sent to mobile devices effectively promote lifestyle changes  [14]  and medication adherence  [49] . We propose these types of interventions not only because they are likely to be effective but also because of their high translational value. They can be delivered at low cost (clear potential for cost-effectiveness) and easily implemented widely (high scalability), therefore constituting a sustainable strategy for Health Services to improve health at the population level. This technology-based solution is highly transferable as it could also be adapted for its use in other settings and groups of patients. In addition, the intervention would offer, in times of pandemic, a feasible alternative to face-to-face consultations for people with prediabetes, with a personalized lifestyle change, using preventive strategies.\n\nThese interventions would enable personalized remote health care for a broad population including socially vulnerable populations. This is of particular relevance in view of the affection of T2DM in this population group and the difficulties of access, and therefore representation, of this population group in clinical trials.\n\nTelemedicine has increased during the COVID-19 pandemic, becoming a very important resource for improving healthcare management, especially in primary care, supervised by multidisciplinary teams, consisting mainly of nurses and GPs  [50] . Implementing mHealth interventions by nurses for the prevention of T2DM could reduce healthcare costs and reach larger populations."

      "title": "Limitations",

Second, involving primary healthcare professionals through online intervention may be unfeasible if the COVID-19 pandemic continues hitting our region with high intensity. Finally, the proposed phase II trial is not powered to determine the effectiveness of the proposed interventions in preventing T2DM. However, it will provide valuable information to determine the feasibility of the trial procedures and to explore the potential impact of the intervention in terms of reduction of HbA1c. We plan to conduct a fully powered phase III trial in case positive results are obtained from this study."

Interventions to prevent the development of type 2 diabetes are needed; (3) The development of a low-cost, easy-to-implement intervention is crucial to address a problem that affects a large vast of population. For all the aforementioned, findings from this study will contribute to solving a real and urgent problem of society, contributing to addressing type 2 diabetes mellitus prevention through a low-cost and easily implementable intervention."
