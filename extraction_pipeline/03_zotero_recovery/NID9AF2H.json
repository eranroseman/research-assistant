  "abstract": "Breast cancer places a substantial burden on patient physical and mental wellbeing, and the delivery of highquality supportive care is essential at all stages of the disease. Given the increased uptake of technology in recent years, eHealth interventions may be a convenient and accessible method for supportive care. Within this context, we conducted a systematic review to describe and quantify the use of eHealth for breast cancer supportive care. We searched MEDLINE, EMBASE, and CINAHL databases for primary research studies published from 2016 to 2021 (present) that assessed the effects of eHealth interventions on adult patients with breast cancer. We explored the effects of the interventions on patient symptoms, lifestyle, satisfaction, and barriers, as well as factors related to feasibility and implementation. The risk of bias of each study was also assessed. Findings were presented according to stage of cancer care. We identified 43 relevant studies capturing n = 6,285 patients (30 randomized controlled trials and 13 non-randomized interventional studies); 5 evaluated patients who were newly diagnosed, 16 evaluated patients undergoing active treatment, and 22 evaluated patients in post-treatment follow-up. A total of 19 studies used mobile apps, 18 used online patient portals, 5 used text messaging, and 1 used both a patient portal and text messaging. We found that patients were broadly satisfied with the eHealth interventions; however, findings were less consistent for symptom and lifestyle-related outcomes. Eight studies were judged as high risk of bias. There was substantial between-study heterogeneity, which made it challenging to discern consistent trends. Overall, future research should continue to explore the use of eHealth for breast cancer supportive care, with a focus on improving patient symptoms.",

      "text": "Managing the long-term care of patients with high-burden chronic conditions is a major challenge facing global healthcare today. Cancer is one of the most common chronic diseases worldwide  [1]  with breast cancer being the most common cancer among women  [2] . In 2020, over 2 million women worldwide were newly diagnosed with breast cancer  [2] . Beyond the burden that breast cancer itself poses, patients may also experience other comorbidities  [3] [4] [5]  requiring further support. Providing high quality supportive care to patients with breast cancer involves patient care management and providing relief from treatment side effects  [6] . Strategies to manage breast cancer are important given the high global morbidity and mortality  [7] . Breast cancer has a substantial burden on an individual's physical and mental wellbeing.\n\nPatients' quality of life (QoL) is impacted by psychological challenges and physical restrictions caused by both the disease and treatment side effects  [8, 9] .\n\nHigh-quality care is defined as effective, patient-centered, safe, timely, efficient, and equitable  [10] . However, there are barriers and challenges preventing patients from receiving this care. Common examples include the distance to receive care, a lack of adequate or available transportation, and time constraints (i.e., travel time)  [11] . Furthermore, these barriers may be more prevalent among elderly, rural, racialized, and socioeconomically disadvantaged individuals  [12] .\n\nElectronic communication-based (eHealth) interventions are becoming a feasible option for providing supportive care to patients with breast cancer. eHealth is a cost-effective, bi-directional method of extending access to care for patients while providing healthcare workers with pertinent health information  [13, 14] . The global use of smartphones and other digital devices with online access is rapidly increasing, with over 1.5 mobile-connected devices per capita in 2020  [15] . As the use of these technologies becomes more commonplace, clinicians developing cancer care strategies have the opportunity to address issues preventing the provision of high-quality care. In addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the need for effective systems to deliver patient care remotely.\n\nAlthough evidence has suggested that eHealth interventions may help support self-management of symptoms and improve lifestyle factors among patients with cancer, most of the literature is not cancer type specific  [16, 17] . A few reviews have specifically investigated eHealth interventions among patients with breast cancer, evaluating outcomes including physical activity, survivorship, and QoL  [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] . However, none were able to capture the full breadth of the literature on this topic given their focus on specific outcome types and eHealth modalities. Further, most of these reviews do not include recent evidence.\n\nSupportive care may help facilitate the continuation of patients' regular lives  [21] . eHealth may specifically aid patients with breast cancer due its flexibility, as breast cancer often affects younger women  [22]  who may play multiple roles in life such as employee, partner, care giver, and mother  [23] . The use of eHealth interventions for patients with breast cancer has shown promise in certain domains such improved QoL  [19] , and shortcomings in other areas such as feasibility and implementation have been highlighted  [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] , showing a need to further investigate the use of these technologies in specific populations to gain a greater understanding of their potential uses in practice. Thus, our objective was to conduct a systematic review to describe and quantify the use of eHealth for breast cancer supportive care, focusing specifically on symptom, lifestyle, and feasibility outcomes, as well as patient satisfaction and barriers to use."

This review is not associated with a protocol; however, all relevant methodological information can be found in this manuscript and its supplement.\n\nFor the purposes of this review, we chose to categorize eHealth technologies into three distinct groups: online patient portals, mobile apps, and text messaging. In line with Kruse et al.  [28] , we defined patient portals as \"a secure online website that gives patients convenient,  24 -hour access to personal health information from anywhere with an Internet connection\"  [29] . We defined mobile apps as selfcontained software designed and installed specifically for use on mobile or other digital devices  [30] . While both patient portals and mobile apps can be accessed via an internet connection using a digital device, they differ on several key principles including their hardware and software components, clinical content, and overall workflow  [31] . Lastly, we defined text messaging as the use of mobile-based short message service communications."

We did not include conference abstracts (no available full text), reviews, commentaries/opinions, case studies, or case series. Our population of interest was adult (age \u2265 18 years) patients with a diagnosis of breast cancer. The intervention of interest was the use of eHealth (including online patient portals, mobile apps, and/or text messaging) to assist in cancer supportive care. We excluded studies where eHealth was not the main intervention or was part of a multi-modal intervention as it was not possible to discern the eHealth-specific effects in these situations. Studies were only included if they used a co-intervention or standard of care as a comparator. Our primary outcome of interest was disease symptoms. Our secondary outcomes of interest were lifestyle (including QoL, mental and physical health, physical activity, diet, etc.), feasibility/implementation (adherence, resource utilization, etc.), patient satisfaction, and barriers to use. Table  A .1 contains the detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria."

Two independent reviewers (MB, IS) screened the studies at the title/abstract level using the inclusion and exclusion criteria. Those studies deemed relevant were evaluated by the two reviewers at the full-text level. Any studies deemed ineligible for the review were excluded based on the following hierarchy of reasons: duplicate, study design, population, exposure/intervention, outcome, and comparator. Any conflicts between the reviewers were resolved through discussion and consensus, and when needed through a third arbitrator (DTW/BG). All aspects of the study screening process were completed using the Covidence webbased platform  [32] .\n\nOne reviewer extracted data from each of the included studies using a pre-designed Microsoft Excel form. Detailed information was collected on study design, location, population, baseline characteristics, sample size, intervention, control, eHealth technology details, follow-up length, and all relevant outcomes (both quantitative and qualitative). To ensure the accuracy of the data extraction process, a second reviewer (MB, IS) validated a random sample of 10 % of the included studies. Results were then presented by stage of cancer care (newly diagnosed, active treatment, and follow-up). We chose to separate our findings in this way because patients may have considerably different needs at each stage of the treatment process."

Each assessment was performed by the two independent reviewers (MB, IS) and any conflicts were resolved through consensus. The Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool  [33]  was used to assess bias for the randomized controlled trials (RCTs). A score of 8 or higher was considered low risk of bias (LRB) and a score below 8 was considered high risk (HRB). The Risk Of Bias In Non-randomized Studiesof Interventions (ROBINS-I) tool  [34]  was used to assess bias for the non-randomized interventional studies (i.e., non-randomized controlled trials (nRCTs), pre-post studies). Level of bias was rated as low (comparable to a wellperformed RCT), moderate (sound evidence for a non-randomized study), serious (contains some important problems), critical (too problematic to provide useful evidence), or no information (not enough information to make a judgement). We considered the studies rated as low or moderate to be at a low risk of bias (LRB). The studies rated as serious, critical, or no information were at a high risk of bias (HRB)."

Of the 43 studies, 5 included patients who were newly diagnosed, 16 included patients undergoing active treatment, and 22 included patients receiving posttreatment follow-up care. Length of study follow-up ranged from 1 week  [39]  to 3 years  [38] , and the majority (74 %) of studies had a follow-up period of 4 months or less  [37, . In terms of intervention modality, 19 studies used mobile apps, 18 studies used online patient portals, 5 used text messaging, and 1 used both a patient portal and text messaging.

      "text": "This systematic review presents a comprehensive summary of the use of eHealth interventions for breast cancer supportive care. Overall, we found that eHealth interventions produced heterogeneous effects on patient symptoms. Lifestyle outcomes varied based on treatment stage, with the most positive findings seen among patients undergoing active treatment. Lastly, although we identified some barriers to use, the eHealth interventions were met with a relatively high level of patient satisfaction.\n\nSymptom-related outcomes were examined by studies in both the active treatment and follow-up stages and heterogenous findings were seen for both patient groups. Similarities and differences in symptomology may be experienced by patients with breast cancer undergoing active treatment and cancer survivors post-active treatment. During active treatment, patients often experience acute symptoms such as pain, nausea, fatigue, in part due to the treatments they are undergoing  [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] . Those post-treatment may experience long term symptoms such as fatigue, pain, and sexual dysfunction, sometimes lasting over five years  [82] . Therefore, finding ways to manage and keep caregivers and clinicians informed of symptoms is important. While eHealth interventions themselves may not be able to reduce symptoms experienced by patients, they may still prove to be an effective tool in symptom tracking and management  [83] .\n\nPatients newly diagnosed with breast cancer have different needs than those undergoing active treatment or follow-up. All identified studies of newly diagnosed patients focused on providing information and supportive education using online patient portals. Online patient portals may be suited for providing supportive care at this stage, as they provide patients with an information seeking platform to learn about their new condition. Information seeking has been found to enhance coping strategies for disease-related challenges  [84] , making patient portals a beneficial resource for patients coming to terms with their new diagnosis  [70] .

There were no clear trends in our review; however, we identified a few promising findings within individual studies, specifically for decreased use of clinical support services and mental health outcomes  [41] . A possible reason for the inconclusiveness of our results was that we only identified five studies on newly diagnosed patients. While three of the studies were low risk of bias RCTs, more well-designed studies are needed to assess the effects of eHealth interventions among patients in this phase of breast cancer supportive care. eHealth for breast cancer supportive care in the active treatment stage showed promising results on the subscales of some QoL measures. As eHealth strategies are commonly self-directed, they may act to empower patients to take an active role in their health and thus improve aspects of their QoL  [85] . Literature shows that better compliance to behaviours recommended by a patient's cancer care team may in turn result in better patient-related outcomes  [86] . Improvement in QoL may be aided through self-directed and self-management interventions but is also still heavily dependant on the supports offered by oncology practices of organizations  [87] . Future research should examine a combination of self-directed interventions and clinical support to best optimize patient care and allow patients to be active participants in their health. While this review focused on eHealth interventions which focused on breast cancer, we acknowledge that other tools have been developed that are not breast cancer specific but may provide benefit to patients with breast cancer. While this was beyond the scope of this review, additional research should examine if site or disease specific interventions provide more or different benefits to patients during each phase of treatment.\n\nWe found some positive effects among pre-post studies of eHealth interventions for supportive care during post-treatment follow-up; however, QoL outcomes largely did not improve among RCTs. This is a similar finding to other examinations of eHealth strategies for improving QoL among cancer patients, where no significant differences were seen among RCTs  [88] . Well-conducted RCTs are commonly considered to be a higher source of evidence  [89]  and more high-quality results are needed going forward. To better improve QoL outcomes, researchers should gain a better understanding of the key factors driving QoL among patients with breast cancer  [90]  and ensure that eHealth interventions are specifically targeting these factors. Some of the follow-up studies in our review have already taken this approach by providing selfmanagement supportive care tailored to each individual patient and their needs  [39, 52] . Despite the lack of high-quality evidence supporting improvements in QoL outcomes, we found that some eHealth follow-up interventions improved aspects of physical and mental health. These improvements may be related to the nature of self-management interventions, which use information to build self-efficacy and thus support behaviour change and improve health outcomes  [91] . In summary, further evidence is needed to develop successful eHealth interventions that support improvements in breast cancer follow-up care outcomes.\n\nWe found that eHealth interventions were associated with a high level of patient satisfaction, few barriers to use, and no detrimental effects. Patients with breast cancer rated the eHealth interventions as highly satisfactory and useful, and many also reported that they would recommend the interventions to others, despite barriers identified. Our findings were similar to those of a systematic review on telehealth and patient satisfaction that reported largely positive outcomes including ease of use, improved communication and self-management, and increased access  [92] . Our findings were also similar to our previous review of text messaging in a cancer population  [93] . Future research is needed to understand barriers to implementation, as the consistently high patient satisfaction associated with eHealth interventions suggests that they are well-accepted and have potential utility to improve breast cancer supportive care. Amidst the positive findings of high satisfaction, we recognize the included studies took place in relatively controlled and select settings. In practice further barriers beyond what is identified here, such as language barriers, technology, access among others, may arise. Additionally, while no harms were documented in the included studies, it is possible perils of eHealth interventions maybe identified when these tools are further studied or put in practice. Future research should seek to identify potential harms and further barriers and mean of which to address them. As the goal of such interventions should be to improve patient outcomes and experiences, we suggest future research take a patient centric approach to examining eHealth interventions.\n\nOverall, reporting on resource utilization outcomes was sparse, examined by only 7 % of the included studies. Further, resource utilization outcomes were heterogeneous and study quality varied widely.\n\nd Patient Satisfaction/Barrier Outcomes: The following hierarchy was used to determine which patient satisfaction outcomes to include in the table: if available, 1 satisfaction outcome (1) overall satisfaction or (2) intervention-specific satisfaction and 1 barrier outcome(1) barriers related to the intervention, or (2) barriers related to recruitment. Abbreviations: ANCOVA (analysis of covariance), C (control), CI (confidence interval), EORTC-C30 (European Organization for the Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire), ES (effect size), FACT (Functional Assessment of Cancer Therapy; ES Endocrine Subscale, BC Breast Cancer), I (intervention), mins (minutes), mo (month), SD (standard deviation), SE (standard error), wk (week). Note: For all outcomes, when multiple time points were recorded, we reported the longest available follow-up. Change from baseline to longest follow up was reported when available and when this was unavailable, longest follow-up without change from baseline was reported."

Future studies examining eHealth use for breast cancer supportive care should also include examinations of largescale implementation and feasibility outcomes. Improved evaluation techniques in addition to the use of standardized methods for outcome reporting would provide stronger insight into the real-world effectiveness of eHealth interventions in breast cancer supportive care. This review has several strengths. We included both randomized clinical trials and non-randomized studies, allowing us to comprehensively review the available literature on eHealth for breast cancer supportive care. We also performed a rigorous search of three electronic databases, providing a comprehensive view of the current state of the literature. Capturing the full extent of the eHealth literature is"

While our review had many strengths it also had limitations. For feasibility purposes, only studies written in the English language were included, which may have limited our search. Secondly, the heterogeneity between studies was high, even among those that focused on the same phase of cancer care. This may be due to a lack of standardized outcome measurements, resulting in the use of many different measures to quantify the same outcome. For example, medication adherence failure, the Korean Medication Adherence scale, and the Morisky Adherence score were all used to measure medication adherence. The use of standardized outcome measures in future research may help improve compatibility between studies within each phase of cancer care. Additionally, 5 of the 13 non-randomized interventional studies and 3 of the 31 RCTs were considered high risk of bias. Due to this, findings should be interpreted carefully and within the context of this potential bias. It should also be noted that the Cochrane Risk of Bias tool penalizes studies, such as those included in the present review, that are unable to blind participants, resulting in a lower total score (i.e., higher risk of bias). Further, the representation of low-and middle-income countries was poor, having only two studies conducted within such populations, suggesting a knowledge gap and limiting the generalizability of this review. We acknowledge the inherent selection bias due to the inclusion of a large number of pre-post observational studies. Additionally, uptake rates varied widely and inclusion criteria for many of the included studies required technological ability and/or access. This further contributes to selection bias and may result in lower satisfaction or uptake during realworld implementation. Lastly, the small yield of appropriate studies, particularly among the newly diagnosed stage, resulted in the inability to generalize our findings or present conclusions."

      "text": "Within the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, eHealth has played a key role in patient care. We conducted a systematic review of the recent literature on the use of eHealth at three key stages of breast cancer supportive care: newly diagnosed, active treatment, and post-treatment follow-up. Although the eHealth interventions were associated with high levels of patient satisfaction and acceptance, they produced mixed effects on symptom and lifestyle-related outcomes in comparison to controls. Notably, the studies were highly heterogeneous, and several were of a high risk of bias, meaning that those findings should be interpreted with caution. Future research efforts should continue to explore the utility of eHealth interventions for patients with breast cancer, focusing on improvements in patient symptoms using standardized outcome measures through a patient centric lens.\n\nTable A4 (continued ) Author, Year Symptom Control Lifestyle (Inc.Qol, diet, exercise, mental health, weight) Feasibility/Implementation Patient Satisfaction/Barriers to Use vs 74.6; 9 weeks 51.5 vs 61.0 (rate difference -0.10, 95% CI -0.23,0.04, group x time interaction p=0.33); 15 weeks 34.0 vs 64.9 (rate difference -0.31, 95% CI -0.45, -0.18, group x time interaction p< 0.001); % with sleep efficiency < 85%, I vs C: baseline 79.1 vs 72.7; 9 weeks 27.0 vs 60.4 (rate difference -0.34, 95% CI -0.47, -0.20, group x time interaction p< 0.001)\n\na This study contains an additional interventional group (personalized coaching phone calls), not reported here as this was not our intervention of interest. b This study included women within 3 months of diagnosis, irrespective of treatment status. We chose to classify this study as newly diagnosed given that the majority of the sample was < 2 months since diagnosis and had not yet completed primary surgical treatment. c This study included women who were currently receiving treatment or had received treatment within the past 3-12 months. We chose to classify this study as active treatment given that the majority of the sample was currently receiving treatment. d This study included women within 5 years post-diagnosis, not restricted by treatment status. We chose to classify this study as follow-up given that the majority of the sample was not on active treatment. e This study included women within 5 years post-diagnosis, not restricted by treatment status. We chose to classify this study as follow-up given that the majority of the\n\nsample was over 1-year post-diagnosis.
