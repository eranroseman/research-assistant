  "title": "Evaluation of Digital Technologies Tailored to Support Young People's Self-Management of Musculoskeletal Pain: Mixed Methods Study",
  "abstract": "Background: Digital technologies connect young people with health services and resources that support their self-care. The lack of accessible, reliable digital resources tailored to young people with persistent musculoskeletal pain is a significant gap in the health services in Australia. Recognizing the intense resourcing required to develop and implement effective electronic health (eHealth) interventions, the adaptation of extant, proven digital technologies may improve access to pain care with cost and time efficiencies. Objective: This study aimed to test the acceptability and need for adaptation of extant digital technologies, the painHEALTH website and the iCanCope with Pain app, for use by young Australians with musculoskeletal pain. Methods: A 3-phased, mixed methods evaluation was undertaken from May 2019 to August 2019 in Australia. Young people aged 15 to 25 years with musculoskeletal pain for >3 months were recruited. Phases were sequential: (1) phase 1, participant testing (3 groups, each of n=5) of co-designed website prototypes compared with a control website (painHEALTH), with user tasks mapped to eHealth quality and engagement criteria; (2) phase 2, participants' week-long use of the iCanCope with Pain app with engagement data captured using a real-time analytic platform (daily check-ins for pain, interference, sleep, mood, physical activity, and energy levels; goal setting; and accessing resources); and (3) phase 3, semistructured interviews were conducted to gain insights into participants' experiences of using these digital technologies. Results: Fifteen young people (12/15, 80% female; mean age 20.5 [SD 3.3] years; range 15-25 years) participated in all 3 phases. The phase 1 aggregated group data informed the recommendations used to guide 3 rapid cycles of prototype iteration. Adaptations included optimizing navigation, improving usability (functionality), and enhancing content to promote user engagement and acceptability. In phase 2, all participants checked in, with the highest frequency of full check-ins attributed to pain intensity (183/183,",

      "text": "Young people want access to health services that are tailored and responsive to their specific health needs, especially for those with chronic health conditions such as persistent musculoskeletal pain  [1] [2] [3] . Digital technologies connect young people with health services and resources to support their self-care and promote positive health habits  [4] [5] [6] . Furthermore, digital technologies are portable, customizable, and readily assimilate into young people's daily routines  [5] .\n\nThis capability to connect is especially important for young people with chronic health conditions, including pain, during the critical transition from childhood to young adulthood  [1, 7] . Persistent pain can impose a significant and enduring health and economic burden on young people and their communities  [8, 9] . Australian data suggest persistent pain rates for young people approach those of adults (ie, approximately 20%)  [8, 10] , whereas international data indicate higher rates for musculoskeletal pain (eg, 37% for back pain)  [11] [12] [13] . Young people often fall through gaps during this developmental transition, with many failing to seek care and adopting unhelpful habits that increase the risk of ongoing health and social issues  [6] . In Australia, this risk is compounded by young people exiting pediatric health services around the age of 16 years and failing to seamlessly integrate into adult health services, despite transitional frameworks  [1, 14, 15] . Digital technologies may help to drive engagement, enabling timely access and broader reach to the right health care  [1, 14, 16, 17] . Currently, the lack of accessible, reliable digital resources tailored to the needs and preferences of young Australians with persistent musculoskeletal pain remains a health services gap  [14, 18] . Recognizing the intense resourcing required to develop and implement effective electronic health (eHealth) interventions, adaptation of proven digital technologies may be a more cost-and time-efficient approach  [19] .\n\nTo accelerate the implementation of digital technologies into the care of young Australians with musculoskeletal pain, we established a transnational partnership to leverage digital technologies already developed and tested for pain care. Both platforms were co-designed using best practice recommendations for eHealth design and implementation  [20] .\n\nFirst, in Australia, we developed a digital resource, painHEALTH, to support improved musculoskeletal pain care for adults  [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] . Co-designed with consumers, using a policy-into-practice approach  [28] , aligned to contemporary musculoskeletal models of care and strategic health frameworks (the chronic conditions framework  [29]  and the national pain strategy  [15] ), painHEALTH supports consumers accessing the right care, at the right time, by the right team. Impact evaluation demonstrated that consumers/caregivers and health professionals perceived painHEALTH as supporting holistic self-management and cocare of musculoskeletal pain  [30] . Second, in Canada, an integrated smartphone and web-based self-management program, iCanCope with Pain, was developed  [16, 31] . This digital platform addresses the self-management needs of young people with persistent pain by improving access to contemporary tailored pain education; providing practical strategies to manage pain, psychological well-being, and sleep hygiene; encouraging physical activity; and providing peer social support  [3, 16] . The platform is undergoing cultural adaptation and usability testing evaluation in Norway  [32] .\n\nTrial evaluation in Canada is also underway to assess implementation success and effectiveness (such as pain intensity, pain-related activity limitations, and health-related quality of life) outcomes (clinical trial number: NCT02601755)."

The specific aims were as follows: utilized the iCanCope with Pain app (hereafter app) over a 1-week engagement period (research aim 2). Finally, in phase 3, semistructured interviews were conducted to provide insights into the participants' experiences of using these digital technologies (Figure  1 ). The study had institutional ethics approval, adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki, and aligned with reporting recommendations from the consolidated criteria for reporting qualitative studies: 32-item criteria (Multimedia Appendix 1)  [33] .\n\nFigure  1 . A 3-phased approach to the user testing was adopted, with all participants undertaking user testing of website prototypes (phase 1), pain app user testing (phase 2), and semistructured interviews on their experiences of using these digital technologies (phase 3)."

Initial eligibility screening was undertaken using a web-based survey platform Qualtrics. The survey instrument was informed by our previous research on young people with musculoskeletal pain  [1, 16] , with minor iterations, and was piloted by members of the research team (HS, AMB, J Chua, and JNS) before deployment to the field.

      "text": "The participants meeting the inclusion criteria and providing consent completed an initial web-based survey to capture demographics and clinical characteristics, including area(s) of their pain, pain duration, and pain diagnosis. The \u00d6rebro Musculoskeletal Pain Screening Questionnaire-Short Form (\u00d6MPSQ-SF)  [34]  was included as a measure of pain-related disability. The \u00d6MPSQ-SF has been validated for use in primary care  [35]  and used for previous clinical pain research in this age group  [1] . Items are scored 0 to 10; 0 refers to the absence of impairment and 10 to severe impairment. A total of 3 items are reversed in order for all the questions to be oriented in the same direction. Total scores range between 1 and 100, with a score >50 indicating higher estimated risk for future (work) disability. Given the age range for our cohort, we modified the wording for items where work was mentioned to include work/study. Once participants completed the web-based survey, they were contacted to schedule a time for phase 1 of the user testing.\n\nParticipants were allocated sequentially to 3 testing groups (each comprising 5 participants). Groups were run in series, with group allocations remaining consistent across all 3 phases of testing (as all participants consented to complete all 3 phases). The purpose of serial testing in phase 1 was to enable iterative cycles of formative feedback used to guide prototype refinements before the subsequent testing group, an approach consistent with best practice recommendations for digital user testing  [16, 20] . The period of testing across all 3 phases for a group ranged from 11 to 26 days. At the completion of phase 3, all participants received an AUD $100 (US $65) gift voucher."

      "title": "Phase 1. painHEALTH and Prototype Website User Testing",
      "text": "For this phase of user testing, the existing painHEALTH platform was used as a control website. This allowed users to evaluate 2 newly developed website prototypes against a fully functional comparator. As painHEALTH was co-designed with adults, rather than younger Australians, we did not expect participants to easily relate to this website, but rather to consider features and content that might be helpful on a youth-focused platform. The prototypes were informed from our previous research using insights from young people with musculoskeletal pain about their needs and preferences for digital tools  [1] . The specific tasks are outlined later in the paper.\n\nWe implemented Lookback as the test platform, using the LookBack Live option. LookBack Live allows users and researchers to engage and communicate together in real time with a website (in this case, painHEALTH and website prototypes) via a shared screen, with reactions, comments, behaviors, and interactions captured via downloadable audiovisual recording. This platform provided a good fit for purpose, enabling flexible scheduling, remote user access, and participants use of their own computers or mobile devices without the need for additional cables or cameras. User insights are denoted by a researcher's use of time stamps, with additional capacity for taking technical notes within the test platform that can later be extracted in text and recorded form. A rapid cycle of prototype iteration was undertaken at each group's completion of user testing.\n\nBefore implementing the user testing, the LookBack Live platform and user tasks were piloted by members of the research team (HS, AMB, JNS, and CL). Minor amendments were made to the user tasks to improve clarity regarding tasks. Participants were scheduled to a time slot, emailed a unique LookBack Live invitation link, and provided with instructions for the session. Participants were informed that the user testing was about the prototypes (and not themselves) and they \"can't do or say anything wrong\" and to \"think aloud\" as much as possible. The total mean duration of the web-based prototype testing was between 60 and 90 min.\n\nParticipants were tasked with evaluation in the following order:"

Users were guided through 4 tasks covering interactive content (pain conditions and stories, self-checks, and pain management) on musculoskeletal pain care.\n\n\u2022 Two newly developed prototype websites (Figure  2 ): Prototype 1 was characterized by soft round shapes with a palette of purple/yellow/pink, and prototype 2 featured a geometric design with a blue/black palette). Content for the prototypes was adapted from the painHEALTH website for the evaluation tasks. The prototype websites were powered by InVision (digital product design). Participants completed the same 4 tasks across each of the 3 websites (Multimedia Appendix 2). Each test task was contextualized by: (1) a background statement about the nature of the task, (2) instructions to guide the specific task required, (3) specific questions about each task to gauge feedback, and (4) any additional feedback. The 4 test tasks were as follows 1. Find and watch Daniel's pain story: This video/text content captured a young person's narrative around their experiences with low back pain. 2 . Find and complete the '\u00d6rebro Musculoskeletal Pain Self-Check': This self-check questionnaire is designed for use across musculoskeletal pain conditions to predict the risk of higher estimated disability  [34] , and users can print out their score to share with health professionals. 3 . Find and read the Making Sense of Pain management module: This content is focused on reasons why pain can persist beyond normal tissue healing times and the need for tailored holistic and integrated pain care. 4 . Find Further assistance: This page provides a list of West Australian pain services and links to a cross-discipline health professional listing managed by the Australian Pain Society.\n\nThese test tasks were designed to reflect user-centered eHealth design principles  [20]  and criteria that predict real-world user engagement  [20, 36, 37] , specifically:\n\n\u2022 Navigation \u2022 Usability (functionality and ease of utilization)\n\n\u2022 User engagement (content presentation, interactive, not irritating, targeted/tailored/personalized, captivating, and relatability)\n\n\u2022 Content (appropriate level of literacy, credible, clear, and concise)\n\n\u2022 Acceptability (design look and feel, meets the expectations of young people with musculoskeletal pain, motivating, and likability).\n\nEngagement criteria were intentionally mapped across the task tests, with some overlapping of criteria (Table  1 ) to enable meaningful interpretation of outcomes and inform prototype iteration.\n\nTable  1 .

Before the interview, participants were contacted (JEJ) to outline the interview process and schedule a time for the interview, in a quiet location chosen by the participant. All 15 interviews were conducted via teleconferencing by a senior qualitative researcher (JEJ) with experience in interviewing young people with musculoskeletal pain and who was independent of phase 1 and 2. No participant requested a support person during the interview. Interviews were audio recorded (duration ranged between 14 and 36 min, mean duration 21 min) and transcribed verbatim.

In the first stage, 5 transcripts were analyzed using a general inductive analytical approach, where codes were directly derived from the data or from the ground up, without starting from a prior theoretical understanding of the issue being explored. For the second stage, the coding framework inductively derived from the first five 5 transcripts was then utilized to deductively code the second set of 5 transcripts. When a new topic emerged from the data, a corresponding code was developed inductively. In the third stage, to verify data redundancy, the revised coding framework was applied to the final set of 5 transcripts. No new codes were added to the framework in this final stage of the analysis. By utilizing a combined inductive and deductive analytical approach, which involved a constant comparison of data over a period until no new topics emerged (data redundancy), a comprehensive profile of participant preferences and experiences was developed. Following the finalization of the coding framework, codes were reviewed, and key themes and corresponding subthemes were developed through an iterative process of grouping codes into concepts, reviewing transcripts, and refining themes. The interview schedule was intentionally divided into 4 parts: (1) general background/context (questions 1 and 2); (2) perceptions of the painHEALTH website functionality (question 3); (3) perceptions of the iCanCopewith Pain app functionality (question 4); and (4) perceptions related to the acceptability, use, and implementation of the 2 digital tools generally (questions 5-13). This enabled the analysis of transcripts to be undertaken for each part of the schedule as mutually exclusive categories. Key themes and subthemes aligning to each part of the interview schedule were then reviewed (HS, AMB, and JEJ) and grouped under overarching (meta) themes  [39] . One-third of the interview transcripts (n=5) were independently analyzed (JNS and CL) to confirm themes identified, and where necessary, refined to reach consensus, and confirm the construct validity. Data were structurally organized to present themes in a logical explanatory scheme  [40] .\n\nWe evaluated the extent to which our inductively derived data mapped to an evidence-based eHealth roadmap (the latter, extensively reviewed elsewhere)  [20] . The roadmap takes a holistic approach to the development of eHealth technologies, integrating persuasive health technology theories with business modeling (efficient, effective, and sustainable) to improve the uptake and impact of eHealth technologies in practice. The roadmap is agnostic to digital platforms, is inherently fluid, interactive, and allows for a cyclical approach to the co-design (acceptability, functionality, and usability) and implementation of digital technologies in real-world settings. The roadmap provided a good fit for purpose, the plurality allowing for analysis of content relevant across both digital platforms (specifically, contextual inquiry, user requirements, value specification, co-design, and operationalization, referred to here as implementation)."

Compared with the control site, participants liked the use of dropdowns (easier navigation) and self-check functionality enhancements (better user experience for quiz completion). The Further Support menu did not resonate well with participant expectations, as this suggested technical support for some. Simplifying language and the use of a glossary were perceived as enhancements that would improve user engagement. On the basis of these outcomes and discussions with members of the team (AMB, JNS, BL, and HS), a consensus decision was reached to proceed with the round and bright prototype only. Collectively, these data informed the first rapid cycle of prototype iteration, implemented before group 2 testing.\n\nTextbox 1.

Over the week of app use, all participants checked in, with 183 check-ins initiated. Of these, 59.6% (109/183) were full check-ins, meaning completion of all 5 domains (sleep, mood, physical activity, and energy levels). The highest frequency of full check-ins was attributed to pain intensity (183/183, 100.0%), followed by pain interference (175/183, 95.6%), and then mood (152/183, 83.1%). Attrition for check-ins was more common for domains covering physical activity (120/183, 65.6%) and energy (109/183, 59.6%). Note that the sleep domain is only asked once per day regardless of the number of times participants checked in each day (therefore, no denominator provided), which explains the lower number relative to other domains (n=72). A total of 73.3% (11/15) participants completed a total of 158 history views over the week of app use (ie, monitoring their progress over time), with a variable frequency of views for each domain. The highest frequency of domain history views related to pain intensity (51/158, 32.3%), followed by pain interference (24/158, 15.2%), activity (22/158, 13.9%), mood (21/158, 13.3%), sleep (19/158, 12.0%), and energy (18/158, 11.4%).\n\nFor the goals set feature, 86.7% (13/15) of participants set a total of 42 goals covering 5 areas.

Adaptation of the website prototype was required and informed by rapid cycles of iteration with a focus on improving user engagement. For the app, participant engagement highlighted the value of tailoring capabilities to support individualized pain self-management. Recommendations for app adaptations were modest and primarily related to enhancing functionality (more capacity to personalize the look and feel), improved flexibility (check-in time), and capacity to monitor outcomes from goal setting.

Our approach is consistent with evidence derived from our recent systematic review of mobile health technologies for chronic noncommunicable disease management in young people, specifically recommendations on effective implementation  [2]  and the use of an evidence-based roadmap to increase the uptake and impact of eHealth technologies  [20] . Our digital tools were perceived as being youth-focused, with a visual design that elicited positive user emotions and promoted active engagement, outcomes aligned with our primary study aims. The positive perceptions of young people on acceptability, usability, and potential engagement are consistent with qualities of product design that predict real-world user engagement with (app and web-based) eHealth interventions  [36] . Furthermore, a recent study on design qualities that may predict user adherence to behavioral eHealth interventions in real-world use, found therapeutic persuasiveness (defined as the incorporation of persuasive design/behavior change principles) to be the most robust predictor of adherence (ie, duration of use and number of unique sessions), suggesting the importance of persuasive design and behavior change techniques incorporation during the design and evaluation of digital behavioral interventions  [45] .\n\nRegarding adaptations, the optimization of the app was primarily related to enhancements in functionality (capacity to personalize the look and feel, scales for goal setting and monitoring of goals/outcomes, and time flexibility for check-ins). Use of the app over the week varied with individual participant engagement data, highlighting the value of flexible daily check-ins and tailoring capabilities to support individualized self-reflection and monitoring. A similar approach to testing cultural appropriateness, usability, and the need for adaptation of the iCanCope with Pain app has recently been undertaken in Norway  [32] , with preliminary outcomes indicating high levels of acceptability and usability, the only adaptations being the need for optimizing user interaction of the social support feature  [32] . The app is currently being evaluated in a randomized controlled trial with a larger sample with chronic pain and juvenile inflammatory arthritis. Other derivatives of the iCanCope with Pain app have also been developed for various conditions in children and adolescents, including self-management of postoperative pain  [46] , sickle cell pain  [47] , and juvenile idiopathic arthritis  [48] , with the latter 2 currently undergoing evaluation  [46] .\n\nAdaptation of the website prototype was guided by rounds of participant feedback, informing rapid cycles of iteration with a focus on improving user engagement. Recommendations for adaptation are mainly related to greater use of chunked information and call outs (key messages in large font that function as calls to action), optimizing navigation (sticky bars, search functions, and drop-down menus), and improving the information on accessing other services and resources to their support care (what services, what they offer, how to access them). These design recommendations were implemented in the final website prototype in preparation for the current (ongoing) phase of finalizing text and audiovisual content in collaboration with young people. This approach to co-design of content will ensure alignment to Australian user needs and preferences  [1, 14] , while also ensuring consistent messaging and self-management domains between the website and the iCanCope with Pain app.\n\nOperationally, the intention for future use of these 2 digital platforms in Australia is to offer complementary digital tools with different functions that can interact bidirectionally (eg, by use of push notifications). Such an approach offers flexibility in supporting both individualized tailored self-management (app), while concurrently providing the capacity for richer audiovisual content and resources specifically codeveloped with and for young Australians (website) and critically, explicitly linked to Australian health services and systems  [2] . On the basis of our impact evaluation of the adult painHEALTH website  [30] , digital platforms can operate as an important health strengthening tool  [49] , linking consumers/caregivers with their clinicians, services, and systems. We have also demonstrated that this approach promotes more holistic integrated pain care models  [17, 30]  and enables consistency of messaging between consumers and their clinicians (eg, sharing of short targeted audiovisual content during clinical consultations about other people's pain experiences, and how they have implemented positive evidence-based behaviors to improve their pain care). The web-based platform will also include contemporary, evidence-based condition-specific musculoskeletal knowledge (eg, about low back pain and juvenile inflammatory arthritis) with links to best practice pain self-management (eg, making sense of pain, pain education, coping skills and behavioral approaches to pain, encouraging movement, activity and exercise with pain (pacing), appropriate use of medicines)  [16, 50] .\n\nAdditional advantages of a web-based platform include the capacity for real-time updating at lower resourcing and cost than app-based technologies, multiple-platform compliance (ie, capacity for use on various devices), easy access, and linking to other entities (eg, consumer, tertiary educational, and health professional bodies). Advantages of the app included empowering young people to take their health in their hands, supported by individual tailoring abilities of the app, informed by check-ins, with self-monitoring and self-reflection supporting helpful habits (behavior change) and complementing clinical care."

      "text": "Outcomes from current, ongoing trials of the effectiveness of the iCanCope with Pain app will help to inform our decision on the most appropriate approach to evaluate the implementation of these digital technologies in Australian pediatric pain care settings. We envisage the use of a contemporary and flexible evaluation approach that moves beyond traditional effectiveness designs to consider alterative hybrid trial designs  [51]  or multidimensional and whole-of-system evaluation approaches, such as a benefits evaluation  [52]  that is best aligned to the Australian digital ecosystem and positions these digital tools for real-world implementation  [51] . The adaptation of user-centered design and implementation science methods from inception (such as done here) can mitigate the risk of low rates of implementation and the associated research waste  [19] . In this context, we gained valuable insights from young people to support and enable implementation, including taking a whole-of-health (systems, services, and clinical-level) approach to facilitate real-world dissemination and embedding. These findings are in accordance with recommendations from our recent systematic review of mHealth technologies for noncommunicable chronic disease management in young adults  [2] .\n\nDigital technologies are positioned to enable the rapid transformation of health care, with their critical role highlighted by the release of the first World Health Organization guideline establishing recommendations on digital interventions for health system strengthening  [53] , and more recently, local recommendations for transforming health in Australia  [54] . The outcomes from this study are, therefore, timely considering the reorientation of health services and system reform toward better integrated management of chronic health conditions  [55] , healthy aging across the life course [56], and the expectations of young people with chronic musculoskeletal pain for access to evidence-based digital tools to support their self-management  [1] . Although we are cautious and thoughtful about the many broader research questions that remain on the evidence for the use of digital technologies in health care innovation (consumer needs and preferences; synergy with current services and systems; capacity to interface with current health systems, services, and workflows; achievement of broader system goals; and stability and sustainability), we suggest that this should not be a reason to accept the current default position in Australia, where many young people with musculoskeletal pain do not have timely access to reliable evidence-based services and resources that promote and support helpful behaviors and improved well-being."
