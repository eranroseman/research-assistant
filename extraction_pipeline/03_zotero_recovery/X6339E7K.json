  "abstract": "Data collection and analysis We used standard Cochrane methods. Our primary outcomes were medication adherence, fatal cardiovascular events, non-fatal cardiovascular events, and combined CVD event. Secondary outcomes were low-density lipoprotein cholesterol for the effect of statins, blood pressure for antihypertensive drugs, heart rate for the effect of beta-blockers, urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane B2 for the antiplatelet effects of aspirin, adverse effects, and patient-reported experience. We used GRADE to assess the certainty of the evidence for each outcome. \n Main results We included 18 RCTs involving a total of 8136 participants with CVDs. We identified 11 new studies in the review update and seven studies in the previous version of the review. Participants had various CVDs including acute coronary syndrome, coronary heart disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, and angina. All studies were conducted in middle-and high-income countries, with no studies conducted in lowincome countries. The mean age of participants was 53 to 64 years. Participants were recruited from hospitals or cardiac rehabilitation facilities. Follow-up ranged from one to 12 months. There was variation in the characteristics of text messages amongst studies (e.g. delivery method, frequency, theoretical grounding, content used, personalisation, and directionality). The content of text messages varied across studies, but generally included medication reminders and healthy lifestyle information such as diet, physical activity, and weight loss. Text messages offered advice, motivation, social support, and health education to promote behaviour changes and regular medication-taking. We assessed risk of bias for all studies as high, as all studies had at least one domain at unclear or high risk of bias. \n Medication adherence Due to different evaluation score systems and inconsistent definitions applied for the measurement of medication adherence, we did not conduct meta-analysis for medication adherence. Ten out of 18 studies showed a beneficial effect of mobile phone text messaging for medication adherence compared to usual care, whereas the other eight studies showed either a reduction or no difference in medication adherence with text messaging compared to usual care. Overall, the evidence is very uncertain about the effects of mobile phone text messaging for medication adherence when compared to usual care. \n Fatal cardiovascular events Text messaging may have little to no effect on fatal cardiovascular events compared to usual care (odds ratio 0.83, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.47 to 1.45; 4 studies, 1654 participants; low-certainty evidence). \n Non-fatal cardiovascular events We found very low-certainty evidence that text messaging may have little to no effect on non-fatal cardiovascular events. Two studies reported non-fatal cardiovascular events, neither of which found evidence of a difference between groups. \n Combined CVD events We found very low-certainty evidence that text messaging may have little to no effect on combined CVD events. Only one study reported combined CVD events, and did not find evidence of a difference between groups.

People with CVDs have a five times greater chance of suffering a recurrent cardiovascular event than people without known CVDs. Although drug interventions have been shown to be cost-effective in reducing the risk of recurrent cardiovascular events, adherence to medication remains suboptimal. As a scalable and cost-effective approach, mobile phone text messaging presents an opportunity to convey health information, deliver electronic reminders, and encourage behaviour change. However, it is uncertain whether text messaging can improve medication adherence and clinical outcomes. This is an update of a Cochrane review published in 2017."

People had various types of heart diseases and were on average 53 to 64 years old. Most people came from hospitals or cardiac rehabilitation facilities. Studies lasted for one to 12 months. The delivery method and frequency of text messages differed amongst studies. Some studies sent text messages customised to patient characteristics and allowed people to reply to the messages. The content of text messages also varied across studies. Generally, text messages included medication reminders and healthy lifestyle information such as diet, physical activity, and weight loss.\n\nThe studies used different ways of measuring and definitions of medication adherence, which prevented us from combining the findings of the studies for this outcome. As a result, the combined effects of text messaging on medication adherence are unknown. Of the 18 included studies, 10 studies showed that text messaging was effective in improving medication adherence. The other eight studies showed either a reduction or no difference in medication adherence compared to those people who did not receive text messages. Given that results on medication adherence differed across studies, we are not sure if text messaging can improve medication adherence.\n\nWe found that text messaging may make little to no difference to fatal cardiovascular events (death from heart disease). In addition, we are very uncertain whether using text messaging can reduce blood pressure, cholesterol, heart rate, non-fatal cardiovascular events (heart complications or stroke), and combined cardiovascular events (death from heart disease, heart complications, or stroke) compared with people who did not receive text messages.

It is estimated that approximately three times as many people will suffer non-fatal cardiovascular events, and that each year 35 million people have an acute coronary or cerebrovascular event. Worldwide, approximately 523 million people are thought to have prevalent CVD (Nieuwlaat 2013; Perel 2015; Roth 2020). This population has a five times greater chance of suffering a new cardiovascular event than people without known CVD (Kerr 2009)."

      "title": "Description of the intervention",
      "text": "Secondary CVD prevention is defined as health care aimed at preventing recurrent cardiovascular events in people diagnosed with CVD (Perel 2015). It is widely recommended by international guidelines that effective secondary prevention strategies for CVD include appropriate treatments with evidencebased medications and comprehensive management of risk factors (Taylor 2023). The use of evidence-based medication, such as antiplatelet therapy, angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors/angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), beta-blockers, and statins, has been shown to be a cost-effective intervention for the prevention of fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events in people with established atherosclerotic cardiovascular diseases (Perel 2015).\n\nUnfortunately, there is a well-documented knowledge-practice gap in the implementation of these proven cost-effective interventions.\n\nFor example, the Prospective Urban Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study reported that in low-and middle-income countries, up to 75% of people with known CVD are not using even one recommended medication (Yusuf 2011). Even in high-income countries, adherence to recommended treatments remains suboptimal. A systematic review showed that amongst people diagnosed with hypertension, 83.7% of people with uncontrolled blood pressure were not adherent to their prescribed antihypertensive medications (Abegaz 2017). Adherence to statin medication was low as well, with approximately 33% to 50% of people discontinuing statin medication within one year (Bosworth 2018).\n\nIt has been shown that a considerable proportion of cardiovascular events could be attributed to poor adherence to medication, with 9% of cardiovascular events in Europe attributed to poor adherence to medication (Chowdhury 2013). It is estimated that good adherence to medication may be associated with a 20% lower risk of CVD and a 35% reduction in all-cause mortality (Chowdhury 2013). This evidence-practice gap might be influenced by different factors, including health system issues such as lack of accessibility and affordability; treatment complexity; or patients' non-compliance with recommendations (Nieuwlaat 2013).In order to influence non-compliance, there is a need to develop behaviour change interventions. However, a Cochrane review showed that traditional behaviour change interventions to improve medication adherence are complex and not very effective, which indicates a need for convenient and feasible innovations to improve patient adherence to medication (Nieuwlaat 2014).\n\nThe widespread ownership of mobile phones and the possibility of automation leads to a potential to deliver behaviour change interventions to large numbers of people at low cost. The global number of mobile phone subscribers is estimated at 8600 million (Statista 2022). Even in low-and middle-income countries, the penetration rate of mobile phones is over 90% (Feroz 2020). As a basic function of the mobile phone, short message services (SMS) are increasingly being used worldwide for communications.\n\nThere has been an emergence of studies investigating if medication adherence could be improved by sending messages as reminders for medication-taking."

      "title": "How the intervention might work",
      "text": "Mobile phone text messaging has been shown to improve medication adherence for a variety of conditions, including HIV, asthma, and mental illness (Dong 2018; Ibeneme 2021; Simon 2022). The development of messages should follow some theoretical framework, and text messages should be developed specifically for the target population and intervention (MacPherson 2021). Text messages as an intervention are relatively cost-effective and quick, and do not require that the intended audience search for information, as it is delivered to them (Willems 2023). Two previous systematic reviews addressed the question of using mobile phones for all types of medication adherence (Anglada-Martinez 2015; Park 2014b). The majority of studies included in the reviews found significant improvement in medication adherence through the use of text messages.\n\nPrevious mixed-methods research has identified three dominant theoretical frameworks as driving behaviour change (including medication adherence) resulting from text messaging programmes for people with CVD. These have been found to include the Information-Motivation-Behavior Skills Theoretical Model  (Fisher 2006) , because participants felt motivated and engaged with the text message programme, it provided advice and skills with solutions and content was considered credible and meaningful (Redfern 2016). Social-Cognitive Theory, Bandura 1989, was also found to influence adherence if social recognition, improved self-efficacy, the provision of achievable task-setting suggestions, practical advice and positive reinforcement were built into the text message programme (Redfern 2016). Furthermore, previous qualitative data suggested that, over time, participants became 'conditioned' towards healthy behaviours irrespective of the specific content of the individual messages received at a certain time, which aligns with operant condition (Redfern 2016); that is, through repeated presentation of a stimulus (in this case cardiovascular health-related text messages), the participants eventually learnt to associate the stimulus with overall cardiovascular health behaviour and consequently messages about diet, also resulting in improved medication adherence and vice versa. In addition, the mechanism of text messaging improving medication adherence could be attributed to the Behaviour Change Techniques proposed by the Capability, Opportunity, Motivation-Behaviour (COM-B) framework, which emphasises that capability, opportunity, and motivation are three essential components of behaviour change (MacPherson 2021; Richardson 2019). Overall, the mechanisms associated with text message programmes are complex and multidimensional and varied between and within individuals; however, repeated reminders and positive reinforcement of healthy behaviours serve to influence attention,"

      "text": "Whilst there is a great deal of enthusiasm for mobile health (mHealth) interventions amongst researchers and policymakers, there is still limited evidence for its effectiveness (Unal 2018).\n\nSystematic reviews have been conducted on adherence to medications and reported promising results (Anglada-Martinez 2015; Ershad 2016; Park 2014b; Thakkar 2016; Zhao 2019). The previous version of this review was conducted to evaluate specifically the effect of mobile phone text messaging on medication adherence for secondary CVD prevention and to try to examine how text messages are created and if SMS are tailored based on individual patient characteristics (Adler 2017). However, the effects of text messaging were inconclusive due to the limited number of included studies and lack of meta-analysis. It remains unclear if text messaging can improve medication adherence and other clinical outcomes (e.g. cardiovascular events, blood pressure, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, and heart rate). Given that research evolves rapidly in this area, and the findings of the previous review could be changed by the new studies recently published, a review update with introduction of the most recent evidence is warranted."

      "title": "Data extraction and management",
      "text": "We used a data collection form to extract study characteristics and outcome data previously piloted on at least one study in the review.\n\nTwo review authors (MH, CZ, QT, or NH) independently extracted study characteristics for each included study. We extracted the following study characteristics. 1. Methods: study design, total duration of study, study setting, withdrawals, and date and country of study. 2. Participants: number, mean age, age range, gender, condition, diagnostic criteria, smoking history, inclusion criteria, and exclusion criteria. 3. Interventions: intervention, comparison, concomitant medications, excluded medications, how text messages were developed, behaviour change technique, any theoretical framework/s used to develop the intervention, time from arterial occlusive event, if SMS was personalised, mode of delivery (frequency and timing of messaging, duration of programme). 4. Outcomes: primary and secondary outcomes specified and collected, method of measurement, and time points reported. 5. Notes: funding for trial, and notable conflicts of interest of trial authors. We resolved any disagreements by consensus or by involving a third person (MH). One review author (QT) transferred data into Review Manager Web (RevMan Web 2022). We double-checked the data entry for accuracy against the data extraction sheets. Assessment of risk of bias in included studies Two of four review authors (MH, CZ, QT, NH) independently assessed the risk of bias for each included study using the RoB 1 tool, as outlined in the Cochrane Handbook for Systematic Reviews of Interventions (Higgins 2011). Any disagreements were resolved by discussion with the other two review authors who were not initially involved in the assessment (MH, CZ, QT, NH). We assessed risk of bias according to the following domains. 1. Random sequence generation. 2. Allocation concealment. 3. Blinding of participants and personnel. 4. Blinding of outcome assessment. 5. Incomplete outcome data. 6. Selective outcome reporting. 7. Other biases.\n\nWe graded each potential source of bias as low, high, or unclear and provided evidence from the study report together with a justification for our judgement in the risk of bias table. We summarised the risk of bias judgements across different studies for each of the domains listed. Where information on risk of bias related to unpublished data or correspondence with a trialist, we noted this in the risk of bias table . Given the nature of the interventions included in this review, it was likely that blinding of participants and personnel would be impossible, as would blinding of self-reported outcome assessment, so we expected trials to be categorised at high risk of bias for both of these domains.\n\nFor the overall study assessment, we categorised a trial as being at low risk of bias if it was rated as low risk in all the domains listed above (with the exception of blinding of participants and personnel/self-reported outcome assessment). We categorised trials that were at high or unclear risk of bias for any risk of bias domain (except blinding of participants and personnel/selfreported outcome assessment) as being at high risk of bias. We assessed trials as at unclear risk of bias when too few details were available to permit a judgement of low or high risk of bias.\n\nWhen considering treatment effects, we took into account the risk of bias for the studies that contributed to that outcome."

We assessed heterogeneity according to the guidance in the Cochrane Handbook (Deeks 2023), using the following thresholds:\n\n1. 0% to 40%: might not be important; 2. 30% to 60%: may represent moderate heterogeneity; 3. 50% to 90%: may represent substantial heterogeneity; or 4. 75% to 100%: considerable heterogeneity.\n\nWe used 40% as a cut-off value for important heterogeneity, which means that we considered an I 2 under 40% as low heterogeneity.\n\nWhen possible, we assessed the potential causes of heterogeneity by sensitivity analyses (Sensitivity analysis)."

We downgraded the certainty of the evidence for each outcome up to a maximum of three levels. We rated the certainty of the evidence for each outcome as high, moderate, low, or very low. Two review authors (NH and QT) independently assessed the certainty of the evidence for each outcome, with any differences of opinion resolved by consulting a third review author (MH).

(Continued) 18 studies included in quantitative synthesis (meta-analysis) and 9 ongoing studies A search for the clinical trial registry numbers of the nine ongoing studies revealed that one study is completed but study results are not published yet (ISRCTN10549665). Included studies Details of the methods, participants, intervention, comparison group and outcome measures for each of the studies included in the review are shown in the Characteristics of included studies tables. We included 18 studies (Bae 2021; Bermon 2021; Chen 2019; Chow 2015; Chow 2022; Dale 2015a; Fang 2016; Huo 2019; Kamal 2015; Khonsari 2015; Maddison 2021; Ni 2022; Pandey 2017; Park 2014a; Passaglia 2021; Quilici 2013; Ross 2021; Zheng 2019). In the original review, Pandey 2014 was included but only an abstract was available. The full paper of the abstract was published in 2017 (Pandey 2017), therefore Pandey 2017 replaced Pandey 2014 in this review update. We attempted to make contact with the authors of two studies to obtain information on non-fatal cardiovascular events (Huo 2019; Zheng 2019), but did not receive a response. Participants The sample size of included studies ranged from 34, in Pandey 2017, to 1424, in Chow 2022. The total number of included participants was 8136, of which 7272 completed follow-up. All 18 studies targeted people with CVD. Different definitions of CVD were used in the included studies. Six studies included participants with acute coronary syndrome (Chow 2022; Khonsari 2015; Maddison 2021; Passaglia 2021; Quilici 2013; Ross 2021), and seven studies included participants with coronary heart disease (Bae 2021; Chow 2015; Dale 2015a; Huo 2019; Ni 2022; Park 2014a; Zheng 2019). Kamal 2015 reported on participants with stroke. Chen 2019 included participants with chronic heart failure. Pandey 2017 included participants with myocardial infarction. Fang 2016 included participants with chronic stable angina. Bermon 2021 included participants with arterial occlusive events, including acute coronary syndrome, stable angina, ischaemic cerebrovascular disease, peripheral arterial disease, and coronary revascularisation. The mean age ranged from 53.6 years, in Fang 2016, to 64 years, in Quilici 2013. The proportion of male participants was higher than 70% in all studies. Only three studies had a proportion of male participants of less than 70%: Pandey 2017 (59% males), Kamal 2015 (67.5% males), and Chen 2019 (56.5% males). Settings Sixteen studies recruited participants from hospitals including large metropolitan hospitals (Dale 2015a; Fang 2016; Maddison 2021), tertiary teaching hospital (Bae 2021; Chow 2015; Chow 2022; Huo 2019; Kamal 2015; Khonsari 2015; Ni 2022; Passaglia 2021; Ross 2021; Zheng 2019), tertiary referral hospital (Bermon 2021; Chen 2019), and non-profit community hospital (Park 2014a). One study took place in a cardiac rehabilitation facility (Pandey 2017). In one study the setting was not reported (Quilici 2013). Seventeen studies reported the country in which they took place: Australia (Chow 2015; Chow 2022), China (Chen 2019; Fang 2016; Huo 2019; Ni 2022; Zheng 2019), Canada (Pandey 2017; Ross 2021), New Zealand (Dale 2015a; Maddison 2021), Brazil (Passaglia 2021), Colombia (Bermon 2021), Korea (Bae 2021), Malaysia (Khonsari 2015), Pakistan (Kamal 2015), and the USA (Park 2014a). Quilici 2013 did not report the country in which the study was conducted, but the author affiliations suggest that it took place in France. Overall, the 18 included studies took place in 11 countries, including six high-income countries (USA, Australia, Korea, Canada, New Zealand, and France), four upper-middle-income countries (China, Malaysia, Brazil, and Colombia), and one lower-middle-income country (Pakistan). None of the included studies were from lowincome countries. Of the 18 included studies, nine were conducted in high-income countries (Bae 2021; Chow 2015; Chow 2022; Dale 2015a; Maddison 2021; Pandey 2017; Park 2014a; Quilici 2013; Ross 2021), eight in upper-middle-income countries (Bermon 2021; Chen 2019; Fang 2016; Huo 2019; Khonsari 2015; Ni 2022; Passaglia 2021; Zheng 2019), and one in a lower-middle-income country (Kamal 2015). Development of SMS All studies used text messaging as a central component of the intervention. The message content was predominantly medication reminders. Thirteen studies reported that the SMS was developed as a reminder to take their medications (Bae 2021; Chen 2019; Chow 2022; Fang 2016; Huo 2019; Kamal 2015; Khonsari 2015; Maddison 2021; Ni 2022; Pandey 2017; Park 2014a; Ross 2021; Zheng 2019). Of the 13 studies, 11 studies also included education or lifestyle modification information (e.g. healthy diet and physical activity) as part of the text messages in addition to the medication reminders. Two studies provided access to a supporting website as an additional intervention component (Bae 2021; Dale 2015a). Details regarding the development of SMS are summarised in Table 1. Four studies specified that the automated computer program from which the messages were sent was developed particularly for this study (Chow 2015; Chow 2022; Pandey 2017; Passaglia 2021). Eleven other studies stated that an automated system was used (Bae 2021; Bermon 2021; Chen 2019; Dale 2015a; Fang 2016; Huo 2019; Kamal 2015; Khonsari 2015; Maddison 2021; Park 2014a; Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews Zheng 2019), which can also be assumed for two remaining studies whilst not explicitly stated (Quilici 2013; Ross 2021). One study used a mobile app to send messages and was not automated (Ni 2022). In Ni 2022, the study co-ordinator sent the medication reminders and educational materials through Message Express (a message saving and delivery app) on an encrypted external device. Seven studies reported on the psychological theory and behaviour change techniques used in the development of their text messages (Chow 2015; Chow 2022; Dale 2015a; Kamal 2015; Khonsari 2015; Maddison 2021; Ross 2021), with Chow 2015 also having an extensive co-design and development process published (Redfern 2014) (Table 1). Four studies only used behaviour change techniques to develop their text messages without stating a psychological theory (Bermon 2021; Huo 2019; Park 2014a; Zheng 2019). The other seven studies did not specify whether the text messages were supported by theoretical framework. Nine studies tailored the text messages to the participants' name (Bae 2021; Chow 2015; Chow 2022; Dale 2015a; Huo 2019; Khonsari 2015; Maddison 2021; Park 2014a; Zheng 2019). Four studies customised messages according to patients' medication profile or appointment schedule (Chow 2022; Kamal 2015; Khonsari 2015; Park 2014a). Six studies delivered semi-personalised text messages based on a consideration of CVD risk factors of participantssmoking status or dietary habits pattern (Bae 2021; Chow 2015; Chow 2022; Maddison 2021; Passaglia 2021; Ross 2021). Two studies stated that the messages were personalised without any further details provided (Ni 2022; Quilici 2013). Two studies did not provide information on whether the messages were tailored (Fang 2016; Pandey 2017). Two studies stated that text messages were not customised according to patient characteristics, and only standardised texts were sent (Bermon 2021; Chen 2019). Four studies stated that bi-directional text messaging was employed, and a response from the participants was required (Chow 2022; Dale 2015a; Kamal 2015; Park 2014a). Nine studies stated that unidirectional text messaging was employed (Bae 2021; Bermon 2021; Chen 2019; Chow 2015; Khonsari 2015; Maddison 2021; Pandey 2017; Passaglia 2021; Ross 2021). Two studies stated that messages were predominately unidirectional, with some messages assessing medication usage and blood pressure/glucose level measurements bidirectional (Huo 2019; Zheng 2019). Three studies did not provide information on whether the messages were bi-directional or unidirectional (Fang 2016; Ni 2022; Quilici 2013). Thirteen studies provided details on the template texts used for the text messages (Chen 2019; Chow 2015; Chow 2022; Dale 2015a; Huo 2019; Khonsari 2015; Maddison 2021; Ni 2022; Pandey 2017; Park 2014a; Passaglia 2021; Ross 2021; Zheng 2019). Ten studies reported that a pilot programme was previously conducted before the formal randomised controlled study (Bermon 2021; Chow 2022; Dale 2015a; Huo 2019; Kamal 2015; Khonsari 2015; Maddison 2021; Ni 2022; Passaglia 2021; Zheng 2019). Ross 2021 and Quilici 2013 were pilot studies only. Fang 2016 did not discuss the method or timing of the SMS in the paper. Interventions The duration of the intervention ranged from one month (Chen 2019; Park 2014a; Quilici 2013) to 12 months (Bermon 2021; Chow 2022; Pandey 2017). Duration of intervention was six months in eight studies (Bae 2021; Chow 2015; Dale 2015a; Fang 2016; Huo 2019; Maddison 2021; Passaglia 2021; Zheng 2019), two months in four studies (Kamal 2015; Khonsari 2015; Ni 2022; Ross 2021), 12 months in three studies (Bermon 2021; Chow 2022; Pandey 2017), and one month in three studies (Chen 2019; Park 2014a; Quilici 2013). The mean duration of intervention was five months. The frequency of text messaging delivery varied from twice daily to once weekly. Twelve studies sent text messages at a fixed frequency, including once daily (Kamal 2015; Khonsari 2015; Maddison 2021; Ni 2022; Pandey 2017; Quilici 2013), once per week (Chen 2019; Passaglia 2021; Zheng 2019), four times per week (Bae 2021; Chow 2015), and six times per week (Huo 2019). The remaining studies sent messages at a variable frequency. Park 2014a sent educational messages three times a week and medication reminders twice a day. Dale 2015a sent daily text messages from week zero to 12 weeks, which were reduced in week 13 to week 24 to five messages a week. Ross 2021 sent daily text messages for 36 days, and then every other day until day 60. Bermon 2021 sent daily text messages in the first four weeks, which was gradually reduced to five messages per week in week 5, three messages per week from week 6 to week 8, and one message from week 8 until week 52. Chow 2022 sent four messages per week for the first six months, which was then decreased to three messages per week over the subsequent six months. One study did not report on message frequency (Fang 2016). The control group included usual care in all 18 studies. However, usual care was not clearly described in nine of the included studies (Chen 2019; Chow 2022; Huo 2019; Pandey 2017; Park 2014a; Passaglia 2021; Quilici 2013; Ross 2021; Zheng 2019). Although the definition of usual care was provided in the remaining nine studies, the definition of usual care varied across studies. Usual care in Bae 2021 included regular follow-up at the outpatient clinic and education on cardiovascular health and risk factors. The usual care group in Bermon 2021 received text messages for reminding of participation in the study. Chow 2015 defined usual care as community follow-up and referral to inpatient cardiac rehabilitation. The usual care group in Fang 2016 received monthly phone calls, and in Kamal 2015 received regular followup visits with neurologist. In Ni 2022, the usual care group received educational materials from WeChat. Usual care in Dale 2015a and Maddison 2021 consisted of an outpatient cardiac rehabilitation programme involving health education and supervised exercise. In Khonsari 2015, usual care referred to cardiac rehabilitation and follow-up appointments with the cardiologists. Outcomes Primary outcomes All included studies measured medication adherence. Five studies measured the overall adherence to several prescribed medications (Bermon 2021; Chow 2022; Khonsari 2015; Maddison 2021; Pandey 2017). Pandey 2017 included participants on a oncedaily regimen of aspirin, a beta-blocker, an angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB), and a statin using self-reported logs. Most participants in Khonsari 2015 were on five or more daily medications, and adherence was measured using the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale. Maddison 2021 measured overall adherence to all three medication classes (aspirin, statin, and blood pressure-lowering medication) and to all four medication classes (aspirin, statin, beta-blocker, and ACEI/ARB) and adherence to each medication Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews class (statin, aspirin, beta-blocker, ACEI/ARB) via self-reported Morisky Medication Adherence Scale. Bermon 2021 measured self-reported adherence to cardiovascular medications used in secondary prevention with the Medication Adherence Report Scale-5 (MARS-5) questionnaire. In contrast to those studies merely using subjective measures, Chow 2022 used a multi-measure approach including a combination of subjective and objective measures of medication adherence to reduce subjectivity. The subjective measures included measurement of overall adherence to five medication classes (aspirin, beta-blocker, ACEI/ARB, statin, second antiplatelet) and adherence to each class separately, by self-reported approach. Objective measures included extraction of prescriptions filled from linked Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) database to validate the self-reported medication adherence (Department of Health and Aged Care 2023), making it distinct from other studies. Three studies only measured adherence to a single medication class. Park 2014a measured adherence to antiplatelet and statin medications separately, using both electronic pill bottles and self-reported adherence. Fang 2016 only looked at adherence to statins by four-item Morisky Medication Adherence Scale. Quilici 2013 measured aspirin adherence using a self-reported adherence approach. Seven studies did not specify which medications the participants were taking and to which medication adherence was measured, but specified that it used self-reported medication adherence (Bae 2021; Chen 2019; Dale 2015a; Kamal 2015; Ni 2022; Passaglia 2021; Ross 2021). Three studies reported prescribed medication, including ACEI/ARB, aspirin, beta-blocker, and statin, and all of these four medications (Chow 2015; Huo 2019; Zheng 2019). Medication adherence was measured via subjective assessment in 15 of the 18 included studies. In the other three studies, medication adherence was measured and validated via objective measures, including medication possession ratio (MPR) (Maddison 2021), medication event monitoring system (Park 2014a), and data linkage with PBS database (Chow 2022). Four studies reported on fatal cardiovascular events (Bermon 2021; Chen 2019; Khonsari 2015; Passaglia 2021). One study reported non-fatal cardiovascular events and combined CVD event (Chow 2022). Secondary outcomes Ten studies provided outcome data for our secondary outcome of blood pressure (Bae 2021; Bermon 2021; Chow 2015; Chow 2022; Dale 2015a; Huo 2019; Kamal 2015; Ni 2022; Passaglia 2021; Zheng 2019), and eight studies reported on LDL cholesterol (Bae 2021; Bermon 2021; Chow 2015; Chow 2022; Dale 2015a; Huo 2019; Passaglia 2021; Zheng 2019). Five studies reported on heart rate (Bermon 2021; Chow 2015; Chow 2022; Ni 2022; Passaglia 2021). Thirteen studies reported patient-reported experience regarding satisfaction, utility, and acceptability of the intervention (Bae 2021; Chow 2015; Chow 2022; Dale 2015a; Huo 2019; Kamal 2015; Khonsari 2015; Maddison 2021; Park 2014a; Passaglia 2021; Quilici 2013; Ross 2021; Zheng 2019). Only one study measured adverse effects by reporting road traffic crashes (Bermon 2021). None of the included studies reported repetitive thumb strain as an adverse effect. Four studies did not report on any of our secondary outcomes (Chen 2019; Fang 2016; Khonsari 2015; Pandey 2017). None of the included studies reported on urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane B2. Funding Eleven studies reported the source of funding (Bae 2021; Bermon 2021; Chow 2015; Chow 2022; Dale 2015a; Huo 2019; Maddison 2021; Ni 2022; Park 2014a; Ross 2021; Zheng 2019). Three studies stated that no specific funding was received (Kamal 2015; Khonsari 2015; Passaglia 2021). Four studies did not report if funding was received (Chen 2019; Fang 2016; Pandey 2017; Quilici 2013). Excluded studies We excluded 12,197 reports based on title and abstract. We excluded a further 18 studies (20 reports) following full-text screening. The reasons for exclusion of each study are presented in the Characteristics of excluded studies table. There were four studies that never set out to measure any outcomes of interest (Foccardi 2021; Moradi 2017; Rohde 2021; Santo 2018), and four studies were non-randomised or single-arm trials (Carrillo 2021; Chen 2018; Legler 2020; Zhao 2019). We excluded four studies because of ineligible intervention (e.g. text messaging was not a central component of a multicomponent intervention) (IRCT20180911041002N; Santo 2017; Wang 2020; Yan 2021). We excluded the remaining six studies because they did not fulfil the inclusion criteria for cardiovascular disease (Acevedo 2023; Akhu-Zaheya 2017; Brar 2018; Cheung 2019; Haramiova 2017; Luong 2021). Ongoing studies We identified nine ongoing studies (ACTRN12621000754842; CTRI/2021/06/034463; CTRI/2021/10/037432; IRCT2014050617596N1; IRCT2016011025937N1; IRCT2016081125937N2; ISRCTN10549665; Park 2017; Redfern 2019). Three were from high-income countries (225 participants, USA, Park 2017; 310 participants, Australia, Redfern 2019; 2500 participants, Australia, ACTRN12621000754842), and six were from lower-middleincome countries (300 participants, India, CTRI/2021/06/034463; 1200 participants, India CTRI/2021/10/037432; 90 participants, Iran, IRCT2014050617596N1; 116 participants, Iran, IRCT2016011025937N1; 116 participants, Iran, IRCT2016081125937N2; 78 participants, Iran, ISRCTN10549665).

We assessed three studies that provided insufficient information as at unclear risk of bias (Khonsari 2015; Pandey 2017; Quilici 2013). No studies were at high risk of bias for random sequence generation. Eight studies reported adequate allocation concealment and were judged to be of low risk of bias for this domain (Bermon 2021; Chow 2015; Chow 2022; Dale 2015a; Kamal 2015; Maddison 2021; Park 2014a; Ross 2021). We assessed nine studies that provided insufficient information as at unclear risk of bias (Bae 2021; Chen 2019; Fang 2016; Huo 2019; Khonsari 2015; Pandey 2017; Passaglia 2021; Quilici 2013; Zheng 2019). We judged Ni 2022 to be at high risk of bias because generation of the random allocation sequence, enrolment of participants, and assignment of participants to intervention were all conducted by the first author. Blinding Whilst blinding of participants is not possible with this intervention, blinding of outcome assessors could have been done. Three studies clearly stated that no blinding of outcome assessors occurred and were therefore deemed as at high risk of bias (Dale 2015a; Khonsari 2015; Ni 2022). Seven studies did not report on this domain and were assessed as at unclear risk of bias (Chen 2019; Fang 2016; Kamal 2015; Maddison 2021; Pandey 2017; Park 2014a; Quilici 2013). Eight studies clearly stated that outcome assessors were not aware of the study group assignment and were therefore rated as at low risk of bias (Bae 2021; Bermon 2021; Chow 2015; Chow 2022; Huo 2019; Passaglia 2021; Ross 2021; Zheng 2019)."

In Bae 2021, intention-to-treat analysis was not performed. Furthermore, 70/439 (15.9%) and 44/440 (10%) participants were lost to follow-up in the control and intervention groups, respectively. In Kamal 2015, a large proportion of participants (20%) were lost to follow-up. In Passaglia 2021, 18.3% of participants were lost to follow-up, and analysis was not conducted based on the intention-to-treat principle. In Ross 2021, there was a significant imbalance between groups for withdrawals or dropouts (5% in the control and 19% in the intervention group). In Ni 2022, 18.4% of the intervention group and 11.2% of the control group did not complete the baseline survey, and analysis was not conducted based on the intention-to-treat principle. Bermon 2021 presented imbalances in numbers and reasons for missing data between the intervention group (15.3%) and the control group (11.5%). Selective reporting For eight studies, we were able to access the trial protocol or registry, and all prespecified outcomes were reported in the results (Bae 2021; Bermon 2021; Chow 2022; Dale 2015a; Kamal 2015; Maddison 2021; Passaglia 2021; Ross 2021). We therefore judged these eight studies to be at low risk of reporting bias. We judged four studies to be at high risk of reporting bias (Chow 2015; Huo 2019; Quilici 2013; Zheng 2019). For Quilici 2013, the data were minimal (published as a letter to the editor), and details within the report differed. In Huo 2019 and Zheng 2019, death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, and rehospitalisation were specified as outcomes of interest in the protocol, but these outcomes were not reported in the findings, representing a deviation from the original stated methodology. In Chow 2015, prespecified outcomes, including psychosocial factors and fruit/vegetable intake, were not reported in the paper. We assessed the remaining six studies as at unclear risk of bias as we did not identify a protocol or trial registration to permit a judgement of reporting bias (Chen 2019; Fang 2016; Khonsari 2015; Ni 2022; Pandey 2017; Park 2014a)."

      "text": "We assessed 14 studies as at low risk of bias for this domain, as there are no differences between groups at baseline, and they appeared to be free In Quilici 2013, the only source of information is a published letter to an editor in which the outcome data for self-reported nonadherence differs between the text and Figure  2 . Ross 2021 was a pilot study and did not determine a sample size based on power calculations, and thus was likely underpowered to detect clinically important differences. In Passaglia 2021, 20 participants (26.6%) in the intervention group did not receive text messaging though their system confirmed that messages were sent. This may have contributed to loss of study power and raises the possibility of a type II error. In Pandey 2017, there were baseline imbalances between groups in gender: 88% male in the control group and 35% male in the intervention group. Self-reported outcomes were widely reported in the included studies, which were susceptible to recall bias. We believe such bias could be balanced across the intervention and control groups, and therefore did not include recall bias as an other potential source of bias in this domain."

Dale 2015a followed up 116 participants for six months and found that participants in the intervention group had a greater medication adherence score (mean difference (MD) 0.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.19, 0.97; P = 0.004) compared to usual care. In particular, this was an MMAS-8 score of 7.3 (standard deviation (SD) 0.9) for the intervention group and 6.8 (SD 1.2) for the control group at six months' follow-up. Fang 2016, had a three-arm design with SMS, SMS + micro letter, or telephone calls (follow-up of six months and 271 participants analysed) and reported that participants given SMS alone had reduced odds of being non-adherent compared to those who received telephone reminders (odds ratio (OR) 0.34, 95% CI 0.18 to 0.63), and that participants given SMS + micro letter had the lowest odds of being non-adherent compared to telephone reminders (OR 0.07, 95% CI 0.03 to 0.15). Kamal 2015 (200 participants, two-month follow-up) reported higher levels of adherence in the intervention arm (adjusted MD 0.54, 95% CI 0.22 to 0.85). Khonsari 2015 (62 participants) reported that \"the risk of being low adherent [(score 3-8 according to Morisky 1986)] among the control group is 4.09 times greater than the intervention group (Relative Risk (RR) 4.09, 95% CI 1.82 to 9.18, p<0.001)\" at eight weeks' follow-up. The same study also reported that the proportion of participants with low adherence at two-month follow-up was 16.1% in the intervention group and 58.1% in the control group. Park 2014a, with the shortest follow-up of 30 days and 28 participants analysed in each group, reported a baseline MMAS-8 score of 6.20 (SD 1.66) for the intervention group and 5.85 (SD 2.10) for the control group. At follow-up, the score had risen for both groups, but was higher for the control group at 6.73 (SD 1.49) than for the intervention group at 6.43 (SD 1.22) (no P value reported). Ni 2022 found that the mean decrease in medication non-adherence score in the intervention group (-1.58, SD 2.49) was greater than in the control group (-0.08, SD 3.15) at 90 days (P < 0.001). Passaglia 2021 reported no difference in the proportion of participants who adhered to the medications between intervention (88%) and control group (93.1%) at six months' follow-up (P = 0.297). Ross 2021 showed no differences in medication adherence scores between intervention and control groups at 60 days (MD -0.3, 95% CI -0.83 to 0.23; P = 0.27). Maddison 2021 found a higher medication adherence score in the control group than in the intervention group (adjusted MD 0.3, 95% CI 0.01 to 0.59; P = 0.04).

      "text": "We identified 18 studies eligible for inclusion in the review, seven from the original review and 11 newly added in the current update. The number of newly added studies shows the rapid growth in this research area and increased evidence of using text messaging in CVD secondary prevention. A total of 8136 participants were included in the analysis. The 18 included studies were conducted in 11 countries, including six high-income countries and five middle-income countries. None of the included studies was from a low-income country. All 18 studies included participants with CVDs. Participants had various CVDs, including acute coronary syndrome, coronary heart disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and angina. Mean duration of the text messaging was five months. There was variation in the characteristics of text messages amongst studies (delivery method, frequency, theoretic grounding, content used, personalisation, directionality). The message content primarily included mixed functionalities, covering medication reminders, and healthy lifestyle information.\n\nWe assessed the overall risk of bias for all studies as high, as all studies had at least one domain at unclear or high risk of bias (Figure  3 ).\n\nThis review provides very low-certainty evidence of the effects of text messaging on medication adherence (Summary of findings 1). All 18 studies included in this review reported on medication adherence.\n\nTen out of 18 studies showed a beneficial effect of mobile phone text messaging for medication adherence (Bae 2021; Chen 2019; Dale 2015a; Fang 2016; Kamal 2015; Khonsari 2015; Ni 2022; Pandey 2017; Park 2014a; Quilici 2013). The other eight studies showed that text messaging resulted in either a reduction or no difference in medication adherence when compared with usual care. Due to the heterogeneity with respect to diverse measurement methods and various definitions, medication adherence was not pooled in a meta-analysis, thus the evidence is uncertain. The certainty of evidence relating to the effect of text messaging on fatal cardiovascular events, LDL cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart rate was low or very low. Pooled analysis found that text messaging may provide little to no benefit for fatal cardiovascular events, LDL cholesterol, SBP, DBP, and heart rate compared to usual care. Sensitivity analyses removing studies with high risk of bias and outliers revealed similar findings that text messaging has little to no effect on LDL cholesterol, SBP, DBP, and heart rate. There was insufficient evidence of text messaging interventions for non-fatal cardiovascular events, combined CVD events, urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane B2, and adverse events due to sparse data available for synthesis. No study measured urinary 11dehydrothromboxane B2. Only two studies measured non-fatal cardiovascular events, and only one study measured combined CVD events and adverse events. Studies reported high levels of acceptability, utility, and satisfaction with the text messaging programme.\n\nOverall, these data suggest that the current evidence for text messaging in the CVD population is of low and very low certainty, and therefore insufficient to guide clinical practice and policy. The results showed little to no evidence of an effect of text messaging on medication adherence, fatal cardiovascular events, non-fatal cardiovascular events, combined CVD events, blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, and heart rate. However, people with CVD tend to have a high level of satisfaction, acceptability, and utility with text messaging. Along with the growth of mobile phone usage globally, future work should also focus on a deep understanding of the enablers and barriers associated with the effectiveness of interventions."

      "title": "Overall completeness and applicability of evidence",
      "text": "The search strategy identified all relevant studies up until August 2023. The 18 included studies varied in terms of their context, intervention characteristics, and the measurement method and definitions of study outcomes, which makes summarising the data difficult and reduces the certainty of the estimates produced. The studies included in our meta-analysis had relatively small sample sizes, short study durations, and were of low quality. Small sample size hindered our ability to generalise our findings to a wide population. Short-term durations prevented evaluation of longterm intervention effectiveness. The low quality of the included studies reduced our confidence in the certainty of evidence.\n\nThe evidence in this review is applicable to a predominantly male population aged between 50 and 65 years.\n\nParticipants had various CVDs, including acute coronary syndrome, coronary heart disease, stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and angina, therefore indicating an appropriate representation of population. Eight studies took place in high-income countries (USA, Australia, Korea, Canada, and New Zealand), and eight took place in uppermiddle-income countries (China, Malaysia, Brazil, and Colombia). Only one study was conducted in a lower-middle-income country Cochrane Library Trusted evidence. Informed decisions. Better health. Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews (Pakistan) (World Bank 2023). It was uncertain where one study was conducted, but it was likely from a high-income country (France). It is therefore unclear whether the results would apply to low-income countries. All studies used text messaging as a central component of the intervention. However, the characteristics of text messaging (e.g. message frequencies, timing, content, degree of personalisation, ability for patients to respond, and degree of automation) varied across the 18 studies. The various characteristics and delivery method of text messages may have influenced how the intervention might work in a CVD population. In addition, details about the specific theoretical framework, directionality, and personalisation of text messages were lacking in some studies. Seven out of 18 studies did not specify if text messages were designed based on a theoretical approach or framework (e.g. behavioural change techniques or psychological theories). We attempted but were unable to classify the content of messages according to behaviour change techniques due to limited description of behaviour change techniques and text message contents in the studies. Future studies should include comprehensive descriptions of the interventions delivered.\n\nMost of the included studies examined medications and diseases singly, which has implications for the generalisability of results, given that most people may have comorbidities or be on multiple medications. It is worth noting that some studies listed medication adherence as a secondary outcome rather than a primary outcome, which suggests that these studies may not be designed around the focus of our review.\n\nAlthough all 18 included studies reported the primary outcome of medication adherence, the variability in outcome measures and measurement tools used limited our ability to conduct meta-analysis. In addition, only a few studies reported data on adverse effects, non-fatal cardiovascular events, and combined cardiovascular events, and no studies reported on urinary 11dehydrothromboxane B2. Insufficient reporting makes it difficult to draw any conclusions for these outcomes.\n\nThe most common comparator for the text messaging intervention was reported as \"usual care\". However, details on usual care were lacking in most of the included studies. In addition, definitions of usual care varied across studies, which were likely to influence the size of the effect estimates.\n\nWe identified nine ongoing studies, ranging from 78 participants, ISRCTN10549665, to 2500 participants, ACTRN12621000754842. Three of these nine studies are being conducted in high-income countries. As these nine studies have not yet reported any results, our findings were limited to those studies that have reported results and could be pooled in meta-analysis.\n\nThere appears to be little or no difference between mobile text messaging and usual care in improving medication adherence for secondary prevention of CVD. There are many potential factors that could contribute to the narrow gap in medication adherence between intervention and control groups. These factors may include low quality of study design, simple intervention design, short duration of intervention delivery, lack of theoretical framework in the development of text messages, small sample size of participants, etc. For example, Ross 2021 only used a simple design of text messaging programme (one-way messages, prespecified order of SMS text messages that was not personalised), and only sent seven text messages that covered medication-related topics. Furthermore, random messages received by participants in the control group may remind them to take their medications and lead to biased results. However, most control groups included in this review did not send text messages to participants, and so the impact of this bias on the results was very minimal."

All studies were at high risk of bias for blinding of participants and personnel (performance bias). Eleven out of 18 studies were at either high or unclear risk of bias for blinding of outcome assessors (detection bias). Only eight studies were at low risk for both allocation concealment and random sequence generation. Hence, we downgraded the certainty of evidence for all outcomes by one level, as the results of the meta-analysis may have been influenced by the low quality of the included studies. Sensitivity analysis removing low-quality studies revealed little to no effect for text messaging on LDL cholesterol, SBP, DBP, and heart rate. However, very few studies of high quality were included in the review. Future studies would benefit from having robust study designs.\n\nWe identified considerable heterogeneity, including methodological heterogeneity due to differences in the criteria for defining outcome measures and measurement method, and clinical heterogeneity related to the characteristics of text messaging. Although all of the included studies used mobile phones to deliver the intervention, we identified substantial differences in the actual content of the SMS. Seven studies lacked information on whether message content was supported by psychological or behaviour change models. The considerable heterogeneity not only has implications for the applicability of the evidence, but also indicates that the quality of reporting for trials evaluating mobile phone interventions is very poor. Additionally, CIs across studies showed minimal overlap. Consequently, we downgraded the certainty of the evidence one level for inconsistency for all outcomes except fatal cardiovascular events, which had low statistical heterogeneity.\n\nWe also downgraded the certainty of the evidence for all outcomes by one level for imprecision because the included studies showed different directions of effect, and CIs crossed the no-effect line and encompassed positive and negative effects. Indirectness was less of an issue in this review update. All included participants had CVDs, indicating an appropriate representation of population. Publication bias could not be assessed reliably for outcomes due to the small number of studies (< 10) that could be included in the meta-analysis."

However, eligible studies published a er the last search date could have been missed. In addition, although we did not exclude non-English articles, non-English articles published in non-English journals might have been missed in this review and could have potentially introduced language bias. We were unable to perform planned subgroup analyses to investigate reasons for heterogeneity due to a lack of details or limited number of studies reporting on the outcome of interest. Study effects may be influenced by the observed heterogeneity. It should be noted that some included studies may not have reported all the data they collected, as study protocols were not available for all studies. As a result, the analysis may be incomplete. Another potential source of bias is that due to variations in approaches used to measure and report outcomes, we were unable to include all reported data in the meta-analysis. Consequently, internal validity of the meta-analysis might be affected. For example, studies reporting on medication adherence reported the data as either proportion of days of medication covered or mean change in medication adherence score, making it difficult to group all studies for a comprehensive synthesis and comparison, and limiting our confidence in conclusions on the efficacy of interventions. Furthermore, medication event monitoring system (MEMS) data have their limitations, as patients may unscrew the MEMS cap without actually ingesting the medication. Finally, the use of available data in data analysis may not reflect the entire evidence base and thus threaten the validity of the results. We found two studies that did not report non-fatal cardiovascular events as per their protocol. We attempted to contact the study authors to obtain the data, but received no response."

      "text": "This review update includes 11 new studies compared with the original review. Our findings of mixed evidence for the effects of text messaging and no reported harms are consistent with the previous review (Adler 2017). It is worth noting that in the previous review, six of seven included studies showed a beneficial effect on improving medication adherence. However, of the 11 new studies included in the review update, only three studies demonstrated a positive effect on medication adherence. The potential reasons contributing to this interesting finding need further exploration, which may be influenced by participant characteristics and intervention delivery format. Compared with the original review, which included small-scale studies, the new studies identified in the review update were applied in more countries and larger populations, indicating a higher level of generalisability of study findings.\n\nLimited systematic reviews have examined the effect of text messaging on medication adherence in people with CVD. Zhao 2019 conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis evaluating the effect of text message reminders on medication adherence in people with coronary heart disease. Their study included only 2 trials with 144 participants for meta-analysis and found that medication adherence in the intervention group was 2.85 times greater than in the control group. Compared with Zhao 2019, our review update expanded participants to CVD and included more studies for a comprehensive analysis. The mixed results observed in the 18 included studies may reflect the challenges involved in improving adherence, which are possibly attributed to multiple intentional (e.g. cost, side effects, availability) and unintentional (e.g. forgetfulness, lack of health literacy) factors (Thorneloe 2018). It might not be easy to address intentional medication adherence solely by text messaging, which may partly explain the inconsistent results of text messaging across studies. How best to design text messaging interventions to address intentional factors to nonadherence to medication is important. Our review found that, of the 10 studies reporting benefits on medication adherence, eight studies incorporated medication reminders as straight message contents, which might be considered as a key element of text messaging in overcoming medication non-adherence (Bae 2021; Chen 2019; Fang 2016; Kamal 2015; Khonsari 2015; Ni 2022; Pandey 2017; Park 2014a). However, there was insufficient power to quantitatively explore heterogeneity due to different content. Another systematic review including nine studies on the use of text messaging interventions for secondary prevention of CVD found that text messaging was effective in improving medication adherence (Unal 2018). However, half of their included studies (four out of nine) included hypertension as the primary condition, which was inconsistent with the inclusion criteria of our review. Our review is comparable to a previous systematic review of mobile phone interventions (e.g. text messaging, mobile apps, or telemonitoring) in the secondary prevention of CVD, which found that text messaging might positively impact the secondary prevention of CVD, but failed to draw any robust conclusions due to high heterogeneity and inability to conduct meta-analysis (Park 2016).\n\nWhilst there is not a great deal of evidence on mobile text messaging for adherence in secondary prevention, it can be useful to look into research into what has been successful in tackling other chronic conditions. Ershad 2016 conducted a systematic review to examine the effectiveness of mobile phone text messaging in improving medication adherence for people with chronic diseases. They included 34 studies, including 22 RCTs, one quasiexperimental, two prospective, two observational, and four cohort studies. Although meta-analysis was not conducted due to the high heterogeneity in the types of included studies, they found that in 85% of included studies, text messaging improved medication adherence in people with chronic diseases. One review on mobile text messaging for medication adherence in all chronic diseases found that mobile text messaging nearly doubled the odds of medication adherence (Thakkar 2016). However, the issue of heterogeneity still existed, as substantial statistical heterogeneity (I 2 = 62%) across the included studies was identified. Furthermore, the included RCTs had a short intervention duration (12 weeks), and whether the adherence improvement could translate into the benefits in clinical outcomes was not assessed. In contrast to the positive findings of medication adherence found in these two reviews, our review update did not demonstrate consistent results. It is uncertain whether text messaging is more effective in improving medication adherence for other chronic conditions when compared with people with CVD."

The remaining eight studies showed that text messaging resulted in either a reduction or no difference in medication adherence when compared with usual care. Due to the heterogeneous nature of study outcomes, we could not conduct meta-analysis for medication adherence. Consequently, there is insufficient evidence to determine the effects of text messaging on medication adherence for people with CVD.\n\nDue to limited evidence, we are uncertain if text messaging reduces fatal and non-fatal cardiovascular events, and combined cardiovascular events in people with CVD when compared to usual care. Furthermore, there may be little to no impact of text messaging on low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, blood pressure, and heart rate for people with CVD. The findings of this review therefore cannot provide important implications for practices, and further evaluation is warranted."

      "text": "The results of the review update should be interpreted with caution, as pooling of the results may be influenced by methodological and clinical heterogeneity. More large-scale, theory-based randomised trials that are adequately powered and of high quality are therefore needed to provide more precise estimates of the effect of interventions. Future studies should synthesise data from highquality studies in order to provide stronger evidence.\n\nGiven that the effectiveness of text messaging may be strongly influenced by the context in which it is applied, the need to perform process evaluation and qualitative studies to enhance contextual understanding of randomised controlled trial findings and identify the individual and organisational-level factors affecting the implementation, adoption, and effectiveness of interventions is highlighted. There is a lack of evidence from low-income countries, as all of the included studies were conducted in middle-and high-income countries. More research should be conducted in low-income countries to bridge the knowledge gap and to assess whether text messaging is beneficial in that setting. No studies included in our review update investigated the long-term effects (> 12 months) of text messaging. Given that in most cases lifelong adherence to medications is required, a long-term sustainability (> 12 months) of text messaging should be explored in future studies. The findings of high utility, feasibility, and satisfaction for the delivery of text messaging are encouraging for future studies of mobile text messaging to support secondary prevention goals.\n\nWe were unable to perform subgroup analysis (e.g. directionality of text messaging, personalisation, intervention modality) in this updated review due to insufficient data. Whilst there has been growing research in this area, there are still a lot of unsolved questions. This review identified that large variability exists with regard to the content of text messages. It suggests that future reviews should carry out content analysis of text messages to ascertain the optimal content of text messages. In addition, seven out of 18 studies did not specify if text messages were designed based on a theoretical approach or framework (e.g. behavioural change techniques or psychological theories). Consequently, there is a need for improvement in intervention design through incorporation of theory-based tailoring strategies to address medication non-adherence. Furthermore, future reviews need to explore the optimal frequency and timing of intervention delivery and use process evaluations to assess the mechanisms by which messages have an effect. In future studies, the form of text messaging might be changed into graphics, video, or audio that is delivered via multimedia messaging services. Future studies should therefore provide sufficient detailed description of the intervention to allow identification of the effective intervention components and to enable rigorous evaluations to be performed. In the future development of text messaging interventions, a wide range of factors influencing adherence that may be amenable to change needs to be fully considered. In addition, cost-effectiveness of text messaging was seldom evaluated amongst the included studies; in future studies, cost efficiency should be considered.\n\nWe found that substantial variability exists with regard to the definition of medication adherence and methods of adherence assessment across studies, making it difficult to group studies for comprehensive comparison. The vast majority of the studies evaluating medication adherence were reliant on participants' selfreport and subjective measurement, which are subject to recall bias and social desirability bias. It is therefore of particular importance that standardised and objective approaches to quantify medication adherence (e.g. development of free and validated scores, pill counts or prescription refill rates) are used to improve comparability of outcome measures across studies for a more reliable and rigorous assessment of the effectiveness of text messaging for CVD. Although there is a lack of high-quality evidence of supporting the intervention effects in this review update, the high number of ongoing studies indicate that the evidence will continue to evolve over time. Consequently, we recommend that review updates be performed regularly to provide nuanced insight and exert new evidence to guide policy and research."

In constructing the content of the text messages, the study authors focused on the most common reasons for medication nonadherence based on the WHO model that were unintentional on the patient's part (forgetfulness and carelessness with medication usage), and included a therapy-related dimension (misunderstanding of treatment instructions: meds name, dosage and timing) (Gadkari 2012). According to the study methods, participants were recruited during an admission for ACS prior to discharge from the cardiology ward. This means that all participants were primarily diagnosed with ACS without any experience of taking The WHO multidimensional adherence model that guided this study included many different aspects to describe medication non-adherence behaviour, including psychological factors (WHO 2003). It is emphasised that no single determinant is responsible for non-adherence to treatment because the adherence phenomenon is multidimension-Development of the automated SMS reminder system in this study was useful for deploying spaced repetition strategies via text messaging. Basically, spaced repetition strategy posits that instruction which is repeated at intervals has a great impact on improving a behaviour (Ebbinghaus 1885).

      "text": "In order to appropriately reflect the findings of the review, we revised the title to 'Mobile phone text messaging for medication adherence in secondary prevention of cardiovascular disease'.\n\nIn the Methods section, we removed the inclusion of cluster-RCTs because the aim was to focus on interventions aimed at individuals. We also excluded quasi-RCTs, as they do not use full randomisation and limit the study's ability to conclude a causal association between an intervention and an outcome.\n\nIn the protocol (Adler 2015), the comparators were no treatment and other modes of communication. We changed the comparator to usual care to align with the reporting of the included studies.\n\nWe changed the inclusion criteria of participants. In the protocol, an eligible study must have had at least 50% of participants with established CVD. In order to reduce heterogeneity in the study populations, we removed the cut-off value of 50%. We excluded mixeddisease populations (e.g. participants with either CVD or other diseases).\n\nFor the primary outcome, we changed \"adherence to treatment\" to \"adherence to medication\" in order to accurately reflect the study aim.\n\nWe also added patient-reported experience of using text messaging as a further secondary outcome. Reporting patient experience of using text messaging could contribute to a deep understanding of text messaging in terms of utility, acceptability, and satisfaction.\n\nIn order to consider all relevant literature and to reduce publication bias, we added three databases (CINAHL Complete, Scopus Elsevier, and ProQuest Central) to our literature search.\n\nDue to the considerable heterogeneity in the reporting method of continuous outcomes measured by scales, we were not able to combine these data, therefore we did not compute standardised mean difference for continuous outcomes measured on different scales.\n\nGiven that we excluded cluster-RCTs from the current review update, we did not need to use our preplanned methods to either perform an appropriate analysis that accounts for the cluster design or calculate correct estimates using the intracluster correlation coefficient.\n\nIn future updates of this review, should we find studies with multiple intervention groups and a meta-analysis is possible, we will combine all relevant experimental intervention groups of the study into a single group, and combine all relevant control intervention groups into a single control group, to make pairwise comparisons.\n\nTo align with the latest version of the Cochrane Handbook, we modified the cut-off value of important heterogeneity from 50% to 40% (Deeks 2023). In the current review, we used 40% as a cut-off value for important heterogeneity, with an I 2 < 40% considered as low heterogeneity. This differed from the protocol, which specified a cut-off value of 50%. In addition to the assessment of statistical heterogeneity, we added assessment methods for clinical heterogeneity and methodological heterogeneity. Addition of assessment methods for clinical and methodological heterogeneity contributed to a comprehensive assessment of variability amongst studies and provided insights into the suitability of performing a meta-analysis.\n\nWe planned to assess for potential publication bias using funnel plots and Egger's test (Page 2023). However, an insufficient number of studies (< 10) within the analysed outcomes precluded this assessment.\n\nWe planned to conduct a meta-analysis if studies did not show sufficient heterogeneity in the types of intervention, its delivery, and study design. However, due to large variations in the way medication adherence was defined and measured, we did not conduct a metaanalysis for medication adherence. Furthermore, we aimed to conduct a meta-analysis for non-fatal cardiovascular events, combined cardiovascular events, and urinary 11-dehydrothromboxane B2, but were unable to do so because of a lack of reported data in the studies.\n\nWe planned to carry out the following subgroup analyses, which were precluded due to insufficient data.\n\n1. Baseline CVD condition (i.e. coronary artery disease, cerebrovascular artery disease, peripheral artery disease, and atherosclerotic aortic disease). 2. Age (not older people versus older people, i.e. 64 or more years old)."
