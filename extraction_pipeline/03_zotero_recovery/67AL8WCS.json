  "abstract": "Aims: To evaluate the immediate effect of text messages promoting healthy lifestyle and supporting parenting on physical activity amongst women with recent gestational diabetes (GDM). Methods: Analysis of data from a pilot randomised controlled trial of a healthy lifestyle program for women with recent GDM. Intervention subjects received text messages providing motivation, reminders, information and feedback as well as an activity monitor. This sub-study examined step count in the 4 h after receipt of a text message, compared to the same time of day on other days among intervention subjects. Results: Data from 7326 days where step counts were recorded, from 31 women were analysed. The median steps in the 4 h following a text message was 1237 (IQR 18-2240) and it was 1063 (IQR 0-2038) over the same time period on comparison days where there was no message (p < 0.001). The effect was similar whether the messages pertained to physical activity or not. There was no attenuation of the response over 36-38 weeks. Conclusions: Women with recent GDM increase their step count in the hours following positive and supportive text messages. This suggests that text messaging programs can facilitate healthy lifestyle and diabetes prevention in this population.",

      "title": "Introduction",
      "text": "Gestational diabetes (GDM) is common, affecting up to 30% of pregnant women, depending on the population and criteria used  [1, 2] . Although glucose tolerance usually returns to normal post-partum, the long-term risk of developing diabetes is around 50%, and women who have GDM are 6-10 times more likely to do so than women who did not have GDM in pregnancy  [3, 4] .\n\nIt has been demonstrated in the Diabetes Prevention Program, that with intensive lifestyle intervention focusing on diet, physical activity and weight, diabetes can be prevented among people with impaired glucose, including women who have had GDM in the past  [5] . There have also been trials involving women immediately after GDM pregnancy. These have generally applied DPP style lifestyle modification programs with life coaches, dietitians and exercise trainers  [6, 7] . Such intensive structured lifestyle post-partum interventions however are not practical for many women at this busy time of their lives, and widespread implementation is challenging for health systems.\n\nEarlier studies utilising technology to encourage increased physical activity after GDM have used pedometers and web-based support as part of their program  [8] [9] [10] . There is now much interest in applying newer technologies such as programmed text messaging and activity monitors in health care, either to facilitate management of specific conditions, or to encourage healthier lifestyles. These digital technologies offer the opportunity to deliver healthy lifestyle interventions at the population level and are an alternative to intensive face-to-face programs. They are potentially very suitable for the younger population of women with GDM who are generally familiar with this technology.\n\nText messaging has been used to support the care of patients with conditions such as heart disease and diabetes  [11] [12] [13] . It has also been utilised to modify behaviours such as smoking, physical activity, weight management and medication adherence  [14] [15] [16] [17] . Text messages can be programmatically personalised, customised, and delivered cheaply to large numbers of subjects  [11] .\n\nRecently there has been rapid advancement and uptake of wearable technologies. At the most basic level, these offer a convenient method of quantifying physical activity in terms of steps taken, but they also offer feedback and motivation and therefore could be an enabler of increased physical activity. A systematic review of 17 studies applying wearable activity monitor interventions, including pedometers, found that when these are offered as passive interventions, where the user did not also receive any other support, they were not effective in promoting behaviour change  [18] . It is when wearable activity monitors were paired with behavioural change techniques (such as counseling, goal setting, motivational phone calls, text messaging or incentives), that studies have demonstrated improvements in physical activity or weight management  [19] .\n\nWe have recently investigated the combined use of text messaging and smart phone linked wearable technology, as part of a program to reduce diabetes risk after GDM  [20] . Smart Mums with Smart Phones was a pilot randomised controlled trial which recruited 60 women with GDM with the aim of promoting healthy diet, physical activity and weight management in the 9 months post-partum. Intervention subjects received an activity monitor and lifestyle text messages, beginning shortly after delivery, and continuing for 8-9 months post-partum. Every week, the subjects received 4 text messages providing motivation, reminders, information and feedback, to encourage a healthier lifestyle. One of these messages gave the subject a weekly step target, calculated from data recorded on their activity monitor, using an adaptive step algorithm. As the control subjects were not given activity monitors, the physical activity outcome was assessed by a questionnaire and one week blinded wearing of a pedometer. There was a trend towards a greater weekly pedometer step count the intervention subjects, and increased weekly activity time but this was not significant. It therefore remains unclear if text messaging has an effect on physical activity in this population.\n\nTo inform the further design of the Smart Mums program, we undertook a sub-study to examine whether the receipt of a text message, and more specifically a text message related to physical activity, results in an immediate response with increased physical activity, as determined by data from the activity monitor. This information builds knowledge about the efficacy of text messages as a tool to prompt adoption of PA in this population, by examining the magnitude of changes in PA behaviour following receipt of the messages, and whether this is related to the theme of the message."

      "text": "Ethics approval for the Smart Mums with Smart Phones Study was obtained from the Western Sydney Local Health District Research Ethics Committee. The trial was registered with the Australian New Zealand Clinical Trials Registry ACTRN12616000067471 and conducted in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki. All participants gave signed informed consent.\n\nThe design and overall results of the study have previously been described. In brief, 60 women with GDM were recruited whilst pregnant, and randomised 2:1 to receive the post-partum text messaging intervention or usual care. Women recruited into the study needed to have sufficient English language skills to read text messages. The 40 women randomised to the intervention received a Fitbit Flex\u00ae activity monitor to assist self-monitoring of physical activity, and for customisation of their weekly step target based on an adaptive step algorithm. From weeks post-partum, the subjects received 4 text messages a week, with one message related to each of the following: Monday -encouraging achievement of a weekly adaptive step target based on data from the Fitbit activity monitor; Tuesday -physical activity; Thursday -general health and motherhood information and education; Saturday -healthy nutrition. The text messages continued for 26 weeks after the postpartum counseling session at 10-12 weeks with each participant receiving messages until 36-38 weeks post-partum. Some messages to week 10 were sent in a predetermined sequence as these related more to issues of immediate concern (eg breastfeeding) following having a baby. The adaptive step target messages and a number of later administrative messages were also sent in a predetermined sequence. The remainder of the messages were sent in a random order. The messages were also sent at a random time of the day, between 0900 and 1600 h. During the course of the program, each woman was sent approximately messages.\n\nThe text messages were developed through an established iterative process  [21] . Some were adopted from an earlier text messaging trial we conducted to improve cardiovascular risk factors among people with coronary artery disease  [11] . Additional messages, appropriate for this population of young mothers and in accordance with local or national guidelines, were developed by a team which included experts in diabetes, nutrition, physical activity, health promotion, and lactation. A working group initially developed the text messages, then these were reviewed for readability and to ensure messages were presented with a positive focus. The text messages then underwent testing with feedback and further modification. Examples of final text messages include: \"Walk 10 mins to go to the shops. Every bit of activity counts!\"; \"Strawberries are low carbohydrate and low calorie. Did you know that one punnet has less calories and carbohydrates than a slice of bread?\"; \"It is OK for breastfeeeding mums to perform exercise like walking and cycling\"; \"Try cutting up some fruit into plain low fat yoghurt, it makes a great filling snack\" All the text messages concluded with the sign off \"@smartmums\" so that the women knew that it originated from the program.\n\nIn addition, intervention subjects received two 30 min diet counselling sessionsa face-to-face session in clinic at initial recruitment to the program when pregnant (over and above standard GDM care) and a repeat session by phone at 10-12 weeks post-partum. These sessions were delivered by a dietitian and focused on the adoption phase of behaviour change, promoting Australian dietary guidelines after pregnancy, and building physical activity into one's daily routine, with the aim of achieving 10,000 steps a day. Control subjects only received standard paper guidelines regarding healthy lifestyle after GDM, with no lifestyle text messages or activity monitor.\n\nThe Fitbit Flex\u00ae activity monitor captures step data on a minutely basis. When charged, worn and synchronised appropriately, then a minute by minute record of step activity can be collected, for the duration of the study. This data was routinely captured as part of the study and stored in our activity monitor dataset. For the first 10 weeks post-partum, the daily step target was set at 3500. Based on evidence that adaptive steps targets are effective in increasing physical activity  [22] , from week 10, new step targets were set weekly based on a rank order percentile algorithm, using the step counts from the previous weeks  [20] . The aim of the adaptive step algorithm was to gradually increase weekly step targets based on steps taken during the previous week  [22] .\n\nFor the current substudy, we analysed the number of steps taken by each woman in the 4 h after each text message that was sent. This data was extracted from the activity monitor dataset. To determine if the text messages increased step count beyond the steps that would usually be taken, the number of steps taken in the 4 h after a text message were compared to the number of steps on at the same times on other days within a one week timeframe (Fig.  1 ). The number of steps taken in the same 4 h of the day, on other days of the week were also extracted.\n\nTherefore for each message, we obtained the step count in the ensuing 4 h, and the step count in the same 4 h on the day prior, and on each of the subsequent 5 days.\n\nPaired days where there was no data for either day in the hours of interest were excluded from analysis. The Monday activity monitor and the Tuesday physical activity messages were collectively considered specifically as physical activity messages, whilst the Thursday general and Saturday nutrition messages were non-physical activity messages. We excluded women who did not record any Fitbit data, or where data was only available on fewer than 1% of the days they were in the study.\n\nThe time frame of the study was divided into 60-day periods, from the time of commencement of the messages to examine sustainability of the effect of text messages on step count. Period 1 was the first 60 days, Period 2 was the next 60 days, Period 3 was the 3rd group of 60 days, and Period 4 was from day 180 to the end of the messages. Again the number of steps taken in the 4 h after a text message were compared to the number of steps on at the same times on other days, and this was examined by Period."

      "text": "There were 31 women with sufficient data for analysis. Their mean age was 34 \u00b1 4 years and they had a self-reported pre-pregnancy body mass index of 29.0 \u00b1 8.2. Five women were born in Australia, 15 in South Asia, 6 in East or South East Asia, 3 in the Middle East, one in the Pacific Islands, and one in Africa. There were 7326 days with data, with the median number of days with data for individual women being 142 . The median number of steps recorded per day increased from 4118 (IQR 2521-5981) in Period 1 to 5640 (IQR 3647-7824) in Period 2, 6244 (IQR 3958-8570) in Period 3 and 6819 (IQR 4117-8356) in Period 4.\n\nUpon comparison of the number of steps taken in the 4 h after a text message against the same 4 h time period on other days, the steps were consistently higher on the day of the text message (Fig.  2 ). Overall, the median steps in the 4 h following a text message was 1237 (IQR 18-2240) and it was 1063 (IQR 0-2038) in the 4 h on the comparison days where there was no message (p < 0.001).\n\nBoth messages related to physical activity and those unrelated to physical activity resulted in an increase in step count in the subsequent 4 h compared to the same hours on comparator days. This was significant for all comparisons except for that of non-physical activity related messages compared to the steps taken in the same hours 5 days later (Fig.  3 ). The effect of physical activity and non-physical activity related messages on step count in the subsequent 4 h compared to the same hours on comparator days was similar.\n\nThe sustainability of the effect of text messages on step count in the 4 h after the message was examined over the duration of the study. Compared to step counts in the same 4 h on other days, there was no attenuation in the effect through the different Periods (Fig.  4 ). In fact, the effect was weakest in the first 60 day period, with there being no difference in 4 h step count between message days and comparator days."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "Our study has examined data from a randomised controlled trial testing the effectiveness of a program promoting healthy lifestyle after GDM, through text messaging supplemented with activity monitors. We have made the novel observation that customised and personalised text messages which provide motivation, feedback, information and reminders, have an immediate effect on step count.\n\nSeveral recent studies have examined the effect of text messaging on daily step count in conjunction with real time data from activity monitors. One study, conducted among patients in an ambulatory cardiology centre, found that 3 daily text messages encouraging attainment of a step target and supporting cardiovascular knowledge increased daily step count by 2500 over a period of 2 weeks, compared to patients who did not receive text messages  [23] . A study using a similar protocol, among patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, found that the intervention increased step count by about 1400 steps a day, over 12 weeks compared to subjects who did not receive text messages  [24] . A study conducted among university students, linked phone pedometer data with motivational and feedback messages. This study found that the messages increased daily step count by 729 steps, with the motivational messages being more effective, but the effect diminished over time  [25] . However there are also studies which have failed to show an increase in physical activity with a program of pedometer linked text messaging  [26] .\n\nThe above studies have focused on daily step counts, there are no previous studies which have examined the immediate effect of a physical activity or healthy lifestyle text message on step count. There is therefore a gap in the understanding of the temporal effect of text messages, in terms of a direct relationship, and the magnitude and durability of behaviour change that these elicit. In our Smart Mums with Smart Phones pilot study, we utilised activity monitor data to set weekly step targets conveyed by text messaging, and also sent 3 other text messages encouraging healthy lifestyle, including physical activity. In this randomised controlled trial, we did not see a significant difference in daily step count in the final week of the study, as measured by blinded pedometer, or in physical activity as measured by questionnaire among intervention subjects, compared to control subjects. As the control subjects did not wear activity monitors, we are unable to assess the effectiveness of the text messages on activity monitor recorded steps as part of the randomised controlled trial. However, as we have demonstrated for an individual, the text messages elicited an immediate physical activity response. This suggests that an activity monitor based text messaging program may be effective in increasing physical activity amongst women who have recently had GDM.\n\nIn our study, the effect of increasing step count was not limited to the physical activity related messages. This suggests that the message content is less important than the effect of the text as a cue or reminder. It is possible that activity monitor related feedback messages (or some other aspect of the intervention) supraliminally primed the subject to respond to other text messages from the program with increased physical activity, serving as a situated conceptualisation  [27] . Once this situated  conceptualisation has been activated, the text messages, whether related to physical activity or not, were motivational cues to start walking  [28] . This is analogous to situational prompts which have previously been demonstrated to increase stair use  [29] . In this regard, having positive healthy lifestyle messages, as utilised in our study, have been shown to be much more effective than negative cues  [28] .\n\nOne study has demonstrated that personalised text messages encouraging physical activity increased the duration and rate of walking over time  [30] . However another has shown that the effect of text messaging on step count was attenuated over time  [25] . In our study, the immediate effect of the messages on step count was sustained over the 36-38 weeks of the intervention program. In fact, the effect of the messages on step count was less in the first 60 days of the intervention. One potential reason for this is that this is the period immediate postpartum, where the demands on the mother may have been the greatest and most stressful, with physical activity being of a lower priority.\n\nThere are some limitations to our substudy. There were many days where there was incomplete or absent activity monitor data. It is possible that women who are responsive to the text messages were more likely to utilise their activity monitors regularly. It is also possible that the receipt of a text message may prompt the woman to wear her activity monitor, so that more steps are then recorded after the message. If this is the case, it is still a beneficial effect. We do not have the means to determine if the text messages were actually read. However in our poststudy survey 23/25 subjects who responded found the texts useful  [20] , suggesting that at least a sizeable proportion of the messages were read. The physical activity messages were sent on fixed days, and we cannot exclude the possibility that these might be days that the women would have been more active independent of the messages, though this seems unlikely. We had also compared the day of messaging against weekends, and the effect was present irrespective of the comparator day. We are currently conducting a similar study with a planned recruitment of 180 women  [31] . The larger sample size will facilitate validation of the findings of the current study.\n\nIn summary, we have found that positive text messages promoting physical activity and healthy diet, and which provide supportive messages for the mother, elicit an immediate increase in physical activity over the ensuing 4 h. The effect was not limited to messages related to physical activity, and was sustained over a period of 6 months. The combined use of text messages and activity monitors may be an effective mechanism to increase physical activity in a post-gestational diabetes healthy lifestyle program. There are no similar data for other at risk populations, but we are optimistic that text messages would have similar immediate effects on other groups, particularly if there are not the demands of new motherhood, and this warrants exploration."
