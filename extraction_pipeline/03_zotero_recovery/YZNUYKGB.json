  "title": "Are SMART goals fit-for-purpose? Goal planning with mental health service-users in Australian community pharmacies",
  "abstract": "Goal planning is an important element in brief health interventions provided in primary healthcare settings, with specific, measurable, achievable, realistic/relevant, and timed (SMART) goals recommended as best practice. This study examined the use of SMART goals by Australian community pharmacists providing a brief goal-oriented wellbeing intervention with service-users experiencing severe and persistent mental illnesses (SPMIs), in particular, which aspects of SMART goal planning were incorporated into the documented goals. Goal data from the PharMIbridge Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) were used to investigate how community pharmacists operationalized SMART goals, goal quality, and which SMART goal planning format aspects were most utilized. Goals were evaluated using the SMART Goal Evaluation Method (SMART-GEM) tool to determine how closely each documented goal met the SMART criteria. Goals were also categorized into five domains describing their content or purpose. Descriptive analysis was used to describe the SMART-GEM evaluation results, and the Kruskal-Wallis H test was used to compare the evaluation results across the goal domains. All goals (n = 512) co-designed with service-users (n = 156) were classified as poor quality when assessed against the SMART guidelines for goal statements, although most goals contained information regarding a specific behaviour and/or action (71.3% and 86.3%, respectively). Less than 25% of goals identified how goal achievement would be measured, with those related to lifestyle and wellbeing behaviours most likely to include measurement information. Additionally, the majority (93.5%) of goals lacked details regarding monitoring goal progress. Study findings raise questions regarding the applicability of the SMART goal format in brief health interventions provided in primary healthcare settings, particularly for service-users experiencing SPMIs. Further research is recommended to identify which elements of SMART goals are most relevant for brief interventions. Additionally, further investigation is needed regarding the impact of SMART goal training or support tools on goal quality.",

      "text": "Goal planning is regularly used to support service-users in changing their health-related behaviours  [1] . Goal planning is a process whereby a health practitioner and service-user identify and agree upon a behavioural target that is worked towards over a specified period  [2] . Goal planning improves autonomy and outcomes for service-users, directs the focus of assessments and interventions, and allows for evaluating outcomes and the documentation of service delivery  [3] . Specific, meaningful, and challenging goal statements have been found to enhance performance and outcomes in various healthcare settings  [4] . There is currently limited research on the best way to plan health goals, with few standardized processes for developing, recording, and evaluating goals  [5] .\n\nThe SMART model of goal planning recommends that practitioners consider several aspects of goals that promote positive outcomes  [6] , commonly that goals are 'specific', 'measurable', 'achievable/attainable', 'realistic/relevant', and 'timed' (SMART)  [5] . The SMART method of goal planning was initially developed within organizational psychology to improve workers' productivity  [7] . Since then, SMART goals have been adopted in various fields, including sports, education, rehabilitation, and healthcare  [4] . SMART goal formulations are recommended with specific goals providing guidance on actions needed to support achievement; measurable goals allowing the tracking of progress; achievability notes a service-user's resources and barriers; relevance considers service-user's preferences; and time-bound provides a clear target date for initiation and achievement of the goal  [8] .\n\nWhilst the potential benefits of person-centred goal planning are recognized, research has identified that appropriate healthcare goal planning can be challenging and timeconsuming, with goals often lacking specificity  [9] . For example, allied health practitioners have experienced difficulty articulating service-user goals as specific and measurable statements  [10] , while service-users have reported not understanding the process or applicability of goal planning processes in healthcare settings  [11] . This has resulted in calls for the use of formal goal planning procedures and guidance  [12] .\n\nMuch of the goal planning literature has focused on specific population groups, such as those with a traumatic brain injury or long-term health conditions  [4] , with less known about how planning can support brief health behaviour interventions  [13] . Brief health interventions include time-limited, person-centred strategies that use motivational health promotion to target lifestyle habits and behaviour change  [14] . As primary healthcare providers, community pharmacists are well-placed to provide brief health interventions during their encounters with regular service-users. This is particularly important for service users experiencing severe and persistent mental illnesses (SPMIs), given the illnesses' social, occupational, and personal impacts and the increased likelihood of co-occurring physical health conditions in this population  [15] . Goal planning, as a component of brief health interventions, is increasingly being incorporated in community pharmacist-led services supporting service-users experiencing long-term conditions  [16] . However, little is known about what aspects of goal planning are most important in supporting health behaviour changes  [13] .\n\nTherefore, this study sought to investigate how community pharmacists operationalized SMART goals during a brief wellbeing intervention with service-users experiencing SPMIs, particularly the quality of the documented goals, aspects of SMART goal method utilized, and which elements were included less often."

      "text": "Data were drawn from the PharMIbridge Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT), in which pharmacies were assigned to the intervention group (IG) or the comparison group (CG) (standard in-pharmacy medication review service). IG pharmacists provided a 6-month, person-centred, flexible, community pharmacy-based intervention with service-users experiencing SPMIs  [17] . The intervention was designed to review and address service-users' health concerns, particularly those related to physical health and medicine-related problems, and provide a brief goal planning intervention as part of a broader multicomponent intervention  [17] . The RCT was undertaken between 2020 and 2021, recruiting IG pharmacies (n = 25) in rural, regional, and urban areas across four regions of Australia. Pharmacy staff recruited service-users aged 16 years or over who had been using antipsychotic and/or mood stabilizer medicine(s) for SPMIs regularly for the 6 months before recruitment, who had unmet physical health concerns, and/or were at risk of or already experiencing medicine-related problems. Ethical clearance was obtained from the Griffith University Human Research Ethics Committee (HREC/2019/473).\n\nIntervention pharmacists received training comprising the Blended-Mental Health First Aid (B-MHFA) for the pharmacy course  [18] , including online self-paced modules and a half-day face-to-face session with a licensed instructor, followed by a one-and-a-half-day workshop that provided opportunities to participate in and observe simulated patient role-plays and engage in debrief discussions with people with lived experience, as well as, training on the mind-body interface; complex psychotropic medicine use; managing physical health concerns; communication, motivational interviewing, and goal planning  [19] . During the training, there was a focus on understanding the lived experience of mental illness, exploring strategies to promote behavioural change and improve physical health, and a collaborative strengthsbased approach to goal planning. Training materials were co-delivered by a pharmacist and a person with lived experience of mental illness who formed mentor pairs in each trial region and continued to support the pharmacists throughout the delivery of the intervention. The 2-hour goal training module centred on the transtheoretical stages of change model  [20] , motivational interviewing  [21] , and how to develop SMART goals  [5] . This module provided information on how to conduct goal planning conversations, identify actions, and complete goal planning worksheets, providing a number of SMART goal examples. No measurement of the pharmacists' confidence or experience in SMART goal planning and documentation was undertaken prior to the intervention."

Service-users and pharmacists collaboratively identified concerns regarding physical and psychological wellbeing and medicine use before co-designing individualized goals and goal plans. All data were recorded in PharMIbridge-specific modules integrated into pharmacy clinical practice software (GuildCare NG TM ). Pharmacists were asked to document the key issue and how the goal would be achieved. Pharmacists followed up with service-user participants at tailored intervals over 6 months to review and adjust or create new goals as required. Goals were recorded at each consultation."

      "text": "The SMART Goal Evaluation Method (SMART-GEM) tool was used to assess whether the goals documented by pharmacists, in collaboration with service-users, met the SMART criteria: specific, measurable, activity-based, and included information about review and time-frame  [22] . Bowman  [22]  argued that assessing whether a documented goal is achievable/attainable or relevant/realistic required knowledge of the service-user's circumstances and context and, as such, could not be accurately assessed by reviewing documentation alone. Instead, activity-based and review were included to reflect the importance of important goal aspects including clearly specifying behaviours and providing regular feedback  [23] . The SMART-GEM does not assess how the goals were determined but instead assumes that a clear understanding of key needs and a collaborative approach to goal planning is undertaken  [24] .\n\nSMART-GEM is a standardized tool designed to evaluate SMART goals in clinical and research settings objectively  [22] . SMART-GEM has been assessed within a physical and neurological rehabilitation setting as having good construct validity and inter-rater reliability on total scores  [22] . The tool provides a framework to assist health practitioners in writing SMART goals and sets specific criteria for evaluating written goals  [10] . Each of the five domains corresponding to the SMART acronym has a set of criteria (Table  1 ) to reflect clinically useful goals and to allow for objective auditing of written goals  [24] . Each criterion is scored with a '1' (goal meets the criteria) or '0' (goal does not meet the requirements). These scores are then totalled to a possible final score of '8', with a score of '8' assessed as an 'excellent' goal, '7' as good quality, '6' as 'average', and '5' or less classified as 'poor' quality goals  [24] .\n\nAll goals documented during the PharMIbridge intervention were evaluated using the SMART-GEM tool. Before undertaking data analysis, two members of the research team (VS and SS) scored the practice goals (n = 10) provided in the SMART-GEM manual  [24] , discussing any differences in interpretations and clarifying discrepancies with the manual's provided answers. Next, PharMIbridge goals were downloaded from the software into an Excel spreadsheet and scored. This included two preliminary scorings of ten goals by the same two researchers, comparing the scores and discussing discrepancies until both scorers were comfortable in applying the tool in the same manner. All goal-related information obtained during the PharMIbridge intervention (key issue, goal, and action plan) was included in the scoring. A further 10 goals were independently scored, with good consistency achieved. VS then scored each PharMIbridge goal individually using the SMART-GEM score sheet  [24] . SM completed a quality review of 25 goals (5%) with only three minor discrepancies on individual items identified, not impacting the overall grading of those goals.\n\nThe goals were also categorized utilizing an existing taxonomy  [25]  into five domains describing the content of goals (Table  2 )."

That is, where will the goal activity be performed?\n\nThe available performance context (hospital ward, rehabilitation gym) needs to be considered in contract to the optimal performance context (service user's home, work setting, local shops) Example Meets criteria: 'Mr Smith will walk independently from his home to the local shops using a walking stick' Does not meet criteria: 'Mr Smith will see the dentist every year' Measurable The goal states how achievement will be 'measured'. That is, using an outcome measurement instrument or a measure of distance, time, frequency, intensity, level of pain, number of cues, or level of assistance needed) The goal identifies the 'criteria' for the acceptable standard of outcome performance. The goal should state how much, how often, how fast, how long, or how accurate the goal outcome is expected to be. For example, within 10 seconds, in \u00bd hour, no more than two prompts, within 10 seconds after verbal prompt, for at least 20 minutes, to complete within 10 minutes on five consecutive occasions, 8 out of 10 correct responses or with 80% accuracy, on each occasion, on 5 consecutive occasions, daily Example Meets criteria: 'Mr Smith will gradually reduce the time taken from 40 minutes to 30 minutes after 2 weeks and 20 minutes after 4 weeks' Does not meet criteria: 'Mr Smith will eat more fruit and vegetables' Activitybased The goal states how the service-user will achieve the goal by providing an intervention Example Meets criteria: 'Mr Smith will practice walking the route daily' Does not meet criteria: 'Mr Smith will monitor his diet'"

Overall, 81.0% (n = 417) of the goals scored two or fewer, with less than 1% achieving a total score of five (n = 4) and six goals (1.2%) receiving a '0' (Fig.  1 ). A Kruskal-Wallis H test showed that there was a statistically significant difference in SMART-GEM total scores across the five domains of goals \u03c7 2 (4) = 35.303, P < 0.001 (Fig.  2 ).

Twenty-one of these goals included information about both measurement of goal achievement (how measured) and an acceptable standard of achievement (measurement criteria).\n\nGiven that the goals were collaboratively developed between pharmacists and service-users, only 67.7% of goals related to the use of medicines included an observable behaviour. However, 95.2% of these goals contained details regarding intervention or action.

To our knowledge, the SMART-GEM tool has not been used to assess the quality of goals developed within community pharmacy settings or with service-users experiencing SPMIs. This raises questions regarding the applicability and validity of the SMART-GEM tool within this setting.

      "title": "Interpretation within the context of the wider literature",
      "text": "Results from this study identified that goals developed during a brief wellbeing intervention appeared to contain less detail than the recommended traditional SMART goal planning format. While this study did not explore why the goals failed to meet the SMART criteria, factors such as the setting in which goal planning occurs and the service-user population participating in goal planning have been found to influence how goals are prioritized and documented  [27] . Much of the research regarding the use of SMART goals has been undertaken in clinical settings, often focused on supporting serviceusers to overcome functional impairments rather than change health behaviours  [28] . Less is known about how SMART goals are being incorporated into brief health inventions in primary care and community-based settings. For example, this study identified that very few goals developed in community pharmacy settings contained information about the specific conditions (0.8%) and context (2.7%) of the goals. This may have been due to an assumed or shared understanding of the conditions (e.g. service-user performs the activity independently) and context (e.g. home environment, local community). These considerations may not be seen as important to include when documenting goals within community settings.\n\nOf interest is the limited number of goals that contained measurement information. Without a measurement component, it is difficult to measure outcomes and demonstrate an intervention's effectiveness. Within this study, the goals most likely to contain measurement were related to lifestyle and wellbeing. It may be that these goals included behaviours or outcomes that were easier to measure (e.g. weight change, exercise duration) compared to other goal types (e.g. those related to mental health status, relationships, or pain) which may be more challenging to measure  [10] . This could be due to the pharmacists' lack of confidence in planning goals outside their usual scope of practice or their general lack of knowledge and experience in developing SMART goals.\n\nWhile goal specificity has been previously explored in various healthcare settings  [16] , studies tended to use researcherdeveloped, non-validated audit tools, preventing a comparison of results. The one identified prior study using the SMART-GEM tool examined allied health clinicians' goal quality and found similar results for goals planned before the clinicians underwent further SMART goal training  [10] . Before implementing the intervention, the PharMIbridge pharmacists received training about SMART goals but had limited opportunities to practice and did not receive any feedback on the documented goals. It is, therefore, difficult to determine the level of knowledge and confidence that pharmacists had in using the SMART goal method or if goal quality would have improved with ongoing feedback. Several studies have suggested that training, practice, and ongoing support are needed to assist health practitioners in creating specific and meaningful goals  [5, 10] ."

      "text": "Studies have identified that healthcare practitioners find it challenging to apply SMART goals to the broader life goals often prioritized by service-users  [29] . Service-users have reported that SMART goals do not always accurately capture their personal preferences or reflect the complexity of their everyday lives  [11] . Therefore, it can be challenging to transform complex and varied needs into measurable, specific, realistic goals during brief interventions. Additionally, goal planning and commitment facilitate motivation to make health changes, and it is unclear if the use of SMART goals during brief interventions accurately reflect or incorporate service-users' longer-term goals, which can be more personally meaningful and motivating. This is an important consideration for including goal planning in shortterm interventions focused on initiating behaviour changes rather than when focused on the service-users' long-term trajectories.\n\nWithin mental health service delivery, goal planning is recognized as an integral component of recovery, providing a means to explore and achieve aspirations for the future and promote hope and personal meaning  [30] . It is unclear if goal planning needs for service-users experiencing SPMIs differ from those with other health conditions. Given the limited research regarding the use of SMART goal planning within mental health recovery, further research is needed to identify which elements of the SMART acronym are most suited to supporting service-users experiencing SPMIs in achieving their desired outcomes when receiving support in communitybased, primary care settings."

      "text": "This study provides insights into the quality and documentation of goals co-designed between community pharmacists and service-users experiencing SPMIs during a brief wellbeing intervention. Whilst SMART goals are recommended for use in brief health interventions, the findings from this study demonstrated that in practice, goals documented by PharMIbridge community pharmacists did not meet the SMART criteria. Further research is needed to determine which elements of the SMART criteria are most important in supporting positive health behaviour changes for service-users participating in brief interventions in primary healthcare settings. Additionally, further investigation is needed regarding the training and types of resources that could support primary healthcare practitioners to incorporate goal planning in brief health interventions."
