  "title": "Twenty-Four-Hour Ambulatory Blood Pressure Measurement Using a Novel Noninvasive, Cuffless, Wireless Device",
  "abstract": "BACKGROUND Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) using cuff-based devices is used for diagnosis and treatment of hypertension. Technical limitations, low compliance, and complex procedures limit their use. The aim of the present study was to test the accuracy of a new photoplethysmography-based, wearable device (Wrist-monitor) as compared with the standard cuff-based ABPM device. \n METHODS Twenty-four-hour (24H) ABPM was performed in parallel for both devices on volunteers aged 18-65 years, while documenting their daily activities. Level of comfort and activity disturbance of both devices were recorded. Linear regression and Bland-Altman were used to evaluate the agreement between devices. Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve analysis was used to classify hypertension based on the average Wrist-monitor measurements as compared with a cuff-based ABPM device. \n RESULTS The study included 28 subjects (18 men) mean age 41.5 \u00b1 16.2 years. Bland-Altman analysis resulted in 24H bias of -1.1 mm Hg for both diastolic blood pressure (DBP) and systolic blood pressure (SBP). Mean daytime bias was -1.9 mm Hg for DBP and SBP, while nighttime bias was smaller (0.7 and 0.4 mm Hg for DBP and SBP, respectively). ROC curve analysis yielded a mean area under the curve (AUC) of 1 for SBP and 24H blood pressure measurements. AUCs of 0.994 and 0.955 were found for the daytime DBP and night DBP, respectively. 24H ABPM with the Wrist-monitor caused significantly less inconvenience compared with the cuff-based device (P < 0.001). \n CONCLUSIONS The cuffless device provides comparable measurements to those obtained with the currently used cuff-based ABPM device, with significantly less inconvenience to the subject.",

      "text": "Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular morbidity and mortality, yet its diagnosis can be delayed due to lack of overt symptoms and reliance on blood pressure (BP) measurements for diagnosis. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) has become a frequently used method for the diagnosis of hypertension,  1, 2  as it provides a more comprehensive assessment of BP during daytime and nighttime, and allows identification of patients with distinct BP profiles, such as masked or white-coat hypertension.  [3] [4] 4] [5]  There is increasing evidence showing that ABPM may score the severity of hypertension and predict the cardiovascular risk of a patient more accurately than office-based BP measurements.  6, 7 The recent National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) guidelines recommend using 24-hour (24H) ABPM to confirm the diagnosis of hypertension.  8 n spite of all the advantages, the currently used ABPM devices have several setbacks that complicate their use and influence the accuracy of BP measurement. These include discomfort from using the cuff, inappropriate cuff size, and inaccuracies in measurements during sleep and daily activities.  [9] [10] 0] [11] [12] [13] [14]  Moreover, it was recently shown that the US hypertension control rates are now declining rather than improving.  15 Thus, there is a need for comfortable, precise, and user-friendly techniques for long-term BP measurement, helping with monitoring hypertension treatment dosing and medication compliance.\n\nThe purpose of the current study was to test the capability and compare measurements obtained using a wearable, noninvasive, cuffless photoplethysmography (PPG)-based remote patient Wrist-monitor to measurements obtained using a gold standard 24H oscillometric cuff-based ABPM device."

      "title": "The PPG-based device",
      "text": "PPG is commonly applied for pulse oximetry, transmitting light which is absorbed by a detector on the other side of relatively thin body parts such as fingers, ear lobes, etc. While passing through the tissue, the light wavelengths show a unique absorbance pattern. The detector can measure the changing absorbance at each of several wavelengths, determining the absorbance resulting from the pulsating arterial blood. The currently used sensor (BB-613WP, Biobeat Technologies, Petah Tikva, Israel, Figure  1 ) is based on reflective PPG, in which part of the transmitted light is reflected from the tissue and detected by a photodiode detector positioned near the light source transmitter. The high resolution of the PPG wave combined with advanced algorithms allows the sensor to capture changes, as well as to track vital signs, derived from the pulse contours. Tracking the changes of BP is achieved after a preset baseline calibration process, and is based on pulse wave transit time technology combined with pulse wave analysis. The baseline calibration measurement is patient-specific and is performed using an approved noninvasive, cuff-based device with the average value of 3 consecutive measurements entered into the device's management application. Calibration is needed once every 3 months, which increases its clinical usability. Within the context of this study, calibration was conducted only once, at the beginning of the study. The algorithms used to analyze the PPG signal provide values that reflect the values within the large vessels/aorta, as was shown previously.  16 The measurement is not influenced by arm position with relation to the heart level. The data were collected and transmitted in real-time to a web application available both to the user and the health care provider, thus providing a remote patient monitoring capability. The PPG-based sensor is integrated in a Wrist-monitor device, and can be worn on any wrist size (Figure  1 ). The device is FDA cleared for BP measurements."

      "text": "On the morning of the study the subjects completed a demographic and past medical history questionnaire, after which both devices were placed, one on each arm-the ABPM was placed on the left arm with the cuff size adjusted as needed, and the Wrist-monitor was attached to the right arm's wrist.\n\nThe FDA and CE certified oscillometric ABPM [ABPM50 by CONTEC medical systems (People's Republic of China)] measured BP every 20-30 minutes for a 24H period, as further detailed below. The collected data were transferred to a designated computer program for further analysis.\n\nWe have previously shown that the PPG-based device is comparable to a cuff-based sphygmomanometer device.  17 This device is able to measure BP every 5 seconds. Initial calibration measurements were taken and entered into the PPG-based device's web application, and from that moment on, the PPG-based devices were continuously monitoring the BP at a 5-second measurement rate. The programmed ABPM BP measurements were recorded every 20-30 minutes, for up to a 24H period, each having an exact timestamp of when it was recorded. From 07:00 to 23:00 measurements were taken every 20 minutes, and from 23:00 to 07:00 measurements were taken every 30 minutes, as accepted in the clinical practice. With each participant, at the beginning of the study, the research team synchronized the PPG-based device inner clock with the time as it appeared in the ABPM app. This allowed us at the end of the study, to pair a parallel measurement taken at the same time in the PPG-based device and in the ABPM device, and compare the two, even if the ABPM measurement time intervals were not precisely as programmed. During this 24H period, participants kept an activity diary which included items such as sleeping, eating, and exercising activities. Nighttime period was defined individually based on the data obtained from the diary. The 24H data were directly transferred from the ABPM device and collected from the PPG-based device's data cloud for further analysis."

      "text": "Characteristics of the study population including daytime, nighttime, and mean 24H BP recorded by the 2 devices are shown in Table  1 . Two of the initially recruited participants were excluded from the analysis due to low rate of data collection in the ABPM device. Among participants, 18 (64.3%) were men, with mean age of 41.5 \u00b1 16.2 years and body mass index of 26.3 \u00b1 5.2 kg/m 2 . Six participants (21.4%) had a diagnosis of hypertension. BP was obtained simultaneously every 20 minutes for approximately 24H, with both techniques. When measurements from all time-points and participants (n = 2,381) were analyzed, 87.6% (DBP) and 81.5% (SBP) of all measurements obtained by the Wrist-monitor were in the range of \u00b15 mm Hg from those obtained by the ABPM device, while 95.3% (DBP) and 94.2% (SBP) were in the range of \u00b110 mm Hg (Table  2 ). Table  3  summarizes the rate of measurements in the hypertension range with both devices during daytime, nighttime, and 24H.\n\nNext, we analyzed the level of agreement between the 2 devices, using the Bland-Altman plots (Figure  2 ). Mean 24H measurements were marginally underestimated (-1.1 mm Hg for both DBP and SBP) with the PPG-based remote patient Wrist-monitor, with narrow 95% LOA (-4.1, 1.8, and -4.2, 1.9 mm Hg for DBP and SBP, respectively; Figure  2a ). When comparing the measurements obtained during the daytime or nighttime separately, average daytime bias was -1.9 mm Hg for DBP and SBP (Figure  2b ), while nighttime bias was smaller (0.7 and 0.4 mm Hg for DBP and SBP, respectively; Figure  2c ). As expected, 95% LOA for the average daytime (SBP: -7.0, 3.3; DBP -6.3, 2.5 mm Hg) was greater as compared with the average nighttime (SBP: -1.7, 2.6; DBP -1.5, 2.9 mm Hg) measures compared with the average 24H values. We have also analyzed the level of agreement for each measurement during daytime, nighttime, and 24H (presented in Supplementary Figure  S4 online ).\n\nComparison of average BP measurements throughout the longitudinal monitoring show high precision and accuracy (LOAs for each panel in Figure  2 : from -4.2 to 1.9 for 24H SBP, from -6.9 to 3.3 for daytime SBP, from -1.7 to 2.6 for night SBP, from -4.1 to 1.8 for 24H DBP, from -6.3 to 2.5 for daytime DBP, and from -1.5 to 1.8 for night DBP), with a relatively narrow 95% LOAs, as shown in Figure  2 . Comparison at the level of specific measurements show wider LOAs for daytime and 24H measurements while those for night are narrower (Supplementary Figure  S4 online ). We found a slight under and over estimate of the agreement between the PPG-based device and the cuff-based ABPM device (Figure  2  and Supplementary Figure  S4  online). However, under estimate was present in less than 2% of the total number of measurements for both SBP and DBP (38 and 50 out of 2,377 measurements, respectively), and over estimate was present in less than 1% of the total number of measurements for both SBP and DBP (19 and 17 out of 2,377 measurements, respectively).\n\nMean values obtained by both devices were highly correlated (R 2 > 0.95, P < 0.0001) for both DBP and SBP, during the 24H measurement period, and during the daytime and nighttime separately (Figure  3a-c ).\n\nIn Supplementary Figure  S5  online, we present the BP graphs of both the ABPM and the PPG-based devices of all participants.\n\nWe used ROC curve analysis to determine the differences obtained between devices for the acceptable abnormal threshold. Thresholds for the ROC were determined according to the 2017 ACC/AHA Guideline's definition for hypertension: the cutoffs for SBP were 130, 110, and 125 for daytime, nighttime, and 24H, respectively, and the cutoffs for DBP were 80, 65, and 75 for daytime, nighttime, and 24H, respectively.  19 ROC curve analysis of the average BP measurements yielded a mean AUC of 1 for SBP and 24H BP measurements. AUCs of 0.994 and 0.955 were found for the daytime DBP and night DBP, respectively. When analyzing all BP measurements (n = 2,381), AUC for both SBP and DBP were >0.94 for all means of 24H, daytime, and night BP.\n\nWe then compared the average of all the 24H measurements taken using the PPG-based devices with the average of the 24H measurements of the PPG-based devices excluding those taken in parallel with the cuff-based ABPM device; with the average of measurements taken by the PPGbased device in parallel to the cuff-based ABPM device; and with the average of measurements of the cuff-based ABPM device. We found that the average measurements taken with the cuff-based ABPM device and with the paralleling PPG-based device measurements were significantly higher than the average taken during the rest of the day (mean of differences (MOD) of 24H measurements of the PPG-based devices-114/68; MOD of measurements of the cuff-based ABPM device-120/73; MOD of measurements of the PPGbased devices excluding those taken in parallel with the cuffbased ABPM device-114/68; MOD of measurements of the PPG-based device taken in parallel to the cuff-based ABPM device-119/72) (Supplementary Figure  S6 online ).\n\nIn 10 participants, the static BP measurements taken by the cuff-based device and used for baseline calibration were above the threshold regarded as hypertensive. In 2 of them, average 24H measurements show normal BP. In the other 18 participants, baseline calibration static BP measurements were normotensive, yet in 3 of them the average 24H measurements are consistent with hypertension.\n\nThe participants reported the Wrist-monitor was significantly (P < 0.0001) more comfortable (Supplementary Figure  S7A  online), was less of a disturbance for their daily routine (Supplementary Figure  S7B  online), and had a significantly (P < 0.0001) higher rating for long-term adherence/responsiveness (Supplementary Figure  S7C online )."

      "title": "DISCUSSION",
      "text": "In this observational study, we tested the capability of a novel remote patient monitoring device to repeatedly measure BP during a 24H period and compared it with a gold standard commonly used oscillometric ABPM device. No significant differences in average measurements between the 2 devices were found. High correlations were observed between the BP levels recorded by the 2 devices even when looking at individual measurements throughout the 24H period, and when looking at daytime and nighttime separately, as seen in the Pearson correlation test and Bland-Altman analysis. Moreover, ROC analysis has shown that the difference between measurements is within the high correlation, in more than 80% of the measurements the difference between the devices was less than 5 mm Hg, and in ~95% of the measurements the difference between the devices was less than 10 mm Hg, for both SBP and DBP values. These findings suggest that the PPG-based device might be used for 24H BP recording and can potentially replace the gold standard sphygmomanometer-based BP ABPM device. The recording with the new device is much more convenient and can be used for more than 24H and therefore might give much more reliable information. Our results suggest continuous BP measurement with the novel device causes less disturbance in daily activities and therefore may become a routine method to diagnose hypertension and to follow patients with hypertension.\n\nThe obvious clinical need to improve BP recording resulted in several attempts to develop noninvasive, wearable devices for continuous BP measurement. These include, among others, the applanation pulse tonometry, in which the pressure wave is continuously measured in the radial artery, from which the BP is extrapolated following calibration with a standard cuff-based BP device  20  ; the vascular unloading time, in which the pulse wave is recorded using PPG and compared with an induced and changing pressure that keeps the amplitude constant, enabling to calculate the BP from the required change in pressure  21  ; and pulse wave transit time, in which the BP is calculated from the delay in the pulse wave compared with an electrocardiogram signal recorded in parallel.  22 In all, preliminary theoretical and small clinical studies have been conducted, but there is still a need to have more information from well-established clinical validation studies.  10, [22] [23] 3] [24] [25]  Here, we present a clinical study of a PPG-based device, using the pulse wave transit time and pulse wave analysis techniques unique by the fact that there is no need to combine electrocardiogram signals, allowing a less cumbersome method to continuously record BP.\n\nABPM has several advantages over a single BP measurement either in the clinic or at home, as it allows a more accurate characterization of the BP pattern of an individual throughout the day and night, and during activities of daily living.  2, 12 However, as the currently used ABPM devices are cumbersome, the users' compliance is relatively limited.  14, [26] [27] ] [28]  When looking at the cuff-based BP repeatability and aiming to reduce BP measurement errors, several recommendations were issued so far in different guidelines, including the use of validated upper-arm oscillometric devices in place of auscultation, training of medical assistants, monitoring compliance with BP protocols, and having several measurements taken to reduce standard errors.  29, 30 All of these issues are easy to comply with when using the PPG-based device.\n\nThe high precision and accuracy of average BP measurements throughout the longitudinal monitoring with a relatively narrow 95% LOAs (Figure  2 ) further shows the value of the PPG-based devices for ambulatory BP monitoring. When comparing all BP measurements (n = 2,381, Supplementary Figure  S4  online), a wider LOA can be noticed during daytime. This is expected due to the dynamic nature of everyday living, as measurements were taken while the participants were ambulatory and in a dynamic real-life setting, unlike measurements taken in a static laboratory setting. This is further strengthened when we see a higher level of agreement in the night measurements, collected mostly during sleep. As neutralization of hydrostatic effects during the night might also be involved as a mechanism, this should be addressed and included in future studies.\n\nIt is important to emphasize that clinically, the diagnosis of hypertension, as well as treatment and outcome measures, are based on the average measurements. Thus, since the aim of this study was to test whether the PPGbased device can be used for ambulatory BP monitoring, comparing the average measurements is more relevant than comparing all measurements. Despite the higher LOAs of all measurements, ROC analysis of over 94% during daytime, night, and 24H measurements demonstrates high level of accuracy at the individual measurement level.\n\nAs shown in Supplementary Figure  S6  online, we found that BP values are influenced by the cuff-based device in comparison to the optical-based Wrist-monitor device, perhaps indicating a cuff-related bias. Though this might have a profound effect on future BP monitoring, we think that the current study should be repeated with larger numbers of participants before definite conclusions could be drawn.\n\nWhen comparing the static baseline BP levels with the measurements taken during the 24H monitoring we found that in 5 participants out of the 28 there were discrepancies, further emphasizing the advantage and the importance of having a 24H monitoring period and not relying on single measurements for the diagnosis of hypertension.\n\nOutliers or unreliable measures could potentially influence such comparison studies. Indeed, in our hands, we found that out of the thousands of measurements collected, less than 1% were either outliers or unreliable measures, leading to the mean \u00b1 SD values described in Table  2  and shown in Supplementary Figure  S5  online. Despite these outliers, we still show that 94.2% of SBP measurements and 95.3% of DBP measurements fall within 10 mm Hg (Table  2 ).\n\nOur study has limitations. We studied a relatively small group of subjects and we did not include enough hypertensive subjects, very elderly subjects, obese subjects and patients with very high or very low BP levels. Therefore, we are unable to estimate the accuracy of the device in these subpopulations. Nevertheless, it is important to note that we compared more than 2,800 measurements between the 2 devices, that the average age of the participants was within the range of people diagnosed with primary hypertension, and that the average body mass index fits the definition of overweight.\n\nWe did not take BP measurements from both arms before starting the test in each individual, and thus may have missed individuals with a substantial BP difference between arms. None of the participants knew of any such difference before joining the study.\n\nFinally, the PPG-based device is under validation for other inpatient settings, such as in pregnant women during labor, in postsurgery patients, and in COVID-19 patients, helping in all of these clinical settings by remote patient monitoring.  31 n conclusion, the wearable, wireless, noninvasive PPGbased device is more comfortable, user-friendly, and offers accurate and continuous BP monitoring. This device could provide a 24H ABPM for hypertension diagnosis and treatment, with high compliance and without reducing the sensitivity of the test. Moreover, this device offers a longer period of continuous monitoring, potentially enabling better adjustment of treatment of hypertensive individuals. Further studies are needed to confirm the accuracy of the device in hypertensive patients and in other subpopulations."
