  "abstract": "Objectives: Investigate how people with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)-an example of a progressive, potentially fatal illness-are using digital technologies (DTs) to address illness experiences, outcomes and social connectedness. \n Materials and Methods: A transformative mixed methods study was conducted in Canada with people with COPD (n \u00bc 77) or with a progressive lung condition (n \u00bc 6). Stage-1 interviews (n \u00bc 7) informed the stage-2 survey. Survey responses (n \u00bc 80) facilitated the identification of participants for stage-3 interviews (n \u00bc 13). The interviews were thematically analyzed. Descriptive statistics were calculated for the survey. The integrative mixed method analysis involved mixing between and across the stages. Results: Most COPD participants (87.0%) used DTs. However, few participants frequently used DTs to self-manage COPD. People used DTs to seek online information about COPD symptoms and treatments, but lacked tailored information about illness progression. Few expressed interest in using DTs for self-monitoring and tracking. The regular use of DTs for intergenerational connections may facilitate leaving a legacy and passing on traditions and memories. Use of DTs for leisure activities provided opportunities for connecting socially and for respite, reminiscing, distraction and spontaneity. \n Discussion and Conclusion: We advocate reconceptualizing consumer health technologies to prioritize quality of life for people with a progressive, potentially fatal illness. \"Quality of life informatics\" should focus on reducing stigma regarding illness and disability and taboo towards death, improving access to palliative care resources and encouraging experiences to support social, emotional and mental health. For DTs to support people with fatal, progressive illnesses, we must expand informatics strategies to quality of life.",

      "text": "Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a progressive, potentially fatal illness that continues to be underresourced despite being the third leading cause of death worldwide.  1 COPD is a heterogeneous lung condition marked by shortness of breath and acute breathing events that can be fatal.  [2] [3] 3] [4] [5]  Social isolation-well recognized among those with COPD-may mean that these \"scary\" breathing events are unsupported experiences.  6, 7 Contributing factors to social isolation include decreased social networks as one ages, loss of ability to work due to loss of physical function, and discouragement from spending time within the community due to poor air quality or fear of viral infection.  5, [8] [9] [10] [11]  Because COPD is characterized by diminished physical ability and noticeable respiratory difficulties such as coughing and oxygen therapy, there can be stigma concerning disability. 12-14 Furthermore, with smoking often cited as the greatest \"risk factor\" for COPD, people may experience stigma and self-blame for having caused their illness.  12, [14] [15] ] [16] [17] [18]  The social isolation and stigmatization of COPD may result in under-treatment of anxiety and depression in the COPD population.  6, 10, [18] [19] ] [20]  Although early diagnosis of COPD and subsequent treatment can delay illness progression and improve patients' quality of life and mortality rates,  2, 4, 21, 22  the stigma toward COPD may contribute to inequitable healthcare access and resources.  5, 11, [23] [24] 4] [25]  Three quarters of people with COPD may be undiagnosed,  [26] [27] [28]  and more than a quarter will first learn of their diagnosis upon hospitalization.  25, 29, 30 Confirmation of diagnosis through spirometry testing  4, 31  may be delayed, as providers may be uncomfortable about, or not see the need for, testing,  32  or costs may be prohibitive for underinsured or rural patients.  33 Although best practice guidelines include attending pulmonary rehabilitation programs,  22, 31, 34, 35  few people have ongoing access to such programs due to smoking cessation requirements, lack of transportation, insufficient dedicated resources, or concerns about feeling \"worthy\" enough.  16, [36] [37] 7] [38] [39] [40]  COPD is potentially fatal; yet, interpersonal discomfort on the taboo topic of death may delay patientprovider discussions on prognosis.  41 The lack of dedicated resources for COPD has also extended into research,  42  as evidenced by some researchers calling COPD the \"poor cousin\" 25 of other chronic conditions.\n\nConsumer health informatics (CHI) holds potential for addressing challenges related to health outcomes and resource access for people with COPD. Figure  1  illustrates common CHI strategies applied across different health conditions that update and expand upon Klasnja and Pratt 43 5 intervention strategies for mobile health. These include health promotion and illness prevention, healthcare provider communication, decision support, patient education, selfmanagement, monitoring and tracking, caregiver support, and continuity of care.  [43] [44] 4] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49]  To date, most CHI interventions for COPD have involved telehealth, mobile apps, and tracking devices to (1) promote disease self-management through information and education  [50] [51] [52] [53] [54] [55] [56] [57] [58]  and (2) facilitate the monitoring of physical activity and COPD symptoms.  50, 51, 53, 55, [58] [59] ] [60]  However, the effectiveness of such tools for COPD is uncertain, 51 , 61 perhaps due to the lack of socioeconomic support required to \"self-manage\" COPD effectively.  53, [62] [63] 3] [64]  COPD apps illustrate the dominance of self-management strategies,  53, 60, 61, [65] [66] [67] [68]  while also repeatedly demonstrating the limited evidence of the effectiveness of these apps,  58, [65] [66] [67] [68]  , and the lack of examples in addressing social needs for selfmanagement.  53, 58, 60, 61, 65, 66 any of the CHI strategies for COPD have evolved from interventions for other chronic conditions (eg, diabetes and hypertension),  [69] [70] [71]  which typically do not have the same clinical and social characteristics as progressive, fatal illnesses with few treatment options like COPD.  68 In addition, even when internet-based interventions are extending to support emotional and mental health for people with chronic conditions, the focus continues to be on other illnesses, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic pain, and cancer.  72 oreover, the design of COPD CHI interventions may not incorporate COPD patients' views.  53 Consequently, CHI interventions for people with COPD may not be addressing needs regarding social isolation,  5, 9  countering stigmatization,  12, [15] [16] [17]  and supporting mental and emotional health.  20 his gap is especially significant given that digital technologies (DTs) have the potential to transform stigmatizing, isolating experiences and inequitable outcomes by providing a place for the narration and validation of experience,  73, 74  peer-based information exchange,  [73] [74] [75]  emotional support,  73, 74  and community building to advocate for resources and policy change.  [76] [77] 7] [78]  We therefore aimed to explore how DTs were used by people with COPD to promote their physical, social, emotional, and mental health.  72 In this research, we take COPD as an example of a progressive, potentially fatal illness for which clinical and social characteristics may lead to fundamentally different illness experiences than those for which CHI interventions are typically developed."

[79] [80] [81] 81] [82] [83] 85  Transformative mixed method studies share participatory methods with community-based participatory research,  [89] [90] [91]  and often begin with a qualitative stage to incorporate participants' perspectives into the research design, with the aim of elevating participants' knowledge to challenge an inequitable status quo.  83, 85 ur study asked people with COPD how they use DTs to support their experiences and outcomes with COPD and for social connectedness. To avoid assuming the scope of DTs used by patients, we provided multiple examples of DT activities (eg, emailing, text messaging) and tools (eg, Skype) and designed our questions to consider different potential roles for DT (eg, communication, education, information-seeking).  73, 74  We defined social connectedness as the sense of belonging people have with their family, friends, community, and peers.  92 Our definition of illness experiences and outcomes evolved from definitions of quality of life 93 and structural inequality  94, 95  : we considered the individual's perspective of their physical, social, emotional, and mental health and the historical, economic, political, and societal contexts that shape this perspective. Notably, we use the term fatal illness to reduce the taboo around discussions of death 41 and to draw attention to the potential outcome of COPD.  96 However, we also want to emphasize the importance of matching individual preferences for the terms people living with these illnesses use when describing their illness trajectory.  97"

Our initial inclusion criterium was that people had to identify with a diagnosis of COPD. However, early into the study people came forward who had shared lived experiences of a progressive, potentially fatal lung condition, and some were attending the COPD support group when they could find no available support related to their illness. In order to surface this hidden population's experiences, we broadened our inclusion criteria to people living with a progressive, potentially fatal lung condition and identified with the COPD community. The survey began with 3 questions: (1a) Do you have COPD, emphysema, or chronic bronchitis; (1b) If not, what makes you a good fit for the study?; and (2) Have you been formally diagnosed with COPD. In addition, the results from the PROs were used to further assess inclusion in the study based on people's severity (CAT) and experiences (PREM-C9) of living with a progressive, potentially fatal lung condition."

During the stage-3 interviews, people noted how the connections with their family had changed with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic when they began to meet online for virtual family reunions (see Table  1A ). No one had conducted a video healthcare visit.\n\nPeople who reported more frequent use of DTs for social connectedness reported higher satisfaction with their social roles and activities.

But with COPD the diagnostic tools. . . I'm sure they're very well based in science and experience, but it just seems pretty minimal compared to another organ's disease and yet COPD or chronic lung disease is such a common problem. . . There just seems to be little depth to it.

Participants were more likely to seek information on symptoms and medications and treatments, and some found it could be difficult to assess the accuracy of online information or be \"mentally upsetting\" to read statistics about their illness (see Table  2A ).\n\nMonitoring and tracking: The majority of participants reported no (39/66; 59.1%) or limited (15/66; 22.7%) use of DTs for tracking medications (see Table  2B ). Interviewees stated that bubble packs for their medications met this need, so DTs weren't necessary. Although pedometers and oximeters have been promoted for COPD-for tracking physical activity and monitoring oxygen levels, respectively-twothirds of people did not use devices for these purposes. Yet 59.1% of participants reported using DTs to monitor and track other health conditions (eg, hypertension). Interviewees who had previously used oximeters found that oxygen percentage information was of limited value in early-stage COPD, as their oxygen readings did not reach critical levels.\n\nIn addition, people knew when their breathing was \"problematic and when it's not\" without technology. However, a participant in late-stage COPD found the oximeter to be a \"savior\" for determining whether their shortness of breath was related to their O 2 or CO 2 levels.\n\nAsynchronous versus synchronous support: Although the majority of technology adopters reported reading forum or blog posts, only 2 people reported high frequency in commenting on forums, blogs, or social media (see Table  2C ). Eighteen survey respondents reported using DTs frequently to participate in support programs. However, the open-ended survey and interviews revealed participants most often used phone and email to communicate with their peer support group. When reaching out to people to discuss their illness preference was for synchronous forms of communication, rather than public, asynchronous forms of communication, such as Facebook."

[PA41, Stage-3] I've been having concerns about my COPD so because you don't get to see your doctor anymore I've thought, well maybe I should look online and then I kind of lose the motivation to do it for some reason. I don't know why. It's such a oneway communication system. [PA67, Stage-3] Creating a safe online place to meet People who were interviewed after the start of the COVID-19 pandemic mentioned the loss of their connections with peer support groups and expressed interest in creating a safe online place to meet (see Table  3A ). The in-person COPD group had been a valuable place for people to share lived experiences: to find information on treatments that worked for others, for discussions about the fatal aspect of COPD, and to know that they were not alone. However, participants also noted that having these existential discussions necessitated first knowing the other people and that 2-way communication was important."

As illustrated in Multimedia Appendix SC, all 3 interviewed participants shared similar experiences to the COPD population when recognizing the fatal aspect of their illness, the lack of information about treatments and the need to advocate. Their use of DTs to support their illness were also similar to COPD participants: selfmanagement strategies did not extend beyond information seeking, and the intergenerational connections afforded through DTs were important for staying socially connected. Notably, 2 interviewed non-COPD participants shared their experiences in being identified with COPD when they were out in the community or when struggling to find a diagnosis. The third interviewed participant saw himself as an \"oddball\" in not fitting into any current programs and joined the local COPD support group.

      "text": "Although people mentioned visiting reputable sites for health information, people found the information was not specific enough to their current stage of COPD, and their own personal situation. However, participants expressed the desire for more interactions with their healthcare providers, and some noted how it had been over a decade without follow-up care. Other work has shown that healthcare providers may be reluctant to discuss the progressive, potentially fatal aspect of COPD.  6, 41 As such our framework emphasizes the need for reducing stigma regarding illness, disability, and taboo toward death by encouraging opportunities for communicating information about illness progression through a person-centered lens. Importantly, the person-centered 97 component of this strategy recognizes varying cultural values in discussing illness, disability, and death. As such, these informatics tools must be accompanied by provider training on eliciting patients' preferences for how and when to approach these sensitive conversations.  97 eople in this study were not interested in participating in the kind of public, asynchronous forums that have been successful with other patient groups (such as those with cancer and HIV  [136] [137] [138]  when advocating for policy change, addressing stigma, and improving resources and treatment.  139, 140 ather, our findings suggested that developing safe, synchronous places to share illness experiences could be an alternative way to bring together a community that could work towards reducing stigma. As part of the transformative approach goal of building capacity, the researchers worked with the community partner in developing a virtual program that included biweekly virtual exercise classes facilitated by a kinesiologist and monthly webinars on recent medication and treatment advancements and advanced care planning that were delivered by respirologists, pharmacists and respiratory therapists.  141 Future research should evaluate whether similar virtual programs could (1) reduce stigma by bringing together a community of patients, families, community members, and healthcare providers that can advocate for change; (2) address the lack of information by providing opportunities to learn from healthcare experts; and (3) support social, physical, and mental health through biweekly peer support. 119\n\nImproving access to resources for palliative care Chronic care models emphasize that self-management is only 1 piece of care, and the importance of ongoing engagement and follow-up with a multidisciplinary, proactive care team trained on consulting patients on the progression of their chronic illness.  55, 96, [142] [143] 3] [144]  However, similar to findings in previous studies,  [35] [36] [37]  few people in this study had ongoing access to multidisciplinary programs that may help in decreasing depression and anxiety and improving quality of life.  34, 35 . As such, our framework emphasizes the need for facilitating culturally sensitive end-of-life discussions and providing access to multidisciplinary care resources. Pulmonary rehab programs have been adapted to incorporate leisure activities as a way to target social isolation 145 and delivered by palliative multidisciplinary care teams who are trained in providing support to people throughout all stages of COPD progression.  128 The proliferation of teleconferencing tools during the past 3 years 37,146 offers a way to reach patients who previously were denied access-those who lack transportation access, have limited social support, currently smoke, or fear viral infection.

As such, they found that CHI's strategy of monitoring and tracking clinical indicators did not fully align with this need. In addition, our study highlighted that patients may not always follow the treatment plan outlined by providers. As such, there is a need for developing \"mundane technologies\" that align with the activities of day-to-day living and reveal how patients make decisions around treatments.  125, 126  However, previous research has noted how monitoring and tracking can negatively impact patients' quality of life 148 by being overwhelming, 117 incompatible with daily life, 149 and in opposition to patients' need to maintain control and establish normalcy.  150 oreover, medicalized devices that provide continuous monitoring may counter the needed distraction that may be beneficial for reducing negative moods, 151 and detract from DTs' role in distancing from negative thoughts  152, 153  when facing the uncertainty of the disease trajectory. Below we examine how participants use of DTs for intergenerational connections, leisure, and other activities outside of their illness provides multiple avenues for distancing from negative thoughts. Participants' intergenerational activities of leaving a legacy, carrying on traditions and passing on memories could also be a way to prepare for end-of-life, promote well-being, and reduce anxiety for older adults.  154 Previous studies of people with a fatal illness have noted the importance of \"needing to prepare\" 6 by writing wills and advanced planning guides, 155 and putting legacy documents 116 in order. Recent research studies have explored how DTs can support leaving a legacy 153 through the sharing of stories through text, images, videos, and music.  130 Older adults' \"digital storytelling\" can promote emotional and mental health, address loneliness,  131, 156  and help develop meaningful social connections across generations. 129 However, although a \"digital legacy\" can be of comfort to loved ones, without clarity as to the disposition of this information after a person's death may go against what they envisioned.  157, 158 Future CHI studies could examine both how digital storytelling and digital legacy discussions could be integrated into palliative care programs.  157 he online leisure activities participants shared in watching concerts, listening to comedy acts and music, and revisiting past hobbies demonstrated how creating opportunities for spontaneity and reminiscing can support social, emotional, and mental health.  159, 160 Leisure activities can be a venue for countering sorrow from the diminished opportunities for spontaneity and social connectedness among people aging with a chronic illness.  142, 145, [161] [162] 2] [163] [164]  Spontaneity has been recognized as promoting social and emotional health for children, 165 but we were unable to find similar studies for adults. Future research could examine if DTs can be used to prompt spontaneity for older adults living with chronic conditions.\n\nOlder adults participating in active leisure activities that have been historically pursued in-person (eg, cultural events, volunteer work, hobbies) have been found to be more important in maintaining social connectedness than passive activities (eg, using computers, watching TV, or listening to the radio). 166 However, given participants' online leisure activities and the evolution of DTs since 2020,  167  further CHI studies about how both active and passive online leisure activities may support social, emotional, and mental health for people with progressive, potentially fatal illnesses are warranted. For example, CHI studies could expand on emerging research on virtual reality that supports travelbased activities and opportunities to 134 promote social and emotional health for older adults.  134, 135 rticipants' limited use of DTs suggest that people with COPD may wish to create a separation between their illness world and their online world. When living with the reality of a potentially fatal illness, people may want choose when to acknowledge their COPD through DT use and when to retreat as a form of respite from facing the prognosis. Paterson's 161 model of shifting perspectives of chronic illness further illustrates how patients want to maintain control over when to focus on living well and versus the burden, progression, and stigma of their illness. The model illuminates how algorithms may deny people this control, by using previous searches to send unwanted online recommendations during needed respite periods. Thus, future CHI research should evaluate the impact of recommendation systems on the emotional and mental health of people with fatal, stigmatizing chronic conditions."

Our analysis of this subgroup illustrated how they can experience another layer of social isolation from not being able to find resources specific to their illness, although some of these participants were partially able to address this isolation by connecting with a COPD peer support group where they could share similar experiences. Other than the PROs, the questions in the survey did not undergo formal validity testing. To address this limitation, existing surveys were reviewed, and multiple people evaluated the survey before it launched."

Significantly, however, the ways in which people with COPD used DTs provides an alternative approach for CHI to develop interventions that increase prioritization of quality of life. Notably, activities that encourage distraction, respite, spontaneity, and the carrying on of memories and traditions may be critical for supporting the social, emotional, and mental health of people with progressive, potentially fatal illness."
