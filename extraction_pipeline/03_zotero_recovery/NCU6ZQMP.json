  "title": "Mechanism of Innate Immune Response Induced by Albizia julibrissin Saponin Active Fraction Using C2C12 Myoblasts",
  "abstract": "Albizia julibrissin saponin active fraction (AJSAF), is a prospective adjuvant with dual Th1/Th2 and Tc1/Tc2 potentiating activity. Its adjuvant activity has previously been proven to be strictly dependent on its spatial co-localization with antigens, highlighting the role of local innate immunity in its mechanisms. However, its potential targets and pathways remain unclear. Here, its intracellular molecular mechanisms of innate immune response were explored using mouse C2C12 myoblast by integrative analysis of the in vivo and in vitro transcriptome in combination with experimental validations. AJSAF elicited a temporary cytotoxicity and inflammation towards C2C12 cells. Gene set enrichment analysis demonstrated that AJSAF regulated similar cell death-and inflammatory response-related genes in vitro and in vivo through activating second messenger-MAPK-CREB pathways. AJSAF markedly enhanced the Ca 2+ , cAMP, and reactive oxygen species levels and accelerated MAPK and CREB phosphorylation in C2C12 cells. Furthermore, Ca 2+ chelator, CREB inhibitor, and MAPK inhibitors dramatically blocked the up-regulation of IL-6, CXCL1, and COX2 in AJSAF-treated C2C12 cells. Collectively, these results demonstrated that AJSAF induced innate immunity via Ca 2+ -MAPK-CREB pathways. This study is beneficial for insights into the molecular mechanisms of saponin adjuvants.",

      "text": "Vaccine development is facing serious challenges due to the emergence of new infectious diseases and the spread of cancer  [1] . Adjuvants should be capable of eliciting appropriate T-cell-mediated and/or humoral immunities targeting specific pathogens  [2] . However, up to now, few adjuvants have been licensed for human use. In addition to safety issues and lower potency, limited understanding of the mechanism and drug targets is also a key factor behind the lack of effective adjuvants  [3] .\n\nSaponin adjuvants achieve adaptive immunity by reconstructing the local immune microenvironment. Although considered as an undesired side effect, early inflammatory response is crucial for adjuvants to elicit adaptive immune responses  [4] . Most vaccines are administered intramuscularly  [5] . However, the muscle tissues contain only a few resident immune cells, whose abundance and type are altered by most adjuvants  [6] . Adjuvant-induced acute inflammatory responses in muscle tissues promote the recruitment of immune cells to improve antigen uptake and expedite the migration of antigen-loaded immune cells to the lymph nodes, leading to the efficient activation of naive T cells and the establishment of adaptive immunity  [7] [8] [9] . Mouse C2C12 myoblasts are commonly used to study the development and regeneration of human skeletal muscle cells  [10] . In our previous works, it was found that C2C12 myoblasts could be applied as an in vitro model in understanding the mechanisms of saponin adjuvants  [11] .\n\nAlbizia julibrissin saponin active fraction (AJSAF) is a prospective adjuvant with dual Th1/Th2 and Tc1/Tc2 potentiating activity on OVA and several commercial livestock and poultry vaccines  [12] . It has been previously reported that AJSAF induced the protein expression of cytokines and chemokines at the site of injection and its adjuvant activity was strictly dependent on its spatial co-localization with antigens  [4] . Although the potential targets and pathways of the AJSAF-induced local innate immunity in mice has been also studied, the results need to be verified  [13] . Here, its intracellular molecular mechanisms of innate immune response were explored using mouse C2C12 myoblast through integrative analysis of the in vitro and in vivo transcriptome in combination with experimental validations."

Six hub genes formed a PPI network with co-expression of 89.51, prediction of 8.88, and other of 1.61 (Figure  6G ). The functions of the six hub genes mainly included the regulation of ERK1 and ERK2 cascade, cytokine-mediated signaling, cell chemotaxis, acute inflammatory response, ROS metabolic process, chemokine production, and cell activation (Figure  6G ). The above results suggested that AJSAF regulated the cell death-and inflammatory responserelated genes in vitro and in vivo through the second-messenger-MAPK pathway.\n\nVaccines 2023, 11, x FOR PEER REVIEW 10 of 16 positive regulation of locomotion (Figure  6B  and Figure  S2 ). Meanwhile, the top 20 TFs of the in vitro and in vivo core genes induced by AJSAF were predicted using the TRRUST database, respectively.

The microarray analysis revealed that AJSAF potentially activated the secondmessenger-mediated signaling (Figure  6A , B ) and regulated the ROS metabolic process (Figure  6G ). Therefore, the second messenger components and ROS generation in C2C12 cells were examined. AJSAF significantly and time-dependently increased the cAMP con-tents in C2C12 cells, which ascended at 0.5 h and peaked at 1 h (Figure  7A ). AJSAF also time-and concentration-dependently induced a significant Ca 2+ influx and ROS production in C2C12 cells (Figure  7B , C ). The transcriptome correlation analysis revealed that AJSAF regulated the MAPK cascade and protein phosphorylation in vitro and in vivo (Figure  6A , B ). Meanwhile, six hub genes were identified to be correlative with the ERK1 and ERK2 cascade. TRRUST predicted that the TFs such as CREB-binding protein (Crebbp) and Nfkb1 regulated AJSAFinduced core genes. Therefore, MAPK, NF-\u03baB, and CREB phosphorylation in C2C12 cells was detected using Western blotting. AJSAF markedly promoted JNK, ERK1/2, p38 MAPK, and CREB phosphorylation in C2C12 cells from 15 min to 2 h. However, AJSAF did not affect NF-\u03baB p65 phosphorylation in C2C12 cells (Figures  7D , E  and  S3 ). These results suggested that AJSAF activated second messenger-MAPK-CREB pathways.\n\nTo identify the role of second messenger-MAPK-CREB pathways in regulating the AJSAF-induced inflammation in C2C12 cells, an inhibition assay was performed. All BAPTA-AM, KG-501, SP600125, PD98059, and SB203580 dramatically repressed Il6, Cxcl1, and Cox2 mRNA expression levels in AJSAF-treated C2C12 cells (Figure  7F ). Moreover, the secretion of IL-6 and CXCL1 as well as protein expression of COX2 in AJSAF-treated C2C12 cells were also inhibited by BAPTA-AM, KG-501, SP600125, PD98059, and SB203580 (Figures  7G , H  and  S4 ).

      "text": "Although saponin adjuvants have been widely investigated for their use in vaccines, their mechanisms of action are poorly understood  [24] . A high concentration of adjuvant is generated at the local injection site after intramuscular vaccination, and the dominant cell population in contact with adjuvants is muscle cells. AJSAF was found to up-regulate both neutrophil-active (CCL3, CCL7, CXCL1, and CXCL5) and neutrophil-derived genes (CCL2, CCL3, and CCL4) in mouse quadricep muscles  [13] . In fact, many different chemoattractants with similar functions are usually present at sites of inflammation  [25] . In this study, AJSAF elicited a temporary cytotoxicity and inflammation in C2C12 cells (Figure  1 ). RNA-seq analysis showed that AJSAF induced 1438 DEGs in C2C12 cells (Figure  3A ). These DEGs were involved in cell proliferation, differentiation, migration, and death, as well as response to wounding and external stimulus (Figure  3D ). The core genes in C2C12 cells induced by AJSAF involved the cell chemotaxis, inflammatory response, cell death, cell migration, apoptotic process, cytokine activity, chemokine activity, and growth factor activity and were correlated with TNF signaling, PI3K-Akt signaling, MAPK signaling, and cAMP signaling (Figure  4C ). Similarly, AJSAF-induced core genes in mouse quadricep muscles were relative with the GO functions including inflammatory response, cell chemotaxis, cell migration, cell death, apoptotic process, chemokine activity, cytokine activity, and growth factor activity, as well as KEGG pathways such as TNF signaling, JAK-STAT signaling, MAPK signaling, and cAMP signaling (Figure  5C ). Moreover, both top 20 enriched terms of AJSAF-induced core genes in vitro and in vivo were co-regulated and associated with cell activation, cell death, granulocyte chemotaxis, inflammatory response, MAPK pathway, and second-messenger-mediated signaling (Figure  6A , B ). These results suggested that AJSAF induced similar in vitro and in vivo functions and pathways.\n\nThe transcriptomic analysis revealed that AJSAF potentially activated the second messenger-MAPK-CREB pathway in vitro and in vivo. Actually, a very early response was observed showing that the intracellular Ca 2+ , cAMP, and ROS levels peaked in AJSAFstimulated C2C12 cells within 2 h (Figure  7A-C ). These three second messengers could promote the phosphorylation of MAPK and activate the inflammasome  [26] [27] [28] . In this study, AJSAF significantly and rapidly induced the MAPK and CREB phosphorylation in C2C12 cells, especially ERK1/2 and CREB, reaching almost their peak at 0.25 h after stimulation. CREB is an important TF for mediating the immune-related genes containing a cAMP-responsive element, including Il2, Il6, Il10, Tnf\u03b1, and Cox2  [29] . Resident macrophages in healthy skeletal muscles regulate tissue homeostasis. CREB-C/EBP\u03b2 cascade induces the expression of M2 genes and promotes muscle injury repair  [30] . A previous study showed that AJSAF activated RAW264.7 macrophages to secrete IL-1\u03b2, TNF-\u03b1,"

In addition, CREB phosphorylation directly inhibited NF-\u03baB activation  [31] , which might explain why AJSAF did not affect NF-\u03baB p65 phosphorylation in C2C12 cells. Furthermore, the inhibition assay revealed that all Ca 2+ , ERK1/2, CREB, JNK, and p38 MAPK inhibitors could reverse the up-regulation of IL-6, CXCL1, and COX2 in the AJSAF-treated C2C12 cells (Figure  7F-H ).
