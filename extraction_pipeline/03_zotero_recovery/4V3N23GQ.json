  "title": "Impact of Bifrontal Home-Based Transcranial Direct Current Stimulation in Pain Catastrophizing and Disability due to Pain in Fibromyalgia: A Randomized, Double-Blind Sham-Controlled Study",
  "abstract": "This randomized, double-blind trial tested the hypothesis that 20 sessions of home-based anodal(a)-transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) (2mA for 20 minutes) bifrontal, with anodal on the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (l-DLPFC) would be better than sham-(s)-tDCS to reduce scores on Pain Catastrophizing Scale and disability-related to pain assessed by the Profile of Chronic Pain: Screen (primary outcomes). Secondary outcomes were depressive symptoms, sleep quality, heat pain threshold , heat pain tolerance , and serum brain-derived-neurotrophic-factor (BDNF). Fortyeight women with fibromyalgia, 30 to 65 years-old were randomized into 2:1 groups [a-tDCS (n = 32) or s-tDCS (n = 16)]. Post hoc analysis revealed that a-tDCS reduced the Pain Catastrophizing Scale total scores by 51.38% compared to 26.96% in s-tDCS, and a-tDCS reduced Profile of Chronic Pain: Screen total scores by 31.43% compared to 19.15% in s-tDCS. The a-tDCS improved depressive symptoms, sleep quality and increased the heat pain tolerance. The delta-value in the serum BDNF (mean post treatment end minus pretreatment) was conversely correlated with the a-tDCS effect in pain catastrophizing. In contrast, the a-tDCS impact on reducing the disability-related to pain at the treatment end was positively associated with a reduction in the serum BDNF and improvement of depressive symptoms, sleep quality and pain catastrophizing symptoms. Perspective: Home-based bifrontal tDCS with a-tDCS on the l-DLPFC are associated with a moderate effect size (ES) in the following outcomes: 1) Decreased rumination and magnification of pain",

      "text": "ibromyalgia is a chronic primary pain condition defined as diffuse pain associated with significant emotional distress related to functional disability.  44 It encompasses widespread pain and a persistent state of high reactivity that amplifies nociceptive stimuli.  29, 32, 66 Additional symptoms include fatigue, depressive symptoms, cognitive problems, sleep disturbances, and multisensory hypersensitivity.  29 Such dysfunctional symptoms might be aggravated in chronic pain, including somatization, helplessness, and catastrophizing.  66 Pain catastrophizing is a maladaptive emotional and cognitive response to pain characterized by a propensity to ruminate about it, magnify the threat associated with it, and feel helpless in the face of pain.  18, 60 According to a neurofunctional imaging study, pain catastrophizing is related to greater activity in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).  21 ncreased bilateral activation of prefrontal cortex (PFC), particularly the left-(l)-DLPFC, has been correlated with pain inhibition in healthy subjects experiencing prolonged acute pain stimulation.  37 In contrast, perceived control of pain was associated with activating the right-(r)-DLPFC.  2 While one functional neuroimage study in depressive disorders, found that hopelessness and negative emotional judgment are related to PFC left-right imbalance with a more pronounced hypoactivation in the left.  26 Hence, activation and deactivation of neural circuits in PFC might be related to maladaptive pain processes, where GABAergic neurons modulate neuronal activity. These circuits are also involved in pain's sensory, cognitive, and affective components. They participate in fine-tuning the balance between descending facilitation and descending inhibition of nociception via the periaqueductal gray and rostral ventral medulla -oblongata-spinal-cord axis.  14, 50 Thus, transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a promising therapeutic option to improve the inter-hemispheric balance, either when applied to the primary motor cortex or the DLPFC.  6, 61 However, the l-DLPFC offers a potential advantage to modulate neural networks on the interface between cognitive processing and pain regulation.\n\nThe impact of anodal-(a)-tDCS on clinical symptoms depends on the cortical area of stimulation and polarity of the current.  68 Anodal stimulation generally augments neuronal excitability, whereas cathodal stimulation produces the opposite effect.  38 tDCS modulates both gene and protein expression of brain derivate neurotrophic factors (BDNF).  20 In fibromyalgia, higher levels of BDNF have been associated with greater disinhibition in the descending pain inhibitory system  58  and with a lower pain pressure threshold.  67 Although the serum BDNF is a surrogate marker of neuroplasticity state, which might predict reducing pain score,  8  the results after tDCS in BDNF are mixed. So, it is impossible to disentangle tDCS effects from time effects and if they occur in specific pathways or are necessary to induce a clinical response.  10 n healthy volunteers the a-tDCS on l-DLPFC increased pain tolerance  38  and reduced the valence for negative emotional images.  46, 47 Also, it modulated pain correlates such as anxiety, depressive symptoms, and unpleasant sensation to a painful stimulus.  45 In fibromyalgia the a-tDCS on the l-DLPFC reduced pain,  8  improved cognitive performance,  42, 52  and increased heat pain threshold (HPT).  52, 57 Although the initial data suggest its possible benefits on emotional aspects associated with pain, there is a gap in the literature related to the impact of a-tDCS bifrontal selfadministered at home linked to pain catastrophizing and disability-related to pain (DRP) for daily activities. Thus, our purpose was to test the hypothesis that 20 sessions of anodal-(a)-DCS on the l-DLPFC and cathodal on the right (r)-DLPFC over 4 weeks would be better than a sham-(s)-tDCS to reduce the total scores on Pain Catastrophizing Scale (PCS) and DRP assessed by the Profile of Chronic Pain: Screen (PCP: S) (primary outcomes). Secondary outcomes were PCSdomains (rumination, magnification, and helplessness), PCP:S domains (severity, disability for daily activities and emotional], depressive symptoms, sleep quality, serum BDNF, HPT, and heat pain tolerance (HPTo)."

      "title": "Sample Size Justification",
      "text": "Sample size estimation was based on a previous study with a similar montage in patients with fibromyalgia.  8 his estimation was established using a 2-tailed hypothesis test for each of 2 primary outcomes (total scores in the catastrophizing pain scale PCS and total score in the disability due to pain scale [PCP:S]) for a randomized ratio into 2:1 to receive a-DLPFC versus s-DLPFC for type I error of 5% and a type II error 20%. The standard deviation (SD) used to estimate the effect size in each of the primary outcomes was the SD found in the s-tDCS in the previous study.  8 Considering that we used 20 tDCS sessions in this protocol, we based our estimate on half the effect size for the difference between treatment groups than observed in the previous study after 60 sessions of tDCS.  8 For an effect size (f) equal to .45 for treatment effect in the total score on PCS total by a standard deviation equal to 18.27, for this outcome, the estimated sample size was 42 subjects. For an effect size (f) equal to .5 for the treatment effect in the total score on PCP:S total by a standard deviation equal to 24.26, the estimated sample size was 34 subjects. To account that we have multiple outcomes, possible dropouts, and the possibility that the outcome measures would not be normally distributed, the final calculations included an increase of 12.5% in the total sample. Thus, the final sample size was 48 patients (32 in the a-tDCS vs 16 in the s-tDCS group)."

      "text": "The scalp electrodes were positioned according to the 10 to 20 system for EEG (F3 anode, l-DLPFC) and the cathode at r-DLPFC (F4). The treatment was for 5 consecutive days, for 4 weeks. For the active tDCS, the current applied was 2mA for 20 minutes.  8, 11 For sham conditions, the montage was the same as active tDCS. The ramp-up time of a-tDCS and s-tDCS stimulation was the 20 seconds for the current to go from 0 to 2 mA and a ramp-down time of 20 seconds. However, in the s-tDCS group, the device was programmed to offer 30 seconds of stimulation across the 20 minutes at the following time points: at the beginning, after 10 minutes, and 20 minutes. The device was programmed to automatically turn on and turn off at each one of these time points. We used this approach to blind the participant about the intervention they were receiving. The current was offered using 35 cm 2 electrodes coated with a vegetable sponge moistened with saline solution administered by 2 silicone cannulas coupled to the electrode. One biomedical engineer programmed the device to offer a fixed number of stimulation sessions, with a minimum interval between each consecutive session of 16 hours.\n\nTreatment protocol with tDCS at home: visits to the center, size of the cap and electrodes' position, training session, protocol compliance, appropriate use, and record of adverse effects a. Visits of volunteers to the center in the course of the protocol Visit 1: They came to the center to give their written formal consent, confirm the diagnosis, answer the sociodemographic questionnaire and other measures of baseline assessment, and receive information about the protocol.\n\nVisit 2: They made a training session on how to use the device at home and received the first treatment session.\n\nVisit 3: They came to the center after 4 weeks of tDCS at home when they did the assessment at treatment end and gave back the device. b. Procedures to choose the size of the cap and electrodes' position\n\n1) The researcher measures the head circumference, and he or she chose the size of the cap according.\n\nThere are 3 sizes of cap: small (38 cm x 55 cm), medium (39 cm x 57.5 cm), and large (40 cm x 59 cm). The cap has a Velcro strap attached to adjust the contact of the cap, ensuring the cap. The patients put the cap and check if the size cap could maintain sponges' contact with the scalp. The cap is to be neither tight nor loose but comfortable.\n\n2) The participants put the cap on their heads, and the researcher measured to localize the positions of the electrodes according to the 10 to 20 system for EEG.\n\n3) The researcher marked the region to fix the sponges on the F3 and F4 positions, according to the 10 to 20 system for EEG. 4) The electrodes from 35 cm 2 into were inserted on the vegetable sponges to deliver the current to the scalp. The electrodes were fixed inside the sponges so that the user cannot change the position and, thus, guarantee an accurate placement of the electrode to deliver the electric current during the stimulation."

(7) The research team member who gives instructions on how to use the device gave instructions for patients to access the step-by-step process for selfadministration of tDCS in the following link:  https://  youtu.be/3Wtji4esOGE ). Also, they were instructed to contact the research team if needed at any time.\n\nd. Sessions of tDCS at home: protocol compliance, appropriate use, and record of adverse effects They received instructions to choose a quiet time in their daily schedule to apply the treatment session.\n\n1) The first home-based session (2nd session overall) was under remote supervision. During the treatment period if they had some doubts or problems with the device, instruct them to accesses the team by What-sApp at any time.\n\n2) The researcher responsible for communicating with patients contacted them weekly by WhatsApp during the entire treatment period. 3) During the treatment sessions, the device registered a sampling of 1 mA and obtained the contact impedance. If the contact impedance is beyond the default predefined value for more than 5 seconds, or the current oscillation was more than 10%, the session was interrupted. 4) All sessions were recorded on the tDCS device software. This data portraits all sessions and is download at the treatment's end. Thus, based on these records, we checked the protocol compliance since they contain the hour of use, duration of each session, values of each session's current intensity, and contact impedance. 5) They received instructions to report adverse effect's diary immediately after the tDCS home session.\n\nTo maintain the research team's blinding, an engineer not involved in the patients' treatment downloaded the information registered in the software across treatment time.

      "text": "Pain Disability due to Pain and Pain Catastrophizing a. The 15-item Profile of Chronic Pain: Screen PCP:S is a selfadministered questionnaire that allows for quick identification of an individual's multidimensional pain experience. It was adapted to the Brazilian Portuguese version with a good psychometric profile.  13 his tool comprises 3 domains: severity, disability, and emotional burden. A pain severity index can be calculated by adding the scores on the pain severity items (4 items: possible range 0-30). These items comprise the frequency of any pain, the frequency of severe pain, average pain, and the most incredible pain intensity over the past 6 months. The 6 items assessing pain interference on patient function (disability), with 0 = never interferes to 6 = interferes daily. The 6 items assessing pain interference on patient function, with 0 = never interferes to 6 = interferes daily. The interference items ask how often pain interferes with such activities as hobbies, essential self-care, housework, relations with others, personal goals, etc. (6 items: possible range 0-36).\n\nEmotional burden items ascertain how often pain has caused the person to feel sad or depressed, anxious, angry, isolated, or to experience reduced enjoyment of life, with 0 = never to 5 = extremely often (5 items: possible score range 0-25). An accepted criterion to define disability related to pain is chronic or recurrent pain or discomfort causing restriction.  13, 63 Thus, we assumed that higher scores on the B-PCP:S indicated higher disability or functionality at work, at home, during social situations, and/or a higher emotional burden. The PCP:S total score ranges from 0 to 91 points. b. The PCS is a self-administered questionnaire that consists of 13 items to assess catastrophizing related to pain. It adapted to the Brazilian Portuguese version with a good psychometric profile.  54 It comprises 3 domains: helplessness, magnification, and rumination. Items are rated on a 5-point Likert-type scale in which both intensity and frequency information are represented, with the following 5 levels of response for each Likert item: (0) not at all, (1) to a slight degree, (2) to a moderate degree, (3) to a great degree, (4) and all the time. The 3 domains' scores are given by the sum of the corresponding items (magnification 6, 7, and 13; rumination 8-11; and helplessness 1-5 and 12). The PCS total score ranges from 0 to 52 points.\n\nPsychophysical Measurements, Depressive Symptoms, Sleep Quality, and Serum BDNF c. The HPT was assessed by quantitative sensory testing (QST) using a standardized protocol. The measure applies the method limits with a computer Peltierbased device thermode (30 \u00a3 30mm) attached to the skin on the mid-forearm ventral aspect. The temperature thermode was set at 32 degrees Celsius (\u00b0C), and it increased at a rate of 1\u00b0C/s to a maximum of 52\u00b0C. Each participant was instructed to push the button immediately at the moment the stimulation became painful. The HPT of each patient was defined as the means of 3 assessments performed with an inter-stimuli interval of 40 seconds. The mean of 3 HPT assessments was defined as the outcome. 53 d. HPTo is the maximal temperature that the volunteer can support. It was determined by the method of limits by the same device used to assess the HPT. The stimulus was applied to the ventral area of the midforearm. Participants were instructed to push a button when the pain became intolerable. To avoid injury by thermal stimulus, it stops automatically at 52\u00b0C. We performed only a single assessment of HPTo to avoid a possible sensitization effect by repetitive painful stimuli in patients with chronic pain, who might have a reduced pain tolerance. e. Beck Depression Inventory -Second Edition (BDI-II) is a self-application instrument composed of 21 items, whose objective is to measure the intensity of depression from 13 years old to the third age. There is no time limit for completing the protocol, but in general, the BDI-II requires between 5 and 10 minutes to complete. 25 f. Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) assesses sleep quality and disturbances over the last month. Its 7 components have internal consistency and a reliability coefficient (Cronbach's alpha) of .83. The score sum of 7 components yields the global score of PSQI, which ranges from 0 to 21. The highest score indicates the worst sleep quality. 5 g. Dosage of BDNF serum levels: Blood samples were collected at baseline and after the 20th session at the end of treatment. At the maximum time of one hour after collection, the blood samples were centrifuged, and the serum separated in .5 mL aliquots for further analysis. The BDNF serum levels were determined by sandwich ELISA using monoclonal antibodies specific for the neurotrophin (R&D Systems, Minneapolis) using the manufacturer's protocol.\n\nThe assayed the samples in duplicate to avoid intraassay variation. Two plates per kit were used over 2 different days, within the same week, to assess the inter-assay variation. Protocols follow the manufacturer's instructions. The Enzyme-linked Immunosorbent was used to determine serum BDNF. The lower detection limit for BDNF of the kit is 7.8 pg/mL. Assay (ELISA) using a ChemiKine BDNF Sandwich ELISA kit, CYT306 (Chemicon/Millipore, Billerica, Massachusetts,). Optical density was measured using an ELISA reader at a wavelength of 450 nm (GloMax-Multi Microplate Reader, Promega) or the Bio-Plex-200 instrument (Bio-Rad) for the multiplexing assay measurements. We used the standard to measure the total protein by the Bradford method, which uses bovine serum albumin. The data were expressed in pg/mg of protein.\n\nClinical Measurements: Central sensitization syndrome Symptoms, Anxiety, Pains Score, and Analgesic Use\n\nAll tests used in this study have been validated for the Brazilian population. To evaluate the quality of life was used the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire . To assess anxiety was used the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory .  33 he pain intensity was assessed with a 10 NPS. The NPS ranged from no pain (0) to the worst possible pain (10).\n\nPatients answered the following question using the NPS: 1) Considering your pain, how intense your worst pain was during last week?\n\nThe severity of symptoms related to central sensitization syndrome was assessed by the Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI).  12 The CSI consists of 25 items (total score 0-100) assessing physical symptoms, emotional distress, headache and/or jaw symptoms, and urological symptoms. This scale allows a rapid tracking of symptoms associated with central sensitization to guide therapeutic strategies and indicate prognostic factors. Higher scores indicate a higher degree of selfreported symptomatology. The cutoff point for the CSI to define the SSC's presence is a score greater than 40, with a sensitivity of 81% and a specificity of 75% to detect subjects with SSC.  43 For the analysis, we used the score as a continuous variable.\n\nDemographic data and medical comorbidities were evaluated using a standardized questionnaire. We used the Systematic Assessment for Treatment questionnaire to assess the side effects of tDCS.\n\nSupplementary analgesia use: They could use additional analgesic medication (acetaminophen, ibuprofen, or tramadol) to relieve their pain if necessary. They might use 500 mg of acetaminophen up to 4 times per day (QID) at maximum QID as rescue analgesia. If their pain persisted, they could use Dorflex (Sanofi Aventis, S\u00e3o Paulo, Brazil; 35 mg of orphenadrine citrate combined with 300 mg of dipyrone and 50 mg of caffeine) at maximum 3 times per day (TID). In the case that their pain persisted, patients could use tramadol at maximum TID."

The models included the factor the treatment group (a-tDCS or s-tDCS) used to analyze the main effect on the primary outcomes (pain catastrophizing and disability due to pain) and their subscales assessed after the 20th session. To control the intraindividual variability, we compared the effect of treatment between groups in the primary and secondary outcomes by the mean differences (delta[D]-values, at treatment end minus baseline]).  39 Pairwise comparisons calculated the main effect of the predicted marginal mean differences between interventions.\n\nIn an exploratory analysis, we examined factors associated with the treatment's effect on improving the primary outcomes (pain catastrophizing and disability due to pain). The covariates included in the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) were the delta (D)-values of depressive symptoms in the BDI-II, (D)-values of sleep quality in the PSQI, and serum variation BDNF assessed by the delta (D)-values. We used this approach based on the delta (D)-values since it recognized that psychophysiological measures show high individual variability upon a stimulus of the same intensity. We considered all the randomized patients as part of the analysis, using the intention-to-treat method (ITT), with the last observation carried forward. The criteria defined to ITT were previously restricted to subjects who had received at least 25% of total protocol sessions, in the case 5 sessions.  36 Effect size (E.S.) was computed by the standardized difference mean (SDM) (mean difference a-tDCS vs. s-tDCS)/pool of baseline standard deviation (S.D.)]. The E.S. was interpreted as follows: small if lower than .20 to .49; moderate if between .50 and .79; and large if larger than .80.  34  All analyses were adjusted for multiple comparisons by the Bonferroni's test, and they were performed with 2-tailed tests at the 5% significance level. The data were analyzed using SPSS, version 22.0 (SPSS, Chicago, IL)."

The dependent variables in the generalized hierarchical model were the \u0394-value of primary outcomes (pain catastrophizing thinking and disability due to pain).

The covariates were retained in the model if they showed a statistically significant association with the dependent variables. The results are presented in Table  4 . It is important to realize that we are comparing \u0394-value (score postminus pre). Thus, a more negative value indicates a larger change, in other words, a more significant effect. The improvement in the pain catastrophizing was positively associated with the reduction in the depressive symptoms. In contrast, the treatment effect was more pronounced in those patients who showed larger variation in serum BDNF, in the sense that a higher serum level at the treatment end was related to lower scores in the catastrophizing pain scale. While the improvement in disability due to pain was positively associated with both improved sleep quality and depressive symptoms.

The cumulative incidence of headache, neck pain, mood swings, and concentration difficulties was reported 10% and 4% of a-tDCS and s-tDCS, respectively. Most side effects were classified as mild, even in the patients that decided to stop the treatment due to a burning sensation.\n\nWe measured adherence by counting the number of completed sessions as verified by the records on the software. The a-tDCS number of sessions administered mean (SD) was18 (3.03); median 20; IQ25-75 = (10; 20) and s-tDCS mean (SD) 19.43(1.98), median 20; IQ25-75 = (14; 22).

      "text": "These findings reveal that the a-tDCS on the l-DLPFC with cathodal on the r-DLPFC produced a top-down effect of considerable magnitude on primary outcomes related to pain catastrophizing and disability due to pain in the ITT analysis. Additionally, they provide evidence of the a-tDCS benefits to improve secondary outcomes classified as exploratory, such as depressive symptoms, sleep quality, and increased HPTo.\n\nAs far as we know, this is the first study to produce evidence about the impact of the bifrontal tDCS with a-tDCS on the l-DLPFC self-applied at home to modulate the pain sensitivity and the emotional aspects related to pain. Nominally, the a-tDCS improved the domains of magnification and rumination of the PCS. At the same time, we found a-DCS benefits to reduce the PCP:S score related to the severity and emotional burden due to pain. These findings point to the DLPFC as an essential region to modulate the pain experience. They find support in the meta-analysis that found a moderate size effect (.54) in pain due to fibromyalgia with the a-tDCS applied in the l-DLPFC.  68 Likewise, an earlier study in healthy subjects showed that DLPFC stimulation modulates the functional connectivity (FC) of sensory and affective networks.  51 Also, cumulative data show that anodal l-DLPFC has a beneficial impact on other symptoms related to maladaptive emotional functioning assessed by the SSS score of ACR-2016. Such effects include a reduction in depressive symptoms according to studies in patients with a depression diagnosis,  9  improved both working memory,  52  and cognitive functions (eg, decision-making).  17 Also, these findings are consistent with previous studies that showed that painrelated activity within the bilateral DLPFC is negatively correlated with pain catastrophizing.  55 lthough the a-tDCS on l-DLPFC has been targeted in the cortical modulation of pain, it remains unknown how the montage of tDCS can affect structures' function  involved in sensory-affective pain information. Earlier studies found that the bifrontal DLPFC stimulation primary modulates FC of both sensory and affective networks, whereas the M1 stimulation modulates FC of sensory networks.  51 Also, the study found greater FC changes by DLPFC bifrontal tDCS was associated with a larger effect to improve pain tolerance.  51 Although our study was not designed to compare the impact of different montages on the clinical outcomes, these findings revealed that the bifrontal tDCS with anodal on l-DLPFC produced an effect with a possible clinical relevance on sensory and emotional pain aspects. According to the literature, this effect can be related to improving the imbalance inter-hemisphere, specifically hypoactivity in the l-DLPFC and hyperactivity in the r-DLPFC. Thus, this top-down control can improve biased information processing toward negative stimuli,  24, 26, 29  and such effects can explain the improvement of catastrophizing thinking related to pain and depressive symptoms.\n\nAlthough we observed a lack of a statistically significant difference in the mean of \u0394-the value of serum BDNF between a-tDCS and sham, a more substantial decrease in serum BDNF from pre-to post-treatment was associated with a significant reduction in disability due to pain (see Table  4 ). Although the changes in the peripheral BDNF might not reflect a direct effect of the a-tDCS, the current findings suggest that the BDNF is a surrogate marker of the state of neuroplasticity that mediates the tDCS effect in the clinical outcomes.  31 hese results find support in a previous study in which the value of cerebral spinal fluid changes BDNF after 2 preoperative sessions of a-tDCS on the M1 was  conversely correlated with the DRP at the end of the first postoperative week.  48 In the same way, other earlier clinical trials in fibromyalgia found that the baseline BDNF predicted the a-tDCS on the l-DLPFC in work memory  52  and the home-based a-tDCS effect on the l-DLPFC in the pain scores.  8 According to this data set, a-tDCS effects on pain processing depend on the neuroplasticity state, which is assessed indirectly by serum BDNF.\n\nIn contrast the \u0394-value of pain catastrophizing was conversely associated with \u0394-value of BDNF. This result indicates that the change of these measure was in the opposite direction. At present, we do not have an explanation for this converse relationship. However, we need to consider that this neurotrophic factor controls a broad spectrum of processes, sometimes exerting opposite effects in the brain, which can be explained based on the specific pattern of its synthesis, with several biologically active isoforms that interact with different types of receptor, finally initiating numerous signaling pathways.  35 According to pre-clinical study,  59  tDCS was able to decrease BDNF levels in the spinal cord and in the brainstem, there were no changes in hippocampus BDNF levels, which may indicate that tDCS activates specific pathways (ie, descending systems) and does not cause general brain activation. Another factor that can be involved in the relationship between changes of BDNF and the tDCS effects is the polymorphism of BDNF since the Met allele is associated with reduced cognitive performance, which suggests decreased brain plasticity.  49 This hypothesis is plausible since in fibromyalgia Val/Val genotype showed higher levels of magnification and rumination of PCS dimensions.  3 he tDCS effect on sleep quality improvement agrees with a recent randomized placebo-controlled trial that demonstrated that 20 consecutive daily sessions of frontal transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) improved the PSQI score.  65 This effect on subjective sleep measures after tDCS was found in healthy  56  and clinical populations.  1, 65 Notably, these studies found improvements in sleep quality with DCS montages that stimulated frontal and/or motor areas. Although the mechanism is not clear, neuroimaging methods identified that cortical topography of slow waves during sleep is primarily associated with activity in a core set of cortical areas mainly located in the PFC and motor regions.  40, 41 ccording to Table  4 , a larger reduction in the score PCP: S was associated with higher sleep quality improvement.\n\nAccording to what was shown in a meta-analysis, the effects of a-tDCS on the HPTo are supported by an extensive number of studies using tDCS to decrease pain.  15 Although in most studies of meta-analysis, the site to apply the a-tDCS has been the M1, our results suggest that a-tDCS over the l-DLPFC might affect the sensory-discriminative pain processing related to tolerance. This effect might involve placebo analgesia in downstream circuits to the anterior insula, anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) hypothalamus, and the PAG.  64 nother hypothesis is that a-tDCS on DLPFC modulates the dorsal part of the premotor cortex, which sends its output to the M1 and spinal cord.  30 Thus, our findings might be explained by a modulatory effect on the corticospinal pathway.  62 They also agree with a previous study with fibromyalgia, where the a-tDCS on l-DLPFC improved HPTo.  57 However, we did not find improvement on HPT related to the tDCS effect. This result supports an earlier study with healthy volunteers who assessed the tDCS effect in pain scores by painful electrical stimuli.  16 Also, they agree with another trial in fibromyalgia with the same montage used at home-based.  8  In contrast, another study in fibromyalgia with a-DCS over l-DLPFC and cathodal supra-orbital improved the HPT.  57 The findings' inconsistencies across studies might be related to sample characteristics, such as clinical and healthy subjects, the number of tDCS sessions, etc. This differential effect related to pain might be related to the pain threshold assessment method since the HPT by the QST is a sensitive approach to identify dysfunction in small peripheral sensory fibers, which are part of dysfunction found in fibromyalgia.  7 Thus, these questions likely influence the pain threshold, and they should be considered in further studies.\n\nIn the interpretation of these results, some methodological aspects and limitations should be borne in mind. First, these findings support the use of bifrontal tDCS with a-tDCS over the l-DLPFC to improve fibromyalgia symptoms. However, we did not compare with different stimulation sites and different parameters, including frequency, current, and duration of the treatment. Second, we included only females to avoid the confounding effect of sex based on the following reasons: 1) There is vast literature related to sex differences in pain sensitivity,  4  and fibromyalgia is more prevalent in women. 2) Women showed a higher medial prefrontal activation under nociceptive stimuli  28  and higher inhibition of the descending pain modulating system than males.  23 3) Incipient data indicate that females are prone to developing a long-term depression (LTD) effect by tDCS longer than men.  52 Third, we used a rigorous and replicable methodology that evidenced the effectiveness and the feasibility of t-DCS at home, as attested by adherence rate higher than 85% of sessions applied in both a-tDCS and s-sham tDCS. Fourth, the adverse events observed in our study are like previously reported in trials of tDCS.  11, 22, 27 Despite local skin reactions, patients did not correctly guess the assignment to tDCS.\n\nIn conclusion, these findings revealed the efficacy of home-based self-applied a-tDCS on the l-DLPFC and cathodal on the r-DLPFC reduced both pain catastrophizing and disability due to pain in fibromyalgia. Also, our results revealed that the a-tDCS improved sleep quality, depressive symptoms, and that the tDCS effect in disability due to pain is associated with decreased serum BDNF."
