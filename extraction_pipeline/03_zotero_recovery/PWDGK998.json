  "title": "Identifying Game-Based Digital Biomarkers of Cognitive Risk for Adolescent Substance Misuse: Protocol for a Proof-of-Concept Study",
  "abstract": "Background: Adolescents at risk for substance misuse are rarely identified early due to existing barriers to screening that include the lack of time and privacy in clinic settings. Games can be used for screening and thus mitigate these barriers. Performance in a game is influenced by cognitive processes such as working memory and inhibitory control. Deficits in these cognitive processes can increase the risk of substance use. Further, substance misuse affects these cognitive processes and may influence game performance, captured by in-game metrics such as reaction time or time for task completion. Digital biomarkers are measures generated from digital tools that explain underlying health processes and can be used to predict, identify, and monitor health outcomes. As such, in-game performance metrics may represent digital biomarkers of cognitive processes that can offer an objective method for assessing underlying risk for substance misuse. Objective: This is a protocol for a proof-of-concept study to investigate the utility of in-game performance metrics as digital biomarkers of cognitive processes implicated in the development of substance misuse. Methods: This study has 2 aims. In aim 1, using previously collected data from 166 adolescents aged 11-14 years, we extracted in-game performance metrics from a video game and are using machine learning methods to determine whether these metrics predict substance misuse. The extraction of in-game performance metrics was guided by literature review of in-game performance metrics and gameplay guidebooks provided by the game developers. In aim 2, using data from a new sample of 30 adolescents playing the same video game, we will test if metrics identified in aim 1 correlate with cognitive processes. Our hypothesis is that in-game performance metrics that are predictive of substance misuse in aim 1 will correlate with poor cognitive function in our second sample.",

      "text": "Despite existing evidence-based interventions, many adolescents continue to misuse substances  [1] . In 2021 alone, over 1 in 5 adolescents aged 12-17 years misused substances (illicit drugs and alcohol or tobacco products)  [2]  and 2 million adolescents had a substance use disorder  [2] . Adolescent substance misuse, defined as \"the unhealthy use of alcohol or drugs to relieve stress, alter reality or bring about pleasure\"  [3] , increases the risk of developing a substance use disorder. Adolescents with substance use disorders are more likely to engage in criminal activity, contract sexually transmitted infections, develop comorbid mental disorders, and die early  [4] . In addition, between 2019 and 2020, there was a 44% increase in drug-involved deaths among adolescents aged 10-19 years  [5] . The negative consequences arising from substance misuse underscore the need to identify at-risk adolescents early to deliver timely prevention and treatment interventions.\n\nLess than 10% of adolescents in need of substance use treatment receive it  [6]  in the setting of poor screening uptake and referral for treatment  [7] . Many adolescents with substance misuse are not identified early, and barriers in screening adolescents for substance misuse contribute to this. The American Academy of Pediatrics and the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration recommend universal screening to identify at-risk adolescents. Yet, fewer than half of primary care providers  [8]  and fewer than a fifth of School-Based Health Center providers  [9]  screen adolescents for substance misuse  [8, 9] . Identifying at-risk adolescents early and delivering effective prevention interventions can prevent substance misuse-associated morbidity and mortality  [10, 11] . Barriers to screening adolescents for substance misuse include the lack of time, concern that adolescents will not be forthcoming about misuse, discomfort with conducting screening, and difficulty with providing a confidential space to conduct screening  [8, [12] [13] [14] [15] . Innovative solutions that address or mitigate these barriers and lead to early identification of at-risk adolescents are urgently needed.\n\nDigital tools hold great potential to mitigate identified barriers in screening for substance misuse given the ubiquity of mobile devices. These digital tools can be accessed anywhere and include mobile phones, wearables such as smart watches or Fitbits, mobile or web-based apps, and game software. Serious games-\"games designed for a primary purpose other than play\"  [16] -are frequently used by over 95% of adolescents  [17] . Serious games are increasingly being used for delivering health interventions among adolescents  [18, 19]  and, more recently, are also being used for assessment of mental health outcomes  [20, 21] . During gameplay, in-game metrics reflective of performance in the game are being collected by the game software  [18, 22] . These metrics may reflect digital biomarkers of health outcomes  [22] .\n\nDigital biomarkers are \"consumer-generated physiological and behavioral measures collected through connected digital tools that explain, influence or predict health-related outcomes\"  [22, 23] . Although most studies investigating the utility of digital biomarkers for health screening and monitoring have focused more on data collected from mobile phones  [24, 25]  and wearables  [26, 27] , games offer another source of data that could potentially measure digital biomarkers  [22] . In-game performance metrics  [18] , such as the amount of time to complete a game task, accuracy of choices in a game task, or style of gameplay (ie, choosing a game task without attention to outlined rules), may reflect cognitive processes such as working memory, processing speed, and inhibitory control  [22] . These cognitive processes (working memory and inhibitory control) affect in-game performance and can therefore be measured using in-game performance metrics  [28, 29] . Deficits in working memory  [30, 31]  and inhibitory control  [32]  are also associated with substance misuse among adolescents  [33]  and may explain by up to 33% of the variance in future risk of substance misuse  [33] . As such, in-game performance metrics may reflect digital biomarkers of cognitive function, which may be used in predicting adolescents at risk for substance misuse. Digital biomarkers have been used to predict health risk among adults  [34, 35]  and adolescents  [25, 27] . Prior studies have also investigated the utility of digital biomarkers for a range of psychiatric disorders  [24, 26, 34, 36, 37] . In these studies, the digital biomarkers captured were primarily from phone or wearable sensors and included measures such as movement, location, sleep, heart rate, and social interaction through call or text logs  [24] [25] [26] [27] 34, 37] . Although games are increasingly being used for measuring health outcomes such as cognitive function  [38] , their utility as digital biomarkers is yet to be widely investigated. In addition, all of the studies that have investigated the utility of game-based digital biomarkers have focused on adults  [21, 39, 40] . A study by Dechant et al  [39]  demonstrated that participants with social anxiety exhibited in-game behavior that was different compared to participants without social anxiety. Specifically, participants with social anxiety were more likely to have their avatar stand at a larger distance to nonplayer characters in the game. In another study by Gielis et al  [40] , they investigated the utility of in-game performance metrics to identify adults with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Adults identified as having MCI took more time to think about a move and made more errors in the game compared to adults without MCI.\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, we are not aware of any studies that have investigated the utility of game-based digital biomarkers for adolescent substance misuse. Given the easy access to games and the high level of motivation and engagement with games among adolescents  [17, 41, 42] , game-based digital biomarkers hold promise for risk identification among adolescents. The use of games as a screening tool could also mitigate barriers in screening since these games can be deployed without supervision and can be completed in private. In addition, prior studies have indicated that adolescents are more forthcoming when completing digital screeners compared to provider interviews and prefer this form of screening  [43] . Finally, future apps of game-based screening and monitoring tools could integrate with the electronic health record to make results readily accessible to providers."

Adolescents will be grouped in 2 groups-high and low risk for substance misuse-based on their baseline responses to questions about substance misuse behaviors (eg, \"in the past 30 days, have you used cannabis?\" and \"How sure are you that you can refuse if a friend offers you alcohol and you do not want it?\"). We will have 2 prediction tasks (substance misuse and self-efficacy to refuse drugs). For each task, we will identify an effective prediction model by testing 6 machine learning classification models (eg, logistic regression, random forest, decision trees, support vector machine, gradient boosted decision tree, and neural networks). We will assess the feasibility of using a logistic regression model to compute a digital biomarker score for each adolescent that ranges from 0 to 1, where an adolescent with a higher score has a higher substance misuse risk."

PlayForward includes 12 Challenge Stacks or levels (the narrative and story-based components of the game) and 5 minigames (People Sense, Refusal Power, Me Power, Priority Sense, and Know Sense). Each of the minigames has 10 levels. The minigames are designed to help the adolescent develop and practice adaptive skills-such as learning to say no to an invitation to use drugs-that can be translated into real life. Players earn stars and points during gameplay, which allow them to advance in the game. PlayForward was tested in a randomized controlled trial of 333 adolescents, aged 11-14 years, where 166 adolescents were assigned to play the PlayForward video game  [19] . At baseline, self-report data on substance misuse and self-efficacy to refuse drugs were collected. During gameplay, data related to their performance in the game (Table  1 ) were collected by the game software and later stored as log files. The game developers (Schell Games) developed reference files for decoding information stored in the log files."

We have identified 285 in-game performance metrics (eg, the number of times the player lost the minigame; Multimedia Appendix 1). One of the authors (SK) extracted all identified in-game performance metrics from log files into a CSV file and uploaded this into R statistical software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing)  [46] . In-game performance metrics that are found to predict substance misuse risk following analysis will be identified as digital biomarkers for adolescent substance misuse risk.\n\nIn total, 2 outcomes (described in the assessments section below)-substance misuse and self-efficacy-to refuse drugs will be used in 2 prediction models. Based on adolescent baseline response to questions on substance misuse and self-efficacy to refuse drugs in a previous study  [19] , a substance misuse score and self-efficacy to refuse drugs score have been derived. For each score, adolescent participants are categorized into 2 groups (high risk and low risk) based on the score distribution. A preliminary examination of the log files of the 166 participants who played the PlayForward game resulted in dropping 6 log files due to file errors. As such, analysis of aim 1 will occur with a final sample of 160 participants."

As such, scores could range from 0 to 30, and higher scores meant lower self-efficacy to refuse drugs. In this sample of 160 adolescents, scores ranged from 0 to 27 with a mean of 2.38 (SD 4.40).\n\nAdolescents were grouped into 2 groups (high risk and low risk) based on the score distribution.

      "text": "Machine learning models  [49]  will be used to predict each outcome. We will use k-fold cross-validation  [50]  to evaluate the performance of 6 machine learning classification models (logistic regression, random forest, decision trees, support vector machine, gradient boosted decision trees, and neural networks) to predict each of the outcomes. These 6 models are representative of a range of popular classification models that have been previously used in substance use research  [51] . These models vary in their underlying mathematical approaches and often offer reasonable to good performance across a variety of data sets. For example, while regression models are easy to implement, the underlying assumption is that predictors are independent  [51] . Decision trees on the other hand do not require elaborate preprocessing but perform relatively worse than other models  [51] . Support vector machine performs well using unstructured data but requires extensive tuning  [51] . The primary evaluation metric used will be the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve  [50] . For each outcome, the model with the AUROC value closest to 1 is the one that has the best ability to discriminate between risk classes, across all classification threshold levels ranging from 0 to 1  [50] .\n\nIdeally, an AUROC value of greater than 0.7 can be achieved by the best model. We will also report the sensitivity and specificity for a range of classification thresholds. In the event that AUROC values are similar across candidate models, it may be useful to identify the best model as the model that offers the most appropriate trade-off between sensitivity and specificity, even if the AUROC value of that model may not be the highest  [50, 52] . Existing screening tools for substance use have sensitivity ranging from 0.71 to 0.94 and specificity ranging from 0.87 to 0.97  [53, 54] . As such, to identify an adolescent at risk for substance misuse, we want to achieve comparable sensitivity and specificity above 0.7. Given the risk of negative outcomes such as an overdose that can occur with adolescent substance misuse, a model that produces a higher sensitivity compared to its specificity would be consistent with existing recommendations for substance use screening tools  [53] . For the best model identified for each outcome, we use Shapley additive explanations  [55, 56]  to explain the relative importance of the features used to predict the outcome class (ie, high risk vs low risk). We will define features (ie, predictor variables used to inform the classification) from in-game performance metrics. When selecting features to be used for classification, the variance threshold method will be used to remove features with 0 (or low) variance because they are unlikely to be useful for discriminating between classes  [49] . We will reduce multicollinearity between features by selectively removing a subset of highly correlated features before performing classification  [49] . In addition, we will assess in-game metrics for multicollinearity and drop in-game performance metrics with a variable inflation factor larger than  10 [57] ."

For aim 1, we completed cleaning of in-game log files in preparation for data extraction. In total, 166 log files were initially available for data extraction. Following data cleaning, 6 files were excluded for reasons such as the data storage files were corrupted, the data structure of log files was different from the rest of the files, and it was impossible to determine the reason for this difference. As such, a final sample of 160 is being used for analysis. The number of extracted in-game performance metrics is 285 (Multimedia Appendix 1). The R software  [46]  was used in extracting metrics from game log files, and codes are being stored on GitHub. Analyses are currently underway. For aim 2, data collection is ongoing and is projected to end in February 2024. Currently, we have enrolled 12 participants. Data analysis for aim 2 will begin once data collection is completed. The results from both aims will be reported in a subsequent publication, which we expect to publish in the winter of 2024."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "Adolescent substance misuse is a predominant public health problem. However, most adolescents at risk for substance misuse are not identified early  [78] . Early identification of high-risk adolescents can inform the delivery of targeted interventions that prevent the development of negative outcomes. However, identifying adolescents at risk for substance misuse is not routinely done due to a myriad of factors. Although mobile phones and wearable devices have been used to identify and measure digital biomarkers for health outcomes  [24] [25] [26] [27] , the use of games is less widely studied. The use of game-based assessment for mental health purposes has been on the rise and may be used to capture potential biomarkers of health outcomes that can be used for screening and monitoring  [22] . The use of games for risk identification offers a promising solution as these can be deployed without the need for provider supervision, can offer privacy to the adolescent completing the game-based screener, and has benefits over self-report data as it would provide a more objective assessment of risk.\n\nIn this proof-of-concept study, we will test the utility of in-game performance metrics-digital biomarkers-to identify adolescents at risk for substance misuse. We will also test the hypothesis that adolescents with poor cognitive function will perform worse in the game and be at higher risk for substance misuse. We will be assessing aspects of cognitive function that are implicated in the development of substance misuse and impacted by substance misuse. We build on prior studies that have successfully used game metrics to measure cognitive function  [38, 40]  and extend prior knowledge in the field by applying it to substance misuse. Games offer an engaging way to assess a wide range of factors among adolescents, most of whom play games  [17] . This study has several strengths. To the best of our knowledge, we will be the first to test the utility of in-game performance metrics to be used as digital biomarkers of substance misuse. We will also be the first to investigate game-based digital biomarkers in an adolescent population.\n\nThis study has several limitations. We are using a game that was not initially designed to measure cognitive function. As such, the game metrics may be poor representations of working memory and inhibitory control. However, other studies have demonstrated that performance metrics collected in a game could be useful in predicting cognitive functions  [38, 40] . We are using a game that is designed to change behavior related to substance use risk. As such, this game may not be ideal as an assessment tool since the tools' predictive ability may wane with repeated use in the setting of positive behavior change. However, other studies have documented that even games designed primarily for assessment can change cognitive processes in ways that can threaten the validity of the game-based tool  [79, 80] . We chose to use this game-based intervention due to the availability of existing data for this proof-of-concept study, which, if successful, will provide preliminary data for future development of a game-based assessment tool for substance misuse risk. Another limitation is that the initial sample on which the prediction model will be trained has a low prevalence of substance misuse. This imbalance may limit the performance of the prediction models to predict substance misuse. To address this, we will use data augmentation methods such as Synthetic Minority Oversampling\n\nTechnique  [81] . In addition, our eligibility criteria for aim 2 will allow us to recruit a sample of adolescents with higher risk for substance use than in aim 1, which may enhance the performance of the model.\n\nDespite limitations, this study represents a novel and likely highly impactful examination of the use of digital games as not only interventions but also potentially as screening and data collection tools. If found to be successful in predicting substance use, it will inform the future design of game-based assessment tools for substance misuse risk. With their broad level of reach and high engagement, games could seamlessly provide data on adolescent substance misuse risk and help to close the gap in screening and early intervention, leading to improved health outcomes in adolescents."
