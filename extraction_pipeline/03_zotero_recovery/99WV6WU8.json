  "title": "What is the effect of mobile phone text message reminders on medication adherence among adult type 2 diabetes mellitus patients: a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials",
  "abstract": "Background Globally, type 2 diabetes has become increasing. As little is known about the effect of educational intervention on this population, this systematic review and meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of mobile phone text message reminders versus usual care to improve medication adherence among type 2 diabetes mellitus patients. Methods PubMed, Google Scholar, Cochrane Library, Scopus, and African Journals Online, were searched. A randomeffects model was employed to estimate combined effect sizes. Subgroup analyses were employed to investigate possible sources of heterogeneity between studies. The overall certainty of the evidence was evaluated using the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development, and Evaluation approach. Results A total of 9 trials with 1,121 participants were included in the review. The pooled estimated impact of mobile phone text message reminders on medication adherence was (SMD: 0.36; 95%CI; 0.14, 0.59) compared to usual care groups among patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus. In addition, subgroup analyses revealed greater medication adherence levels in those studies with intervention durations of more than six months and with self-report/refill adherence scale measurement (SMD: 0.21; 95%CI: 0.02, 0.40) and (SMD: 0.45; 95%CI: 0.22, 0.68), respectively. \n Conclusion Mobile phone text messages can potentially lead to improved medication adherence levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes despite heterogeneity across the studies. Therefore, mobile phone text messaging when delivered in addition to usual care, have the potential to produce significant improvements in medication adherence.",

      "text": "Diabetes mellitus (DM) has become a widespread noncommunicable health problem, resulting in significant morbidity and mortality  [1] . About 422 million adults worldwide live with DM  [2] . The International Diabetes Federation estimates that about 629 million people will be affected by 2045  [3] . About 80% of the affected people live in low-income countries  [4] . In particular, type 2 diabetes (T2DM) accounts for more than 90% of all diabetes cases  [5] . The increased burden is due to multiple risk factors such as physical inactivity, obesity, unhealthy diet, physical inactivity, family history, age  [6, 7] , and oxidative stress  [8] .\n\nMedication non-adherence is one of modern medicine's significant health challenges; poor medication adherence is associated with increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs. [9] . Improving adherence to medications for T2DM patients would help to maximize the clinical benefits for the wider population  [10] . There is, therefore, considerable scope for increasing adherence to prescribed medicine, thereby reducing morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs.\n\nTelemedicine can be a strategy for closer monitoring and intervention to achieve better metabolic control and help in the global care of individuals with concomitant chronic diseases  [11] . Text messaging is increasingly used in medical practice to remind patients of clinic appointments, to report test results, and to adjust treatment doses  [12] . In addition, text messages can help remind patients to take their medications, recognize who is not taking them and why, if any, and provide appropriate advice in such cases  [13] .\n\nThe use of text messages is vital for improving diabetes treatment adherence and glycemic control  [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . Therefore, mobile phone-based interventions are of particular interest, given their low cost and potential for widespread delivery. However, no systematic review has specifically examined the effect of mobile phone text message interventions on adherence to medications for T2DM. Hence, the present review and meta-analysis aimed to evaluate the effect of mobile phone text message interventions on medication adherence in patients with T2DM."

Next, we assessed the overall risk of bias. We considered a study: to be at high risk of bias when at least one domain was judged as being at high risk, to be at low risk when all domains were judged as being at low risk and to raise some concerns when at least one domain was judged to raise some concerns. However, no domains were judged as being at high risk of bias. Any disagreement was resolved through discussion and consensus, and if required, we consulted a third review author (AM)."

      "text": "We found nine randomized control trials that evaluated the effect of text messaging interventions on medication adherence in participants with T2DM. Studies generally have a low risk of bias regarding random sequence generation and incomplete outcome data. Allocation concealment was described in 2 of the included studies  [27, 28] , resulting in a low risk of bias due to allocation concealment. Five studies  [15, 17, 25, 27, 28]  described blinding participants and personnel as having a low risk of bias. Outcome assessors were reported to have a low bias risk in three studies  [17, 25, 28] . Most of the studies  [16, 17, 25, [27] [28] [29] [30]  described a low risk of bias for incomplete Fig. 6 Subgroup analysis based on the duration of intervention Fig. 7 Publication bias among included studies\n\noutcome data using an intent-to-treat analysis. In the review, two of the nine included studies  [15, 30]  demonstrate some concern about the possible risk-ofbias judgments to selective reporting.\n\nAuthors found that mobile phone text messaging interventions had a favourable effect on medication adherence in patients with T2DM, with significant improvement in medication adherence by 0.36% when nine studies were pooled together in a meta-analysis. The body of evidence relating to the effect of mobile phone-based interventions on anti-diabetic medication adherence was a moderate level of evidence. Pooled analysis of nine trials showed a paramount benefit for medication adherence for interventions delivered through educational and motivational text messages about T2DM. The studies were conducted in different areas of the globe and provided reasonable confidence in the applicability of results across settings.\n\nOur finding of evidence for the effects of mobile phone text message-delivered interventions to increase adherence to medication prescribed for T2DM is consistent with one meta-analysis determining the effectiveness of short message service intervention to improve glycated hemoglobin control and medication adherence in T2DM  [31] . Similarly, this finding is consistent with a systematic review of diabetic self-management education and support apps interventions to improve medication adherence from slight to moderate effects  [32] . However, one systematic review examining RCTs of monitoring and messaging interventions targeting medication adherence to managing type 2 diabetes found no evidence of improvements in medication adherence in their pooled meta-analyses of five trials  [33] .\n\nOur finding showed that pooled analyses of interventions delivered by text messaging indicated moderate benefits with statistical significance. Our findings were consistent with the findings from trials using a short message system alone targeting adherence to cardiovascular disease medication, which also report small benefits of mobile phone text interventions  [34] . Medication adherence is essential for maximizing the effectiveness of pharmaceutical therapy  [35] . It is known that improved medication adherence may have also influenced glycemic control  [36] . Nevertheless, future research must confirm the association between medication adherence and HbA1c levels. The distinct advantages of text messaging over other interventions are simplicity and ease of administration, often in an automated fashion using a computerized program  [37] .\n\nThe finding of the subgroup analysis showed that medication adherence improved significantly after six months of intervention. This implies that we are unable to suggest the effectiveness of mobile phone-based interventions for short-term adherence to medication prescribed for T2DM. Only one study found the longest intervention\n\nTable 2 Summary of findings the effect of mobile phone text message interventions compared to usual care --SMD 0.36 SD higher (0.14 higher to 0.59 higher) *The risk in the intervention group (and its 95% confidence interval) is based on the assumed risk in the comparison group and the relative effect of the intervention (and its 95% CI) CI: confidence interval; SMD: standardized mean difference GRADE Working Group grades of evidence High certainty: we are very confident that the true effect lies close to that of the estimate of the effect Moderate certainty: we are moderately confident in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be close to the estimate of the effect, but there is a possibility that it is substantially different Low certainty: our confidence in the effect estimate is limited: the true effect may differ substantially from the effect's estimate Very low certainty: we need more confidence in the effect estimate: the true effect is likely to be substantially different from the estimate of effect period for medication adherence out of the studies was 24 months; therefore, it is difficult to predict the effect of longer interventions. Further research is required to shed more light on the long-term effect of mobile phone text message interventions on medication adherence. This is the first systematic review and meta-analysis of the effectiveness of mobile phone text messaging in improving medication adherence among T2DM. Future studies would consider the following limitations. First, we have limited papers to those written in English. Second, the authors did not include individuals with type 1 diabetes, gestational diabetes mellitus, or prediabetes. Third, the long-term effects of text messaging on medication adherence could not be examined due to the short duration of the trials included in the analysis. Fourth, in some studies, the level of medication adherence was selfreported; this would raise the possibility of reporter bias. Fifth, it is likely that these interventions would require adaptation for different settings, and it needs to be clarified what behavior change techniques, or combinations of them, are effective. Finally, many confounding factors might influence the patients' adherence that we are not maintaining in this review, such as age, sex, duration of diabetes, educational level, cultural background, and socioeconomic class."

      "text": "Our review examined the effectiveness of mobile phone text message reminders/intervention and found an excellent positive effect on T2DM medication adherence. These findings can have important implications for everyday practice and policy, particularly during pandemic times or when healthcare resources are stretched, as novel methods of healthcare delivery in remote and contactless ways become increasingly necessary. Mobile phone text message interventions hold promise in improving adherence. However, implementation and long-term sustainability need to be considered.\n\nOur findings suggest possible effectiveness, but our review did not find any studies that reported affordability/cost-effectiveness or how interventions may impact equitable access to T2DM treatment and management. However, the evidence demonstrated from previous analyses of mobile-based interventions in other fields showed inexpensive once systems are set up. Furthermore, compared to other digital interventions, mobile phones are widely prevalent in modern society; short text message interventions are likely more affordable and easily accessible to the general population, including remote and rural populations, as mobile phones are ubiquitous across low-, middle-, and high-income countries. In addition, mobile phone text message interventions may reduce access barriers such as lack of transportation, inability to get time off work, medical consultation costs, and finances.\n\nMobile phone interventions should be considered part of the more comprehensive health service delivery. Future mobile phone-based interventions should consider the context and needs of the population, for example, literacy, phone use, use of other services, and what behavior change techniques delivered by mobile phones are likely to be effective. For example, it is not given that people deemed illiterate in a classic reading and writing context cannot benefit from text message interventions as they may still be capable of understanding text messages. Hence, policymakers and other concerned bodies should design appropriate implementation guidelines to improve medication adherence using mobile phone text messages as a care package."
