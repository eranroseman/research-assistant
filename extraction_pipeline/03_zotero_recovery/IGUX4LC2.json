  "title": "Effect of using drug management application on drug adherence and outcomes in older adults with polypharmacy: a randomized clinical trial study",
  "abstract": "Background Adherence to complex drug regimens and polypharmacy are among the challenges of old age, which may negatively affect their motivation to continue drug therapy or lead to incorrect drug administration. The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of using a drug management application on drug adherence and outcomes in polypharmacy older adults. \n Methods In this randomized clinical trial study conducted in 2022, 192 Iranian older adults with polypharmacy were selected according to the inclusion criteria and allocated to case and control groups using the block randomization method. The data collection tools included a demographic questionnaire, drug outcome questionnaire, and Morisky Medication Adherence Scale. The intervention was done using a drug management application for 8 weeks. The collected data were entered into the SPSS software version 22 and analyzed using descriptive (frequency, percentage, mean, standard deviation) and inferential (Chisquare, Fisher's exact test, independent t-test) statistics. \n Results The case and control groups were homogeneous in terms of demographic variables and drug adherence level before the intervention. A signi cant difference was found in the drug adherence level after using the app (p < 0.001). Moreover, a signi cant difference was found in drug outcomes, including rehospitalization due to disease aggravation, re-hospitalization due to medication error, falling, hypo or hypertension, and hypo or hyperglycemia, and medication use accuracy between the groups after the intervention (p < 0.05). \n Conclusion The results showed that using a drug management application that meets the speci cations of older adults can improve drug adherence and reduce the adverse outcomes of drug use.",

      "text": "Population ageing has turned into one of the most important public health challenges in recent years, a phenomenon that has affected Iran at a higher speed compared to other countries ]1]. Ageing is associated with changes in different body organs. In this period of life, chronic diseases threaten the elderly person's health so that the elderly population is the largest drug consumer in different societies  [2] .\n\nUnder these circumstances, the elderly should take complex drug regimens for their treatment process leading to a phenomenon known as polypharmacy. There are different de nitions for polypharmacy; however, it most commonly refers to daily using ve medications or more  [3] . Polypharmacy is extensively prevalent in different societies, for example, its prevalence is about 36% in England where older adults above 65 years constitute one-fth of the population  [4] . The mean prevalence of polypharmacy is 23.1% in Iranian older adults [32.7% in women and 15.2% in men)  [5] . This phenomenon is associated with adverse consequences, including; drug interactions, medication error, increased side effects, re-hospitalization, falling, functional and cognitive disorders, imposing nancial burdens on the health care system, and nally disability and death. Polypharmacy has a direct relationship with reduced physical activity, motion disorder, decreased appetite, and depression in the elderly, and may seriously affect their medication adherence and quality of life  [6] .\n\nMedication adherence is one of the challenges associated with polypharmacy in the elderly population.\n\nEffective medication adherence reduces treatment costs, accelerates the recovery process, stops disease progression, and prevents re-hospitalization  [7] . The personal factors related to drug non-adherence are divided to two categories of intentional non-adherence including self-drug discontinuance and unintentional non-adherence including problems such as forgetfulness, visual impairment, and inability to move, among which forgetting is a very important cause of poor medication adherence  [8] . A study on 24000 Iranian elderly patients showed that 62% of them forgot to take their medications  [9] . Poor drug adherence is associated with worsening of the elderly patient's health condition, increased hospitalization period, and risk of disease progression, disability, and death  [10] .\n\nTechnology advances have opened new horizons for management of chronic diseases and improvement of health care services. The use of the mobile phone facilitates the monitoring of the treatment process and health care providers-receivers' relationship  [11] . Today, mobile health is one of the most up-to-date types of health care interventions that can play an effective role in promoting the health of older adults. Mobile health apps have features such as; messaging, alarms, and reminders. These features can be used to overcome problems such as forgetfulness and are the most popular strategy among technologybased strategies for drug use management  [12] . In this regard, the Medisafe app was designed to monitor the older adults' blood pressure. The results showed that medication adherence improved and blood pressure fell in the normal range in patients in intervention group. As another case, the AlerHTA app was used to promote education and remind time of drug use. The results showed a signi cantly higher medication adherence in the elderly patients in the intervention group  [13] . Nonetheless, in some cases, the designed apps failed to achieve their objectives completely. For example, in one study, no signi cant difference was observed in blood pressure control between elderly patients in case and control groups after using an educational app  [14] .\n\nHowever, many apps that are designed for the general population are not customized for useing by the elderly, which comprise a large population with various health needs. Therefore, little interaction is observed between them and these apps  [15] . Most of older adults suffer from impaired vision and hearing and have touch problems for using smartphones, which are usually ignored in designing these apps. Moreover, the apps designed for older adults are usually in languages other than Farsi, rendering them practically useless for Iranian older adults. Persian drug reminder apps only remind the time of medication use and have failed to meet elderly needs. Ease of use, interesting user interface, font adjustment capability, and use of appropriate warm colors to compensate vision impairment are among the factors that should be considered in designing a suitable app for this age group. In other words, a drug management app should be designed in such a way that even those that are only able to read and write can use it  [16] .\n\nSince the available apps do not meet the older adults' needs for medication use management due to their special conditions, they need an app that has the highest congruence with their physical and mental conditions. A review of the literature suggests that the above items are not considered in the available apps. Therefore, it was decided to design an app that has the highest congruence with their needs. Furthermore, there are contradictory data regarding the effectiveness of drug management apps in promoting drug adherence and its associated consequences. Therefore, a clinical trial study was conducted to evaluate the effect of using drug management app on drug adherence and outcomes in polypharmacy adults."

      "text": "A randomized clinical trial study was conducted in April-June 2022. The research population consisted of older adults presenting to a hospital in Tehran, Iran. This hospital is a prominent health center for the geriatric population. The inclusion criteria were age above 60 years, daily intake of more than 5 types of drugs, ability to read and write, ability to communicate with, having a smartphone, and a positive history of cardiovascular disease diabetes, hypertension, or COPD. The exclusion criteria were a history of cognitive diseases, use of expensive and hard-to-nd drugs, a positive history of special hard-to-treat diseases like cancer, use of injection drugs, unwillingness to participate in the study, and death. To calculate the sample size, for an intervention that could reduce the subjects with poor adherence by 20% with a con dence interval of 95% and power of 80%, 86 samples were needed in each group. Considering a loss to follow-up of 10%, 96 samples were needed for each group (Fig.  1 )  [17] .\n\nTwo hundred and fourteen older adults were evaluated for inclusion and exclusion criteria, of whom 192 were found to be eligible and were assigned to case and control groups using block randomization method with a block size of 4. The allocation sequence was generated using  www.randomization.com .\n\nAn opaque envelope was used for allocation concealment. At the time of enrollment, according to the order by which the participants entered the study, one of the envelopes was opened in order and the allocation group was determined. The primary outcome was medication adherence and the secondary outcome was the drug outcomes experienced during the study. Medication adherence was measured before and eight weeks after the intervention. The data collection tools were a demographic questionnaire, a researcher-made drug outcomes questionnaire, and the Morisky Medication Adherence Scale. The demographic questionnaire was used to collect data on age, sex, marital status, education level, income su ciency, disease, method of information acquisition about the consumed drug, and how to use mobile phone. The Morisky Medication Adherence Scale was developed to evaluate medication adherence by  Morisky et al in 2008 [18] . This scale was translated to Persian according to the Iranian culture and validated by Kooshyar et al  [19] . This scale contains eight questions. Response categories are yes/no for the rst seven items with a dichotomous response and a 5-point Likert response from never to always for the last item. A score < 6 indicates low adherence, a score of 6 to < 8 shows moderate adherence, and a score of 8 represents high adherence  [18] . Pedersini et al examined the validity and reliability of the scale in diabetic patients in 2014 and reported a correlation e cient and Cronbach's alpha of 0.68 and 0.62, respectively  [20] . In addition, the pill count method was also used to assess medication adherence  [21] . A drug outcomes questionnaire made by the researcher was used to measure the occurrence of each complication resulting from incorrect medication use, including re-hospitalization due to disease recurrence, re-hospitalization due to medication error, falling from the bed at home, hypo or hypertension, and hypo or hyperglycemia. Face and content validity methods were used to determine the validity of the questionnaire."

It's time for your drug\" was designed for Iranian older adults in Persian language for the rst time. The comments of geriatric experts in this eld were used in the design phase. To nd the possible aws and ensuring its correct function on mobile phones, it was installed on the mobile phones of 10 elders. After receiving the nal con rmation and obtaining informed consent, the app was installed on the mobile phones of the participants in the intervention group. Face-to-face training on using the app was offered to each participant in a 60-minute session and medication use alarms were set. During the intervention, the participants could contact the researcher through the phone number that was given to them to ask their questions. The participants in the control group received the routine care of the health center including periodical visits to evaluate the treatment process and required care."

During the intervention, 4 patients were excluded from the control group (3 due to death and 1 due to unwillingness to continue the study); moreover, 4 patients were also excluded from the intervention group (2 due to death and 2 due to unwillingness to continue the study). Finally, the data of 92 cases and 92 controls were analyzed (Fig.  2 ).\n\nDemographic ndings showed that the participants mean age was 69.02 \u00b1 5.61 and 68.5 \u00b1 95.26 years in the control and intervention group respectively, indicating no signi cant difference (p = 0.926).

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "The present study was conducted to evaluate the effect of using a drug management app on drug adherence and outcomes in polypharmacy adults. The results showed that using an app customized for the special conditions of the older adults improves medication adherence. In line with the results of the present study, Naja et al conducted a study to investigate the effect of using a mobile phone-based application on medication adherence in patients with heart failure during three months. The results showed a signi cant increase in the medication adherence score after using the app. Medication adherence changes were more signi cant in the intervention group compared to the control group, indicating improved medication adherence in people with heart failure after using the app  [23] . The results of the above study were consistent with the results of the present study, suggesting the positive effect of drug management apps on improved medication adherence. Santo K conducted a study to determine the effect of medication reminder applications on drug adherence in patients with coronary heart disease in three months. The primary outcome was the medication adherence level and the secondary outcomes were the blood pressure and cholesterol levels. The mean score of medication adherence was signi cantly higher in app users compared to the control group, which is similar to the present study  [24] . In another study, Li et al evaluated the effect of a smartphone application on medication adherence in 24 polypharmacy patients with a mean age of 59.5 years for one year in Australia. In this study, the participants in the intervention group were the users, which offered medication regimen details and educational messages. The participants were required to report each time they took a medication via the app. The control group received routine care including routine visits. Both groups were evaluated three times, including one, three, and twelve months after the intervention. The results showed a 4.37 times higher improvement in the medication adherence in the intervention group compared to the control group in the third assessment  [25] . Although Li et al did not exclusively focus on older adults and the participants age range was 18-75 years, its results were consistent with the results of the present study, indicating improved medication adherence in drug management app users.\n\nBaghei et al studied the effect of a mobile educational application on medication adherence in hypertensive older adults. Comparison of the mean scores of medication adherence components showed signi cant differences in commitment to treatment and hesitation in implementation of treatment between the two groups while no signi cant difference was observed in the blood pressure status between the intervention and control groups after the intervention. However, in the present study, blood pressure alterations reduced signi cantly in the intervention group compared to the control group; therefore, the results are not consistent. This difference may be due to the follow-up duration. However, it can be concluded that mobile app education can improve medication adherence in older adult app users  [14] . Habib et al conducted a study to improve medication adherence following hospital discharge using a mobile application in Canada. This study was conducted on 49 patients with a mean age of 64.6 years assigned to two groups. The patients were followed for 30 days' post-discharge. During the follow-up period, they were evaluated for medication adherence and re-hospitalization. At the time of discharge, the app was installed on the mobile phones of the patients in the intervention group. According to the results, the medication adherence rate was 83.7% in the intervention group and 77.8% in the control group, indicating no signi cant difference  [26] . Although it seems that the results of the above study and our study are not consistent, the reason may be the short follow-up time of this study. Moreover, in this study, only 65.2% of the patients in the intervention group used the app, which could be due to reasons such as failure to design an appropriate app for this group and lack of proper training for its use or not being user friendly.\n\nThe results of the present study showed that using the drug management app reduced adverse drug outcomes including re-hospitalization due to disease aggravation and medication error, falling, hypo or hypertension, hypo or hyperglycemia, and medication use accuracy according to the pill count method. In this regard, Park et al conducted a study to determine the effect of using digital health monitoring on readmission reduction in patients with health failure in the United States. This study was carried out on 58 patients and the readmission rate was measured during 30 days. The results showed that the overall 30-day readmission rate was 10% in these patients, while the mean readmission rate was 25% across the country indicating a signi cant reduction  [27] , which was consistent with the results of the present study suggesting that the use of new technologies in the health care system causes a signi cant reduction in the re-hospitalization rate. Although Habibi et al found no signi cant difference in medication adherence between intervention and control groups, the readmission rate was 8.7% and 15.4% in the intervention and control group respectively indicating the positive effect of the intervention on the re-hospitalization rate, which is consistent with the results of the present study  [26] . Furthermore, Sartori et al conducted a study to evaluate the effect of educational intervention using the WhatsApp platform on medication adherence in hypertensive and diabetic patients. In the intervention group, the participants received training in the form of audio, image, or video messages with a focus on increasing medication adherence via the WhatsApp while the control group received the routine care. Data analysis 16 weeks after initiating the intervention showed no signi cant difference between the two groups  [28] . The results of this study are not consistent with the results of the present study and the use of WhatsApp could not lead to a signi cant difference between the two groups. This difference in the results may be due to differences in the structures of these apps, including ease of use and observance of delicate considerations required for older adults regarding using the app, which were carefully implemented in designing the app in the present study. Chandler et al investigated the impact of mobile phone use on treatment adherence in hypertensive patients in the United States. Three months after using the app, treatment adherence improved markedly in the intervention group while no change was observed in the control group. The ndings showed a signi cant reduction in systolic and diastolic blood pressure in the intervention group compared to the control group  [29] . The results of this study are consistent with the results of the present study; as mentioned earlier, the designed app reduced blood pressure alterations in the intervention group in the present study.\n\nFinally, Athilingam et al conducted a study to evaluate the effect of enhanced self-care using mobile technology on reducing readmission in patients with congestive heart failure. The results showed that the patients in the intervention group were not readmitted during the 30 days of the study compared to the control group. The preliminary results showed the potential effectiveness of the app in reducing readmission and improving self-care in heart failure patients  [30] , which was similar to the results of the present study. Nonetheless, the sample size was much larger in the present study compared to the above study, which improves the generalizability of the results.\n\nConsidering the Covid-19 pandemic in Iran and the sensitive conditions of older adults, it was di cult to make the necessary arrangements for participation of the elders in the introduction session, which included various topic such as the objective of the study, using the app, and completing the questionnaire. To address this problem, the participants were grouped into different groups, and Covid-19 related protocols including social distancing, face mask use, and disinfection were strictly observed."

      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "The results of the present study showed using the drug management application was a bene cial, costeffective method for improving medication adherence, reducing readmissions, preventing blood pressure and blood sugar alterations, or promoting correct drug use in polypharmacy older adults. The use of health application designed according to the needs and capabilities of the target group improve the patients' control over their disease and helps them prevent adverse drug outcomes, which can threaten their lives, through promoting correct drug use, ensuring a healthy, high-quality old age. One of the main objectives of the health care systems is to promote the quality of life, prevent an increase in costs, and reduce the economic burdens caused by different population groups. The results of the present study showed that medication adherence improvement reduced adverse outcomes like readmission. Therefore, it is possible to improve medication adherence, prevent adverse drug outcomes, reduce the burden of care, and improve the quality of life of older adults through policy making to educate this population on new technologies so that they can employ them to manage their health condition effectively."
