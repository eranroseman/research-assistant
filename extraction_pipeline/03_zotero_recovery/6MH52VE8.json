      "text": "We included four randomised controlled trials involving 182 participants.\n\nFor the primary outcome of health outcomes, including physiological measures, there is moderate quality evidence from two studies involving people with diabetes showing no statistical difference from text messaging interventions compared with usual care or email reminders for glycaemic control (HbA1c), the frequency of diabetic complications, or body weight. There is moderate quality evidence from one study of hypertensive patients that the mean blood pressure and the proportion of patients who achieved blood pressure control were not significantly different in the intervention and control groups, and that there was no statistically significant difference in mean body weight between the groups. There is moderate quality evidence from one study that asthma patients receiving a text messaging intervention experienced greater improvements on peak expiratory flow variability (mean difference (MD) -11.12, 95% confidence interval (CI) -19.56 to -2.68) and the pooled symptom score comprising four items (cough, night symptoms, sleep quality, and maximum tolerated activity) (MD -0.36, 95% CI -0.56 to -0.17) compared with the control group. However, the study found no significant differences between the groups in impact on forced vital capacity or forced expiratory flow in 1 second.\n\nFor the primary outcome of capacity to self-manage the condition, there is moderate quality evidence from one study that diabetes patients receiving the text messaging intervention demonstrated improved scores on measures of self-management capacity (Self-Efficacy for Diabetes score  (MD 6.10, 95% CI 0.45 to 11.75) , Diabetes Social Support Interview pooled score (MD 4.39, 95% CI 2.85 to 5.92)), but did not show improved knowledge of diabetes. There is moderate quality evidence from three studies of the effects on treatment compliance. One study showed an increase in hypertensive patients' rates of medication compliance in the intervention group (MD 8.90, 95% CI 0.18 to 17.62) compared with the control group, but in another study there was no statistically significant effect on rates of compliance with peak expiratory flow measurement in asthma patients. Text message prompts for diabetic patients initially also resulted in a higher number of blood glucose results sent back (46.0) than email prompts did  (23.5) .\n\nFor the secondary outcome of participants' evaluation of the intervention, there is very low quality evidence from two studies that patients receiving mobile phone messaging support reported perceived improvement in diabetes self-management, wanted to continue receiving messages, and preferred mobile phone messaging to email as a method to access a computerised reminder system.\n\nFor the secondary outcome of health service utilisation, there is very low quality evidence from two studies. Diabetes patients receiving text messaging support made a comparable number of clinic visits and calls to an emergency hotline as patients without the support. For asthma patients the total number of office visits was higher in the text messaging group, whereas the number of hospital admissions was higher for the control group.\n\nBecause of the small number of trials included, and the low overall number of participants, for any of the reviewed outcomes the quality of the evidence can at best be considered moderate."

      "text": "Many people suffer from long-term conditions such as asthma or diabetes. To make living with the long-term illnesses as easy as possible, people have to regularly monitor the symptoms of their conditions and adapt their lifestyles. This review studied whether mobile phone applications such as Short Message Service (SMS) (also known as text messaging) and Multimedia Message Service (MMS) can support people to better manage their long-term illnesses by sending medication reminders or supportive messages, or by offering a way for people to communicate important information to their healthcare providers and receive feedback.\n\nWe found moderate quality evidence that under some conditions these types of applications may indeed have some positive impacts on the health status of patients with diabetes, hypertension and asthma, and on their ability to manage their own condition, although for some outcomes no significant effect was observed. In two studies, there was very low quality evidence that participants evaluated the mobile phone messaging support positively. Also, in two studies, there was very low quality evidence that: there was no difference in health service utilisation by diabetes patients receiving text messaging support and those who did not (one study); and that asthma patients receiving text messages visited the doctor more often but were admitted to hospital less often than those not receiving the messages (one study).\n\nBecause of the small number of patients involved in these studies the evidence is not very strong. Furthermore, the usefulness and potential negative consequences of mobile phone messaging over extended periods of use for self-managing long-term conditions are not yet known. One study f ound no statistical dif f erence on glycaem ic control between groups receiving the intervention or usual care.

      "text": "(2 studies)\n\nMobile phone messaging is an important means of human communication globally. Mobile phone penetration is rapidly increasing, particularly in the Asia Pacific region, with 90% of the global and 80% of rural population having access to a mobile network in 2010. The number of subscriptions in 2010 reached 5.3 billion, representing a 76.2% global penetration rate (ITU 2010). The penetration rates are 70% to 90% in high-income countries, with a similar rate of increase across all socio-economic groups (Atun 2006). Most digital mobile phones provide Short Message Service (SMS), also known as text messaging, and Multimedia Message Service (MMS) for transmitting graphics, video clips and sound files. SMS, in particular, has rapidly developed into a powerful communication medium, particularly among young adults. The total number of text messages sent globally tripled between 2007 and 2010, from an estimated 1.8 trillion to 6.1 trillion, with about 200,000 messages sent every second (ITU 2010). These short messages, where up to 160 characters of text are sent from the Internet or from a mobile phone to one or several mobile phones, could provide an important, inexpensive medium of communication.\n\nThe terms text message, text, or txt are more commonly used in North America, the UK, Spain and the Philippines, while in many other countries the term SMS is used. In this review we will use the term 'text messaging' to refer to the use of SMS only, distinguishing it from the term 'mobile phone messaging', which encompasses both SMS and MMS. Increasingly, the latter term also refers to mobile email and 'instant messaging' delivered to the mobile phone.\n\nText messages, compared to other communication channels, have the advantage of instant transmission and low cost. There is also a smaller chance of being misplaced compared to print materials, and of being invasive to daily lives compared to phone calls  (Kaplan 2006) . Features such as ubiquity, mobility, direct and instantaneous access and direct communication offer the possibility of using mobile phones for health information transfer  (Atun 2006) . A literature review on the use of mobile phones in health care has demonstrated the wide application and potential of mobile phones to: increase access to health care; enhance efficiency of service delivery; improve diagnosis, treatment and rehabilitation; and support public health programmes  (Atun 2006; Car 2012) . Mobile phone messaging has, for example, been used to provide appointment reminders  (Bos 2005) , to improve patient compliance with medications  (Fairley 2003; Marquez Contreras 2004; Vilella 2004) , to monitor chronic conditions  (Ferrer-Roca 2004; Kwon 2004; Ostojic 2005)  and to provide psychological support  (Bauer 2003; Franklin 2006) . Mobile phones have also been used in managing communicable diseases and in health promotion programmes (e.g. in smoking cessation  (Obermayer 2004; Rodgers 2005) ). Furthermore, the use of mobile phones has been shown to improve service utilization among population groups such as teenagers and young adult males who do not typically use health services, by providing the opportunity to remotely access care providers for advice (Atun 2006b). However for older adults, some of whom are less able or willing to use mobile phones, the effect on service utilization could be limited (Atun 2006b).\n\nChallenges in using mobile phone applications in health care include incomplete coverage of mobile networks across regions, lack of standards, and possible information overload (Adler 2007).\n\nThis review is part of a series of four reviews which aim to determine the effects of mobile phone messaging in improving the processes of healthcare service delivery and service utilization.\n\nWe divided the reviews into four areas based on specific interventions and related outcomes:\n\n\u2022 Mobile phone messaging for facilitating self-management of long-term illnesses (this review);\n\n\u2022 Mobile phone messaging for communicating results of medical investigations (Gurol-Urganci 2012);\n\n\u2022 Mobile phone messaging for preventive health care (Vodopivec-Jamsek 2012);\n\n\u2022 Mobile phone messaging reminders for attendance at healthcare appointments  (Car 2012) ;"

      "title": "Description of the condition",
      "text": "Long-term diseases such as diabetes, asthma, heart disease and human Immunodeficiency virus (HIV) affect people's lives over a long period of time. They usually place a substantial burden on the health, economic status, and quality of life of individuals, families and communities. Given that a significant proportion of healthcare resources is utilised by people with long-term conditions, policy makers give high priority to the effective management of these conditions. It has been suggested that, in order to improve the quality and effectiveness of long-term disease management, a systematic approach is needed, comprising proactive healthcare systems and an active role for patients in self-managing their disease  (Yanez-Cadena 2006) . There is strong global interest in the role of self-management programs in controlling and preventing long-term disease complications  (Bodenheimer 2002; Bodenheimer 2002b; Bodenheimer 2002c; Foster 2007) . For instance, the United Kingdom (UK) Department of Health issued a policy document in 2005 recognising support for self-care as one of the three pillars of the National Health Service (NHS) and social care long-term conditions model  (DoH 2005) . The term 'self-management' of a long-term illness refers to the tasks a person can perform to minimise the impact of that illness on his/her health status by him-/herself, or with the support of a healthcare provider  (Clark 1991) . These tasks can be classified into medical management, emotional management or role management tasks  (Corbin 1988) . Typically, self-management of a longterm illness requires that a person has the skills to self-monitor the symptoms and clinical markers of that condition, to understand the associated implications, and to adjust medication, treatment or behaviour accordingly  (Barlow 2002; Corben 2005) ."
    },
    {
      "title": "Description of the intervention",
      "text": "Communication between patient and healthcare provider plays an important support role in both disease monitoring and education. For example, care providers can send patients reminders to self-monitor or attend to their care; or patients can send messages to their provider reporting the results from self-monitoring  (DoH 2005) . Communication to support self-management can take a number of forms, such as face-to-face conversations, phone conversations or phone messaging. The communication of selfmonitoring results or reminders typically does not require the exchange of lengthy or complex information, and phone messaging therefore presents an interesting new delivery medium for such messages. Relevant interventions provide disease-related information to patients, support self-monitoring of illnesses, support adherence to treatment or medications or both, or offer a channel for peer-to-peer networking and support through SMS or MMS."
    },
    {
      "title": "How the intervention might work",
      "text": "Mobile phone messaging interventions can be used to: enhance self-efficacy (e.g. reminders, feedback on treatment success); provide a form of social support (from peers and health professionals); or establish social networks (support groups, peer-to-peer networks). By increasing self-efficacy  (Bandura 1977; Bandura 1982)  and providing support mechanisms  (Cohen 1985; Cobb 2002; Christakis 2004 ), these interventions may influence health behaviours and enhance self-management of long-term illnesses. Text messaging can be beneficial in this context by providing patients or their carers with information on their condition, by monitoring of illness, by promoting improved adherence to treatment and/or medications, or as a channel of peer-to-peer networking and support. In particular, text messaging can be an important source of support to people in remote locations and to those with mobility issues. Text messaging may facilitate education on selfmanagement problem solving skills, and in this way enhance patient confidence to carry out the behaviours necessary to reach a desired goal. For instance, Anh\u00f8j and colleagues describe a small study in Denmark in which asthma patients were sent four daily text messages that included a medication reminder as well as requests to send back peak flow measurements, data on sleep loss, and medication dosage  (Anh\u00f8j 2004) . These data were entered in an online asthma diary to facilitate communication between patients and their doc-tors, and to aid in the development of an individual patient-based treatment plan. In another small trial of an intervention for asthma patients, patients sent daily text messages with peak flow data to an asthma specialist who once a week adjusted their therapy accordingly  (Ostojic 2005) . The study concluded that text messaging (when supplemented by a written action plan and standard follow-up) was a convenient, reliable, affordable, and secure means to help asthma control. In Ferrer-Roca 2004, diabetic patients used text messaging to send data on blood glucose levels and body weight to a web-based database. In response they received help or warning messages if the recorded measurements were out of range for that individual patient, as well as monthly calculated glycosylated haemoglobin results, leading to improved self-management in elderly persons and teenagers. 'Sweet-Talk', a text-messaging support system for paediatric patients with Type 1 diabetes, was also successful in improving self-efficacy for young people who are harder to reach in healthcare settings  (Franklin 2003; Franklin 2006) . Similar positive results were recorded for adolescents with type 1 diabetes in Rami 2006, although with some technical problems due to data loss, which resulted in patient dissatisfaction. Several studies describe the use of text messaging for sending medication or treatment reminders. In a study involving 26 primary healthcare centres in Spain, people with hypertension received medication reminders for compliance with therapy in the form of text messages. However, no significant improvement was observed in the intervention group  (Marquez Contreras 2004) . In another study, HIV-infected patients aged 16 to 24 were sent text message reminders for highly active antiretroviral therapy. Although these reminders were found to be helpful, and the level of daily intrusion was seen as acceptable, the study period of 12 weeks was not adequate to assess their full impact  (Puccio 2006) . Continuous support from healthcare providers, peers and the community can be critical in conditions with a high risk of relapse, such as bulimia nervosa. In Germany, text messaging was used to send bulimic patients who had finished inpatient treatment, weekly individually-tailored feedback messages  (Bauer 2003) . This type of support was found to be well-accepted, practical and effective. In another site, however, there was limited acceptance of a text message intervention in the after-care of bulimic patients who had received outpatient psychotherapy  (Robinson 2006) ."
    },
    {
      "title": "Acceptability and risks of the intervention",
      "text": "Studies in which patients and/or providers rated text messaging for promoting disease self-management positively, noted features of simplicity and timeliness of the intervention  (Ferrer-Roca 2004; Pinnock 2006 ). On the other hand, some skepticism was reported regarding clinical benefits, time and cost implications  (Pinnock 2006) . Possible disadvantages of using mobile phone messaging include the risk of inaccurate data input  (Norwell 2003) , lack of understanding or misinterpretation of the information, and difficulties in reading for those with poor vision or literacy problems. Furthermore, mobile phone messaging is intended to support or complement the process of care delivery, rather than to substitute for it. A narrow focus on the technology may result in providers misinterpreting it as an endpoint to their responsibilities within the care delivery process, believing that their work is completed once the message is sent. This may result in inadequate follow-up of patients after the intervention. Additionally, text messaging cannot capture the verbal and non-verbal cues that may also influence the interpretation of the message. The psychological and social impacts of using the mobile phone in this way are other key issues. Having correct patient contact information and securely-stored health records are essential to meet privacy, confidentiality and data protection requirements. Failures or delays in mobile phone message delivery are rare but possible; however, harm is unlikely as senders are usually notified instantly in cases of a transmission problem. There may be additional monetary and time costs, as backup systems may be needed. Lastly, risks associated with mobile phone messaging in general may apply, for instance increased risk of car accidents as a result of messaging whilst driving."

In all studies participants were ambulatory patients attending primary and/or secondary health facilities. The target group for the intervention varied: the studies on diabetes were targeted to youth and young adults  (Franklin 2006; Hanauer 2009) ; Marquez Contreras 2004 targeted hypertensive patients aged over 18 years; and, though not explicitly targeted to a specific age group, Ostojic 2005 included primarily young adults (mean age 24.6 \u00b1 6.5 years) with a diagnosis of moderate persistent asthma.

One study involved two-way communication between patients and an automated system, whereby the system generated reminders for blood glucose monitoring that were sent to the patient at a specified time, either by text message or by email. Patients then returned their blood glucose results to a central system, and in response received automatically generated messages with feedback and, if the blood glucose value was out of the desired range, appropriate care recommendations (Hanauer 2009). In addition, patients could opt to daily receive two random short messages: one with diabetes-related information and one with unusual fun facts or trivia (unrelated to diabetes). Lastly, Ostojic 2005 involved twoway communication between patients and healthcare providers whereby patients used text messaging to send daily asthma selfmonitoring results to a central database, and healthcare providers would personally review the results and provide weekly feedback and advice."

The software used to support the SweetTalk intervention was developed in close collaboration between users, researchers and software developers in an iterative, user-centred design  (Waller 2006) . Collected peak expiratory flow results from asthma patients were analysed with Asthma Center 0.90 software (Polimedika d.o.o., Zagreb, Croatia) (Ostojic 2005). In three studies patients used their own mobile phones (or those of a partner) to send and receive text messages  (Hanauer 2009; Marquez Contreras 2004; Ostojic 2005) .

Some of the messages were personalised by tailoring the content to the self-management goals set by the patients in the diabetes clinic. Hanauer 2009 and Marquez Contreras 2004 used randomly-selected standard messages written in conventional language (English and Spanish, respectively). The aim of the messages in Marquez Contreras 2004 was to: provide information on hypertension; promote compliance, good health and dietary habits; and remind patients to take their medication (e.g. 'Try to take your pills exactly as your doctor advised you. This ensures that your treatment will be useful'). Ostojic 2005 does not give any examples of the form and content of reminder messages.

In all studies it was unclear whether allocation was concealed. Only one study explicitly addressed the lack of blinding of patients (Ostojic 2005). Though not stated in any of the other studies, we assume that in none of them did blinding of patients, healthcare providers or outcome assessors take place. Because we were not able to review the original study protocols, fully-informed inferences on potential selective reporting cannot be made. Intervention and control groups were sufficiently comparable in all studies. Only one of the included studies stated that analysis was done in accordance with the intention-to-treat (ITT) principle  (Franklin 2006) . In this case ITT was interpreted to mean that participants were compared in the groups to which they were originally randomly assigned, regardless of whether they actually received some or all of the intervention. However, patients who withdrew from the study before baseline data were collected or who moved away from the study area were subsequently removed from the analysis.\n\nHanauer 2009 presented data only for participants who had actively engaged with the intervention.

      "text": "The studies primarily focused on the health and self-management effects of the interventions, with little to no discussion of patient satisfaction or acceptability of the intervention. Franklin 2006 was the only study to explicitly address these issues. The SweetTalk system was developed in a participatory fashion, involving users, researchers and software developers. Before the trial the system had undergone several rounds of iterative refinement and validation  (Franklin 2003 , Waller 2006) . A user satisfaction survey conducted at the end of the trial (analysing all three arms) showed that 81% of patients felt the system had improved their diabetes self-management and 90% wanted to continue receiving messages (Summary of findings for the main comparison). Of the patients in the intervention group, 97% were happy with the frequency of receiving messages, but 20% complained about receiving the same message repeatedly. Subsequent content analysis of the messages suggested that patients generally valued the opportunity to engage in reciprocal communication  (Franklin 2008) . Hanauer 2009 provided a less explicit evaluation of the acceptability of text messaging to support self-management of long-term illnesses by demonstrating that, after an initial period of more frequent use, the number of blood glucose monitoring results submitted by patients declined sharply over the 3-month duration of the study. Nonetheless, when asked how they would prefer to access the system in future, more people (50%) chose cell phone reminders over email (17%). In fact, two-thirds  (12 of 18)  of the participants assigned to the e-mail group commented that they would have preferred cell phone reminders."

      "text": "Two of the included studies investigated the impact on health services utilisation. Patients on conventional insulin therapy receiving SweetTalk support made a comparable number of clinic visits (MD 0.30, 95% CI -0.22 to 0.82) (Analysis 3.1) and calls to an emergency hotline (RR 0.32, 95% CI 0.09 to 1.08) as patients without the support (Franklin 2006). For asthma patients, the total number of office visits was higher in the intervention group (21 versus 15 visits), whereas the number of hospital admissions was higher for the control group (2 versus 7 admissions) (Ostojic 2005; Analysis 3.3). The particulars of hospital admissions in this study, however, are not known, so no unambiguous conclusions can be drawn about the intervention's impact on asthma-related hospitalisation.\n\nIn addition to potential impacts on health services utilisation, Ostojic 2005 considered the direct costs of the text messaging intervention for patients and providers. The additional cost in the intervention group of follow-up per patient, per week, amounted to (Euro) EURO0.67 to the patient and EURO1.00 to the physician. Per week patients spent an additional 11.5 minutes on data transmission. Costs to the patient in the study by Marquez Contreras 2004 were covered through sponsorship and receipt of messages was free."

      "title": "Summary of main results",
      "text": "This review draws together the evidence for delivering health interventions that focus on management of long-term conditions by mobile phone messaging. The results of our review show that interventions delivered through mobile phone messaging had few direct impacts on health outcomes related to the management of long-term conditions. Studies on diabetes and hypertension did not demonstrate a significant impact from text messaging on health indicators. Only the study on asthma management demonstrated some potential to improve the health condition of patients  (Ostojic 2005) . In this study text messaging was used as a means to establish interactive 2-way communication between patients and their physicians, rather than as a 1-way channel for relaying health education or support messages, as was the case in the other studies. Although at present we have insufficient evidence to further explore this hypothesis, one possible explanation could be that the method of initiation of the interaction (e.g. patient-versus provider-initiated) and the intensity of the communication are contributing factors to the success of text messaging in healthcare delivery. It should also be recognised that the purpose of these text message interventions was not so much to directly affect health status as to achieve behavioural change and improve self-efficacy. The causal relationship between self-management capacity and health status may not always be clearly established and, furthermore, the evaluation period for the included studies may have been insufficient to capture causal effects. The evidence on the effects of text messaging for promoting patients' self-management of their condition appears to be mixed.\n\nIn one study, diabetes patients reported that text messaging gave them greater capacity to manage their illness  (Franklin 2006) . These patients also demonstrated somewhat better therapy adherence compared to patients without text-message based support.\n\nIn contrast, studies involving hypertension and asthma patients did not show any effect from text message reminders on rates of compliance with medication or self-monitoring  (Ostojic 2005 , Marquez Contreras 2004) . These results show that, although in some cases text messaging can be of some use in supporting selfmanagement, more research is needed into the mechanisms underpinning these effects, and the role of factors such as message content and frequency.\n\nOur review found very little evidence on the acceptability of text messaging in supporting self-management of long-term conditions to patients or their care providers. In one study the majority of participants expressed their readiness to continue using the intervention (Franklin 2008). Another study, however, suggested that over time interest in this type of support gradually decreases  (Hanauer 2009) . Evidently, the short-and long-term acceptability of text messaging in disease self-management is an area that requires further attention. Little attention has also been paid to direct and indirect costs associated with text messaging in self-management of long-term conditions. Although our review found that, whilst text messaging support may have some potential for reducing severe adverse events leading to hospitalisation, the overall effect on health service utilisation remains unclear. Only one of the included studies attempted to quantify the direct costs to all users and considered it affordable  (Ostojic 2005) . It should, however, be recognised that such costs may be highly dependent on the nature of the intervention and the size and characteristics of the target group."

      "title": "Overall completeness and applicability of evidence",
      "text": "We systematically collected and analysed the evidence on the effects of mobile phone messaging in supporting self-management of long-term illnesses. However, a number of limitations should be taken into account. Firstly, we have deliberately taken a rather narrow focus: including only those studies in which the intervention is delivered exclusively through text messaging. We excluded studies in which text messages were combined with other forms of data transmission, such as email, Internet or GPRS, as it would be difficult to assess the independent effect of a text message within such complex interventions. This strategy restricted the body of evidence that we were able to build on as we found that many studies in the area of mHealth have relied on multi-faceted interventions in which text messaging was combined with other technologies. Our review thus contains only a relatively small number of studies, none of which has a sample size larger than 67 participants and one of which had only 16 participants. Combined with the substantial heterogeneity in the selected studies, it is very difficult to assess to what extent our findings have more general relevance. Secondly, the fact that no data have been collected beyond a study period of 12 months means that no conclusions can be drawn about the long-term effects of text messaging in supporting the self-management for conditions that are characterised by their protracted, often life-long, duration. Studies with longer periods of follow-up are needed.\n\nOne other important limitation of this review is that all of the included studies were set in high-income countries where mobile phone ownership is widespread and data transmission reliable. Although mobile phone ownership and network coverage are on the increase in most parts of the world, particular attention should be given to the suitability of mobile phone based applications in lowincome settings. None of the studies evaluated potential complications from text messaging such as loss or misinterpretation of data.\n\nNo consideration was given to issues of security and confidentiality. Particularly in low-income countries where mobile phones are frequently shared between family members, these are important issues that need to be taken into account."

      "title": "Quality of the evidence",
      "text": "The included studies were of varying methodological quality with most studies providing insufficient information to accurately assess the risk of bias. On the whole, sequence generation for randomisation was considered adequate, but in none of the studies was it clear if, and how, the allocation was concealed. The lack of blinding in all studies can be partly explained by the interactive nature of the interventions, which does not permit the blinding of patients or their healthcare providers. There is, however, a potential for bias from the apparent lack of blinding of outcome assessors.\n\nThe individual studies examined a wide variety of outcomes.\n\nHealth outcomes and measures of the capacity to self-manage long-term conditions were mostly evaluated with formally-validated measures. Nonetheless, the heterogeneity in the outcome measures makes it difficult to draw unambiguous conclusions on the effects of text messaging. Assessment of patient satisfaction or acceptability of the intervention relied on less defined measures, and the generalisability of these findings is questionable. Because of the limited number of studies included in this review and the relatively small number of participants in each of the studies, the quality of the overall evidence is moderate at best, and strong conclusions on the effectiveness of text messaging in supporting selfmanagement of long-term conditions cannot be drawn. However, despite these limitations this review provides a useful overview and has exposed important gaps in the current knowledge in this area which merit further research."

      "text": "We believe that we have identified all the studies concerning the use of mobile phone messaging to support the self-management of long-term and chronic conditions that met our study design criteria (RCT, CBA, ITT) to June 2009. We also successfully contacted four trial coordinators to obtain additional information regard-ing ongoing trials. However, by excluding studies with possible confounding from other communication and/or data transmission methods, we may have introduced selection bias towards less successful interventions, as there is a likelihood that more complex interventions are more successful at facilitating self-management."

      "title": "Agreements and disagreements with other studies or reviews",
      "text": "This review comes in the wake of two other reviews that have a similar focus. Fjeldsoe 2009 reviewed the evidence for behaviour change interventions delivered by text messaging, whereas Krishna 2009 looked more broadly at healthcare delivery via mobile phones in the management and prevention of disease. Both of these reviews feature three out of the four studies we have included, with only Hanauer 2009 being a more recent addition. However, our review differs from these two reviews in several respects. Firstly,  Krishna 2009  focuses on all possible fields of application for mobile phones in disease management and prevention rather than on their utility in supporting self-management of long-term disease alone. Their conclusions are thus based on an even more heterogeneous set of studies, further complicating the process of deriving robust conclusions. Secondly, the review was not restricted to text messaging applications alone, but also included interventions whereby mobile phones were used for regular phone calls or for data transmission by GPRS (for example to transmit data received from a wireless device), thus including a number of studies which we have excluded from our analysis to minimise possible confounding. Interestingly, Krishna 2009 is overall more positive regarding the impact of mobile phones on health outcomes, compliance with medication and self-efficacy. A possible explanation could be that interventions that employ a more extensive set of technologies in the communication between patients and healthcare providers are better tailored to patients' needs and preferences than those that exclusively rely on text messaging, thus leading to better outcomes. The focus of Fjeldsoe 2009 is somewhat closer to that of our review, as it looks specifically at behaviour change interventions, evaluating changes in both preventive health behaviour and behaviour associated with the management of clinical conditions. The review, however, used somewhat less stringent selection criteria, and included studies without a control group. Furthermore, although text messaging had to be the main method of intervention delivery, the review also considered studies in which other technologies were used as adjuncts. Despite the wider scope of the review and the inclusion of less rigorously conducted studies, the conclusions of Fjeldsoe 2009 -that text message-based interventions can have some positive short-term behavioural outcomes but that further research into long-term effects and acceptability is required -are largely in line with those of our review."

Furthermore, very little is known about long-term effectiveness, risks and limitations, and consumer satisfaction with the intervention. At least in developed countries, the rapid rise of so-called 'smartphones' (that is, phones that can connect to the Internet) could mean that simple mobile phone messaging interventions such as those reviewed here will be replaced with more complex interventions that use a combination of web-based and mobile phone messaging technologies."

      "title": "Implications for research",
      "text": "Although mobile phone messaging health interventions have been the subject of many studies, few of these meet the high standards for evidence associated with RCTs. The evidence of this review is based on just four RCTs. However, we also found numerous pilot studies that did not meet our inclusion criteria. Researchers should focus more on validating their findings from such pilot studies through follow-up studies with adequate research designs (e.g. RCTs, QRCTs, CBAs) and including appropriate controls. These studies should include not only assessment of health outcomes and measures of self-efficacy but also pay attention to issues of risk and acceptability of the intervention. For interventions that are designed to support the self-management of long-term illnesses in particular, more attention should also be paid to their effects over longer periods of time."
