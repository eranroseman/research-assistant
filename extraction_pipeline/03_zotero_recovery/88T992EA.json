  "title": "A Text Message Intervention for Adolescents With Depression and Their Parents or Caregivers to Overcome Cognitive Barriers to Mental Health Treatment Initiation: Focus Groups and Pilot Trial",
  "abstract": "Background: Many adolescents with depression do not pursue mental health treatment following a health care provider referral. We developed a theory-based automated SMS text message intervention (Text to Connect [T2C]) that attempts to reduce cognitive barriers to the initiation of mental health care. \n Objective: In this two-phase study, we seek to first understand the potential of T2C and then test its engagement, usability, and potential efficacy among adolescents with depression and their parents or caregivers. \n Methods: In phase 1, we conducted focus groups with adolescents with depression (n=9) and their parents or caregivers (n=9) separately, and transcripts were examined to determine themes. In phase 2, we conducted an open trial of T2C comprising adolescents with depression referred to mental health care (n=43) and their parents or caregivers (n=28). We assessed usability by examining program engagement, usability ratings, and qualitative feedback at the 4-week follow-up. We also assessed potential effectiveness by examining changes in perceived barriers to treatment and mental health care initiation from baseline to 4 weeks. \n Results: In phase 1, we found that the themes supported the T2C approach. In phase 2, we observed high engagement with daily negative affect check-ins, high usability ratings, and decreased self-reported barriers to mental health treatment over time among adolescents. Overall, 52% (22/42) of the adolescents who completed follow-up reported that they had attended an appointment with a mental health care specialist. Of the 20 adolescents who had not attended a mental health care appointment, 5% (1/20) reported that it was scheduled for a future date, 10% (2/20) reported that the primary care site did not have the ability to help them schedule a mental health care appointment, and 15% (3/20) reported that they were no longer interested in receiving mental health care. \n Conclusions: The findings from this study suggest that T2C is acceptable to adolescents with depression and most parents or caregivers; it is used at high rates; and it may be helpful to reduce cognitive barriers to mental health care initiation.",

      "text": "Approximately 6% of US adolescents aged between 12 and 17 years have a diagnosis of depression; however, >20% of those diagnosed with depression have not received treatment in the past year  [1] . Furthermore, studies show that, on average, 10 years elapse from the time of mental health symptom onset to receipt of treatment  [2] . Among those referred to mental health care for depression or suicidality, only 18% access mental health care within 6 months  [3] , which may increase only to 32% with integrated mental health services  [4] . If left untreated, depression can become harder to manage  [5]  and puts individuals at greater risk for suicide  [6] .\n\nThere are many documented reasons why adolescents do not seek or receive mental health treatment. Help-seeking for mental health symptoms is a multistep process beginning with an awareness of the problem, followed by an expression of the problem and the need for help to others-which for adolescents is typically a parent or caregiver-followed by a discussion and plan for help-seeking  [7] . Barriers to advancement along this process for mental health treatment include lack of health literacy, perceived stigma, concerns about confidentiality, and preference for self-reliance. These barriers are amplified in the adolescent development period  [8]  and are difficult to overcome when both the child and parent or caregiver may have different beliefs or barriers.\n\nInterventions aimed at improving help-seeking for mental health have shown mixed results. A systematic review from 2012 demonstrated that mental health help-seeking interventions improve attitudes but not necessarily behaviors among young people  [9] . A more recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 98 mental health help-seeking interventions found that formal help-seeking behaviors improved when the intervention was delivered to adults with or at risk of mental health problems but not when delivered to adolescents  [10] . Among a review of interventions targeting mental health in adolescents specifically, almost all were delivered in schools, and three-quarters were education-based  [11] . [12] ; however, they have also shown mixed promise for adolescent help-seeking for mental health. In 2014, a systematic review of 18 studies of web-based interventions targeting help-seeking in young people aged between 14 and 25 years (only 4 of which included adolescents) found that although the trials did not change in help-seeking behavior, quasi-experimental and cross-sectional studies reported that interventions facilitated seeking professional help for an average of 35% of users  [12] . A recent scoping review of 4 studies of digital health interventions aimed at improving help-seeking behavior or access to mental health services among parents or caregivers of 2-to 12-year-olds concluded there was some evidence of improved mental health literacy but not necessarily help-seeking  [13] ."

This report details the design of our intervention and presents the results from a two-phase study. In phase 1, we conducted focus groups with adolescents with depression and their parents or caregivers separately to understand the barriers to mental health treatment and the acceptability of the T2C approach. In phase 2, we conducted an open trial of T2C for adolescents with depression referred to mental health care and their parents or caregivers. We assessed usability by examining T2C program engagement as well as usability ratings and qualitative feedback at the 4-week follow-up. We assessed potential effectiveness by examining changes in perceived barriers to mental health care and mental health care initiation from baseline to 4-weeks. Findings from this study are critical to inform the further development and evaluation of digital interventions aimed at improving help-seeking and linkage to mental health care."

T2C was informed by the Health Belief Model  [14] , where perceived susceptibility or severity of depression, perceived benefits to mental health treatment, and cues to action all influence the likelihood of mental health care help-seeking. The T2C design was also shaped by the belief that help-seeking is a multistep process that starts with awareness of the problem, followed by a recognition that mental health care can help and subsequently by a discussion and plan for help-seeking between child and parents or caregivers  [7] ."

If the parent or caregiver reported not having made an appointment, they were asked, \"Are you ready to make an appointment for your child?\" If they replied affirmatively, they were provided instructions on how to set up an mental health care appointment. If they indicated not being ready, they received the messages, \"Do you feel that your child could benefit from seeing a mental health clinician?\" and \"Do you have concerns about your child seeing a mental health clinician?\" On the basis of their responses to these queries, an individual would receive psychoeducation aimed at reducing stigma, increasing perceived benefits of mental health care, or both. Psychoeducation was designed in a microlearning format  [15]  as daily true or false questions for 6 days (see Multimedia Appendix 1 for sample messages). To encourage conversations between parent or caregiver and child regarding depression and mental health care, T2C provided cues to action at the end of each day in the form of a talk tip, for example, \"Sometimes starting the conversation is hard. Consider: Are you okay? I'm here if you want to talk.\" On day 7, parent or caregiver participants received a check-in asking if they were then ready to make an appointment. At this point, if they did not feel ready, they were referred to their child's primary care physician to discuss their decisions. If they indicated that they were ready, they received appointment instructions."

To increase awareness of symptoms and severity of depression among adolescents, T2C incorporated daily mood monitoring, which has been shown to differentiate adolescents at higher risk for psychopathology  [16] ; \"How often have you felt down, depressed or sad today on a scale 1 (not at all) to 5 (all day)?\" As depressed adolescents often underestimate the severity of their symptoms and do not correctly perceive their degree of psychological risk associated with depressive symptoms  [17] , T2C provided adolescents with both immediate and end-of-week feedback on their depression-related symptoms. Immediate feedback focused on relating symptoms to underlying psychopathology, for example, \"You report some symptoms of depression today\" and prompting self-management strategies, for example, \"Try to focus on one small thing that was good today.\" End-of-week feedback focused on quantifying the extent of depressive symptoms; \"You reported some symptoms of depression on [X%] of days this past week,\" where X was calculated as: (days with any depressive symptoms) / (days with any report). Adolescents were then offered the option of continuing mood monitoring: \"Are you interested in continuing to monitor your mood for another week?\""

    {
      "title": "Principal Findings",
      "text": "In phase 1, we found evidence that adolescents with depression and their parents or caregivers face numerous barriers to receiving mental health care, among which cognitive barriers related to stigma and belief in the utility of mental health care play a significant role. We also found evidence that a program like T2C incorporating daily negative affect check-ins for adolescents and (for parent or caregivers) daily prompts to talk about mental health care with their child had the potential to reduce some barriers by being easy, relatable, and simpler than talking on the phone. In phase 2, we found evidence that T2C is used at high rates by adolescents, has high usability ratings, and may reduce perceived barriers over time.\n\nRegarding adolescent engagement, we found that all completed onboarding, including mental health barrier classification, and there were high opt-in rates for continued daily negative affect check-ins beyond the first week. For adolescents, we believe that the brevity of daily interactions and the use of SMS text messaging contributed to these high engagement rates. Regarding parent or caregiver engagement, we found that although less than three-quarters of parents consented to enroll in T2C, all who did completed onboarding, including completion of mental health barrier classification. Not surprisingly, for adolescents with parents who refused enrollment, we found lower rates of mental health care initiation at follow-up. Future studies should seek to understand why certain parents or caregivers defer enrollment and ways to improve parental or caregiver enrollment in help-seeking interventions.\n\nUsability ratings and qualitative feedback reinforced engagement findings. Overall, adolescents and parents or caregivers were satisfied with the T2C program, found the message content clear, and did not need to learn things before operation. In addition, around three-quarters of adolescents and parents or caregivers would recommend the T2C program to someone in need. From qualitative feedback, in addition to being seen as easy to use, the T2C program-especially the daily negative affect check-ins-seemed to provide some feeling of being cared for. The limitation of automated programs not being able to provide truly personalized support was brought up, suggesting that efficient programs that supplement bot with counselor communications should be considered  [20] .\n\nAt the 4-week follow-up, most adolescents reported either having initiated mental health care or pending scheduling, leaving only 15% (3/20) of adolescents still not interested in mental health care. On the one hand, this seems to be a higher rate of mental health care initiation than the 30% reported in the literature. On the other hand, this indicates that additional program components or strategies are needed to close this gap. At baseline, almost three-quarters of parents or caregivers reported already making an mental health care appointment, and more than half of those remaining were ready to make an appointment. For these dyads, the T2C program functioned essentially as a scheduling assistant. For parents or caregivers who were not ready, the program sought to reduce cognitive barriers and promote dialog with their child about mental health care. Additional features may include strategies to overcome structural barriers to mental health help-seeking, including transportation and virtual visits.\n\nMechanistically, we found some evidence that the T2C program facilitates reductions in adolescent cognitive barriers to mental health care from baseline to 4 weeks. The greatest reduction (47% to 37%) was observed for concerns around embarrassment, with smaller reductions regarding privacy and disclosure. We speculate that the daily negative affect check-ins with feedback may have made adolescents more comfortable sharing mental health symptoms, which in turn helped reduce concerns about embarrassment. Future intervention design could consider enhancing this effect by priming the adolescent-provider relationship before an in-person visit with asynchronous communication."

      "title": "Limitations and Strengths",
      "text": "This study has several limitations. First, we recruited mostly female White youth; therefore, the findings may not be valid in males or racial or ethnic minorities. Second, we did not measure objective mental health care initiation but used self-reports from adolescents. Third, we did not capture participants' specific mental health or substance use diagnoses in addition to depression, limiting the understanding of severity and breadth of mental health care needs. We note several strengths of our study. First, we were able to recruit youth and parent or caregiver dyads, as both are critical in understanding barriers to mental health care initiation. Second, we designed and evaluated the intervention through multistage user feedback, incorporating mixed methods. Third, in the phase-2 open trial, we examined multiple sources of outcome data within each participant to triangulate usability findings."

There is an urgent need for evidence-based help-seeking programs for youth with depression, and a program like T2C, if found to be effective in a larger trial, could fill a needed gap."
