  "title": "A systematic umbrella review and metameta-analysis of eHealth and mHealth interventions for improving lifestyle behaviours Check for updates",
  "abstract": "The aim of this meta-meta-analysis was to systematically review randomised controlled trial (RCT) evidence examining the effectiveness of e-and m-Health interventions designed to improve physical activity, sedentary behaviour, healthy eating and sleep. Nine electronic databases were searched for eligible studies published from inception to 1 June 2023. Systematic reviews with meta-analyses of RCTs that evaluate e-and m-Health interventions designed to improve physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep and healthy eating in any adult population were included. Forty-seven meta-analyses were included, comprising of 507 RCTs and 206,873 participants. Interventions involved mobile apps, web-based and SMS interventions, with 14 focused on physical activity, 3 for diet, 4 for sleep and 26 evaluating multiple behaviours. Meta-meta-analyses showed that e-and m-Health interventions resulted in improvements in steps/day (mean difference, MD = 1329 [95% CI = 593.9, 2065.7] steps/ day), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MD = 55.1 [95% CI = 13.8, 96.4] min/week), total physical activity (MD = 44.8 [95% CI = 21.6, 67.9] min/week), sedentary behaviour (MD = -426.3 [95% CI = -850.2, -2.3] min/week), fruit and vegetable consumption (MD = 0.57 [95% CI = 0.11, 1.02] servings/day), energy intake (MD = -102.9 kcals/day), saturated fat consumption (MD = -5.5 grams/ day), and bodyweight (MD = -1.89 [95% CI = -2.42, -1.36] kg). Analyses based on standardised mean differences (SMD) showed improvements in sleep quality (SMD = 0.56, 95% CI = 0.40, 0.72) and insomnia severity (SMD = -0.90, 95% CI = -1.14, -0.65). Most subgroup analyses were not significant, suggesting that a variety of e-and m-Health interventions are effective across diverse age and health populations. These interventions offer scalable and accessible approaches to help individuals adopt and sustain healthier behaviours, with implications for broader public health and healthcare challenges. In recent decades, the rise in chronic diseases has posed a complex challenge to global healthcare 1,2 . Conditions like obesity, cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes, and mental health disorders are closely linked to behavioural practices 3 . Notably, 24-hr movement behaviours (physical inactivity, extended sedentary periods, insufficient sleep) and poor dietary choices are key modifiable risk factors for chronic diseases  [4] [5] [6] [7] [8]  . The global economic burden of chronic diseases is estimated at $47 trillion (USD) between 2010 and 2025 9 . Addressing these risk factors through healthier behaviours in physical activity, sedentary behaviour, sleep, and diet can significantly reduce chronic disease incidence and severity  3, [10] [11] [12] [13]  . The non-adherence rate to recommended health behaviours including physical activity and sedentary behaviour (e.g.,",

This requires implementation of population-based interventions that are both cost-effective and practical when applied on a large scale, including those that support individuals. The widespread availability of the internet and the use of websites and smartphone applications have resulted in a growing interest in e-and m-Health interventions to promote healthy behaviours  19  . These interventions leverage digital technologies such as smartphones, apps, wearable activity trackers, and web-based programs to deliver health-related information and support to individuals  19  . By utilising the ubiquity of digital technologies, including smartphones, wearables, and online platforms, these interventions engage individuals in health-related activities, offer tailored interventions, and facilitate continuous monitoring and feedback. The advantages of these technologies in promoting behaviour change include accessibility, individualisation, real-time feedback, and potential scalability  20  . Among the health behaviours targeted by these interventions, physical activity, sedentary behaviour, healthy eating and sleep, have emerged as key areas for promoting overall health and preventing chronic diseases  [6] [7] [8]  .\n\nE-and m-Health interventions often employ behaviour change techniques such as goal setting, self-monitoring, feedback, and social support to encourage individuals to adopt and sustain healthy behaviours  19  . They frequently incorporate elements such as gamification, personalised messaging, machine learning, or other strategies to enhance engagement and motivation  19  . To gain a better understanding of the effectiveness of e-and m-Health interventions, numerous studies have been conducted in recent years to assess their impact on health behaviours, and the findings have been summarised in numerous previous systematic reviews  [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27]  . Yet, these previous systematic reviews have varied widely, including different types of eand m-Health interventions (e.g., SMS only  21  , or mobile apps only  22  ), focussed on a specific behaviour only (e.g., physical activity  23  or diet only  24  ), or focussed on specific populations (e.g., breast cancer  25  , cardiovascular disease  26  , older adults  27  ). This meta-analysis of meta-analyses aims to consolidate and amalgamate the existing knowledge in this field. Specifically, this meta-meta-analysis aims to:\n\n1. Synthesise the current evidence regarding the effectiveness of e-and m-Health interventions to improve physical activity, sedentary behaviour, diet and sleep using meta-analysis. 2. Determine whether intervention effects differ based on participant characteristics (age, sex); population; e-and m-Health intervention approach (mobile apps, web-based, SMS, mixed [which included combinations of at least three of the other modes]); and AMSTAR-2 quality rating score."

An overview of all reviews' characteristics is shown in Supplementary Table  1 . There was a total of n = 206,873 participants. Mean participant age ranged between 20.4 and 82.0 years, and most reviews (n = 42, 89%) involved a mix of female and male participants. The populations that were most commonly examined were the general population (n = 9), adults with overweight or obesity (n = 9), a mix of various chronic diseases (n = 5), survivors of cancer (n = 4) and other (n = 20, see Supplementary\n\nTable 1 for full description of populations). Fifteen reviews (31.9%; consisting of 287 component RCTs and 79,632 participants) specifically focused on physical activity e-and m-Health interventions, three (6.4%; consisting of 68 component RCTs and 17,679 participants) on diet interventions, four (8.5%; consisting of 81 component RCTs and 27,978 participants) on sleep interventions and 25 (53.2%; consisting of 471 component RCTs and 109,227 participants) evaluated combined behaviours. Description of the types of eand m-Health interventions that were included in each review are shown in Supplementary Table 1 and included mobile apps, web-based and SMS interventions. Most reviews (n = 27, 57.4%) had a critically low AMSTAR-2 score (low: n = 15, 31.9%; moderate: n = 1, 2.1%; high: n = 4, 8.5%), Supplementary Table  2 ). For mean differences (MD), there was sufficient data to perform meta-analyses for: daily steps (steps/day), moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA, min/week), total physical activity (min/week), sedentary behaviour (min/week), fruit and vegetable consumption (serving/ day), energy intake (kcal/day), saturated fat consumption (grams/day) and weight (kilograms). For standardised mean differences (SMD), there was sufficient data to perform meta-analyses on the following outcomes: daily steps, MVPA, total physical activity, sedentary behaviour, fruit and vegetable consumption, sleep quality, insomnia severity and weight. Visual analyses of funnel plots for meta-analyses with at least 10 studies included showed no evidence of publication bias (total physical activity: Supplementary Fig.  1 ; weight: Supplementary Fig.  2 ). Pooled analysis of 5 meta-analyses showed that the effect of e-and m-Health interventions on total physical activity was 44.8 min/week (95% CI = 21.6, 67.9, p < 0.01; n = 5 meta-analyses, 73 component RCTs, 18,608 participants, I 2 = 91.8%, Fig.  2 ) at post-intervention, and 101.8 min/week (95% CI = -15.8, 219.3, p = 0.09; n = 1 meta-analysis, 8 component RCTs, 1495 participants, I 2 = 0.0%, Supplementary Fig.  3 ) at follow-up.\n\nMeta-analyses based on SMDs showed a medium effect of e-and m-Health interventions on total physical activity at post-intervention (SMD = 0.28, 95% CI = 0.21, 0.35, p < 0.01; 16 meta-analyses, 263 component RCTs, 62,377 participants, I 2 = 51.2%, Supplementary Fig.  4 ) and follow-up (SMD = 0.29, 95% CI = 0.20, 0.38, p < 0.01; 2 meta-analyses, 25 component RCTs, I 2 = 0.0%, 3566 participants, Supplementary Fig.  5 ).\n\nPooled analysis of 3 meta-analyses showed the effect of e-and m-Health interventions on MVPA was 55.1 min/week (95% CI = 13.8, 96.4, p = 0.01; n = 3 meta-analyses, 54 component RCTs, 39,057 participants, I 2 = 90.0%, Fig.  3 ) at post-intervention, and 50.2 min/week (95% CI = -26.2, 126.6, p = 0.20; n = 1 meta-analysis, 14 component RCTs, 3169 participants, I 2 = 94.4%, Supplementary Fig.  6 ) at follow-up.

      "text": "This umbrella review set out to consolidate and assess the cumulative evidence on the impact of e-and m-Health interventions on 24-hour movement behaviours and diet. We identified 47 meta-analyses, comprising 507 RCTs, with a total of 206,873 participants. The combined findings from meta-analyses revealed that e-and m-Health interventions resulted in an increase of 1329 steps per day, an increase of 55 min/week in MVPA, an increase of 45 min/week in total physical activity, a decrease of 7 hours/week in sedentary behaviour, an increase of 0.6 servings/day in fruit and vegetable consumption, a reduction of 103 kcals/day in energy intake, a decrease of 6 g/day in saturated fat consumption, and a decrease of 1.9 kg in body weight. Meta-analyses also demonstrated large effect size improvements in sleep quality and insomnia severity. Taken together, the results underscore the effectiveness of e-and m-Health interventions across various health behaviours, intervention approaches, and age and health populations.\n\nPhysical activity emerged as a primary focus in the included systematic reviews and meta-analyses, with results graded as Grade A, demonstrating consistent level 1 studies. In comparison to a recent umbrella review of wearable activity trackers  28  , the e-and m-Health interventions in our review showed a similar improvement in daily steps ( + 1330 steps compared to +1800 steps in Ferguson et al.  28  ) and MVPA (+8 min per day compared to +6 min in Ferguson et al.  28  ). It is important to emphasise that these observed changes in physical activity were not only statistically significant but also clinically meaningful, indicating a substantial impact on individuals' overall health and well-being. Moreover, our study provides some indication of the sustainability of these improvements during long-term follow-up assessments (e.g., for total physical activity and MVPA), suggesting that the positive effects of these interventions may persist after the intervention has concluded. This indication of promising long-term maintenance underscores the benefits of e-and m-Health interventions in promoting physical activity.\n\nDietary intake emerged as the second most extensively investigated health behaviour, and the findings from meta-analyses indicate that e-and m-Health interventions have small-to-moderate improvements across various dietary outcomes. These interventions have proven effective in promoting increased consumption of fruits and vegetables while simultaneously reducing saturated fat and energy intake. Furthermore, enhancing nutritional intake stands as a pivotal component of comprehensive treatment programs aimed at mitigating the risk of cardiovascular disease and diabetes  29, 30  . Although a decrease in daily energy intake is associated with improved weight status, adiposity, and metabolic syndrome risk reduction  30  , it is worth noting that the average reduction of 103 kcals/day, as highlighted in this review, may not meet the >5% to \u226510% recommended energy intake reduction threshold. Nonetheless, this finding is in line with the review's identification of a modest 1.9 kg weight loss. Even such a seemingly modest weight reduction can yield substantial health benefits, particularly considering that a 5-10% reduction in total body weight is often advised for noticeable health enhancements  31  . In this context, a 1.9 kg decrease can represent a significant step forward, especially for individuals embarking on their weight loss journey.\n\nThis review underscored that sedentary behaviour and sleep, despite their significant implications for health, have been less emphasised in e-and m-Health intervention research compared with physical activity and dietary behaviours. For sedentary behaviour, our study revealed a notable reduction of 427 min per week, which translates to approximately 1 h less per day. As recent literature suggests, the focus on sedentary behaviour interventions is gaining traction  32  . Such notable reductions underscore the health potential of these interventions  33  and emphasise their contribution in guiding individuals towards meeting established activity and sedentary behaviour guidelines  34  . Regarding sleep, our findings highlight the efficacy of e-and m-Health platforms in fostering healthier sleep habits. Although sleep interventions traditionally catered to specific pathologies like sleep apnoea  35  , a significant proportion of the general population, estimated at around 30%, experiences sleep difficulties  36  , pointing to an unmet need for broader interventions. E-and m-Health interventions, given their broad reach and adaptability, emerge as a potent solution for providing comprehensive sleep programs for the general public.\n\nThe subgroup analyses revealed variability in the effectiveness of digital health interventions across certain participant and intervention factors, although overall effects were largely consistent. More pronounced differences emerged for specific outcomes like MVPA, steps, and fruit/vegetable consumption; for example, larger benefits were observed in those with overweight/obesity compared to the general population for steps and produce intake. Web-based platforms also outperformed apps and mixed approaches for steps and MVPA. However, intervention effects were generally similar across subgroups for total physical activity, weight, and energy intake, with a few exceptions like greater energy reduction in younger adults. While digital interventions appear broadly effective overall, tailoring specific platform types and delivery modes to particular populations may further optimise impacts on outcomes like MVPA and healthy eating. Carefully considering intervention design and individualised intervention components may be worthwhile to maximise effectiveness.\n\nThis study boasts several key strengths. Foremost, its rigorous methodology adheres to the PRISMA 2020 guidelines, and the comprehensive search strategy produced an extensive dataset of 47 systematic reviews and meta-analyses, encapsulating 507 unique RCTs and encompassing 206,873 participants. The minimal redundancy evident from a CCA of 0.5% ensures our findings are drawn from a diverse and predominantly independent evidence base, lending substantial weight to the generalisability of our conclusions. By pooling data from multiple meta-analyses, the meta-metaanalytical approach provides a thorough synthesis of the current evidence, strengthening the reliability of the effects reported. The wide-ranging populations and interventions studied further expand the understanding of the versatility and relevance of e-and m-Health interventions across diverse contexts and demographics.\n\nDespite its numerous strengths, the study is not without limitations. A significant concern is the quality of the reviews included, with a majority (57.4%) having a critically low AMSTAR-2 score, which may impact the overall trustworthiness of the findings. Additionally, the meta-analysis, by its nature, could obscure heterogeneity in individual studies or mask specific nuances that might be of significance. For example, interventions focusing on populations with lower initial levels of physical activity or fruit/vegetable consumption, such as individuals with obesity, may have greater effects in promoting these behaviours. However, our ability to investigate baseline differences between subgroups is constrained due to the synthesis of aggregate effect estimates from systematic reviews. The finding that the included reviews relied on largely distinct sets of RCTs suggests there is heterogeneity in the literature and potential subgroup differences between studies that we were unable to assess. Moving forward, we suggest further examination of potential clinical and methodological subgroups that may account for differences between reviews. Carefully delineating patient populations, interventions, comparators, and outcomes in included trials may reveal explanations for the lack of overlap and inconsistencies between past syntheses. Finally, the general challenges associated with e-and m-Health studies, such as technological disparities among participants or rapidly evolving technology landscapes, might also affect the results' applicability over time.\n\nThe observed variability in intervention effectiveness across different populations and intervention types from the subgroup analyses can be interpreted in several ways. The lack of significant differences in many subgroups might suggest that more complex and expensive interventions don't necessarily outperform simpler e-and m-Health strategies. This is encouraging as it hints at the potential for broader, cost-effective dissemination of digital health tools, reaching more people without a heavy resource investment. However, as the field of digital health interventions progresses, there's likely untapped potential for individualised, tailored approaches. Such bespoke interventions could cater to the distinct needs and preferences of specific user groups, potentially boosting adherence and enhancing outcomes. We also recognise that technology access and cultural factors related to technology use may vary across populations and should be considered when interpreting these findings. While this review provides evidence that digital health interventions can be broadly effective, it does not explore potential differences in impacts for specific cultural or demographic groups with differing technology access or tech usage patterns. Further research into population and cultural differences would provide valuable context about whether effectiveness may differ based on the population or region. Future research should also prioritise in-depth exploration of adherence to e-and mHealth interventions, recognising that while these interventions demonstrate efficacy when adhered to, suboptimal adherence remains a significant challenge, warranting investigation into the valuable insights that detailed adherence data can provide.\n\nOverall, the findings of this study underscore the potential of eand m-Health interventions as transformative tools in the promotion of healthier behaviours across various domains, from physical activity, sedentary behaviour and sleep to dietary habits. Future research should delve deeper into understanding which specific elements of e-and m-Health interventions resonate most effectively with different user profiles. Given the inconsistency in subgroup effects, it would be beneficial to explore the underlying mechanisms that make certain interventions more effective for specific groups. Additionally, with the rapid evolution of technology and user interfaces, studies should remain abreast of the latest digital trends to ensure interventions remain engaging and effective. In particular, conversational agents (i.e., chatbots) are emerging digital health support tools, and a recent review of experimental studies suggesting they hold considerable promise for intervening on physical activity and diet  37  . Future systematic reviews and meta-analyses should also provide detailed reporting of behaviour change techniques utilised in individual trials. This information is crucial for identifying effective intervention components and informing the development of future interventions. There's also an opportunity to investigate the longterm sustainability of behaviour changes induced by e-and m-Health interventions. It would be pivotal to ascertain not just the immediate impact but also the longevity of such changes in real-world scenarios, ultimately driving the design of more sustainable and impactful digital health solutions.\n\nThis review highlights the promise of e-and m-Health interventions across various health behaviours. For designers or developers, a range of different e-and m-Health interventions can generally be effective, however opportunities exist for more personalised approaches to optimise engagement. Public health researchers should conduct higher-quality trials examining optimal designs for specific populations. Healthcare providers can recommend appropriate e-and m-Health interventions to promote lifestyle change in patients. The general public can benefit from reputable, evidence-based digital resources that increase physical activity, improve diet, reduce sedentary time, and address sleep issues, even with modest sustained changes. Collectively, these findings underscore the potential of eand m-Health solutions but also indicate needs for tailoring, sustained adherence strategies, and further study of long-term impacts across user groups.\n\nIn conclusion, this rigorous meta-meta-analysis offers a promising snapshot of the efficacy and potential of e-and m-Health interventions in shaping healthier behaviours across various populations. With consistent findings pointing to tangible improvements in physical activity, dietary habits, sleep, and sedentary behaviour, e-and m-Health tools stand as an important approach in an ever-evolving health landscape. Importantly, while the immediate impacts are evident, the longevity and sustainability of these interventions in real-world contexts remain paramount for future investigations. As technology continues its inexorable march forward, it will be crucial for health interventions to adapt, innovate, and maintain relevance. This review not only underscores the benefits of such interventions but also sets a roadmap for future researchemphasising the need for personalised, adaptable, and enduring digital health strategies. The present results affirm the potential of e-and m-Health tools in driving meaningful and lasting changes in health behaviours, benefiting a diverse array of populations across the globe."

Reviews that included RCTs involving children or adolescents were excluded. Intervention: E-and m-Health interventions targeting physical activity, sedentary behaviour, diet or sleep. For inclusion, the systematic reviews had to be exclusively focused on e-or m-Health interventions, and \u226575% of the included RCTs in these reviews were required to be delivered solely through e-or m-Health interventions. Reviews were excluded if an eligible e-or m-Health intervention was combined with an ineligible intervention (e.g., physical activity plus medications), or if 25% or more of the included RCTs involved an ineligible intervention. Reviews were also excluded if they were focussed on wearable activity trackers to prevent overlap with a recently published umbrella review  28  . Comparator: Reviews were eligible if they compared an eligible e-or m-Health intervention (physical activity, sedentary behaviour, diet or sleep) arm to no intervention, including waitlist, usual care, a sham intervention or an equal attention non-physical activity, sedentary behaviour, diet or sleep intervention arm. Outcomes: The primary outcomes were any outcomes related to physical activity, sedentary behaviour, diet and sleep. Secondary outcomes were outcomes related to weight and adiposity. Study type: Systematic reviews with meta-analyses of RCTs only, that included meta-analyses of at least one of the outcomes of interest.\n\nNine databases were searched (CINAHL, the Cochrane Library, Embase via OVID, MEDLINE via OVID, Emcare via OVID, ProQuest central, ProQuest Nursing and Allied Health Source, PsycINFO, Scopus) using subject heading, keyword and MeSH term searches for \"e-Health\", \"m-Health\", \"digital health\", \"technology-based\", \"physical activity\", \"sedentary behaviour\", \"sleep\", \"healthy eating\", \"diet\", \"nutrition\" \"systematic review\" and \"meta-analysis\" (see Supplementary Table  3  for the full search strategy). Database searches were limited to peer-reviewed journal articles published in English-language prior to 1 June 2023.\n\nThe search results were imported into EndNote x9 (from Clarivate, Philadelphia, PA) to eliminate duplicates and transferred to Covidence (developed by Veritas Health Innovation, Melbourne, Australia). Two separate reviewers conducted title/abstract and full-text screening, data extraction, and quality and risk of bias assessment. Data extraction was performed using a standardised extraction form. Disagreements were resolved through discussion. The quality and risk of bias assessment was performed by two independent reviewers in duplicate using the AMSTAR-2 tool, with ratings categorised as \"high\", \"moderate\", \"low\", or \"critically low\" confidence  38  .\n\nThe evaluation of overlap among the RCTs in the included reviews was conducted using the CCA. The following equation was used: CCA = (N -r) \u00f7 (r \u00d7 c) -r, where N is the total number of RCTs included across all reviews (including duplicates), r is the total number of unique RCTs (excluding duplicates), and c is the number of reviews included in the analysis  39  . The following categories were used: 0-5% denoted as \"slight,\" 6-10% as \"moderate,\" 11-15% as \"high,\" and >15% as \"very high\" overlap  39  . To assess publication bias, funnel plots were created, and the presence of asymmetries or missing data sections was visually examined for meta-analyses with at least 10 studies included  40  .\n\nMeta-analyses of the outcomes of interest were performed by pooling the effect sizes and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) reported in each metaanalysis, using a random effects model. Results of all meta-analyses were displayed visually using forest plots. Separate meta-analyses were performed for standardised effect sizes (e.g., standardised mean difference, SMD) and unstandardised effect sizes (e.g., mean difference, MD), and the metaanalysed effect sizes (SMDs or MDs) were reported with 95% CIs. Subgroup analyses were performed for age (50 years or less, over 50), sex (female, male, not reported), population (general population, chronic disease), intervention type (mobile apps, web-based, SMS, mixed [which included combinations of at least three of the other modes]) and AMSTAR-2 (critically low, low, moderate, high) if more than 1 eligible meta-analysis was included in at least 2 of the groups. The I 2 statistic was used to quantify the proportion of the overall outcome attributed to variability  40  . The following values were used to determine level of heterogeneity: I 2 = 0-25%: low heterogeneity; I 2 \u2265 25-50%: moderate heterogeneity; I 2 \u2265 75-100%: high heterogeneity  40  . The following classifications for the magnitude of effect were used: less than 0.20 = small effect; 0.20 to 0.50 = medium effect; and greater than 0.50 = large effect  41  . A p-value of <0.05 was considered statistically significant. All meta-analyses were performed using Stata (v16, Stata Corp, College Station, TX, USA).\n\nLevels of evidence and grades for recommendations  42  were used to classify the overall level of evidence as grade A: consistent level 1 studies (i.e., systematic reviews of RCTs or individual RCTs); B: consistent level 2 (i.e., systematic reviews of cohort studies or individual cohort studies) or 3 studies (i.e., systematic reviews of case-control studies or individual case-control studies) or extrapolations from level 1 studies; C: level 4 studies (i.e., case series) or extrapolations from level 2 or 3 studies; or D: level 5 evidence (i.e., expert opinion without explicit critical appraisal) or troublingly inconsistent or inconclusive studies of any level  42  .\n\nThere were several variations to our pre-registered protocol. We were unable to complete the following planned subgroup analyses, due to insufficient data reported in the included meta-analyses: intervention based on a theoretical framework or theory (yes or no), number of behaviour change techniques, method of outcome assessment (self-report or objective), intervention length and time since follow-up (short-term versus longer term). materials are available from the corresponding author upon reasonable request."
