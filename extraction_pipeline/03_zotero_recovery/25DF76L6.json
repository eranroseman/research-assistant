  "title": "Design and baseline characteristics of an implementation study to increase activity with social incentives: The STEP together trial",
  "abstract": "Background: The majority of people in the United States do not achieve recommended levels of physical activity. Even small, daily increases can have health benefits. Wearable devices paired with social incentives increased daily steps in pilot studies but have not been tested for long-term effectiveness in community settings. This paper describes the study design and baseline participant characteristics of a trial testing these approaches to increase physical activity among families in the Philadelphia area. Methods: The trial, called STEP Together, is a Hybrid Type 1 effectiveness-implementation study. Participants enroll on family teams of 2-10 people, including at least one person 60 years old or older. Each participant receives a Fitbit device, establishes a baseline daily step count, and selects a daily step goal 1500 to 3000 steps greater than their baseline. Family teams are stratified based on family size and randomized to Control, Social Incentive Gamification, or Social Goals through Incentives to Charity. Participation is 18-months: a 12-month intervention and 6-month follow up. Results: 779 participants on 285 family teams were randomized. Recruitment was more difficult than anticipated due to the COVID-19 pandemic and higher-than expected numbers of participants who were already physically active and therefore ineligible. Changes to the eligibility criteria that did not impact the underlying intent or conceptual basis for the trial improved recruitment feasibility. \n Conclusion: The results from this study will contribute to the growing body of evidence about scalable, effective strategies to motivate individuals and families to increase their daily physical activity.",

      "text": "Regular physical activity (PA) is associated with numerous health benefits including lower risk of cardiovascular disease, certain cancers, cognitive decline and dementia, and depression  [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] . Research suggests that there is a dose-response relationship between PA and health, such that even small increases in PA can reduce risk of chronic disease and all-cause mortality  [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . However, fewer than half of adults in the United States (US) achieve the recommended amount of weekly PA (150-300 min of moderate-intensity per week)  [16] . Women, people living in poverty, and people with lower education are less likely to meet the recommended level of PA  [16, 17] . The proportion of adults meeting recommended levels of physical activity declines with age  [16] , despite the importance of physical activity to support healthy aging and prevent all-cause mortality  [2, 3, 18, 19] .\n\nEvidence shows that insufficiently active individuals can benefit from even small increases in daily PA  [14, 20, 21] . A meta-analysis of cohort studies showed progressive benefits of increasing PA up to 8000-10,000 steps/day for adults younger than 60 and up to 6000-8000 steps/day for older adults  [7] . Among older adults, there is evidence that 2. Methods STEP Together is a three-phase study. In Phase 1, the study team sought community input about the proposed study design using a series of Community Engagement Studios  [35, 36] . Feedback from these sessions was used to adapt and refine the study design prior to implementation  [36] . Phase 2 of STEP Together is an implementationeffectiveness trial, which is currently underway. Phase 3 will be dissemination, translation and scale-up of the successful intervention strategy or strategies based on the results of Phase 2. This paper describes the study design and participant baseline characteristics for the trial being conducted in Phase 2. Phase 2 started in September 2021, when some restrictions on in-person activities due to the COVID-19 pandemic were still in place.\n\nDuring Phase 2, additional modifications were made to address recruitment challenges due to the continuing COVID-19 pandemic. Appendix A provides an overview of key aspects of the study design prior to implementation (at the conclusion of Phase 1) and the current/ final design. The methods described below reflect the final study design of Phase 2 unless otherwise noted. The adaptations do not substantively change the intent or conceptual basis for the trial."

      "text": "Participants in the STEP Together study enrolled as part of a family team. Initial recruitment methods included social media posts, newspaper ads, and in-person recruitment at community sites. Due to slow enrollment, the team pivoted to primary recruitment via messages sent to potentially eligible Penn Medicine primary care patients. The first person from a family to enroll was designated the \"Team Captain.\" After the Team Captain completed the eligibility screening and informed consent, they were asked to provide information about their family team members, who were then invited to enroll. All participants began the enrollment process by creating an account on Way to Health, the study platform used to manage eligibility screening, consent, surveys, and activity tracking and feedback  [37] . Fig.  1  provides a general overview of the enrollment process for individuals and family teams. Fig.  2  provides a general overview of the study flow.\n\nSTEP Together is funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI) and is registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT04942535). The Institutional Review Board at the University of Pennsylvania approved the study. All participants provided informed consent or child assent and parental consent."

Potential participants completed an individual screening and were eligible to move forward if they could read and speak English, had a smartphone or equivalent digital device, lived in the 9-county Philadelphia area, and were 14 years old or older. Although the study was conducted remotely, geographic eligibility criteria were established to ensure that all members of a family team lived within the same region and to increase recognition of the institution conducting the study.\n\nIndividuals were ineligible if they were already participating in another PA study, could not safely or feasibly participate in an 18-month PA study, were unable to operate a Fitbit device, or were unwilling or unable to wear a Fitbit and receive daily text messages during the study. Individuals who reported high levels of physical activity were excluded early in the screening process.\n\nEach family team also had to meet team eligibility criteria. Teams had to have 2-10 people and each team had to include at least one person 60 years old or older. Every individual on the team had to have a family or close-friend relationship with at least one other person on the team. \"Family\" was defined as first-degree relatives, second-degree relatives, family by marriage, family by adoption, and long-term or common law partners. Close friends were defined as friends who had known each other for two or more years, communicated or saw each other at least once a week, and were willing to join a \"family\" team together."

      "title": "Run-in period",
      "text": "After a family team enrolled and was deemed eligible to move forward, everyone on the family team received a Fitbit Inspire 2 or Fitbit Inspire 3 device (when it became available). Participants were instructed to connect their Fitbits to the study after they completed the baseline surveys (described below). They were told to wear the Fitbit for two weeks without intentionally changing their activity patterns. The \"runin\" period was designed to troubleshoot technical issues, familiarize participants with the Fitbit device, exclude people who were already so active that they would not benefit from the trial, and establish participants' baseline step counts  [30] . After participants recorded two weeks of step data, their daily step count for the second week was averaged to establish an initial baseline. Any day with less than 1000 steps recorded was excluded from the average since it is unlikely to represent actual daily activity  [38, 39] . Participants needed at least 4 days of valid step data in order to calculate a baseline  [30, [40] [41] [42] . Participants who did not link their Fitbits to the Way to Health study platform or did not achieve a minimum of 1000 daily steps for at least 4 days within a consecutive 7-day period were deemed ineligible. The run-in period was extended for participants who needed to troubleshoot a device issue or indicated that their PA during the run-in was atypical.\n\nParticipants with an average daily step count between 1000 and 7500 steps during the last week of the run-in were eligible. Participants with a baseline of 8400 steps or higher during the entire 14-day data collection period were ineligible. Participants with a baseline between 7600 and 8300 steps during the entire 14-day data collection period were eligible for an extension to their run-in period. After the extension, participants with an average daily step count up to 7500 steps were eligible, participants with an average daily step count of 7600-8300 steps were eligible if their family team was eligible, and participants with an average daily step count of 8400 or higher were ineligible. Average daily step count during the last week of the run-in period was used to establish participants' baseline physical activity.\n\nWhen all the members of a family team completed the run-in period, participants were notified about their individual eligibility and their family team's eligibility. Family teams were eligible after the run-in period as long as at least two people from the team, including someone 60 years old or older, were individually eligible. Eligible participants who were not on an eligible family team become ineligible if they did not invite another eligible family member or friend to join their team."

For inactive individuals, an increase in 1500 to 3000 steps over baseline represents a meaningfuland sustainableincrease in daily physical activity  [43, 44] .\n\nDuring the study, participants are permitted to contact the study team to update their goal as long as the updated goal is within these parameters or the alternative minimum goal described in Appendix A.

Every Monday, each family team receives 70 points (10 points for each day of the week). Each day, a family member is selected at random to represent the team as the \"family representative.\" If the family representative meets their goal on the day they are selected, the family keeps their points. If the family representative does not meet their goal, the family loses 10 points. This design leverages loss aversion, which has been shown to be effective in encouraging behavior change  [46, 47] . The team is not told who is selected as the day's family representative until the following day.\n\nParticipants in the Gamification arm receive a daily text message with a motivational message informing them if they met their goal the previous day. The person who was selected as the family representative the previous day also gets an update on the team's points for the week.\n\nAll families start the study at the silver level. They move up or down the following levels: blue (lowest), bronze, silver, gold, and platinum (highest). If the family team has less than 40 points at the end of the week, the family drops down one level. If they have 40 or more points, they advance a level. Every 8 weeks, families that are in the blue or bronze level are moved to silver to allow for another \"fresh start\"  [48] . Each Monday, participants in the Gamification intervention receive an email with information about their family's level in the game (whether they moved up or down a level or stayed at the lowest or highest level).\n\nAt the end of the 12-month intervention period, each participant on a team that finishes the game in the platinum or gold level receives a small trophy to recognize their achievement.

The Team Captains can select from a list of pre-approved charities or select one of their choosing if it is a registered 501(c)(3) in good standing.\n\nA family representative is randomly selected each day. They are informed the following day if they were selected as the family representative. If the family representative's step goal is achieved, the family receives credit for meeting their goal. If it is not met, the entire family does not get credit. If the family representatives meet their goals on at least 4 of 7 days of the week (Monday through Sunday), $20 is donated to charity on behalf of the family team. Participants in the Charity arm receive a daily text message with motivational messaging informing them if they met their goal the previous day. The person who was selected as the family representative the previous day also receives an update on the team's progress towards a charity donation for the week.\n\nParticipants receive an email with information about whether their family earned a donation to charity every week of the intervention. Charity payments are made monthly, and participants receive a separate email from the study team when each charity payment is made.\n\nDuring the 6-month follow up period, participants in the Charity arm receive a daily text message stating whether they achieved their step goal on the prior day."

The analyses will compare the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios that show the difference in costs between intervention and control arms divided by the difference in outcomes (e.g. change in daily step counts) of intervention arms over 12 months. The analysis will be from a payer perspective and will include costs that would be incurred by the payers of the program. Measured costs will include intervention costs such as incentive payments, cost of technology platform, and devices utilized for participant monitoring and tracking. Costs will also include personnel costs for time spent on monitoring and tracking of participants and coordinating and overseeing the intervention activities. The analysis will use differences between each intervention and control in measures of physical activity (steps and minutes of MVPA), and health-related quality of life measured by the EQ-5D  [50]  as the outcome measures."

After the run-in period, 454 people were ineligible because they were too active. The accrual target was increased from 675 to 750 for two reasons: 1) many family teams had received their Fitbits and were already in the run-in period when the initial target sample size was Fig.  3 .

When the updated target of 750 participants was met, family teams that were in the run-in period were allowed to complete the run-in and were randomized, if eligible.

Of the 285 family teams that were randomized, 95 family teams were randomized to each arm (258 participants in Arm A, 261 participants in Arm B, and 260 in Arm C). Participants' ages average 58.1 years (SD = 16.8). Three quarters of the participants are female (N = 581, 74.6 %), similar to other physical activity studies  [30, 33, 41, 62]  and health behavior clinical trials in general  [67] . About half of participants are non-Hispanic White (N = 415, 53.3 %), 36.3 % are non-Hispanic Black (N = 283), and the remaining participants are Asian (N = 38, 4.9 %), Hispanic (N = 34, 4.4 %), or another race/ethnicity (N = 9, 1.2 %). The average number of participants on a family team is 3.2 (SD = 1.5, range = 2-9). Randomized participants had an average baseline step count of 5371.4 (SD = 1609.6, range = 1300 to 8300).\n\nThere are statistically significant differences in race/ethnicity and cigarette smoking status between arms. Arm A has a higher proportion of Asian participants (8.5 %) and Arm B has fewer Black participants than the other arms  (27.6 % vs 38.4 % and 43.1 %) . Arm C has the highest proportion of participants who have ever smoked cigarettes (33.1 %) and Arm A has the lowest (22.9 %)."

      "title": "Discussion",
      "text": "The STEP Together study has an ambitious, complex design and the research team encountered significant recruitment challenges due to the COVID-19 pandemic. A large number of potential participants were ineligible because they were already very physically active. The eligibility screener included questions intended to discourage active people from moving ahead with enrollment, but many who were already very active completed the run-in period. In response to these issues and feedback from potential participants, eligibility was expanded to allow close friends on the family team, the minimum age of the \"older adult\" on the team was lowered to 60 years, and the study region was expanded to allow for participants living in counties surrounding Philadelphia. After implementing these changes and focusing recruitment efforts on potentially eligible Penn Medicine primary care patients, recruitment and randomization of 779 participants was achieved.\n\nChallenges during the early stages of the trial include missing or delayed daily step data, and some participants being unresponsive to study team outreach. A participant is considered lost to follow-up and removed from the study (passive withdrawal) after 60 or more consecutive days of missing data unless they are actively communicating with the study team to resolve the issue. Up to the time that this write-up was prepared (September 2024), a total of 64 participants, or 8.2 %, withdrew or were removed from the study, which is less than the projected 12 % dropout rate used in the power calculations."

    {
      "title": "Strengths",
      "text": "The STEP Together study has several important strengths. STEP Together collects continuous physical activity data using Fitbit wearable devices. This objective measure of daily steps and MVPA prevents overor under-reporting of PA by study participants. Another key strength of the STEP Together study is the length of intervention and data collection period: a 12-month intervention testing two intervention strategies against control and 6-month follow up period. This 18-month duration is significantly longer than in most published studies testing incentive strategies to increase PA. As an implementation trial, STEP Together aims to yield findings that can be used to both increase and sustain higher activity levels. The study's entirely remote design may facilitate uptake of the intervention strategies into real-world contexts."
    },
    {
      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "In addition to important strengths, the STEP Together study has some limitations. Enrollment efforts identified more people who were already very physically active and thus ineligible. Another limitation includes missing data from participants who did not respond after repeated contact attempts over more than a month, though the dropout rate was only 8.2 %."

    {
      "title": "Conclusion",
      "text": "Despite strong and growing evidence that PA promotes health and prevents common chronic diseases, more than half of the adults in the US do not meet recommended levels of PA. Interventions that incorporate wearable devices with behavioral science-informed social incentive strategies have the potential to be scalable, sustainable, and effective. STEP Together is a large, community-based trial testing Gamification and Charity donations as strategies to promote increased daily step count among families in the Philadelphia area. The final randomized participants will complete the study in late 2025. The findings will contribute to the growing body of evidence about low-cost strategies to motivate individuals and families to engage in more active lifestyles."
