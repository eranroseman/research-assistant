      "text": "Aging, unhealthy diets, and sedentary lifestyles are key risk factors of cardiometabolic diseases (CMDs), which include metabolic syndrome (MetS), type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM), and cardiovascular diseases (CVDs)  [1] [2] [3]  . MetS is a cluster of metabolic disorders including obesity, hypertension, escalated blood glucose lipid, which could progress to T2DM and CVDs if not managed effectively  [2] [3] [4]  . Globally, there is a high prevalence of poor cardiometabolic health (Table  1 ), with CVDs causing 20.5 million deaths in 2021 (approximately one-third of all global deaths)  4, 5  . Overall, the prevalence of metabolic disorder increases with age. However, there has been a notable rise in youth-onset obesity and T2DM, driven by factors such as increased consumption of calorie-dense foods, more sedentary behavior, structural racism, and other social determinants of health  6, 7  . Since 1990, adult obesity rates worldwide have more than doubled, while adolescent obesity rates have quadrupled  8  . In the US, the prevalence of youth-onset T2DM among children aged 10-19 years nearly doubled from 2001 to 2017  9  , with the most pronounced increase occurring in racial and ethnic minority groups  6, 9, 10  . In 2023, a consensus recommendation from the American Heart Association Presidential Advisory and the American Academy of Pediatrics called for annual obesity screening and blood pressure assessment from 3 years of age  7  .\n\nNotably, early-stage metabolic disorders can often be reversed through lifestyle modification and medication, and small habit changes may be more effective than medication alone  3, 11, 12  . Key challenges of disease management and prevention may be attributed to low adherence to healthy lifestyle and the lack of early detection of asymptomatic metabolic abnormalities  7, 13, 14  , which highlight the critical need for effective methods to facilitate personalized care plan to drive long-term adherence to lifestyle changes in decentralized settings, as well as early detection of metabolic decline across diverse populations including those who are generally healthy.\n\nFrom a socioeconomic perspective, the potential to use early metabolic health biomarkers for identifying subclinical metabolic decline is strengthened by a growing public interest in self-monitoring health biomarkers and tuning lifestyle habits to achieve optimal health  15  . This trend can be attributed to multiple factors. First, there is an increased awareness of the adverse effects of unhealthy diets and physical inactivity on the risk of metabolic disorders. Second, policy initiatives aimed at fostering environments that facilitate healthy lifestyle choices while rendering unhealthy options less attractive have gained traction. For instance, the sugary drink tax, advocated by the WHO, has been implemented in over 100 countries to deter consumption  16  . Similarly, Singapore has implemented \"Nutri-Grade,\" ranging from A to D, to provide guidance on sugar and saturated fat levels in beverages. Additionally, many countries have launched national public health campaigns to promote healthy lifestyle at the societal level, such as the \"Active People, Healthy Nation\" initiative in the US  17  , \"LumiHealth\" in Singapore  18  , and \"LiveLighter\" in Australia  19  . Lastly, the advent of digital health technologies and wearables has enabled continuous monitoring of various health-related metrics during daily activities.\n\nfor their metabolic health. These evaluations focus on assessing the metabolic dynamics in response to exercise, aiming to optimize performance during intense physical activity. Metabolic flexibility, the ability to switch fuel utilization between glucose and fat to maintain homeostasis, is a key indicator of metabolic health as it reflects how adaptive the body is throughout physiologic challenges  [20] [21] [22]  . Studies have shown that professional athletes exhibit a greater level of metabolic flexibility compared to moderately active individuals and those with MetS  [23] [24] [25]  . The enhanced flexibility allows athletes to readily switch between utilizing glucose and fat in response to energy demand and substrate availability. Conversely, individuals with impaired metabolic function, particularly the elderly and individuals with metabolic disorders, have declined metabolic flexibility  21, 22, [26] [27] [28] [29]  , making them less adaptive to nutritional changes and disturbance in energy balance.\n\nMetS patients and professional athletes represent the extreme ends of the spectrum of metabolic health. For individuals who are non-athletes and free of metabolic disorders, there also exists a varying degree of metabolic flexibility due to interindividual biological differences such as genetic characteristics and overall health and fitness level  25, 28, [30] [31] [32] [33]  . Indeed, many studies have shown that evaluating metabolic flexibility could improve risk stratification and enable early detection of metabolic dysfunction even in seemingly healthy individuals  20, 30, [32] [33] [34]  . For instance, in a study that investigated the metabolic response to an acute high-fat overload, substantial variability in the ability to switch fuel to lipids was observed among healthy adults. Notably, this degree of flexibility is indicative of the propensity for future weight gain  32  . Conversely, another study found that within the obese group, some individuals exhibited a transcriptional profile that was similar to the normal weight group, suggesting they had retained a degree of metabolic flexibility  33  . This highlights that metabolic flexibility could be independent of body size, and not all obese individuals experience the same degree of metabolic impairment. Taken together, metabolic flexibility could serve as an early biomarker of metabolic abnormalities, in order to (1) differentiate metabolic health status within the generally healthy population.\n\n(2) reflect the level of metabolic health at an individual level, which evolves over time as a result of lifestyle choices and health management strategies (diet, intermittent fasting, physical activity, sleep, etc).\n\nOne of the decentralized health solutions emerging as a transformative paradigm for personalized metabolic disease management is the digital twin technology  35  , defined as an evolving digital entity designed to accurately reflect the object or process it represents  35, 36  . The emergence of the digital twin technologies may potentially transform healthcare and, importantly, has led to personalized health management, biomarker predictions, visualization of health data, and many other features  35  . In a study led by Rad et al., the team integrated digital twins with personal health knowledge graphs (PHKGs) and harnessed diverse health data sources to enhance diabetes management  37  . For example, this patient-specific digital twin enables realtime, personalized care including glucose level predictions and insulin dose optimization. In a similar study, Zhang et al. developed a digital twin framework using multi-omic data, mechanistic models, and knowledge graphs coupled with machine learning (ML) to enhance clinical decision support for T2DM patients  38  . Furthermore, a study leveraged generalized metabolic fluxes (GMF) to build a digital twin model that predicts and identifies chronic kidney diseases among T2DM patients  39  . Of note, human digital twin initiatives, such as the EDITH program  40  , have been funded by the European Commission to build a roadmap toward an ecosystem for virtual human twins. Taken together, digital twin technologies present a promising approach to personalize treatment strategies with tailored interventions especially for metabolic diseases, which often require longitudinal monitoring  35  .\n\nIn this perspective, we introduce the concept of a metabolic flexibilitybased digital twin model designed to drive adherence to lifestyle changes, enable personalized health management and early detection of subclinical metabolic decline. Two key modules of the proposed digital twin are, (1) the gamification module based on longitudinal monitoring of fuel switching and metabolic flexibility trends, (2) the artificial intelligence (AI)-powered integrated digital twin module for analyzing and predicting long-term health outcomes associated with sustained adherence to health regimen and metabolic flexibility assessment. Importantly, we discuss the technical feasibility of constructing the proposed digital twin, the challenges in its development and implementation, along with the associated socioeconomic perspectives that need to be taken into consideration to realize improvement in metabolic health on a population level (Fig.  1 )."

      "text": "Metabolic flexibility is conventionally determined by measuring the respiratory quotient (RQ), which is defined as the ratio of carbon dioxide produced (VCO 2 ) and oxygen consumed (VO 2 ) (VCO 2 /VO 2 ) from rest to exercise, or from fasting to feeding using the indirect calorimetry technique  20, 30, 41  . The RQ generally ranges from 0.7 during pure fat 8 \u2022 Lifestyle modification (achieving and maintaining a healthy weight with behavior change, healthy diet, recommended physical activity level) \u2022 Use of medications as needed \u2022 Procedures or surgeries as needed \u2022 Low adherence to lifestyle changes \u2022 Difficulty in personalizing health regimens that maximize weight loss efficiency Raised total cholesterol 39% (WHO, 2008) 95 \u2022 Lifestyle modification \u2022 Use of medications as needed \u2022 Low adherence to lifestyle changes \u2022 Early detection of the disease \u2022 Tracking cholesterol over time Hypertension 32% in women, 34% in men (2019)\n\n96 \u2022 Lifestyle modification \u2022 Adoption of a balanced, low-sodium diet \u2022 Use of medications as needed \u2022 Low adherence to lifestyle changes \u2022 Early detection of the disease T2DM 10.5% (IDF, 2021) 97 \u2022 Lifestyle modification \u2022 Using medications that lower the risk of CVDs \u2022 Achieving targets for control of HbA1c, blood pressure and cholesterol \u2022 Low adherence to lifestyle changes \u2022 Managing multiple treatment targets \u2022 Early detection of the disease \u2022 Early detection of complications \u2022 Personalized care CVDs More than half a billion (World Heart Report, 2023)\n\n98 \u2022 Lifestyle modification \u2022 Medications \u2022 Procedures or surgeries \u2022 Management of other metabolic disorders (co-morbidities) \u2022 Additional components such as stress management, healthy sleep and not smoking \u2022 Low adherence to lifestyle changes \u2022 Early detection of CVDs risk factors \u2022 Long-term care adherence  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41514-025-00211-6\n\nmetabolism to 1.0 during pure carbohydrate metabolism  42  . Past computational models of metabolic flexibility are primarily based on mechanistic simulation of energy expenditure and metabolic fluxes at tissue level or whole-body level using a system biology approach. In one study, genomescale metabolic models were employed to compute the RQ of computational model of skeletal muscle  42  , accounting for energy expenditure and enabling the simulation of metabolic flexibility in response to varying energy demands. Another notable study developed a computational model of human metabolism to predict changes in RQ in lean and obese men, using differential equations to represent nutrient uptake and ATP production  43  . These approaches were implemented in in silico testing or retrospective analysis. In this perspective, we introduce an alternative approach to assess metabolic flexibility by tracking the dynamic changes in blood glucose and ketone bodies (KBs) during health interventions, with the aim to implement this as a digital twin solution to support decentralized metabolic health management in real-world scenarios.\"\n\nIn a glycogen-depleted state, adipose tissues release free fatty acids that further break down into ketone bodies (KBs), such as \u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, acetoacetate and acetone, to serve as energy substrates in place of glucose  44, 45  . KBs have received tremendous attention as a biomarker of elevated fat metabolism in the context of metabolic disease prediction  46  , diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) detection  47  , dietary therapy  48, 49  , and health optimization  50  . In a recent work, self-monitoring of metabolic dynamics for a healthy subject based on serial measurements of blood KBs and blood glucose (fingerstick-and wearable-based) was reported  50  . Notably, a specific glucose and KBs trajectory indicative of fuel switching (also known as ketosis) was observed after 1-5 days of a sustained regimen of fitness and dietary interventions  50  . This important work indicated the possibility of evaluating metabolic flexibility by monitoring the ease and rapidity to reach fuel switching under fixed health regimen. Interestingly, the knowledge that the implemented health regimen successfully induced ketosis motivated the subject to consistently adhere to the regimen. More importantly, visualizing the dynamics of the biomarkers, especially the ketosis-driven KBs trajectory, also motivated the subject to sustain the regimens, which are essential toward achieving fuel switching  50  . This adherence persisted throughout the study and beyond its completion, even in challenging situations like traveling. Similarly, gamification strategies have also been implemented in clinical trials for disease prevention. For example, physical activity was significantly increased among families with game-based intervention in a clinical trial  51  (NCT02531763). Furthermore, gamification interventions  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41514-025-00211-6\n\nwere deployed to incentivize physical activity for patients who may be at risk with CVDs and T2DM, and the participants engaged in more physical activities in the trials  52, 53  (NCT02961192; NCT03749473). In summary, these demonstrated the successful application of gamification strategies in promoting and sustaining adherence to health regimens and potential longterm behavior change.\n\nThe module 1 of the proposed digital twin is designed to monitor fuel switching and promote adherence to healthy behaviors (Fig.  2 ). It begins with input data-glucose and KB measurements and details of a fixed health regimen, followed by pattern analysis to identify the occurrence of fuel switching within a preset period. A Metabolic Flexibility Score (MFS) will be computed based on the fuel switching speed. For instance, an MFS of 90% is assigned if fuel switching occurs rapidly (e.g., day 2), encouraging adherence to the current regimen. If fuel switching occurs with delay (e.g., day 10), an MFS of 60% is given, recommending adherence and continued monitoring. If fuel switching does not occur within 14 days, it will prompt a potential risk of metabolic disorder and immediate adjustments to the health regimen (e.g., reduce carbohydrate intake). The output provides actionable scores to gamify adherence, motivating individuals to optimize metabolic flexibility and healthy behavior.\n\nA key challenge associated with developing the proposed module is the difficulty in obtaining KB measurements due to its invasive nature, as blood fingerstick test strips are currently the gold standard method. Although minimally or non-invasive methods for measuring KBs in human interstitial fluid 54 , sweat  55  , urine  56  , and breath  57, 58  have been reported, their accuracy and reliability remain uncertain. An accurate and non-invasive KB monitoring method may eventually become available with further technological advancements. For example, a recent study reported a stretchable wearable sensor for measuring solid-state epidermal biomarkers, showing strong correlation with blood biomarkers and dynamic correlation with physiological activities  59  . Alternatively, considering the convenience of using continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) to collect glucose data and the partially inverse correlation between glucose and KB, it is worthwhile to investigate if KB level or fuel switching occurrence could be estimated using CGM data. ML pipelines like neural networks have been applied to train models using CGM data for accurate and timely forecasting of future blood glucose levels  31, 60  . In selected diabetes clinical trials, blood KBs were measured during hyperglycemia for early identification of DKA  61  . Using such datasets, Cichosz et al. utilized a supervised binary classification ML approach to train a model using labeled data, enabling it to predict elevated KB level based on CGM data obtained from patients with type 1 diabetes for the first time  47  . Based on the retrospective CGM data collected for 4 h before the KB measurements, the authors obtained an acceptable prediction accuracy. While further studies are warranted to validate the results in other cohorts and comparing different ML algorithms, this work underscores the possibility to correlate CGM patterns indicative of ketosis."

      "text": "The gamification module provides real-time feedback and a reward mechanism that gamifies adherence to health regimen, empowering users to adopt interventions that most effectively induce and maintain a beneficial state of ketosis. Another critical feature to be integrated into the digital twin is the predictive analytics for evaluation of long-term health outcome resulting from sustained fuel switching (Fig.  3 ). Frequent post-intervention checkpoints could include self-trackable measurements like body weight, BMI, blood pressure, and body fat composition. Additionally, a panel of metabolic health and aging biomarkers such as Apolipoprotein A (ApoA), Apolipoprotein B (ApoB), Hemoglobin A1c (HbA1C), Interleukin-6 (IL-6), C-reactive Protein (CRP), and blood lipids could be measured as baseline and final health outcome. The relationship between fuel switching occurrence, longitudinal trends of MFS, and changes in health metrics and biomarkers will then be mapped using AI-powered models.\n\nExisting health management technologies like the \"January AI\" application have leveraged ML pipelines to learn an individual's physiology and provide personalized recommendations based on predicted blood glucose response to specific behavior patterns  31, 62  . Excitingly, generative AI (GenAI) models offer significant potential to speed up the development of digital twins  63  , as well as enhance the predictive accuracy and user engagement of digital twin platforms. First, GenAI model could adherence to healthy behaviors by evaluating fuel switching speed and providing real-time feedback as the reward mechanism. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41514-025-00211-6\n\nbe evaluated together with traditional ML models for the simulation of long-term health outcomes based on implemented interventions, potentially outperforming conventional ML approaches. Second, GenAI can generate synthetic data for unmeasured biomarkers to aid in health trajectory forecasting  64  and minimize the need for invasive testing. Lastly, conversational GenAI tools powered by large language models (LLMs) can be integrated into digital twin platforms to provide real-time coaching and motivational feedback to users. An example user interface of the digital twin includes longitudinal trends of MFS and predicted long-term biomarker changes (Fig.  4 ). https://doi.org/10.1038/s41514-025-00211-6\n\nGenAI solutions have the potential to improve the performance of digital twin models for health management. However, addressing challenges related to data privacy and security, trustworthiness and explainability, and bias in GenAI is crucial to ensure its safe and effective integration into wearables and digital health technologies  [65] [66] [67]  . Developing AI risk assessment protocols and formulating specific metrics including inscrutability and trustworthiness, and ongoing model monitoring can help detect and mitigate risks associated with GenAI health technologies  67  . Potential strategies to overcome data privacy and security challenges include the implementation of advanced encryption and anonymization techniques before feeding data into generative models. Additionally, federated learning allows models to be trained across multiple devices or servers holding local data samples without exchanging them, thus enhancing privacy."

      "title": "Challenges in implementing and achieving success with digital twin solutions",
      "text": "Although there is significant potential for digital twin technologies to improve health management and patient outcomes, their widespread implementation and successful utilization have been hindered by various social factors, (1) disparities in the accessibility of digital health tools, (2) socioeconomical challenges in adopting and adhering to a healthy lifestyle, particularly healthy dietary patterns. For instance, studies from the US and Europe have found that digital health tools are more frequently used in urban areas, while usage is lower among ethnic minorities and individuals with language barriers  68, 69  . Furthermore, younger populations, as well as those with more advanced education levels and higher economic status, tend to use these tools more extensively. In other words, people with poor health are among those facing the greatest challenges in accessing digital health tools. These challenges primarily stem from the digital divide that exists between different countries, ethnicities, and communities, with significant disparities in digital infrastructure and inclusiveness, which encompasses accessibility, affordability, digital literacy, and attitudes-such as trust and enthusiasm-toward digital technologies  68, 70  . The number of people who have access to the Internet has been steadily increasing over the years. As of 2023, approximately 67% of the global population has internet access, nearly double the figure from ten years ago  71  . Notably, Singapore ranks first in digital inclusiveness among 82 countries in 2020  72  , primarily due to initiatives like free public WiFi and financial support for digital skills training. In contrast, other Southeast Asian countries fell below the global average mainly due to substantial lowincome populations.\n\nAlongside tackling the digital divide to boost the adoption of digital health technologies, it is crucial to develop effective strategies to overcome access barriers for disadvantaged groups who currently lack any form of healthcare. For instance, training programs could be deployed for community health workers who will provide education and facilitate access to services in underserved communities. Languages and culturally tailored platforms could be developed to help bridge gaps for ethnic minorities and non-native speakers. Furthermore, it is important to recognize that the effective use of digital health does not always demand continuous or sustained use. One potential strategy to reduce the healthcare burden of CMDs could involve a system-wide, short-term implementation of remote monitoring technologies (e.g., CGM) to identify pre-diabetic or diabetic populations. Following this, longitudinal monitoring could be introduced for individuals undergoing lifestyle modification. This approach may necessitate a redesign of healthcare systems that begins with clearly defined goals and rapidly collects data to assess the current landscape  73, 74  .\n\nSecond, the adoption and adherence to healthy dietary patterns is a key challenge that needs to be addressed for achieving successful outcome from digital twin technologies, as a balanced and nutritious diet is the cornerstone of metabolic health management. This challenge could be addressed by improving nutrition education and food security. In the US, fewer than 1 in 10 adolescents and adults consume enough fruits or vegetables and too much sodium  75  . In many countries, clinicians are recommended to provide nutrition care to patients, yet most feel their nutrition training was inadequate. A study from the UK found that over 70% of medical students and doctors reported receiving less than 2 h of nutrition training in medical school  76  . A systematic review indicated that nutrition is insufficiently incorporated into medical education, regardless of country, setting, or year of medical education 77 . Among the general population, many consumers lack a clear understanding of what constitutes healthy carbohydrates. A survey conducted in Australia indicated that 50% of participants did not know precisely what constitutes a whole grain  78  . Moreover, a study in Singapore revealed that while most respondents were able to identify hidden sources of sodium in food like instant noodles and processed meats, only 4 in 10 were aware that sweeter-tasting dipping sauces and foods are higher in sodium  79  . Taken together, it is essential to improve nutrition education for healthcare providers, as well as public awareness campaigns for the general population, to promote healthy eating.\n\nFurthermore, similar to the varying levels of access to digital health tools, access to nutritious food also varies widely across different populations. Food security is one of the key social determinants of health for CMD risk  7, 80, 81  ; however, more than 1 in 10 children and adults report food insecurity in the US, indicating that this issue extends beyond low-income regions  82, 83  . The roles of various stakeholders-including insurers, healthcare providers, the food industry, and public health organizations-are critical within this ecosystem  14, 84  . Insurers influence access to nutritional services and resources, while healthcare providers are key in referring patients to nutrition programs. The food industry must prioritize the production and marketing of healthy food options. Public health initiatives are essential for addressing food equity and security, recognizing that these factors are interconnected and vital for improving population health outcomes. Notably, the American Heart Association recently launched a new Food Is Medicine research initiative  14  , which provides free or subsidized healthy foods to at-risk individuals. This program aims to generate evidence to convince insurers to cover such programs for specific groups and to drive system-level changes that facilitate healthy eating for at-risk populations  84  ."

      "title": "Broader ecosystem perspectives on improving community metabolic health",
      "text": "Improving accessibility to healthcare resources and driving behavior change toward a healthy lifestyle are critical groundwork that may potentially prevent CMDs and other diseases. These challenges are also crucial to the eventual adoption as well as the implementation of the proposed digital twin-enabled workflow, which may be a promising tool for metabolic flexibility improvement. However, broader ecosystem considerations, including socioeconomic issues, should be prioritized prior to the implementation of advanced healthcare technologies, such as digital twins. From a broader perspective, considerations across the ecosystem, including gig workers and health of all age groups, should also be carefully addressed. The emergence of the gig economy in Southeast Asia and other parts of the world has created substantial job opportunities. However, gig workers experience significant inequalities in the context of accessing healthcare resources through insurance and protection  85  . For example, in Singapore, gig workers, including hail ride drivers and food delivery riders, only receive insurance depending on the \"goodwill\" of service providers and coverages vary substantially from different employers  85  . With a new law in effect later in 2024, all gig workers will be covered under standardized insurance similar to employees of other sectors. In other parts of Southeast Asia, gig workers are considered independent contractors who do not enjoy the full benefits of typical employees, such as insurance coverage  86  . Therefore, it is evident that gig workers experience substantial vulnerabilities in the broad ecosystem, and their accessibility to healthcare resources should be addressed  87  .\n\nMoreover, gender disparities in health, especially CMDs, may potentially lead to unsatisfactory treatment outcomes  88  . Sex should be considered  https://doi.org/10.1038/s41514-025-00211-6 as a biological variable when studying disease mechanisms, as some diseases may require sex-specific treatment strategies  89, 90  . Notably, chronic diseases in women are on the rise, and the National Institutes of Health (NIH) of the US has also developed a framework to account for sex differences for chronic conditions in women  89  . This framework specifically categorizes women-specific chronic conditions into: (1) female-specific, (2) more common in women, (3) potentially understudied in women, and (4) high morbidity for women. For example, around one in three women have hypertension globally, and this condition is considered one of the most important risk factors for women  91  . Conventionally, hypertension is more prevalent in men under 50 years of age, whereas women after the age of 65 (menopause) have higher chances of developing hypertension  92  . Similarly, women tend to experience stroke at a much lower blood pressure than men  91  . It is evident that sex-specific treatment strategies should also be implemented to address potential chronic diseases. Harnessing digital platforms powered by AI may pinpoint trends and patterns in relevant biomarkers for early detection.\n\nIn addition, in the context of birth rates in Asia, substantial declines in countries including Korea, Singapore, and China are observed. In contrast, the prevalence of chronic medical conditions is increasing, with approximately 10-30% of youth diagnosed with a condition  93  . Youth and adolescents age between 10 to 24 years old may be one of the most digitally literate group, and they may be more prepared to harness digital health devices to longitudinally monitor their health conditions. However, driving their adherence to treatment and healthy lifestyle may be challenging. For example, a study found that youth are less likely to use CGMs consistently for glucose monitoring when compared to adults  94  . For downstream implementation, gamification strategies should be carefully designed and considered and implemented into health optimization for all age groups.\n\nThe challenges discussed above are not siloed to health and healthcare. Harnessing digital health approaches may not solve these broader issues in the ecosystem. Community efforts that involve all stakeholders spanning from pharmaceutical companies, food industry, to government agencies to address challenges including agriculture, sustainability, energy, housing, economy, work, transportation, community planning, and healthcare will lay the groundwork for the success of health optimization via digital platforms."

Recent literature has demonstrated the feasibility of digitally monitoring the process of metabolic switching in a decentralized setting, targeting the favorable switch to fat oxidation as the end point. Key unresolved questions for future research include (1) Is there significant individual variability in the ease and rapidity to reach metabolic switching under a standardized health regimen? (2) Does the magnitude of the ketosis response vary based on different intensities of interventions? Additionally, AI models including digital twins could be leveraged to (1) identify glucose patterns associated with the onset of ketosis during health interventions and (2) simulate the relationship between health regimen, metabolic flexibility trends, and long-term health outcomes. It is important to note that the proposed digital twin approach is not merely a recapitulation of biological processes for observational or fundamental studies; it has the potential to inform the development of proactive, pre-emptive interventions tailored to steer each individual's metabolic health in a more favorable direction. Furthermore, this participatory health approach empowers people to actively take ownership of learning how to improve their health experientially and ethically, fostering both personal responsibility and informed decision-making in their health journeys. Lastly, it is essential to consider broader factors within the healthcare ecosystem, including accessibility, nutrition education, health disparities, and sex differences. Public health initiatives, in conjunction with the emergence of digital health technologies, may help address the aforementioned challenges and accelerate the path toward metabolic health optimization and healthy aging.\n\nOpen Access This article is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International License, which permits any non-commercial use, sharing, distribution and reproduction in any medium or format, as long as you give appropriate credit to the original author(s) and the source, provide a link to the Creative Commons licence, and indicate if you modified the licensed material.
