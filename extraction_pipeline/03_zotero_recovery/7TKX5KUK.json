  "abstract": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) remains a public health priority in the United States because of its association with complex health needs, reduced life expectancy, lifelong disabilities, and high cost of care. A cross-sectional analysis was conducted to calculate the crude and race-specific birth prevalence for SCD using state newborn screening program records during 2016-2020 from 11 Sickle Cell Data Collection program states. The percentage distribution of birth mother residence within Social Vulnerability Index quartiles was derived. Among 3,305 newborns with confirmed SCD (including 57% with homozygous hemoglobin S or sickle \u03b2-null thalassemia across 11 states, 90% of whom were Black or African American [Black], and 4% of whom were Hispanic or Latino), the crude SCD birth prevalence was 4.83 per 10,000 (one in every 2,070) live births and 28.54 per 10,000 (one in every 350) non-Hispanic Black newborns. Approximately two thirds (67%) of mothers of newborns with SCD lived in counties with high or very high levels of social vulnerability; most mothers lived in counties with high or very high levels of vulnerability for racial and ethnic minority status (89%) and housing type and transportation (64%) themes. These findings can guide public health, health care systems, and community program planning and implementation that address social determinants of health for infants with SCD. Implementation of tailored interventions, including increasing access to transportation, improving housing, and advancing equity in high vulnerability areas, could facilitate care and improve health outcomes for children with SCD.

      "text": "Sickle cell disease (SCD) is an inherited blood disorder caused by mutations in the hemoglobin subunit beta (HBB) gene and is associated with premature mortality  (1)  and significant morbidity, including vasoocclusive pain, stroke, and multiorgan damage. The protective association between variants in HBB and severe Plasmodium falciparum malaria results in a higher prevalence of HBB mutations in geographic areas with high malaria prevalences  (2) . The combination of this protective effect and the historical trans-Atlantic slave trade has resulted in SCD primarily affecting Black or African American (Black) persons in the United States, leading to exacerbation of high disease-associated morbidity in groups affected by structural racism and health inequities. Social determinants of health further contribute to poor outcomes among persons with SCD  (3, 4) . Because of the associated health inequities, high risk of lifelong disabilities, and high cost of care, managing SCD remains a major national public health priority  (5) .\n\nAlthough universal newborn screening for hemoglobinopathies, including SCD, has been implemented nationally since 2006  (6) , SCD birth prevalence data remain scarce. The most recent race-specific birth prevalence (one in 365 Black newborns) is based on 2007 data  (7) . Data from 2015-2017 indicate an overall SCD birth prevalence of one in 2,024 U.S. newborns  (8) . The CDC-funded Sickle Cell Data Collection (SCDC) program is well suited to estimate SCD birth prevalence. At the time of this analysis, SCDC included 11 state-level surveillance programs from the southern, midwestern, and western United States. The programs collect and analyze data on newborns with SCD, including SCD type and geographic location, allowing for the assessment of county-level socioeconomic conditions that influence health outcomes among infants with SCD. Identifying these conditions can guide the planning and implementation of public health, health care systems, and community programs supporting persons with SCD. This report analyzed state newborn screening program records from 2016-2020 from 11 SCDC program states to provide updated crude and race-specific SCD prevalence among newborns and to describe the percentage of newborns with SCD by county-level socioeconomic characteristics among these states."

Newborns with a confirmed diagnosis of SCD were included if the infant's birth and their mother's residence county were within the SCDC program state. Confirmed SCD diagnosis was based on a positive Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory SCD test result reported by a state newborn screening program with confirmatory testing or clinical diagnosis by a physician and documented confirmatory CLIA-certified laboratory testing after the newborn period. The mother's residence county and infant's race, ethnicity, sex, date of birth, and SCD type were extracted from newborn screening records or birth certificate data. Infants' race, ethnicity, and SCD type were based upon state-specific methodologies across newborn screening programs  (9) . The total number of live births and of live births among non-Hispanic Black persons by county were obtained from each state's health department."

Prevalence rates were calculated overall and by state.\n\nCounty Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) characteristics were quantified using the 2020 state-specific SVI databases based on the birth mother's county of residence at birth. The statespecific SVI ranks each county relative to other counties within the state on 16 social factors. Percentile ranking values range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating greater vulnerability. An overall SVI percentile ranking as well as percentile rankings measured on four themes (socioeconomic status, household characteristics, racial and ethnic minority status, and housing type and transportation) \u00a7 were categorized into quartiles from least to most vulnerable: low (0 to 0.25), medium (>0.25 to 0.5), high (>0.5 to 0.75), and very high (>0.75 to 1.0) vulnerability. The percentage distribution of birth mother residence within SVI quartiles was derived for the overall SVI measure and by SVI themes. SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute) was used for all analyses. Institutional review boards or ethics committees overseeing each state program either determined the analysis to be outside purview as public health surveillance or exempt and approved a waiver of consent. This activity was reviewed by CDC, deemed not research, and was conducted consistent with applicable federal law and CDC policy. \u00b6"

The majority (64%) of mothers of newborns with SCD resided in counties with high or very high housing type and transportation social vulnerability, underscoring potential strategies to serve these communities, including medical transportation programs or development of innovative care models to facilitate access to comprehensive SCD care. For example, improving flexibility in scheduling of medical transportation, providing reimbursement for use of existing public transportation such as rideshares, and partnering with local faith-and community-based organizations for medical transport have the potential to improve access to care. Moreover, understanding the geographic location of SCD-affected newborns within a state can help guide specialty and primary care efforts to improve access to SCD care.

      "title": "Limitations",
      "text": "The findings in this report are subject to at least four limitations. First, because of the time needed to ascertain SCD type by public health surveillance systems, state newborn screening data are subject to a 3-year time lag. Despite this lag, SCD counts among newborns did not fluctuate significantly between years. Second, missing data hampered the ability to further disaggregate race and ethnicity categories, which might be important to understanding differential birth prevalences across states and tailoring programs to different racial and ethnic communities. Third, SVI was examined at the county level as opposed to U.S. Census Bureau tract level, which could mask variations of SVI within counties. Finally, SVI metrics are at the county level rather than the person level and might not reflect a comprehensive assessment of specific services needed by infants with SCD."
