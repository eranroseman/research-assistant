<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1." xml:id="_ZrpKDcw">Introduction</head><p xml:id="_W4x7uBH"><s xml:id="_GkNK9HJ">Biomedical research has made significant strides at developing methods and tools to support care delivery by individual healthcare providers, while, for a number of reasons, teamwork has become a desired care delivery model <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2eJrJkd">On the clinical side, these reasons include the increasing complexity of patients' conditions (e.g., chronic diseases with associated morbidities) combined with increasing medical specialization and fragmentation of disciplinary knowledge.</s><s xml:id="_QXZx9NZ">On the care delivery side, it is recognized that the management of complex clinical conditions by an interdisciplinary healthcare team (IHT) that includes clinicians and allied healthcare providers from various disciplines working jointly to achieve a common goal of patient-centered care <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> results in improved health outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_BzfYaaa">For simplicity, in the text we will use the generic term "clinician" to indicate any healthcare provider, e.g., physician, nurse or physiotherapist.</s><s xml:id="_ya67qwQ">In cases where precise distinction of providers is needed, we use a specific term.</s></p><p xml:id="_6m6EhPR"><s xml:id="_dTQKDnN">Care delivery by an IHT is often defined as a "complex process in which different types of staff work together to share expertise, knowledge, and skills to impact patient care" <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Be4hPN8">Such care delivery is difficult to operationalize because of the need to consider providers simultaneously as individuals and as members of an IHT operating in a fluid environment where multiple tasks and teams co-exist and where one team member is usually involved in the care of multiple patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Jn4rP7m"><ref type="bibr">Karsh et al.</ref> state that IHT operationalization goes beyond designing a new front-end interface to an existing health information technology (IT) system but rather requires a complete system redesign <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7EWxX3Q">As demonstrated in <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the lack of properly redesigned health IT system may diminish the benefits of team-based patient management and may result in inferior patient outcomes.</s></p><p xml:id="_Sm5PPeW"><s xml:id="_qcmQZkp">Research on teamwork processes and interactions in an IHT has largely focused on how to model their certain aspects instead of what particular aspect should be modeled.</s><s xml:id="_fDbebPG">Mabry et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> described the use of multiple specialized Intelligent Monitor Agents collaborating in a team-like environment to carry out monitoring and diagnostic tasks in emergency trauma scenarios.</s><s xml:id="_egDpWdf">Similarly, Taboada et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> proposed an agent-based modeling and simulation tool to assist the operations of an Emergency Room.</s><s xml:id="_RFbGtw2">The implications of the collaboration of autonomous agents with human actors have been discussed by Grosz <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ZVhHsaE">Huguet et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> described the use of a multi-agent architecture to model and interpret the effects of different types of communication errors in the context of field training for medical teams.</s><s xml:id="_uhW6W2u">Ruan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> developed an agent-based model that is integrated with a workflow system to improve support for an IHT in palliative care setting.</s><s xml:id="_jYsCcmP">Our earlier research <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> used agent-based modeling to represent selected few aspects of team formation.</s><s xml:id="_jF8zmX4">Similar -to some extent -research also is conducted in team science, but there it is more concerned with the education of team members than with the overall operationalization of care delivery by an IHT <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_zhEqpBB"><s xml:id="_YXX4ZBb">Activities of an IHT are usually guided by a clinical workflow that specifies tasks to be completed and defines their precedence.</s><s xml:id="_ThzMFeb">Despite extensive research on the formalization and execution of business workflows <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, there is limited application of this research in healthcare, mostly because the execution of a business workflow is task-oriented as opposed to being team-oriented <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KhERqck">Existing workflow management systems (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_umNgKhW"><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, or <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>), although effective for executing individual workflows, are ill-suited for executing workflow designed for an IHT.</s><s xml:id="_266kUqT">This issue was addressed by Grando et al. who defined patterns in order to model task assignment and delegation as part of team-based care delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NFNnUJs">Others extended that research by modeling the tasks that an IHT executes and describing how to allocate these tasks to team members <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gbpGJ4t">However, they considered IHT membership to be static and did not account for its dynamic nature.</s></p><p xml:id="_aMUSJXB"><s xml:id="_HakbxAZ">In our research we focus on a specific aspect of the teamworkdynamic formation of an IHT.</s><s xml:id="_FrK3CCu">It involves identification and the management of team leadership, team membership, and the assignment of tasks to team members, <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ZgCDtqH">Every IHT must have a leader, i.e., a clinician who makes definitive decisions related to patient management (hospital admission, care path, discharge, etc.).</s><s xml:id="_BCU6HCw">In most cases, the leader is a physician who takes the role of "most responsible physician" (MRP).</s><s xml:id="_SYeFPgm">Other members of the team execute workflow tasks that are compatible with their skills, roles, and access privileges, and membership in an IHT evolves as members of a team finish their shifts, are called to other patients, or execute new tasks requiring different clinical expertise <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_uAwz7fP">There are additional challenges of supporting dynamic formation of an IHT, including blurring of the roles of team members <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the required continuity of team leadership <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, and a need to account for patient preferences whenever possible.</s><s xml:id="_dRxNg2w">It is clear that more research is needed in order to gain a better understanding of the teamwork processes governing an IHT <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, and how to align dynamic formation of an IHT with patient preference models.</s></p><p xml:id="_BZdeXVA"><s xml:id="_AyPVrw8">In this paper, we build on and significantly expand upon our earlier work <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref> and present an extended framework called the Team and Workflow Management Framework (TWMF) that allows modeling and operationalizing the dynamic formation of an IHT while also incorporating patient preferences into clinical workflows.</s><s xml:id="_KTAmt2P">TWMF aims at in-patient tertiary care -a setting that is characterized by high team volatility <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> and therefore asks for better support centered on IHT formation.</s><s xml:id="_sEtZFSr">TWMF currently considers patient preferences for attending clinicians and therefore affecting MRP selection and team membership.</s><s xml:id="_HFyypsy">However, in our earlier work we discussed more complex preference models that involve treatment options if available <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, thus, TWMF can be extended to handle these models and such extension is discussed in the last section.</s></p><p xml:id="_mgEcJZM"><s xml:id="_8nzuU82">Our design and implementation of the TWMF draws upon frameworks for designing and evaluating health IT system such as the context of system testing continuum developed by Kushniruk et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WnZs7r8">The continuum represents system evaluation starting with experimental simulations of representative cases before moving into clinical laboratory simulations, and finally clinical simulations in real care delivery settings.</s><s xml:id="_MaTpZGJ">The work presented here takes place at the earlier stages of the system testing continuum where the TWMF and associated proof-ofconcept prototype are tested in expanded experimental simulation using comprehensive use cases of care delivery by an IHT.</s></p></div>
