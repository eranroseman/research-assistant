<ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_CYnNDZP">In Australia, suicide is the leading cause of death among individuals aged 15 to 24 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_XaJgrUD">Though it is well recognized that young people have different and unique mental health needs compared to adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, there continue to be few resources and interventions that have been specifically designed for young people and that have evidence for preventing suicide-related outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_yYBPVNC">Self-guided digital mental health interventions (DMHIs) delivered through smartphone apps or web-based platforms without human guidance have rapidly emerged as a potential low-cost and scalable model of care for young people experiencing suicidal ideation, self-harm, and mental health issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_mq2rYjG"><s xml:id="_mGjJfQ5">Findings from a recent meta-analysis of self-guided DMHIs for suicide prevention show that self-guided digital interventions directly targeting suicidal ideation are effective in reducing the severity of suicidal thoughts, although evidence specifically in relation to young people is still rare <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3tdJh3k">However, there is ample evidence indicating that low levels of user engagement with DMHIs have hindered the real-world uptake of these interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>, including DMHIs targeted at younger users <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_sNYWU8z">In addition, poor engagement-stopping use of a digital intervention before the minimum number of modules that are expected to lead to clinical benefits have been completed-may also impede mental health benefits that could potentially be gained from DMHIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hp49T2T">For these reasons, solutions for optimizing user engagement with DMHIs represent a critical step toward advancing the wider integration of digital interventions in routine practices of health, education, and community settings where they can reach and benefit young people.</s></p><p xml:id="_XhQNKt6"><s xml:id="_yAA9e9M">To date, there is inconclusive evidence supporting the efficacy of technology-supported strategies (eg, reminders, coaching, and personalized feedback) toward improving engagement with DMHIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8pxc8B5">It has been hypothesized that the lack of efficacy associated with these engagement strategies may be due to poor alignment with the needs and preferences of users <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_n4h2UE4">Indeed, there is little evidence that such engagement strategies have been co-designed with, or incorporated the perspectives of, those who are intended to benefit from DMHIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_YyS9Aad">To improve the effectiveness of both DMHIs and any supporting engagement strategies, adopting user-centered design approaches-such as participatory design or co-design-has been strongly recommended <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_UuqtcjE">While several studies have now described processes of actively involving service users in the development of mental health-focused digital interventions for youth and young people <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, no studies have yet discussed such processes in the context of adjunctive strategies-strategies that are accessed externally to DMHIs (eg, via social media or the internet) but are designed to be used in conjunction with the latter-for promoting engagement with digital interventions.</s></p><p xml:id="_D4azBrh"><s xml:id="_ruWbcQA">This study details the development of a technology-supported adjunctive strategy for increasing engagement with LifeBuoy <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>-a smartphone app designed to help young people manage suicidal thoughts.</s><s xml:id="_3WbMrJp">LifeBuoy seeks to achieve this by imparting distress tolerance and emotional regulation skills that are grounded in dialectical behavior therapy and acceptance and commitment therapy.</s></p><p xml:id="_NYruCFk"><s xml:id="_nXScQNb">A recent evaluation of LifeBuoy supported the app's efficacy in reducing the severity of suicidal ideation but not other outcomes of interest such as depression, anxiety, or general psychological distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_vUnaVDe">Additionally, while module completion rates were high, most participants stopped engaging with the app after a month <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_27XUmKQ">By adding an adjunctive strategy to reinforce therapeutic content and enhance sustained engagement with the app, we hoped to see improvements across both mental health and suicidality-related outcomes.</s></p><p xml:id="_yTgZQpz"><s xml:id="_VSpfQAA">Our design approach integrated existing literature with qualitative insights obtained from young people with lived experience of suicide.</s><s xml:id="_epHc5Bb">This study is the first to discuss how user-focused design practices may be applied in developing strategies for promoting engagement with DMHIs for young people.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_tQ4zk3e">Comparison With Previous Literature</head><p xml:id="_9NJqRmW"><s xml:id="_ABwrx4h">To date, no study has reported on the process of designing adjunctive strategies for supporting engagement with DMHIs.</s><s xml:id="_YNasZyk">Notwithstanding, our study findings were generally consistent with past research on the co-design of digital interventions for younger users, which found young people to have a preference for direct, practical information <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, content that positively impacts mood (such as relaxation techniques, distraction activities, or uplifting quotes) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and designs that are visually appealing <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_JkgG7xc"><s xml:id="_TafXmCF">Nature-themed backgrounds appealed most to advisors because of their calming effect on mood.</s><s xml:id="_uZkaFdk">These views are congruent with theories and findings from environmental psychology.</s><s xml:id="_pjcb4aS">According to Stress Reduction Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, exposure to nature reduces stress and has therapeutic effects on both physiological and psychological well-being.</s><s xml:id="_WZQqhRV">Importantly, earlier research has extended the postulations of Stress Reduction Theory by demonstrating that virtual exposure to natural environments can be effective toward reducing stress and attenuating subsequent reactivity toward stressful stimuli <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mfthuwX">This is aligned with feedback from the design workshops that looking at nature-themed stock photos has a rejuvenating effect.</s></p><p xml:id="_eJQXgUu"><s xml:id="_dYB89VY">The young people who were interviewed felt that Instagram was a suitable social media platform for the adjunctive strategy.</s><s xml:id="_rukG9GN">This was attributed to their existing familiarity with the platform and the perceived sense of community support provided by other users.</s><s xml:id="_RmaHnjK">This finding appears to contradict previous research reporting an inverse association between Instagram use and mental health among youth and young adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_v6gKFcD">However, a recent study found that Instagram use had an indirect effect on reducing suicidal ideation through the mediating effect of perceived burdensomeness among young people aged 18-25 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_YbCSkmW">Although more research is needed to elucidate the relationship between Instagram use and mental health, these findings collectively suggest that an accompanying Instagram account might be a suitable complement to DMHIs targeting suicide ideation among young people.</s></p><p xml:id="_Uw3jJ6A"><s xml:id="_7gvDXkb">Currently, there are no studies promoting engagement with digital interventions, which have examined the feasibility or acceptability of adjunctive digital strategies that provide detailed content on topics relevant to users <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Wvys7qR">Using a blog emerged as a novel way to provide in-depth information on topics of interest to young people with suicidal ideation and reinforce the therapeutic content covered in LifeBuoy.</s><s xml:id="_Yh7s54T">Importantly, the blog allowed young people with lived experience of suicide to directly contribute content that would likely resonate with the needs and challenges faced by intended users of the LifeBuoy app.</s><s xml:id="_zxUxfjk">It is also hoped that this would increase the acceptability of the blog among young people who use LifeBuoy.</s><s xml:id="_ZQtnRva">Nevertheless, whether the blog is efficacious toward promoting engagement with LifeBuoy requires empirical investigation.</s></p></div>
