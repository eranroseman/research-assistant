Store' and the 'Google Play Store' respectively, accounting for around 92% of the mobile app distribution business <ref type="bibr">1</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_uaVfgJu">The success of their vertically integrated mobile platforms relies heavily on the sales and marketing functionality of their respective app stores.</s><s xml:id="_Hepwru5">The number of health and wellness apps available in the app store has been estimated to be 350,000 apps worldwide with as many as 90,000 new health apps added in 2020 alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">2</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_SHWqnCY">The Apple App Store first opened in 2008 and the Google Play Store in 2012, with an emphasis on games, utility apps, and social networks.</s><s xml:id="_tpRBkVh">Barriers to submitting an app were originally low, which meant amateurs or small developer groups could easily make apps.</s><s xml:id="_e3fJDVC">In the health domain this quickly became problematic, as a 2015 review of asthma apps and insulin calculators found, which identified a range of potentially harmful errors and privacy issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_5UhwfKT">Today, Apple and Google selectively assess apps with a health impact.</s><s xml:id="_XTmywcE">For example, in 2019 apps associated with e-cigarettes or "vapes" were removed and in 2021 during the height of the COVID-19 pandemic the app of an online dating community for people who chose not to be vaccinated against the coronavirus was removed <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_8yVnEWs">Both companies also sell a range of products with health implications such as the Apple Watch, which in its latest version includes a heart rate sensor, an electrocardiogram, and an irregular heart rhythm notification.</s><s xml:id="_Dy6U4SF">The Apple App Store currently features a category of "Health and Fitness" covering a range from simple wellness apps that play white noise or sleep diaries all the way up to more clinically relevant apps such as a self-harm tracker, heart rate monitors, and mental health counselling platforms.</s><s xml:id="_F233NAP">At the time of writing, apps in this category do not carry details of any medical device certification.</s><s xml:id="_2e7KfPJ">Some top-rated apps in this category simultaneously make claims like "instantly measure heart rate" or "accurate like ECG" but disclaim "not intended for medical use, for fitness use only".</s><s xml:id="_WcN22AK">A 2020 assessment of the regulatory status of paediatric drug calculator apps made available to the EU market, which have an intended purpose classifying them as medical devices, found that one only out of 74 apps (1.4%) had the necessary regulatory approval <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">7</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_HTVNg44">Of these apps, 66 of the 74 (89.2%) apps were available on Google Play Store and 8 (10.8%) on Apple App Store.</s></p><p xml:id="_qjbYBxp"><s xml:id="_bkCAUaf">Increasingly, government agencies such as the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 8 , UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">9</ref> , Germany's Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte (BfArM, or the Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical Devices) and the EU Medical Devices Coordination Group (MDCG) have delineated where a "health app" crosses into being a "medical device" <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_fjYUdqA">While there is local variation, broadly speaking a "medical intended purpose" includes prevention, diagnosis, monitoring, or treatment of a disease, injury, or handicap <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_bzhccUu">Software with a general purpose used in a healthcare setting (such as a word processor or spreadsheet), that is a simple fitness monitor, provides education, or fulfils back-office functions like booking appointments are excluded.</s><s xml:id="_tYxMQTm">However, the proportion of health and wellness apps that are (or should be) registered as medical devices in various regions is not readily discernible from public app store data.</s><s xml:id="_CQNAXS9">Apps which have been developed for a medical purpose must be marked to indicate that they are in conformity with applicable regulations and quality management standards (Conformité Européenne, "CE-marked") before being made available in the 27 countries of the European Union (EU), the EEA member states that implement EU medical devices regulation (Iceland, Liechtenstein, and Norway) and Turkey (together the "Union" for the purpose of the EU Medical Devices Regulation (EU) 'MDR' 745/ 2017) (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_vbQunMV">In accordance with the EU MDR, which replaced the EU Medical Devices Directive ('MDD' 93/42/EEC), manufacturers are required to label their products with the CE mark to signify they comply with specific standards of performance, quality, safety, and efficacy for their product type.</s><s xml:id="_K4KX4Fj">Depending on the nature of the product, a range of quality management system (QMS) procedures must be put in place such as ISO13485, with a range of documents produced that must then be audited, in most cases, by a "notified body".</s><s xml:id="_qGxv7Zd">Over the past five years the EU has upgraded the regulatory risk classification of many 'Software as a Medical Device' (SaMD) apps, and hence the oversight processes required (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>), through EU MDR which became applicable on 26 May 2021 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">15</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_5dMKwgG">Apps which perform simple data handling tasks, including the transfer, communication, compression, storage, conversion, formatting, archive, display or simple search of medical information are not included in this definition <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_7ACCxBV">MD apps providing information to be used to take decisions with diagnostic or therapeutic purposes are classified moderate risk (i.e., class 'IIa', or in higher risk classes ('IIb' or 'III') if the decisions made on the basis of their information have a serious (serious health deterioration or the need for surgery) or a critical impact (death/irreversible health deterioration) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_QG9dcfG">Medical device apps include those supporting healthcare delivery through advice to users on their symptoms, apps interacting with

actors in the delivery chain, other than importers and developers, who make a device available on the market.</s><s xml:id="_MMpkyhy">If a MD app developer not based in the Union, makes its app available in the EU via an app store, then the app store is not only the distributor of the MD app, but also its "importer".</s><s xml:id="_TU6gFGr">Most, but not all the requirements on distributors and importers are already met by Apple, but as of yet, Google meets only a small subset of these requirements (Tables <ref type="table">1</ref> and <ref type="table">2</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_Wffk9m4">App stores must ensure through verification checks that apps comply with specific requirements in the regulation EU MDR (as described in Table <ref type="table">2</ref>, and in <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13</ref> ), and remove noncompliant apps.</s><s xml:id="_nGC3nvV">As distributors, they are permitted to do this on a sampling basis rather than having to audit every app.</s><s xml:id="_phEbySf">Where apps rely on software that is run on infrastructure outside the Union for its functioning (e.g., an AI model that provides information for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes shown in the app as output) this software should comply with the CE marking requirements of EU MDR, based on Article 6 of that Regulation.</s></p><p xml:id="_gZAmTBR"><s xml:id="_fqwNZjk">The traditional pre-digital role of distributors was to purchase products from manufacturers to market and sell these products to end-customers.</s><s xml:id="_R4rkDgJ">This would typically involve coordination of storage and transport, however, activities such as complaint management was not specifically required.</s><s xml:id="_bsVDYqT">In the era of cloudbased app distribution, app stores manage information which is critical to safety, and are the principal actors responsible for the handling of complaints.</s><s xml:id="_UNqE5VW">The legislative requirements on app store manufacturers introduced by the MDR include the monitoring and reporting of safety-relevant complaints in app reviews or discussion forums as user feedback (even star ratings), which could contain safety-related information <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_RfWv5JB">In addition to checking CE-marking status, instructions for use and labelling, distributors must ensure that devices have appropriately applied unique device identifiers (UDIs) for version tracking, as well as informing the authorities if they become aware of serious issues associated with CE-marked apps.</s><s xml:id="_BKh8fvZ">However, there is no evidence in the literature, or in online complaints databases, to show that app stores have ever reported any issues originating from users to regulatory authorities.</s><s xml:id="_spNxq58">A search of the US FDA manufacturer and user facility device experience (MAUDE) database reveals no reported complaints about apps distributed through an app store <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">17</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_rWud9QG">In the EU, it is unknown, if complaints will be recorded by app stores via the European Database on Medical Devices (EUDAMED), once it is fully operational <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18</ref> .</s></p><p xml:id="_YU6upFg"><s xml:id="_cT67XXt">In addition to being distributors, if a medical device app was developed outside the EU, app stores are also effectively functioning as "importers", which invokes substantial further requirements <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_T58yAMy">Importers must be established in the EU, and while Apple and Google do have subsidiary entities, their role with respect to the EU MDR is unclear.</s><s xml:id="_msMkJx3">Importers must also ensure that instructions

registered, for each app they import, in this database, or a national equivalent, as long as EUDAMED is not yet functional.</s><s xml:id="_eUFXMjd">At the time of writing (December 2022) Google is not

allow competing app stores for their iOS and Android environments.</s><s xml:id="_nQuvfTJ">The implications of this are lesser for Google, as alternative Android app stores do exist, e.g. for free/open source apps only <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_GxWFzSw">By contrast, Apple has strongly resisted 'sideloading', i.e., the opening up of iOS to apps not provided

providing curation, oversight, triage, documentation, and complaint handling for apps.</s><s xml:id="_3AdKzVM">Such organizations could be run as for-profit entities (as are brick and mortar pharmacies in the real world), non-profits funded by grants, or national governments.</s><s xml:id="_mZGXaRG">Unlike the existing app stores, digital app pharmacies would have no fundamental conflicts of interest with developers.</s><s xml:id="_7KE5tM7">These app stores would still incur the regulatory oversight costs associated with being a medical device distributor or importer, but could recoup costs through registration fees to developers, fees charged on in-app payments, or direct fees to consumers.</s></p><p xml:id="_DGxr57r"><s xml:id="_teuebQf">A third vision of the future of EU health and wellness app stores is that the current duopoly remains, but that Google and Apple evolve their approach substantially to resolve the developing pressures and meet legislative requirements fully and transparently.</s><s xml:id="_Vu3NgWn">This would involve developing approaches to fully deliver their responsibilities as distributors and/or importers of medical device apps.</s><s xml:id="_H6xqzxb">This would increase the requirements applied to app developers at the point of submission and update to the app stores, with increased checks carried to verify regulatory conformity and assess data validating claims.</s><s xml:id="_3de8JAQ">This would require active surveillance of complaints and reviews of data by the app stores, alongside reporting of adverse or serious adverse events, as reportable by law under the MDR.</s><s xml:id="_hHXcAY8">The fulfilment of responsibilities without unfair market practices and with the avoidance of public confusion would be more likely if there was separation of app stores into clearly demarcated domains which provide: (i) prescription-only medical device apps; (ii) other medical device apps; (iii) labelled and conforming wellness apps; and, (iv) other non-regulated lifestyle applications.</s><s xml:id="_yxGR5Mk">These approaches would need to be accompanied either by divestiture of Google's and Apple's own medical device app development businesses, or the thorough separation of these businesses from their app stores business.</s><s xml:id="_KDKDj8G">The separation must be sufficient to convince app developers, EU regulators and courts that conflict of interest was adequately managed.</s><s xml:id="_CpmRega">Medical devices and wellness apps are already important to consumers, to patients and to health systems.</s><s xml:id="_XDumhAY">To enable this sector to further develop safely, these 'wild west' aspects of the market must be resolved.</s></p></div><figure
