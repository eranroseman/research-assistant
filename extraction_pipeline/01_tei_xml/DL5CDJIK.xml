<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_VYuh56F">Cost of collecting and integrating.</head><p xml:id="_SqebGKK"><s xml:id="_yN4NepH">The cost of tracking often leads to abandonment,

find tracking "a hassle," feel "lazy," or "lose interest" and stop tracking (20, 16, and 6 people).</s><s xml:id="_7uyncnX">The habit of collecting data can often be difficult to maintain in tools that require regular manual entry, such as financial spreadsheets or food journals <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>: "I got behind on keeping up with it and couldn't find the time to start back up" (p112, 18 others).</s><s xml:id="_4RBKk5U">Others find tracking too tiring "I got burnt out on [keeping a financial spreadsheet]" (p14).</s></p><p xml:id="_ZJKtCBj"><s xml:id="_MxgCFYD">Cost of having or sharing the data.</s><s xml:id="_2EKjtqc">45.2% of respondents who stopped tracking location did so due to concerns for data sharing.</s><s xml:id="_TE5nAd5">This surfaces within Li et al.'s model as part of integration between the location data collected and the social context in which it is shared <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_CaAv5aK">Although concerns with regard to privacy in location tracking and sharing are welldocumented <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, we note a connection between sharing concerns and abandonment of location self-tracking.</s><s xml:id="_TyYNtzu">People were concerned about what friends could see "I don't want people knowing where I am all the time" (p161, 11 others) as well as companies using information about them "I don't want a record of my activities being reviewed or sold to try to sell me better ads" (p61, 6 others).</s><s xml:id="_5eyE83a">Although these concerns were largely expressed by people tracking location, emerging new domains (e.g., biometric data such as heart rate or blood pressure) may present similar concerns, especially as more personal informatics tools rely on cloud storage or processing.</s></p><p xml:id="_yfxwnFp"><s xml:id="_YKJ5G7Q">Discomfort with information

"didn't like being so aware of how little money I had," while p178 stopped tracking because she "had to witness my weight fluctuations every day."</s><s xml:id="_CHam63N">For p163, entering new expenses was unpleasant: "I felt guilty every time I tracked an expense that was not a necessity."</s><s xml:id="_wGCG8yv">Prior work has found food journals can feel judgmental when people exceed their calorie budgets <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_CWf67NC">We extend this finding, noting that tools in other domains can create feelings of judgment.</s></p><p xml:id="_9cP4CYD"><s xml:id="_Phdmb9q">Abandoning tracking may be the easiest way to address this discomfort.</s><s xml:id="_xmKNVS4">p23 stopped tracking because she "felt discouraged with my lack of progress" and p3 "didn't feel like I was getting the results that I wanted."</s><s xml:id="_5ctYvDd">Tracking emphasized the difficulty of p144's circumstances and made her feel even worse about her situation: "the decision to stop tracking made me very sad, like it was the final thing in admitting how bad my [financial] situation had become."</s><s xml:id="_Ajv2vF2">When people do not feel tools help them act to change the situation, tracking may only add to their frustration.</s><s xml:id="_nvDuCWW">Data quality concerns.</s><s xml:id="_hNaf6FD">People often desire greater accuracy than their tools provide <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>: "the calories burnt seemed so random, and didn't line up with other online sources" (p123, 19 others), or find data unreliable "the GPS would lose my location and stop tracking my run" (p139), leading to imperfect personal data.</s><s xml:id="_ZDgGYUJ">This problem in collection inhibits effective reflection and consequently action.</s></p><p xml:id="_pbAtPmg"><s xml:id="_MeSEzrN">Learned enough.</s><s xml:id="_qCEP3sk">People often begin tracking to learn their habits, with a goal of action <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_URDR2TN">Moreover, Rooksby et al. find people track over short-term periods in support of long-term goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_uJ4t9tM">We also found this practice in our participants.</s><s xml:id="_sBY4626">Six people felt no reason to continue tracking after learning what they needed in order to act: "I was very familiar with the different routes I was taking when I was running, so I eventually just sort of phased out MapMyRun.</s><s xml:id="_PTdNx7w">It wasn't beneficial to me anymore" (p20).</s><s xml:id="_NtRXCFY">After people develop a skill, the potential benefits of tracking change and it can become unnecessary.</s><s xml:id="_9hRJQET">p29 "was able to figure my distance and calories burned without <ref type="bibr">[MapMyRun]</ref>" and p89 "was able to keep track [of my finances] in my head."</s><s xml:id="_mGDWbvw">Living Healthy #chi4good, CHI
