clearly preferred for receiving public health messages, in an emergency or urgent situation, nearly half (48.7 %) of respondents wanted both email and SMS to ensure they received critical messages.</s><s xml:id="_6FcuCgd">Each mode has its disadvantages which can be overcome by the other.</s><s xml:id="_ynB2Ch8">For example, email is nearly ubiquitous in the workplace, easily

dangerous to the public's safety for public health agencies to rely solely on email or SMS as, without the resources to handle continuous listserv maintenance and updating, critical messages may not be delivered.</s><s xml:id="_P9pKrP3">Adopting a system to deliver SMS messages also would require opting in and updating challenges while also introducing concerns about security and the potential for misunderstanding messages due to SMS' limited character length.</s><s xml:id="_aK4e2yc">However, given the two modes complement one another well, particularly in an emergency, utilizing both may be the most effective approach to distribute time-sensitive messages.</s><s xml:id="_dzvKKaj">It is clear research to determine the best combination for different groups of stakeholders that also

engaging stakeholders in realtime surveillance is a shared objective.</s><s xml:id="_tBc3mEz">But stakeholders must be assured that the data requested is worth submitting by public health agencies
