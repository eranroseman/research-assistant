the same label may be applied to different behaviour change techniques (BCTs) or different labels applied to the same technique.</s><s xml:id="_Z7YFyap">An example of the former is 'behavioural counseling' described both as "educating patients about the benefits of lifestyle change, encouraging them, and suggesting what changes could be made" (Steptoe, <ref type="bibr">Kerry, Rink, &amp; Hilton, 2001, p.266)</ref> and "feedback on self-monitoring record, reinforcement, recommendations for change, answers to questions, and general support" <ref type="bibr">(Tate, Jackvony, &amp; Wing, 2003</ref><ref type="bibr">, p.1834)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_wny46VP"><s xml:id="_vEhktU8">Similarly, interventions reporting the use of 'goal setting' for dietary and physical activity behaviour change interventions differ substantially from each other <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Shilts, Horowitz, &amp;
