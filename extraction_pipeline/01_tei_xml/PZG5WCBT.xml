1) absence of a single data source for all estimates, 2) small sample size for some data sources, 3) correlation of both diabetes and its comorbidities with other factors such as age and obesity, and

approach combines the etiological fractions (e) with total projected U.S. health service use (U) in 2022 for each age-group (a), sex (s), medical condition (c), and care delivery setting (H), which includes hospital inpatient, emergency room (ER), and ambulatory service (office visits and hospital outpatient/clinic visits):</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">Attributed health resource use H ¼ X

fractions, we use the 2020 Optum dNHI database and the 2020 Medicare 5% sample SAF to capture the populations insured by commercial insurance and Medicare, respectively.</s><s xml:id="_PS7Ak5y">The

MEPS.</s></p><p xml:id="_qHgXDJy"><s xml:id="_uCFXAZe">Unlike the MEPS data, the dNHI and the Medicare 5% SAF data lack information regarding race/ethnicity and certain patient characteristics that could influence both the health status of patients and their behaviors related to seeking health care.</s><s xml:id="_BAa7YSB">For the 10 comorbid conditions thought to be the largest contributors to the overall cost of diabetes (general medical condition, other chronic ischemic heart disease, myocardial infarction, heart failure, hypertension, conduction disorders and cardiac dysrhythmias, cellulitis, occlusion of cerebral arteries, end-stage renal disease, and kidney failure and its sequelae) we estimate two multivariate Poisson regressions using MEPS 2015-2019 to determine the extent to which controlling only for age and sex might bias the relative rate ratios for hospital inpatient days, emergency visits, and ambulatory visits.</s><s xml:id="_7HpZw92">First, we estimate a naive model adjusting for age and sex only, and second, we estimate a full model that includes diabetes status as an independent variable as well as known predictors of health service use including age,

on the relationship between health care use and the covariates (other than diabetes); instead, these covariates are included to control for patient characteristics not available in medical claims data that could be correlated with both medical conditions and health-seeking behavior.</s><s xml:id="_8JeXsaX">The full model omits indicators for presence of coexisting conditions or complications of diabetes (e.g., hypertension), since including such variables could downward bias the estimated relationship between diabetes and health care use for each of the 10 medical conditions.</s><s xml:id="_GADpcet">The rate ratio coefficients for the diabetes flag variable in the naive and full models are then compared.</s><s xml:id="_7v2kRjT">A comparison of the naive and fully adjusted model rate ratio coefficients suggests statistically significant overestimates of the rate ratios for emergency visits when using the naive model for six conditions.</s><s xml:id="_725hkkn">For inpatient

conditions.</s></p><p xml:id="_6NYaEAk"><s xml:id="_zTnH6jT">To minimize the risk of overestimation for these comorbid conditions, we scale the rates ratios estimated from the dNHI and Medicare 5% SAF

costs (e.g., MEPS).</s><s xml:id="_YxHbAcw">Due to the number of strata (age-group, sex, race/ ethnicity, and insurance status) our ability to distinguish race within the "Other" category is limited; for instance, to have sufficient sample size to estimate medical costs for each stratum we combined multiple years of MEPS data.</s></p><p xml:id="_qw2E7ss"><s xml:id="_eZB684z">An important limitation with regard to how disability status was captured was a change in the NHIS <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(56)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_c3z6mYT">Compared with 2017 estimates, the proportion of the population receiving SSI payment (being disabled) decreased by $50%.</s><s xml:id="_3rekxsg">This is largely due to the redesign of the NHIS questionnaire.</s><s xml:id="_36Q6xpJ">Specifically, the question about receipt of SSI payments was asked in the family survey prior to 2019; as such, the responses included the status of all family/household members and potentially overestimated the proportion receiving SSI payments.</s><s xml:id="_EXDs7CU">In 2019, the family survey was eliminated and the question about receipt of SSI payments was asked in the adult questionnaires; thus, the response might only reflect to that person's situation rather than that of the entire family.</s><s xml:id="_rMcSYvn">To assess the likelihood of being on disability as demonstrated by receipt of SSI payments, we compared likelihood of being on disability for the population with diabetes with that of the population without diabetes using a logistic regression adjusted for age-group, sex, race/ ethnicity, diagnosed hypertension status (yes/no), and body weight status (normal, overweight, obese, unknown) and found that the population with diabetes has a 1.8 percentage point higher rate of being out of the labor force and receiving disability payments compared with the population without diabetes.</s><s xml:id="_BHKEhEB">This is much lower than what was reported in 2017 (3.1 percentage points).</s></p><p xml:id="_yp7FGZs"><s xml:id="_Q3sZf3H">Lack of updated data or discontinuation of data collection stream presents challenges in capturing some cost components.</s><s xml:id="_taMHHbh">In most cases, we replicate our methods from prior reports using the most recent data available from a given survey.</s><s xml:id="_Y2X2RFj">However, in two instances we use an alternative approach.</s><s xml:id="_PxWYRku">First, in prior reports we used the NHAMCS Outpatient Department Data files to estimate outpatient health care use.</s><s xml:id="_YnUY25x">The most recent NHAMCS data were not available due to quality issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(14)</ref>, so we rely on the 2009-2011 Outpatient Department Data file for our estimates.</s><s xml:id="_5qQ6ejB">To assess robustness of this alternative approach, we also assessed the rate of change in outpatient care use from the same period, 2009-2011 to 2017-2019, in the MEPS data and observed a small (3.3%) decrease.</s><s xml:id="_a8j9nSk">This small decrease may be due to shifts in site of service over time.</s><s xml:id="_NBPekwE">The second instance where we use an alternative approach was for estimating care use in nursing home and hospice settings.</s><s xml:id="_Hphpans">The survey used to estimate hospice use in 2017 (NHHCS) was last fielded in 2007 (57).</s><s xml:id="_7VYgGeX">We apply a method similar to that used in 2017 and adjust the hospice use found in the most recent study.</s></p><p xml:id="_uDuSbSY"><s xml:id="_RS837gp">National health-related expenditures are projected to exceed $4.4 trillion in 2022 <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(58)</ref>, but slightly less than half of these expenditures are included in our analysis.</s><s xml:id="_VqHaEfj">These cost estimates omit national expenditures (and any portion of such expenditures that might be attributable to diabetes) for administering government health and private insurance programs, investment in research, overhead and infrastructure, policy efforts and diabetes-related quality measure reporting, over the counter medications, disease management and wellness programs through private insurance or community based, and office visits to nonphysician providers other than podiatrists (e.g., dentists and optometrists).</s></p><p xml:id="_HAtZEHv"><s xml:id="_q3SuSJb">Nevertheless, using a methodology that is largely consistent with our previous studies conducted in 2012 and 2017, and with updated national survey and claims data sources, we

diabetes increase.</s><s xml:id="_TsUy3kA">The estimates presented here show that diabetes continues to place an enormous burden on societyboth in the economic terms presented here and in reduced quality of life.</s><s xml:id="_TpG2Fdg">Future research should include exploration of the costs and benefits of new therapies, devices, and intervention modalities that can potentially prevent
