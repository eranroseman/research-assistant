success in Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) viral suppression, reduced the incidence of Acquired Immunodeficiency Virus (AIDS)-defining illnesses, and improved quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_XHrCwAF">In recent times, ART has also been identified as a potent intervention to reduce the transmission of HIV among HIV serodiscordant couples <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_h5nWXnc">Optimal adherence to ART has however emerged as a key determinant of ART's success <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_N6WnHfE">It is therefore desirable to provide adherence support for patients receiving ART to help preserve the effectiveness of first-line ART regimens.</s></p><p xml:id="_fngJgCF"><s xml:id="_eMENtDF">Several approaches, ranging from the simplification of dosing schedules to the design of complex adherence interventions have been developed <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SqZy7R7">Among these interventions, mobile phones have emerged as a potentially more effective adherence support strategy <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> due to its increasing penetration rate, relatively low cost, convenience and the ability to offer varied communication approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gy3DxVQ">Mobile phone coverage is now near ubiquitous, with an estimated 95% of the global population living in an area covered by a basic 2G mobilecellular network <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_VykdUdY">With documented evidence of its use in the management of several chronic conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, mobile phones will be essential in facilitating the attainment of the 17 sustainable development goals (SDGs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_VTADxwp"><s xml:id="_545DQBG">Unfortunately, the quality of evidence and the strength of recommendations of existing studies and reviews do not support the widespread adoption of mobile phone interventions in ART adherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_dEhFmhq">The recommendations from the two reviews (which included only RCTs and SMS-based interventions) may be limited to high literate populations who might already be familiar with sending and receiving text messages.</s><s xml:id="_4UGN6tJ">The situation is summarised by two systematic reviews, which concluded that 'mobile SMS is effective in improving adherence to ART <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>'.</s><s xml:id="_nHWDagN">In the first systematic review, (carried out in 2012), Horvath and his colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> utilised the standard Cochrane review approach to identify studies utilising mobile phones for ART adherence.</s><s xml:id="_XhBCGkY">However, only two studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> met its strict inclusion criteria (only randomised controlled trials <ref type="bibr">[RCT]</ref> utilising SMS messaging as an intervention).</s><s xml:id="_DZNRKhH">The authors found evidence of efficacy in using short weekly messages.</s><s xml:id="_vdWy3tZ">The publication was followed by a recommendation by the World Health Organisation to consider text messaging 'for promoting adherence to ART as part of adherence interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_8QFDmZj"><s xml:id="_8PAG5Hj">Newer studies on SMS interventions have produced more contradictory results.</s><s xml:id="_Jr6K7Ez">The inconclusive findings, coupled with a need to determine the specific components of text-messaging trials that provided the observed effects, led to a second systematic review in 2014 by Finitsis et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SMmvbnU">The eight RCTs that met the inclusion criteria found text-messaging interventions to be effective in supporting antiretroviral therapy adherence.</s><s xml:id="_XMuN89d">Through sensitivity analyses, this review further reported on key design elements of the intervention that can potentially enhance the observed effects.</s><s xml:id="_Eh4B7Kz">These design elements include frequency of message delivery, directionality, tailoring of message content and matching the message to dosing timing.</s><s xml:id="_nQTjH8d">The literature so far has been inconclusive on these, and the authors recommended further exploration of these areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> Despite the quality evidence generated by the two reviews, it remains unclear if the efficacies observed in these RCTs translates into effectiveness in broader and more realistic settings.</s><s xml:id="_BkWdzuF">While recommending RCTs to ascertain intervention's effectiveness, attention could be paid to other forms of evidence (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_NHfYTcz">prospective cohort studies and pragmatic trials) that permit assessment of patients in their natural settings for longer periods.</s></p><p xml:id="_QX4Ny5z"><s xml:id="_Vf9kQzR">Another real-world implementation dimension not addressed in the existing reviews is how SMS-based intervention may be implemented in low literacy populations.</s><s xml:id="_ebS29xS">With emerging evidence suggesting that designs that encourage two-way communication may exhibit better outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, low literate populations may not benefit from the SMS-based intervention.</s><s xml:id="_JMM5ggE">A promising approach that may enhance engagement in this population is a phone call intervention.</s><s xml:id="_Hg22kU9">A preference for phone calls over text messages in populations with low-literacy and resource-constraint settings has been reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fQVcaFp">The limitations of existing SRs and the rate of incoming evidence calls for a more inclusive, up-to-date review that incorporates other forms of evidence.</s><s xml:id="_bHbbYM3">Our review adopts a broader scope to include mobile phone voice calls and non-RCTs.</s><s xml:id="_sdm4QHz">Findings of the current study will fill an essential gap in prior reviews that relied solely on SMS reminders and SMS-based interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr"
