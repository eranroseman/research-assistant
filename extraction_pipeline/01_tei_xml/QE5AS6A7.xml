<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="_2M4cBnk"><p xml:id="_nQTFkKm"><s xml:id="_aunUNDt">Men who have sex with men (MSM) remain the population at highest risk for HIV infection in the USA, comprising 67% of all new infections in 2014 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_avzU42n">Consequently, HIV prevention interventions aimed at reducing sexual risk behaviors among MSM have been deployed since the beginning of the epidemic, and they remain a cornerstone of the national approach to controlling HIV today <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WvxaJUr">One common feature of behavioral HIV prevention interventions targeting MSM and other at-risk populations is that they are grounded in health behavior theories that emphasize the importance of cognitive variables in influencing sexual risk behavior (e.g., information, perceived severity and susceptibility, self-efficacy for enacting behavioral skills).</s><s xml:id="_zQMzjd3">However, empirical support for these theories' utility in predicting sexual risk is largely limited to cross-sectional research, and results from stronger designs (e.g., longitudinal or experimental) are much more mixed, suggesting that additional, as yet unidentified, processes operate to drive decisions about sexual behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_WV66JV5"><s xml:id="_Gx32F8y">Deploying information or behavioral skills toward precautionary behaviors during a sexual encounter is a complex self-regulatory task, requiring recruitment of a number of neurocognitive resources.</s><s xml:id="_54x57Z5">Prominent among the resources necessary for self-regulation is executive functioning (EF).</s><s xml:id="_SKwRS8h">EF is an umbrella term for a set of neurocognitive processes that allow one to plan, organize, and execute mental and behavioral actions that are adaptive, goal-directed, future-oriented, and socially informed <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_yAg3pn6">Although it is generally agreed that many hierarchically organized and highly discrete cognitive processes fall under this umbrella, there is no clear agreement across various psychological disciplines as to what processes should be included and how they should be organized.</s><s xml:id="_YchhQKG">For the purpose of this study, we utilize a comprehensive model <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> that builds on the tradition of clinical neuropsychology.</s><s xml:id="_gJMStgR">Based on this model, several larger subdomains of EF can be identified.</s><s xml:id="_Z8WEQJb">These include abstract reasoning, initiation and maintenance of adaptive action, selection of adaptive responses, and the ability to prospectively remember what actions need to be taken next <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_6sdKJub"><s xml:id="_ZMYYKJR">Although EF is increasingly appreciated as central to enacting health behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, one recent review failed to identify even a single study examining EF and sexual risk among healthy, nonsubstance-using adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_AjxvnJN">However, limited evidence from substance-using populations suggests that a link does exist.</s><s xml:id="_AJNu3BP">In one study of substance-using MSM, researchers found that men who performed poorly across several tests of EF reported greater risk behavior than other men in the sample <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rf6jx96">Another study of substance users found that more impulsive individuals (assessed with the Go/No-Go task) had a stronger association between frequency of substance use and sexual risk behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ww2aY6v">Two studies of HIV-infected substance users revealed that individuals with better decision-making performance (assessed with the Iowa Gambling task) had stronger associations of sensation seeking and emotional distress with sexual risk behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WHga8Zc">This work suggests that EF might be an individual difference contributing to people's varying capacities to engage in safe sexual behavior.</s><s xml:id="_wbV73PX">However, problems exist in generalizing from research on high substance users to other populations, given the complex, bidirectional manner in which substance use and EF affect one another <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_n6xfmE2">Thus, we propose to study this phenomenon in an adult sample of MSM who were not preselected for any other risk factors.</s></p><p xml:id="_HM3UhEq"><s xml:id="_Vg9TV4b">Although EF can be conceptualized as a stable trait, it also fluctuates as a state.</s><s xml:id="_wa86WmD">Specifically, EF capacity fluctuates in response to acute stressors such as lack of sleep <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, or the need to engage in emotional regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EjfBN88">Such fluctuations are sometimes conceptualized as "depletion" of EF resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9JaGyKJ">Furthermore, individuals also vary in the degree to which their cognitive performance fluctuates <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and such individual differences in fluctuation may be clinically meaningful.</s><s xml:id="_PAJaPsF">In fact, cognitive intraindividual variability is a risk factor for both morbidity and mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and for abnormal cognitive decline <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8prFTQC">In other words, people appear to vary in their susceptibility to EF depletion, such that more susceptible individuals have less capacity to sustain and engage EF during activities that are cognitively or interpersonally challenging.</s><s xml:id="_y457cHh">In turn, periods of EF depletion could lead to lapses in enacting precautionary measures during a sexual encounter.</s><s xml:id="_U2a9aJu">In fact, in an experimental depletion paradigm, participants in the experimental condition that was designed to deplete EF resources exhibited greater tendency to engage in inappropriate sexual behavior as compared with their nondepleted counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_3Gycy5n"><s xml:id="_Wkt5zxq">This study aimed to test the hypotheses that condomless anal intercourse (CAI) relates to (a) individual difference in trait EF (assessed at baseline), and (b) individual differences in the "depletability" of state EF (assessed after exposure to a stressor).</s><s xml:id="_gez8Fy6">We hypothesized that individuals with poorer baseline levels of EF (i.e., trait EF), as well as those whose EF was more depleted by the stressful task (i.e., state EF depletion), would be most likely to engage in CAI.</s></p></div>

thus, these variables might form a complex triad, making it difficult to disentangle the effects of EF alone.</s><s xml:id="_Wyn9yH3">Finally, it is possible that EF simply is not strongly associated with sexual risk behavior when it is assessed in an untaxed state among young adults not preselected for substances use.</s></p><p xml:id="_BXjWqEf"><s xml:id="_EbnwAR7">These findings must be qualified by several limitations.</s><s xml:id="_qBgbdf7">First, our assessment of EF was abbreviated, and our composite measure had a lower reliability than we expected based on our previous research.</s><s xml:id="_XCgN8YW">Thus, although we utilized several subtests of a well-established battery, we did not tap all cognitive domains that contributed to EF, leaving open the possibility that unassessed domains might show different associations with CAI.</s><s xml:id="_jvckAPv">Despite this, our study actually represents an improvement over much of the literature in this area, which commonly relies on just one or two tasks to assess EF and provides no control for lower order CP.</s><s xml:id="_vvSMhMY">Additionally, this study utilized a relatively small sample that reported generally low levels of sexual risk behavior, leaving us underpowered to detect small effects.</s><s xml:id="_PK5AWUB">Our assessment of sexual behavior also did not include questions about the relatively recent addition of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) as an HIV prevention strategy.</s><s xml:id="_v6C8gy5">Thus, some of the men engaging in CAI in our sample might have been using PrEP, reducing their risk for HIV (but not other sexually transmitted infections).</s><s xml:id="_w34bxF9">Another limitation is that our design did not compare the impact of a stressor task between test administrations to a control task.</s><s xml:id="_5TAU9Cg">Thus, we cannot be certain what changes in cognitive performance we might have seen had the participants not engaged in the stressful task, and we can only speculate that differences in performance across categories of risk were related to depletion caused by the stressor task.</s><s xml:id="_kpQ2856">Future research exploring this possibility should test the impact of different kinds of tasks, varying level, and type of stressor to more carefully pinpoint which kinds of tasks are truly depleting for men with varying histories of risk behavior.</s><s xml:id="_vZ9Cfua">Moreover, because anti-gay "minority stress" might make MSM more vulnerable to rejection sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, future work should examine whether the effects we observed generalize to other populations, including MSM who do not identify as gay or bisexual.</s><s xml:id="_YmhAFpQ">Finally, the oft-cited phenomenon of "ego depletion" has been criticized recently with a new work suggesting that the effects may not be as robust as once thought <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_6n3JfPT">EF depletion is a much more specific neurocognitive phenomenon, with an evidence base distinct from that supporting ego depletion.</s><s xml:id="_fH8z7Ra">Nevertheless, the application of EF depletion to sexual risk behavior does imply that the state decreases in EF contribute to broader self-regulatory challenges, and the field faces unresolved questions about what domains of self-regulation are truly "depletable," and what those changes mean for subsequent real-world behavior.</s></p><p xml:id="_RNAFdv3"><s xml:id="_zzaVX5D">This preliminary study is the first of which we are aware to examine associations between EF and sexual risk behavior in a sample of adults without documented substance use challenges.</s><s xml:id="_EZK4KXK">Should future research corroborate the idea that stressful interpersonal interactions deplete some individuals in a manner that makes it harder for them to maintain sexual safety, interventions will need to adapt accordingly.</s><s xml:id="_3P8YNZs">For example, execution of precautionary behaviors that occur outside of a sexual encounter (e.g., taking PrEP) might be a better option for individuals who struggle with executive control in challenging situations.</s><s xml:id="_7m2jPtW">Alternately, interventions might double down on the activities that emphasize building habits (e.g., repeated rehearsal of behaviors) that rely less on sustained EF in a sexual encounter.</s><s xml:id="_7gpMaUC">Exploration of these and other possibilities will be a priority as we build a greater evidence base for understanding the role of EF in sexual behaviors.</s></p></div>
