Mercer Kollar, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Wansink &amp; Pope, 2014)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_CM7PEMH">In addition, the risk-framing hypothesis has made its way into a number of handbooks for undergraduates (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Holtzhausen &amp;

Salovey, 1997, p. 5</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_MWuhBjm">However, they then continued their reasoning without ascribing much importance to this difference.</s><s xml:id="_82m8Kgc">But conceptualising risk in terms of perceived danger rather than in terms of uncertainty makes a world of difference.</s><s xml:id="_JFxguNY">To illustrate this, let us investigate the claim that detection and prevention behaviours differ in 'perceived risk'.</s></p><p xml:id="_u8JCxW7"><s xml:id="_xzPZF7W">Most likely, the reason that the risk-framing hypothesis has remained so popular with researchers is the fact that it offers such clear-cut recommendations: use gain-framed information with prevention behaviours and use loss-framed information with detection behaviours.</s><s xml:id="_GP2JHKD">But how plausible is it exactly that prevention and detection behaviours differ in perceived risk?</s><s xml:id="_axP7AGS">If perceived risk is construed as 'the possibility of something bad happening', then indeed an argument can be made that people find detection behaviour 'risky'.</s><s xml:id="_SeKNsEe">If, however, we conceptualise risk as uncertainty, as prospect theory does, then the difference between detection and prevention behaviour is not so straightforward at all.</s></p><p xml:id="_27j9zRy"><s xml:id="_H8Ffka9">To be sure, there is a lot of uncertainty involved in detection behaviours.</s><s xml:id="_N4GkEA5">In the short term, no one can be sure whether self-examination or screening will result in finding potential symptoms.</s><s xml:id="_JMkH5Fa">In the longer term, finding potential symptoms is no guarantee for effective treatment, and not finding any potential symptoms is no guarantee of living a long, healthy life.</s></p><p xml:id="_YcYanHW"><s xml:id="_jHnNVj7">But the question is not whether detection behaviour involves uncertainty; the question is whether engaging in detection behaviour can be construed as resulting in more uncertainty relative to not engaging in detection behaviour.</s><s xml:id="_W3ycAUZ">Only then can detection behaviour be considered as the option with truly uncertain consequences in contrast to the certain consequences of the alternative option of not engaging in detection behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(O'Keefe &amp; Jensen, 2007)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_axtZttR">There is no empirical evidence for this, and it hardly seems plausible.</s><s xml:id="_cngJ92e">In fact, one might argue that engaging in detection behaviour is actually an attempt to reduce uncertainty regarding one's health status <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Cox et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Levin, Schneider, &amp; Gaeth, 1998)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_GbXkYDn"><s xml:id="_SY4gfF7">To a lesser extent, this reasoning applies to prevention behaviours: although people may engage in prevention behaviours to avoid disease, both engaging and not engaging in prevention behaviours can have a whole range of unforeseen and uncertain consequences.</s><s xml:id="_sqg53w7">It thus seems that, in the attempt to derive the risk-framing hypothesis from prospect theory, 'key aspects of prospect theory [ … ] were lost in translation' <ref type="bibr">(Cox et al., 2006, p. 89)</ref>.</s></p></div>

the nature of the message-framing paradigm (gain-vs.</s><s xml:id="_pJfyuV9">loss-framed messages containing essentially equivalent information) is bound to result in small effects.</s><s xml:id="_UgEXk2r">If participants in all conditions receive the same information, it cannot be expected that there will be large differences in persuasive outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_Pq6jb3M">Even small effects, however, may translate to substantial changes at the population level.</s><s xml:id="_ZG7c8DC">In addition, small shifts in one variable can have important effects over time if they are self-reinforcing (cf.</s><s xml:id="_s6CpfUX"><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Slater, 2007)</ref> or if they influence other important variables (cf.</s><s xml:id="_emFdVd8"><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Gerbner, Gross, Morgan, Signorielli, &amp; Shanahan, 2002)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ddrYj5m">Rather than discarding message framing as not consequential, it is therefore warranted to understand its effects, even as these are expected to be small.</s><s xml:id="_xYfSsXs">In fact, we argue that researchers should embrace this 'smallness'.</s><s xml:id="_Msf4AM3">Only after we have achieved a better understanding of the small immediate effects of message framing can we hope to investigate how these effects can translate into behaviour at the population level over time.</s></p><p xml:id="_AWQxwWW"><s xml:id="_fYrbgVr">Unfortunately, the research into these small effects is hampered by studies employing long health messages in which a number of things are going on that could potentially affect the way recipients process, understand or react to it.</s><s xml:id="_BjKYYr5">Therefore, we propose a message-framing research agenda where researchers focus on the details of framed messages and the subtle effects that these details can have.</s></p><p xml:id="_MBaJAuZ"><s xml:id="_brY2BVv">For instance, recipients can be influenced by 'antecedent framing', but also by 'consequent framing'.</s><s xml:id="_NAx8mdy">To understand what we mean by this, consider the following sentence that is typical of messages used in message-framing research: 'If you quit smoking, your chance of lung cancer will decrease'.</s><s xml:id="_j9twHf6">The sentence basically constitutes a conditional proposition with an antecedent ('if you quit smoking') and a consequent ('your chance of lung cancer will decrease').</s><s xml:id="_JPdxcp3">Message framing is often understood as antecedent framing, where the loss-framed equivalent of the above-mentioned sentence would be: 'If you don't quit smoking, your chance of lung cancer will increase'.</s><s xml:id="_75PvCc8">But O' <ref type="bibr">Keefe and Jensen (2006)</ref> have already pointed out that, besides the antecedents, the choice of consequents can also affect the persuasive effects of health messages.</s><s xml:id="_v2eZ8He">Here, the consequents of the recipients' behaviour are cast in essentially negative terms, referring to his or her chance to get lung cancer.</s><s xml:id="_hZGU4Wc">But they could just as well be cast in positive terms, as in: 'If you quit smoking, your chance of a healthy life will increase'.</s><s xml:id="_cYmZc3y">In fact, if we would contrast this latter sentence with our original one, we are in fact not engaging in antecedent framing, but in consequent framing, where the consequents of the decision are framed positively or negatively.</s></p><p xml:id="_UdX7fZU"><s xml:id="_HrGnPWj">Research suggests that consequent framing matters.</s><s xml:id="_dsJTBad">For instance, one study found that, when consequents were framed positively, positive antecedent framing (e.g., 'If you perform the healthy behaviour') was more effective than negative antecedent framing (e.g., 'If you don't perform the healthy behaviour'), while the reverse was true when consequents were framed negatively <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Cesario, Grant, &amp; Higgins, 2004)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_YQZvXWx">In general, however, the issue of antecedent and consequent framing is ignored in the message-framing literature.</s><s xml:id="_PS4PURj">In fact, it is quite common to confound antecedent framing and consequent framing in message framing experiments.</s><s xml:id="_kJr7d5W">For example, one study employed a gain-framed message that was entitled 'Great Breath, Healthy Gums Only a Floss Away', while the loss-framed message was entitled 'Floss Now and Avoid Bad Breath and Gum Disease' <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mann, Sherman, &amp; Updegraff, 2004)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_jCBmUs2">The gain-framed message included the phrase 'flossing your teeth daily [ … ] promotes great breath', while the equivalent phrase in the loss-framed message was 'if you don't floss your teeth daily [this] causes bad breath'.</s><s xml:id="_TFV63qk">In this study, then, antecedent framing and consequent framing were clearly confounded.</s><s xml:id="_HS3hSmE">To increase our understanding of message-framing effects, we argue that antecedent framing and consequent framing should be manipulated and investigated independently from each other (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Cesario et al., 2004)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_amZPzvA"><s xml:id="_GDUT2Am">But the challenge does not stop there.</s><s xml:id="_7unwnTu">The use of negations is another issue that deserves attention in message-framing research.</s><s xml:id="_r8q9f6d">Consider again our gain-and loss-framed sentences on smoking cessation above and notice that the loss-framed sentence includes a negation ('if you don't'), whereas the gain-framed sentence does not.</s><s xml:id="_Y2xrVEC">Research has shown that including negations in verbal material slows down information processing and makes it more error-prone <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Clark &amp; Chase, 1972;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Deutsch, Kordts-Freudinger, Gawronski, &amp; Strack, 2009)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fEf6Bn5">Thus, stressing the consequences of quitting smoking may be objectively equivalent to stressing the consequences of not quitting smoking, but the use of negations in the loss-framed message may cause the resulting psychological processes to be divergent.</s><s xml:id="_uX9P82u">Unfortunately, message framing is confounded with the use of negations in most studies.</s><s xml:id="_c55CtgN">For instance, the study referred to above included negations in the loss-framed message, but not in the gain-framed message.</s></p><p xml:id="_nrVugMw"><s xml:id="_mPdTxvy">Of course, researchers could choose to apply antecedent framing without the use of negations.</s><s xml:id="_PVEHMFk">The loss-framed sentence in our example would then be: 'If you continue to smoke, your chance of lung cancer will increase'.</s><s xml:id="_c68JTf6">But it is far from clear that distinct phrases will be perceived in the same way.</s><s xml:id="_AeTVRxX">After all, it is known that asking people whether something should be 'allowed' can yield vastly different results from asking whether the same thing should 'not be forbidden'.</s><s xml:id="_DG3SDJs">It seems that these two constructs, while logically equivalent, carry different meanings for most people <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Holleman, 2006)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5jZ5Hnu">So who is to say that 'quitting smoking' and 'not continuing smoking' are perceived as equivalent in people's minds?</s><s xml:id="_yt4PbSt">And who is to say that '[not obtaining] great breath' is perceived as equivalent to 'avoiding bad breath'?</s><s xml:id="_8jVWvKa">In other words, in one single study <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Mann et al., 2004)</ref>, antecedent framing was confounded with consequent framing, the use of negations and distinct phrasing.</s><s xml:id="_JxpcP6C">Although not all message-framing publications provide the full texts of the employed messages, we suspect that such confounds are extremely common in messageframing studies, profoundly complicating the enterprise of trying to understand what goes on in message-framing effects.</s></p><p xml:id="_M66CBpP"><s xml:id="_e4m8tmW">In sum, we suggest that subtle differences in a health-promoting message beside its frame may influence recipients' reactions to the message.</s><s xml:id="_8xgP36k">Unfortunately, traditional message-framing research is poorly equipped to deal with this complexity.</s><s xml:id="_MbNNMVj">A single gain-framed message of perhaps 200 words contains a number of things that can have some effect on the recipients.</s><s xml:id="_sd8p7nW">In most studies, then, it is impossible to tease out which of these factors caused the effect.</s><s xml:id="_EYcuSAq">We argue that the way around this is to conduct particularly fine-grained analyses, employing controlled settings and responsive outcome measures.</s><s xml:id="_Ng8k5Zg">Perhaps most importantly, 'pure' manipulations are necessary, in which antecedent framing is not confounded with consequent framing, negations or other important factors.</s><s xml:id="_GtTe8Qd">As an example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Brüll, Ruiter, and Jansma (2016)</ref> conducted a first EEG-study in which they investigated the effect of single sentences which were either gain-or loss-framed on event-related potentials (ERPs) known to be relevant for language processing.</s><s xml:id="_z4xgrY9">Their results showed that sentences with negations and, independently, loss-framed sentences elicited ERPs usually associated with processing difficulties, leading the authors to conclude that affirmed gain frames may lead to improved processing.</s></p><p xml:id="_jmYsU3s"><s xml:id="_XR6ktjU">The leap from processing a single sentence to the decision to change one's behaviour is substantial.</s><s xml:id="_cyxBfNr">So we understand that research focusing on the small effects of subtle manipulations may not be very inspiring to those who want to conduct research that can lead to immediate improvements of health-promotion practice.</s><s xml:id="_HmRBVTd">But we argue that an in-depth analysis of message framing is more worthwhile than another large-scale field experiment using 200-word messages and behavioural outcome measures.</s><s xml:id="_HhAGqSQ">In the long run, the more granular approach may provide a better path to understanding how message framing can influence recipients in subtle but consistent ways.</s><s xml:id="_vXSFqVG">When this is the case, follow-up studies can investigate how these subtle effects influence actual health behaviour.</s></p><p xml:id="_eg9PSr7"><s xml:id="_ZJFFYVy">Regardless of one's opinion of these suggestions, which space will not allow us to elaborate on further, the present article clearly shows that there is no convincing support, either theoretical or empirical, for the risk-framing hypothesis.</s><s xml:id="_EkPcP3x">While the risk-framing hypothesis has been central to message-framing research for the past 15 years and can be considered established doctrine in the health message-framing field, the present article shows it is time that researchers turn their attention to other hypotheses in the field of message framing.</s></p></div>			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" xml:id="foot_0"><p xml:id="_jBewxGb"><s
