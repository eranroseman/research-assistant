<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_27FMHmM">Introduction</head><p xml:id="_kwB8XAB"><s xml:id="_NyF4SW8">Following the proliferation of smartphones and other smart devices into people's everyday lives during the last decade, mobile app stores (eg, the Apple App Store and Google Play Store) now provide users with a plethora of different health-related mobile apps (mHealth apps) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_JsYPsvE">Typical mHealth apps available on these stores include apps that support users in pursuing healthy diets <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, apps that motivate their users to increase their physical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, or apps that help managing chronic diseases properly <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, to name but a few.</s><s xml:id="_8NCFNVP">Surveys show that 58.23% (934/1604) of US smartphone users have downloaded at least one such mHealth app to their smartphones in the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>, making mHealth apps a multibillion Dollar business with annual growth rates of 30% or more <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9EH4CeC">Yet, despite mHealth apps' potential to positively influence users' health behavior and their high download numbers, research also suggests that in the past a majority of users have failed to frequently use such apps or even stopped using them after a short period, for example, due to high data entry burden, or loss of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_tfQJJXg"><s xml:id="_cFJ3mHe">Gamification presents itself as a promising approach to overcome a loss of interest, increase user engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, raise the quality of health behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and motivate users to use mHealth apps for a sustained period <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_H6VTz6J">It refers to the overall proliferation of games in culture, society, and technology and describes that technologies are being transformed and designed to afford positive experiences, motivational enforcement, and skill accruement <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hWKQp5k">Drawing on the motivational potential of (video) games to foster certain health behavior outcomes has a long tradition in health care.</s><s xml:id="_QY9XjaV">The development of so-called serious games (ie, "games that do not have entertainment, enjoyment or fun as their primary purpose" <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>), for example, can be traced back as far as to the 1970s <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_pWC5FxR">Standing in the long tradition of gaming in health care, gamification has rapidly gained interest by health care researchers and professionals over the last decade.</s><s xml:id="_zyDagbX">While some health behaviors, such as exercise and exercise programs in themselves are pervasively gameful in nature, mHealth apps supporting such behaviors are increasingly and more explicitly gamified further <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_uuJVaB3"><s xml:id="_nxJWDge">Research on gamification and its design is still in its infancy and rapidly evolving.</s><s xml:id="_SwYaM9m">Researchers increasingly recognize methodological shortcomings of existing studies on the effectiveness of gamification and that research on gamification has mainly advanced without an agenda, theoretical guidance, or a clear picture of the field <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7Q4vPNg">What we actually know about the phenomenon today stems from fragmented pieces of knowledge, and a variety of different perspectives <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_eDP3ret">One of these perspectives has led to the development of a variety of frameworks and processes for designing and implementing effective gamification (see Mora et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and Morschheuser et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> for an overview).</s><s xml:id="_KPT2UBJ">Another perspective is concerned with providing means (eg, taxonomies) to conceptually classify existing gamification approaches (eg, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_JmPkdF7">However, these research streams usually produce research results based on research prototypes.</s><s xml:id="_FYE6w2p">While experiments on simple prototypes of gamification may improve the internal validity of the corpus of gamification research on how any specific gamification features affect behavior, the state of the apps of gamification in practice may differ from research prototypes.</s><s xml:id="_mDPj3b3">Therefore, research is needed to map the types of gamification available and improve the possible external validity as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ZrqpR92">In order to better grasp the phenomenon of gamification and its influence on peoples' health behavior through mHealth apps in practice, we currently lack knowledge about how gamification is actually implemented in real-world mHealth apps and whether certain industry best practices have emerged.</s><s xml:id="_Eu42WSa">From our point of view, research and practice will benefit from such knowledge for various reasons.</s><s xml:id="_s3jS734">First, in conjunction with conceptual design knowledge, such deeper knowledge on gamification approaches in pertinent, real-world mHealth apps can guide developers in designing and implementing suitable gamification approaches with regard to their targeted health behavior and aid them in unleashing the full motivational potential of gamified mHealth apps.</s><s xml:id="_nWDUnv7">Second, for researchers in the field of gamified mHealth apps, such knowledge can serve as an indicator that shows whether, and if so, how extant research insights into the design of effective gamification in mHealth apps have been transferred to real-world systems.</s><s xml:id="_eyHGN8R">Third, such research contributes to a deeper understanding of the interplay between the effectiveness of gamification and its application context because it helps to get a better picture of whether certain gamification approaches have shown to be particularly suitable for certain health behaviors in practice.</s><s xml:id="_8acChKw">Providing practitioners and researchers with such knowledge requires scrutinizing the status quo of and understanding which, if any, dominant gamification approaches are being designed and implemented in mHealth apps.</s><s xml:id="_4hQkT6e">We therefore ask: (Research Question) What are dominant gamification approaches in mHealth apps?</s></p><p xml:id="_6Mm3mWv"><s xml:id="_QFsUGyS">In literature, several studies exist that apply gamification to mHealth apps.</s><s xml:id="_gbMbpzu">However, most studies investigate the psychological or behavioral effects that occur when introducing specific game design elements (eg, points, leaderboards) or a combination of different elements to a certain mHealth app <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_MG88pQ6">The stream of research that is closest to our work has been concerned with investigating the extent to which game design elements have been implemented in real-world mHealth apps and analyzing their relationships to various other constructs such as app popularity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, user ratings <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>, or the use of health behavior theory constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gjrwd2n">To the best of our knowledge, no research exists that has explicitly examined the emergence of specific dominant gamification approaches in the domain of mHealth apps and the relationship to their targeted health behaviors.</s></p><p xml:id="_dyFDg9w"><s xml:id="_9MHr9XJ">In order to answer our research question, we draw on the taxonomy of gamification approaches in mHealth apps proposed by Schmidt-Kraepelin et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_yTWPkf2">The taxonomy enables us to classify gamification approaches employed in pertinent gamified mHealth apps from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store.</s><s xml:id="_aktkGEA">In addition, we use the 2-step clustering approach of Punj and Stewart <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, which has been employed in similar research <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>, for identifying archetypes of gamification approaches in pertinent mHealth apps.</s><s xml:id="_JbWn7h4">In doing so, we are able to unveil established best practices in the design and implementation of gamification for mHealth apps and to analyze to what extent those gamification approaches are influenced by the underlying desired health-related outcomes.</s></p></div>

motivational affordances.</s><s xml:id="_q6Bkvcp">Gamification cannot only be applied with regard to a lot of different health-related outcomes, but it can also come in various forms and shapes.</s></p><p xml:id="_Dmp5Brg"><s xml:id="_B8XZA8J">Second, our results also indicate a close relationship between the identified archetypes of gamification approaches in mHealth apps and the actual health behavior change that is being targeted by such mHealth apps.</s><s xml:id="_5bvfxR6">We further analyzed this finding by investigating the relationship between the most significant archetype characteristics and the targeted health behavior.</s><s xml:id="_RZn4e4c">The results of this additional analysis, in general, support our findings (cf.</s><s xml:id="_F6R7Sk2">Multimedia Appendices 9 and 10).</s><s xml:id="_MymNn3s">It is noticeable that certain archetypes of gamification approaches are in practice primarily used for certain health behavior changes.</s><s xml:id="_J5zHff7">For developers of gamified mHealth apps these insights provide valuable points of reference for implementing gamification that targets to support a specific health behavior.</s><s xml:id="_Dm3Myh3">For example, when it comes to getting people to live a more active life and increase their physical activity, our results indicate that archetype 1 and archetype 2 are implemented frequently.</s><s xml:id="_uMeKe4n">These gamification approaches are characterized by a high degree of competition, which could be inappropriate in other, more serious, health contexts and could even lead to negative effects (eg, demoralization of users due to overemphasizing of peer pressure) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5Gg7s2M">The two archetypes differ in particular with regard to the dimension of goal setting (ie, whether goals are set by the user or determined externally) and collaboration (ie, whether collaboration is cooperative, supportive only, or no possibility for collaboration is implemented).</s><s xml:id="_N7xfVwB">A completely different form of gamification approaches, however, is used in apps that are intended to support future health professionals in their training.</s><s xml:id="_GAFmMJd">These typically implement archetype 7 and archetype 8.</s><s xml:id="_VZtFTMR">They are characterized by the fact that the goals to be achieved are set externally and the narrative is episodic.</s><s xml:id="_rNrdn9Y">However, both archetypes are also fundamentally different in some characteristics.</s><s xml:id="_4dHJrCp">For example, while archetype 7 does not offer any type of rewards and draws only on presentational user advancement, archetype 8 aims to motivate their users with internal rewards and adjust difficulty levels in a progressive user advancement.</s><s xml:id="_WkbWQ5c">In contrast to the previously discussed gamification approaches for fitness apps, archetype 7 and archetype 8 do not provide any form of competition.</s><s xml:id="_6MWcHF5">This could be an expression of the fact that the use of competition in learning environments is often seen as problematic and controversial in research <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hn6U8qB">On the one hand, researchers report that competition is used in classrooms to draw the attention of learners and motivate learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_y2V6g8s">On the other hand, researchers have often raised concerns that incautious implementations of competition in educational settings may create anxiety and impede performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_f223bdH">Also, other clusters indicate a close relationship between the targeted health behavior and the implemented gamification approach.</s><s xml:id="_Q3TGKdS">For example, when it comes to support mental health activities (archetype 5), developers of gamified mHealth apps primarily avoid using gamification that potentially puts additional pressure on users (eg, competition, externally set goals) and instead aim to foster positive experiences by allowing self-set goals and collaboration.</s><s xml:id="_HV4XXF8">For health behaviors that require continuous assistance (archetype 6: eg, chronic disease management, medication adherence), especially continuous narratives seem to be a popular approach to meet users' motivational needs.</s><s xml:id="_s5eexDX">By contrast, developers of mHealth apps that implement this archetype primarily do not use elements of competition or any type of rewards.</s><s xml:id="_sStGDaS">Contrasting the previously discussed archetypes, the range of targeted health behaviors for archetype 3 and archetype 4 is substantially broader.</s><s xml:id="_FT7sc8k">Instead of being tightly related to a specific health behavior, these archetypes seem to be applicable for various different health behaviors.</s><s xml:id="_hSyWGNp">For example, archetype 3 uses episodic narratives in order to motivate users to stay compliant with a temporary health behavior (eg, following pregnancy guidelines).</s><s xml:id="_97mQMRw">By contrast, apps that implement archetype 4 draw on gamification approaches that are inherently related to the targeted health behavior in order to motivate users to achieve externally set goals (eg, completing a specific 30 days fitness challenge).</s></p><p xml:id="_9J5SYRf"><s xml:id="_2DMPNvA">Third, the manual analysis and interpretation of our 8-cluster solution indicates that archetypes of gamification approaches for mHealth apps seem to be less clearly definable in comparison to other use cases of this method (in this regard, we particularly refer to the studies by Thiebes et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and Remane et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_HxRPjSd">This observation is also supported by statistical indicators.</s><s xml:id="_xJYasuA">For example, in our study of gamification approaches for mHealth apps the analysis of the dendrogram resulted in considerably more cluster sizes as suitable candidates than the dendrogram in the study by Thiebes et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_d6cND2X">A similar picture was drawn when applying the elbow rule (ie, comparing the slopes of cluster size candidates within the scree plots), where the 6-cluster solution was clearly identified as the dominating solution by Thiebes et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, while we were left with multiple possible solutions that performed relatively equal with regard to statistical measures.</s><s xml:id="_9pR9Qwg">From our point of view, there are different explanations for this observation.</s><s xml:id="_tbWXM4m">For example, it might be the case that our taxonomy of gamification approaches allows more meaningful combinations of characteristics than the taxonomies for business models proposed by Thiebes et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> and Remane et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, which leads to a more heterogeneous landscape and less clearly separable archetypes.</s><s xml:id="_eaqDyKc">Furthermore, it should also be noted that the development and provision of mHealth apps in most cases require significantly less capital and economic risk taking than direct-to-consumer genetic testing services <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> or carsharing services <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_pCnQTQK">As a consequence, providers of gamified mHealth apps may simply be more willing to experiment around with their gamification approaches and do not necessarily have to draw on best practices.</s><s xml:id="_jD9Yqrn">Lastly, the concept of gamification is still rather new and has just recently become increasingly popular for mHealth apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qxuQ4cs">Thus, best practices for gamification approaches in mHealth apps might still be in an emerging phase and become clearer in the future.</s></p><p xml:id="_MaHGVQV"><s xml:id="_UG6wUCC">Fourth, when comparing our classification results with the classification results that emerged during the taxonomy development process <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, large differences between theoretical considerations on gamification in mHealth apps and their implementation in practice became apparent.</s><s xml:id="_eZjywMs">These differences become particularly clear in the dimensions gamification concept-to-user communication and user identity.</s><s xml:id="_4AvPUH3">During the taxonomy development process, in which exclusively 27 mHealth apps presented in research papers (primarily research prototypes) were examined, 5 of 27 apps were classified with a mediated gamification concept-to-user communication and 6 of 27 apps were classified with a virtual character as the characteristic for user identity.</s><s xml:id="_5t3H2Bt">By contrast, our classification of a total of 143 pertinent mHealth apps offered in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store showed only 3 apps with a mediated gamification concept-to-user-communication and only 1 app with a virtual character as form of user identity.</s><s xml:id="_78ZNzux">In the case of virtual characters, this may be explained to some extent by the consideration of user preferences by developers of mHealth apps.</s><s xml:id="_Q8t9NWF">A recent study showed that avatars (the most common form of virtual characters in gamification approaches) are among those game design elements that are least preferred by users of mHealth apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WQQ48vP">However, existing research has shown that the successful use of avatars in gamification approaches is complex and requires a profound consideration of individual user needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_aZE5a4Q">Only by incorporating these individual needs and avoiding one-size-fits-all solutions, a desired level of emotional attachment and extraneous cognitive load may be achieved <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EmcpkqM">Our results could be interpreted as an indicator that most developers of mHealth apps are not willing to put this effort into the development of virtual characters, especially because users seem to attach less importance to their inclusion in comparison to other game design elements.</s></p></div>

consideration of some key limitations.</s><s xml:id="_xzVa7NR">First, gamification is a relatively young and constantly evolving phenomenon that just recently started to draw increasing attention by researchers and practitioners alike.</s><s xml:id="_QX92gWJ">Disregarding this aspect, our archetypes represent only a snapshot of the current landscape of gamification approaches in pertinent mHealth apps.</s><s xml:id="_jzcJNdu">It is likely that in the near future, new insights from research and practice may guide the development of innovative and more effective gamification approaches (eg, through stronger consideration of individual and contextual factors that determine the effectiveness of gamification).</s><s xml:id="_kZrP6QY">Future research may answer this limitation by closely examining the evolution of knowledge on effective gamification approaches in mHealth apps and how they are designed.</s><s xml:id="_nVVTv2t">Second, we limited our analysis to free mHealth apps on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store which might have led to the exclusion of relevant paid apps or mHealth apps from other app stores.</s><s xml:id="_HFEhhE3">However, it would have been complicated and costly to deal with the different revenue and pricing models of freemium, premium, and others.</s><s xml:id="_BcFTGJn">With an industry trend toward free mobile apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, 95% of downloaded apps being free, and more than 95% of revenue in mobile app stores being generated through freemium business models <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, we are confident that this sample inherits the majority of gamification approaches used in mHealth apps today.</s><s xml:id="_CRpzhUY">Furthermore, we think that the categorical decision of only including free apps from the Apple App Store and Google Play Store ensures the reproducibility of the results.</s><s xml:id="_cWM82rd">Nonetheless, investigating paid apps or alternative app stores could potentially reveal further insights.</s><s xml:id="_KctmDhg">Third, the sample of 143 gamification approaches is notably smaller than that of similar studies in other contexts (eg, the 277 direct-to-consumer genetic testing services investigated by Thiebes et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_T5bFvAx">This may have led to some clusters being underrepresented in our analysis.</s><s xml:id="_G4G33nQ">In addition, we focus our analysis on the most popular mHealth apps only, because our goal was to identify the best practices of gamification approaches.</s><s xml:id="_Rh7ejJb">However, this certainly limits the explanatory power of our results as mHealth apps that have a very small and specific target group (eg, people with very specific and rare diseases) and still implement valuable gamification approaches may be underrepresented in our sample.</s></p><p xml:id="_PNEdDme"><s xml:id="_AkpJdHT">It may be an interesting avenue for future research to assess whether less popular apps utilize gamification in a different way.</s><s xml:id="_XvReQfK">In this regard, additional measures for mHealth app popularity (eg, user rating or number of users) could be taken into account in order to include more niche mHealth apps in the analysis.</s><s xml:id="_9ZpWtMy">Such research could additionally contribute to the upcoming research stream that aims to assess the potential effect that gamification may have on mHealth app success <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_RwfwF9S">Fourth, the coding of each mHealth app by only 1 researcher might have led to false classification in terms of the gamification approaches, which then could have impacted the cluster analysis.</s><s xml:id="_K9g7ZFn">However, both researchers were trained prior to the coding to have an identical understanding of the gamification approaches confined within the taxonomy in order to minimize human error in this process.</s><s xml:id="_HRzS8Qn">Furthermore, with larger groups of objects the cluster analysis tends to be less sensitive toward outliers, which decreases the effects of false coding.</s><s xml:id="_ga9t7J2">Additionally, our approach included 2 different clustering methods (ie, Ward's Method and k-means) to further minimize the risk of creating inaccurate cluster solutions due to outliers.</s><s xml:id="_7jYHv2S">Finally, it must be noted that we omitted the 2 dimensions gamification concept-to-user communication and user identity when conducting the cluster analysis.</s><s xml:id="_WPArCHZ">However, we are confident that this was the best possible approach to achieve meaningful results because omitting both dimensions during the analysis resulted in substantially higher explanatory power of the clusters and only a negligible number of objects (of the 143 apps analyzed, only 1 showed the characteristic virtual character in the dimension user identity and only 3 showed the characteristic mediated in the dimension gamification concept-to-user communication showed the inferior characteristics.</s></p></div>
