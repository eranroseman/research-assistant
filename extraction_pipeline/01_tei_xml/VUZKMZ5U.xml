perceived importance of taking antiplatelet medications following MI and/or PCI.</s><s xml:id="_wm4rBgD">Less frequent TM responses to statin reminders may be a reflection of mobile phone use patterns because individuals took statins in the evening rather than the morning.</s></p><p xml:id="_sUtzsMJ"><s xml:id="_cuuftN3">Self-reported medication adherence did not differ among patients who received

reason for unanalyzable data among other previously reported difficulties.</s><s xml:id="_zekSrdT">The majority of patients were recruited for the study on the day of hospital discharge.</s><s

xml:id="_8BaQySb">Second, the sample may have underrepresented patients who were uncomfortable using mobile phones as these patients may have declined to participate in the study leading to unintentional sample selection bias.</s><s xml:id="_4qxGt88">Third, the follow up period of 30 days was relatively short and did not provide long-term adherence trends or clinical outcomes,

participation in an intervention aimed to improve medication adherence after experiencing a significant acute medical event.</s></p><p xml:id="_pVfq85c"><s xml:id="_PKMQKcz">Another strength of this study was the use of multiple measures of medication adherence to understand the patterns and barriers to medication self-administration.</s><s xml:id="_f4KTgjP">The MEMS and MMAS-8 were used in this

xml:id="_wK7kVtb">Although responses to TM by the TM Reminders + TM Education group do not prove patients took their medications, the high response rates indicated engagement with the
