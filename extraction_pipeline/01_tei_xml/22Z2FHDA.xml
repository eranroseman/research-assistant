<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1." xml:id="_VSXvyQr">Introduction</head><p xml:id="_uHxhjpv"><s xml:id="_RQzrSz2">Virtual reality (VR) is a computer technology that typically allows the user to look around in an artificial world, move through it and interact with it.</s><s xml:id="_Pt3Dzzg">VR is thereby capable of inducing a strong 'sense of presence', which is commonly described as the feeling of being physically situated within a spatial environment portrayed by a medium (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Wirth et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zAPWwJA">It is often thought that an increased sense of presence magnifies 'user effects' (e.g., the extent to which users respond realistically to the mediated environment) and that this, in turn, increases the effectiveness of applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Cummings &amp; Bailenson, 2016)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rgx356c">This is not only of great value for the entertainment industry, but has also proven to be useful in the field of healthcare, for clinicians and patients alike.</s><s xml:id="_cVxFEnu">For instance, VR exposure therapy has helped people overcome specific phobias, such as fear of height or spiders, since at least the mid-nineties <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Rothbaum et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> for meta-analyses see e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Morina, Ijntema, Meyerbr€ oker, &amp; Emmelkamp, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Parsons &amp; Rizzo, 2008)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hSmpHGk">Another popular example is the use of VR as a pain reduction technique in the treatment of acute pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Garrett et al., 2014)</ref>, such as pain experienced during wound care by patients with severe burn injuries <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Hoffman, Patterson, Carrougher, &amp; Sharar, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Hoffman et al., 2008)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_cfBxheH"><s xml:id="_yAYPsPP">Overall, VR in healthcare is still in its early days in terms of novel treatment paradigms.</s><s xml:id="_wHwtcnx">In case of VR exposure therapy, the added value over real-life ('in vivo') exposure seems to be that it allows exposure to all kinds of real-world situations (e.g., standing on top of a flat, or being surrounded by spiders) at a single location, thereby providing a cost-and time-efficient alternative.</s><s xml:id="_XNVCu5w">There are other advantages, such as that VR allows control over the artificial stimuli (i.e., the virtual environment can be adjusted or abandoned at any given moment), but the main benefits seem to be of practical nature.</s><s xml:id="_SeQwbsz">In case of VR as a pain reduction technique, being able to induce a sense of being situated within a VR environment serves a different purpose.</s><s xml:id="_3YGBGMs">Although the exact mechanisms remain unclear, VR is generally hypothesized to be capable of reducing pain by means of distraction <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Garrett et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_yjh2vE2">Conscious attention is required to process pain signals and VR can provide an engaging environment which draws a lot of attentional resources, leaving less attention available to process these pain signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Hoffman et al., 2001)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_gqvEa7H"><s xml:id="_njthjHj">Although VR is used effectively in the aforementioned examples, its most valuable feature may be that it is not subject to the same limitations as the physical world; VR allows the user's environment to be manipulated in ways that are difficult or even impossible to realize otherwise.</s><s xml:id="_wgxBjf4">It is therefore relevant to establish which manipulations VR allows for, to test their user effects and to explore whether these manipulations can be of clinical relevance.</s><s xml:id="_qtsqrkh">Such knowledge may serve as guidelines for the development of future medical applications and the aim of our study was to contribute in this line of research.</s><s xml:id="_AADwd3y"><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Cuperus and van der Ham (2016)</ref> previously investigated the effect of manipulating the spatial distance between objects in VR on memory.</s><s xml:id="_8C6dVTg">In this study, participants took shots at a target on a soccer field and were shown three different types of VR replays of their performance on this task; one accurate representation of actual performance and two manipulated representations in which the distance between the ball and the goalpost was adjusted.</s><s xml:id="_EFTmfez">One manipulation made performance seem worse (miss distances multiplied by 1.5) and the other made performance seem better (miss distances multiplied by 0.5).</s><s xml:id="_SbHPjC5">Interestingly, however, all three were considered equally accurate representations of actual performance, indicating that the distance manipulations were not noticed.</s><s xml:id="_rChdWZM">Moreover, the type of manipulation positively correlated with participants' feeling of competence with respect to the task.</s></p><p xml:id="_a92dYkD"><s xml:id="_n6tb36x">The results of this soccer study can be explained in light of how people memorize spatial relations between objects and between objects and themselves.</s><s xml:id="_zzJmsdQ"><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Kosslyn (1987)</ref> proposed a distinction between the representations of coordinate (metric) and categorical spatial relations (e.g., the side of an object in relation to another object).</s><s xml:id="_cPpCPwp">Typically, people are not very accurate in memorizing the precise metric properties of objects and their locations, especially after longer temporal delays.</s><s xml:id="_PTCQuBX">The same holds true for memory retrieval, which is a reconstructive process <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Bartlett, 1932)</ref> that is susceptible to misleading, suggestive information <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Loftus, 2005)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_vmSYGjv">The VR replays in the study by Cuperus and van der Ham matched participants' memory in terms of the categorical spatial relations that were of main importance to the task (i.e., the side of the goalpost along which the ball passed for each shot), which could well explain why the manipulations were not noticed.</s></p><p xml:id="_zSvnfC6"><s xml:id="_SpjkFTs">In the present study, we investigated whether the manipulation of spatial distance in VR can also be of clinical relevance.</s><s xml:id="_YK7wBA5">We focused on a specific clinical population; patients with intermittent claudication (IC).</s><s xml:id="_2vbsggj">IC is a cramping pain or discomfort in the legs, which occurs during exercise, such as walking, and is relieved with rest <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Lane, Ellis, Watson, &amp; Leng, 2014)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_UCS3n5q">Most often it is a symptom of peripheral artery disease, in which the arteries that supply blood to the limbs are obstructed due to atherosclerosis.</s><s xml:id="_AWAWCWP">Current guidelines appoint supervised exercise therapy, consisting of treadmillor track walking to moderate claudication pain, as primary treatment for patients with IC.</s><s xml:id="_5gr2hW8">A meta-analysis shows that this generally decreases patients' functional impairment, which is usually quantified as the distance that patients can walk before pain forces them to stop <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Lane et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8kYy9Jp">However, motivating patients for such a painful exercise program forms a barrier to widespread prescription of supervised exercise therapy for all patients diagnosed with IC <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Fokkenrood et al., 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_qYb3Qph"><s xml:id="_dfUdJ2y">First, we tested whether VR can serve as a pain reduction technique in patients with IC.</s><s xml:id="_gHXCHnA">Up till now, all studies about pain and VR focused solely on pain outside control of the patient (e.g., pain experienced during wound care).</s><s xml:id="_v2y4CZx">What is special about claudication pain is that it is produced 'actively' by walking.</s><s xml:id="_2vGp6An">Based on previous analgesic effects of VR on pain (for a review see <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Garrett et al., 2014)</ref> we expected that an engaging VR environment would also distract patients with IC from the pain in their legs during treadmill exercise and that this would lead to greater exercise performance (i.e., greater walking distance), thereby possibly increasing therapy effectiveness.</s><s xml:id="_ehrQsYB">Next, we examined whether manipulating the spatial characteristics in the VR environment in two subsequent VR treadmill exercise sessions would influence exercise performance further, by 'stretching' and 'compressing' the environment in the direction of its walkway.</s><s xml:id="_aFxK9d6">When learning a route, people initially build up knowledge of landmarks.</s><s xml:id="_ncs5fb4">Metric properties such as distance or temporal duration are believed to be acquired gradually with experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(McNamara, Sluzenski, &amp; Rump, 2008)</ref>, so in interpreting the environment in subsequent VR sessions we expected patients to rely mostly on the categorical information they acquired earlier.</s><s xml:id="_r6xfrVV">Because this information (i.e., landmarks and their order) matched that of the first VR session, we expected that the spatial manipulations would not be noticed <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Cuperus &amp; van der Ham, 2016)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_uXMc2JV">The subsequent sessions also included a flag which marked the location of the previously reached walking distance (± 10%, depending on condition), thereby setting visual, attainable goals.</s><s xml:id="_p8kjZJg">We reasoned that patients would be motivated to pass or at least reach their prior record, leading to increased treadmill walking distance in the stretched VR condition and decreased walking distance in the compressed VR condition.</s><s xml:id="_9KBcvpG">Finally, aside from its effects on performance, we explored whether treadmill exercise with VR would be considered more enjoyable than exercise without VR.</s></p></div>
