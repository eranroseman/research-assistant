achieve?</s></p><p xml:id="_GPzweFh"><s xml:id="_eSYNJHV">Population health intervention research (PHIR) develops and evaluates policies, programmes and other interventions that seek to have an impact on population health and/or health equity by modifying the underlying determinants of health or by directly influencing health behaviours.</s><s xml:id="_5wZY2up">Such interventions are sensitive to context, by which we mean any feature of the circumstances in which an intervention is conceived, developed, implemented and evaluated (see Chapter 2).</s><s xml:id="_kSDDxM4">Many population health interventions work to change the context within which health is produced and become part of the context for future health behaviours, interventions and outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_GJC9wcJ">Understanding the relationship between interventions and contexts is critical to understanding implementation success and failure, how interventions achieve impact, why their impacts vary and whether interventions can be sustained or successfully translated from one context to another.</s></p><p xml:id="_Dyb33Ug"><s xml:id="_xR3ZDtw">Concerns that too little emphasis is placed on the relationships between interventions and contexts have been expressed for at least 20 years.</s><s xml:id="_bekPM6x">Pawson and Tilley 1 identified lack of attention to context as a critical weakness of prevailing approaches to evaluation and a key motivation for developing an alternative 'realist' approach.</s><s xml:id="_uFvuSBx">Also writing in 1997, Birch <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">2</ref> drew attention to the risk that the developing field of evidence-based medicine encouraged a focus on unbiased estimates of average treatment effects, at the expense of understanding how effects vary by population and health-care system characteristics.</s><s xml:id="_RZky5ez">A 2002 review found that none of the 'checklists in common use to assess the quality of evidence for a public health intervention contain details on how the differential effect of context (however defined) could be taken into account'. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">3</ref></s><s xml:id="_vdZtGrr">Other reviews of both substantive intervention studies and frameworks for interpreting public health evidence reached similar conclusions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">5</ref></s><s xml:id="_EWwAjd5">nce then, an increasingly comprehensive body of guidance has been developed to help with the design, conduct, reporting and appraisal of PHIR and references to context have become more frequent.</s><s xml:id="_FgbjTZE">This increase has had a number of drivers.</s><s xml:id="_sCSUFk2">One is methodological interest in evaluation approaches that go beyond the identification of average treatment effects, including systems thinking, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">6</ref> process evaluation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">7</ref> causal modelling <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">8</ref> and implementation research. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[10]</ref></s><s xml:id="_4HhRm5T">0]<ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[11]</ref> Another is substantive concern with health inequalities and the possibility that effective interventions (in the sense that they improve population health overall) may fail to reduce or may even widen health inequalities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[13]</ref></s><s xml:id="_rwWVjvf">3]<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[14]</ref> A third is the failure to replicate initial trial findings when interventions are implemented more widely. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">16</ref></s><s xml:id="_ewzUHND">A fourth is social theorists' critique of research that uses abstract representations of health risks and interventions that are not situated in time, place and social, cultural, political, economic and other circumstances. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">17</ref></s><s xml:id="_MzTpHmf">cognition of the importance of context in principle has not yet been translated into widespread good practice.</s><s xml:id="_drdv6NY">There have been a number of useful recent contributions to clarifying terminology and concepts, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">19</ref> but there remains a lack of systematic guidance for producers, users and funders of PHIR evidence on how context should be taken into account.</s><s xml:id="_6uKEMzC">A 2015 review of intervention studies published in 10 leading public health journals found that, with a few exceptions, treatment of context was superficial, with cursory descriptions of a narrow range of contextual factors, largely treated as confounders or as obstacles to intervention delivery or fidelity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">20</ref></s><s xml:id="_RNEtCt4">Another study published in 2017 found that references to social context had become less frequent in health behaviour change intervention research since 2006 and called on research funders and other stakeholders to develop guidance on how to take account of social and cultural contexts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">21</ref></s><s xml:id="_VaqTdEW">here is a need both to identify existing good practice and to move the field forward by extending existing perspectives and inviting new approaches that address the significance of context for population health interventions.</s><s xml:id="_p6M3eD9">This document seeks to pull together recent thinking and practical experience of addressing context within PHIR.</s><s xml:id="_2D3BJuB">Its intended audiences include: l established PHIR researchers as well as researchers new to the field, from all disciplines with an interest in contributing to PHIR and teaching l research funders and journal editors, who play a role in setting agendas, priorities and structures for how PHIR is conducted, peer reviewed and reported l peer reviewers of research funding applications and journal manuscripts, who shape what research is funded and disseminated and what capacity is built among those working in the field l users of PHIR, who need to infer from the evidence whether or not an intervention is applicable to their own context and what impacts they can expect were they to implement the intervention in its original or in an adapted form.</s></p><p xml:id="_cabBkeB"><s xml:id="_fW6vdFE">Recent efforts to build and strengthen the field of PHIR have placed greater emphasis on context.</s><s xml:id="_MN8WwwH">This document builds on such work.</s><s xml:id="_TAapjD4">Its basic premise is that, rather than treating context as a source of 'noise' or a barrier to implementation, understanding the relationships between interventions and their contexts is vital to determining how interventions work (or why they fail) and their applicability to different settings and populations.</s><s xml:id="_SWqmSyw">Our primary focus is on research that seeks to improve population health and reduce health inequalities through interventions that act on the underlying determinants of health or more directly on health behaviours, <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">23</ref> but the issues are also relevant across the whole range of public health and health services research.</s></p><p xml:id="_H73S789"><s xml:id="_CWyVMbA">Taking context more fully into account in PHIR (and related fields) will improve the quality and usefulness of research evidence in four important and closely related ways.</s><s xml:id="_D2sYGPg">First, taking account of context in the development of interventions should lead to more appropriate, implementable, effective and sustainable interventions that either work well in a specific context or have sufficient flexibility built in to their design to work across a range of contexts.</s><s xml:id="_xaRQynG">Second, understanding how interventions relate to context is key to understanding how they work.</s><s xml:id="_FvKKNqw">Failure to take account of such relationships is one reason why interventions shown to be effective in one setting fail to achieve similar impacts elsewhere, even if they are replicated faithfully and implemented successfully in the new setting.</s><s xml:id="_sq9vQpY">Third, understanding the relationship between intervention and context helps to explain why impacts vary and, in particular, whether an intervention is likely to narrow or widen inequalities in health, for example by ethnicity, gender or socioeconomic status.</s><s xml:id="_Xs8ZzX8">Finally, including adequately detailed accounts of context in reports of intervention studies will make them more useful to decision-makers interested in implementing, adapting, sustaining, transferring and scaling up interventions and to researchers developing theoretical models of change underlying improvements in public health.</s></p><p xml:id="_c57mKJx"><s xml:id="_BKPThxq">In the following sections, we explain the origins of the guidance and the writing process and define some key terms.</s><s xml:id="_3jbz8cj">In Chapter 2, we provide a broad, working definition of context.</s><s xml:id="_Pe3g4Nv">We identify the features of context that are likely to interact with interventions in ways that cause variation in impact and help or hinder implementation, translation and scaling up.</s><s xml:id="_eudCJcS">In Chapter 3, we outline how context should be taken into account throughout the PHIR process, from priority setting (see Defining the public health problem and associated research questions) and intervention development (see Developing and adapting interventions) to the design and conduct of evaluations (see Evaluating interventions) and to reporting, synthesis and knowledge exchange (see Reporting, synthesis and knowledge exchange).</s><s xml:id="_gXcYP7Q">In Chapter 4, we summarise the key messages for producers, users and funders of PHIR and suggest priorities for future research.</s><s xml:id="_y9jP64H">Chapter 5 contains summaries of the case studies that we draw on throughout the document.</s></p><p

and development of the guidance Development of the guidance was initiated by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research -Institute of Population and Public Health (CIHR-IPPH) and the UK National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Public Health Research (PHR) programme, two national research funding agencies that share an interest in advancing the evidence base for population health interventions.</s><s xml:id="_H7hd5QC">In 2014, the agencies commissioned two background papers that explored current understanding and use of context(s) in PHIR: one by Shoveller and colleagues 20
