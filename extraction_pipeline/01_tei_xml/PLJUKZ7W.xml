within the next 30 years, rising from a proportion of 9% in 2019 to a projected 16% of all people in 2050 [1].</s><s xml:id="_9HQ5M33">In Denmark, population forecasts has estimated the percentage of persons over 65 years to increase from 20% in 2019 to 22.6% in 2030, which is higher than the expected average for Northern Europe [1].</s><s xml:id="_ufNPArW">In the latest population projection, Statistics Denmark also estimate that the proportion of citizens aged 80 or over will double from 5% in 2021 to 10% in 2060 <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_PQ9Ez4c"><s xml:id="_qkaamYT">Older adults have relatively frequent contact with emergency departments, which often converts into hospitalizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr"

there is a correlation between hospital contact and home care use for the elderly.</s><s xml:id="_CRqKHxA">A US analysis showed that 30% of home healthcare patients are hospitalized or visit an emergency department <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fTQHf23">In Denmark, 50% of those over 65 years who were hospitalized also received home care or lived in a nursing home (for patients hospitalized aged 80 or above the proportion was 80%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[5]</ref> resulting in expenses that are four times higher for this group than for the elderly in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[5]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_qjXfvvq"><s xml:id="_5VcQAnK">If possible, hospitalizations should be avoided for dependent and frail elderly, since they can exacerbate challenges with mobility and daily activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[7]</ref> and lead to adverse events during hospitalizations, e. g. acquired infections <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[8]</ref>, or in transitioning from the hospital to homes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_E8F7Yk3">An overview of systematic reviews has highlighted common characteristics of effective interventions to prevent hospitalizations for frail older individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_bR7zXQS">Results show that the most effective interventions are those that integrate community care (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_zSr5tUf">at-home preventive geriatric screening) with hospital care <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_eQ8j3KK"><s xml:id="_kxmvwKV">To facilitate an integrated approach, and to help municipalities responsible for community care in Denmark, the Danish Health Authority have previously published guidelines to assist community health personnel in assessing the everyday health of the elderly receiving home care and to act upon any abnormalities detected in order to avoid preventable hospitalizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WExnpU6">Based on these recommendations, Aalborg Municipality implemented a digital version of a triaged changing table suggested in the guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_YEVf8sF">The tool consisted of a checklist used to detect changes in the citizen's habitual state by answering questions within five subgroups of health status: Mental and social state, behavior in the home, activities of daily living, consumption of food and beverages as well as physical complaints.</s><s xml:id="_KBGp774">The current state was given a color code (green, yellow or red) depending on the number of changes registered from the citizen's normal habitus within the five subgroups.</s></p><p xml:id="_wZCbu3u"><s xml:id="_NQcc5bT">A high risk of hospitalizations and a complex pattern of risk factors of the elderly adults was also found in the overview of systematic reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_VJ6qjNQ">This makes machine learning (ML) a suitable way to help primary care and community health care personnel with decisions surrounding potential hospitalizations, because ML was developed specifically for prediction purposes with an intention to identify hidden patterns and interactions among various predictor variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qKzQSuz">However, not much is known about which variables to include in prediction models aimed at forecasting hospitalizations for the elderly in a community care context and expected predictive performance.</s><s xml:id="_9Sp8D2y">A systematic review from 2014 concluded that, in general, models based on administrative and/or routine clinical data from community-dwelling adults performs well <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[15]</ref> and that the best performing models included historical activity and concrete codes for diagnoses and medicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5Br6AJ6">However, a recent study has found good performance for prediction models based only on triage of functional assessments, care needs and geriatric syndromes from the elderly <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_eGeE2R7"><s xml:id="_mxwdv5V">The objective of this study was therefore to investigate whether it was possible to predict acute hospitalizations in elderly recipients of home care services based on a newly developed triage tool in Aalborg Municipality in combination with administrative and clinical data routinely collected in the Danish healthcare and social care sector.</s></p></div>
