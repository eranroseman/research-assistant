which are used, especially when studying experiences and attitudes.</s><s xml:id="_XTU5hUt">While variables such as enjoyment are often included in the research models examining gamification, there are considerably few studies using similar or validated measurement instruments for a particular variable.</s><s xml:id="_xQvkK5V">Therefore, comparing research results or conducting any comprehensive meta-analyses poses a significant challenge.</s><s xml:id="_WaK389B">In order for the research field to develop, a consistency in measurement instruments and research models is needed across studies, in order to gain comparable results.</s><s xml:id="_dbMkWSv">Furthermore, many empirical studies rely on reporting only descriptive statistics, even though conducting some form of inferential analyses could also be feasible in many cases.</s></p><p xml:id="_xMwxTXx"><s xml:id="_9EQWGq4">Methodological agenda point 1) Future gamification research should aim for consistency in measurement instruments

gamification is conducted without control groups.</s><s xml:id="_S4PpDUJ">While many of the studies are motivated by the question of whether the gamification approach is effective or not, in many cases, the studies eventually fail to accurately answer the question due to a lack of control groups.</s><s xml:id="_sJqNhdr">Furthermore, even if empirical approaches are used, a large proportion of the studies rely simply on user evaluations.</s><s xml:id="_NhuG6xZ">Previous literature reviews have already pointed out these shortcomings <ref type="bibr">(Hamari et al., 2014)</ref>, and the amount of controlled, experimental research settings has increased as the field has matured.</s><s xml:id="_ChbaDxW">However, as noted in this review that out of 227 studies using quantitative methods

study designs, which more often than not do not control between the various affordances implemented in the studied systems.</s><s xml:id="_mw87mZQ">Many studies examine the effects or perceptions of
