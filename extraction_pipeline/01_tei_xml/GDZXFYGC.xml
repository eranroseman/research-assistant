<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_f7TsM96">Background</head><p xml:id="_fNteMGu"><s xml:id="_ZQZm4YB">In recent years, the use of mobile health (mHealth) apps by both the public and health care professionals (HCPs) has significantly increased with the introduction of smartphones <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> and growing interest in the health care industry and research field <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zbunsvm">The COVID-19 pandemic has further accelerated reliance on digital health <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_AHau9Vx">mHealth apps are used by patients to manage diseases, self-monitor, gather health information, supervise behavior changes, manage fitness, and remind them of their medication and rehabilitation schedules <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Fusf2NH">From HCPs' point of view, mHealth apps help manage health records, provide easy access to health records, and provide a path to conduct mobile consultations and remote monitoring during and after treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_RVaHczp">In addition, mHealth apps provide easy access to HCPs by connecting them to clinical information system resources such as electronic health records <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_JG6CPh8">Although mHealth apps could provide evidence-based and cost-effective health data and 2-way communication between patients and their HCPs in a remote setting, a few barriers have blocked the expansion of mHealth apps in the health care industry.</s><s xml:id="_VbHnHQK">Data confidentiality, privacy, and security and the regulatory supervision of the apps are some known barriers that hinder mHealth adoption in the health care field.</s></p><p xml:id="_rHv265G"><s xml:id="_paZ8jFa">Despite various benefits of mHealth apps, data confidentiality, privacy, and security issues have caused patients or the public to display less interest and low confidence in mHealth app practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3uNsHrT">It could be due to the uncertainty about the information gathered or kept in mHealth apps, the function of the stored data, and who can view or access the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_76pSBAX">The term "confidentiality" is defined as the responsibility of those who obtain data (app providers) to uphold the concerns of those to whom the information is related (consumers) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_seyzTE6">The study by Bhuyan et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> mentioned that the National Committee on Vital and Health Statistics defined privacy as an individual legal right or freedom to protect or disclose their health information, and security is defined as personal, mechanical, or authority protection tools used to guard health information against unwanted people or access, whereas privacy is defined as the physical, mechanical, or legislative mechanism or tools to shield personal health information from unauthorized disclosure <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_Acgu7VP"><s xml:id="_vchmtfs">Confidentiality, privacy, and security act as challenges in boosting mHealth app adoption.</s><s xml:id="_NRYNTtz">Patients' perceptions of these issues may influence their adoption of mHealth apps, but such events are context dependent.</s><s xml:id="_t9eYkau">While users are more likely to raise concerns about privacy or confidentiality issues when probed about mHealth apps, such perceptions may not ultimately influence their behavior regarding the actual use or adoption of such apps.</s><s xml:id="_WH4pEEa">Thus, it is pertinent to explore whether privacy concerns are prioritized by users when they engage with mHealth apps and whether such concerns affect their decision to use the apps or not.</s></p><p xml:id="_F4QKAHr"><s xml:id="_YstsuwV">There are several reasons for data protection in mHealth apps, particularly to address the risk of any unauthorized to keyed-in information and stored data by hackers <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_CgnWSPv">In addition, data management and storage, data privacy disclosure, data integration, data encryption, app operability, and authentication are established factors contributing to data breaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_uDHCnsa"><s xml:id="_CYgNnRt">Several studies have highlighted the connection between patients' awareness and the risk of data breaches.</s><s xml:id="_WyJfqFm">End users have an obligation for the security and privacy of their data to be maintained <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xTNvzay">As the main stakeholders of the health care system, patients have a contractual relationship with health care providers as the latter are expected to ensure the safety and confidentiality of patients' health information.</s><s xml:id="_wVMr6mB">Health care app developers must protect sensitive patient data by complying with data privacy regulations such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act).</s><s xml:id="_8c3wK6s">To ensure data privacy and security, mHealth apps are encouraged to incorporate data encryption, implement secure authentications, and perform regular risk assessments <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_CqNxebV">While HIPAA encompasses physical, administrative, and technical aspects to ensure the security of personal health information, the GDPR requires health centers or organizations to collect detailed consent from users before recording their personal data and giving them the right to access, amend, delete, or restrict the processing of their data.</s><s xml:id="_vHacUqV">These privacy requirements for app security are known not only by mHealth app providers but also by patients and users <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hdFM6W4">This represents another dimension that may influence patients' perspectives on and adoption of mHealth apps.</s></p></div>

with such laws entails severe consequences.</s><s xml:id="_bQcaCqg">From health care providers' perspective, and given the confidentiality and sensitivity of patient data, only authorized users such as medical staff should be given access to stored health data.</s><s xml:id="_gbvTcf3">Nevertheless, confidentiality and availability need to be carefully balanced when structuring this critical security system.</s><s xml:id="_fkNWAbZ">Despite the fact that all patients' health data are made available to be exchanged, shared, and monitored to provide robust health care services, certain aspects of the data may be considered confidential and, for security reasons, must be kept restricted or inaccessible.</s><s xml:id="_ZQkK3Ax">These goals should be rationalized to ensure that
