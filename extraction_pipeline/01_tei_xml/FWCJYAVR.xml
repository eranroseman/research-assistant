be sustained into adulthood.</s><s xml:id="_zkHg3Wd">Engaging in adequate levels of moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (PA) is a widely recommended health behavior, as childhood PA has been linked to resilience against health problems later in life, such as obesity and related chronic diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> and premature mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_TFmZx7D">The majority of youth fail to get the recommended amount of PA, with older children in middle and high schools experiencing a precipitous decline in PA compared to younger children, in part due to longer time spent in classrooms engaged in sedentary activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_dfWR2FZ">Because interventions are far less successful once obesity is established in childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> , children between the ages of 6 and 11 in elementary school provide a critical window for PA interventions to motivate and sustain healthy PA habits and reduce sedentary behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> .</s></p><p xml:id="_rw6TFfu"><s xml:id="_kG7mXmt">Numerous health interventions that leverage emerging digital technologies have been developed in recent years, such as exergames (digital games that require players to perform PA or demonstrate their knowledge of the benefits of PA), in efforts to encourage children to associate PA with the fun, game-like feel of digital games <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_TXjE4Jf">Although these technologymediated PA interventions have demonstrated considerable promise, they often yield modest effects, with short-lived and transient PA increases following the initial intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> .</s></p><p xml:id="_F67rfER"><s xml:id="_hrKwJK8">Self-determination theory, a social psychological framework for predicting and describing human motivation for behavior change <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> , provides one explanation for this outcome: when children associate PA behaviors with extrinsic sources of motivation (e.g., points, badges), PA behaviors can stop when the extrinsic rewards end <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_huNpsy7">These findings suggest that linking PA to the technology interface alone (e.g., emphasizing extrinsic rewards in an exergame) deprives children of the opportunity to become the change agent to internalize and integrate PA into their lives, diminishing the overall potential of technology-mediated health interventions for longer-term behavior change.</s></p><p xml:id="_xBtN5JQ"><s xml:id="_3NwpyBc">Self-determination theory contends that there are basic, universal needs that motivate human behaviors at all stages of life through the inherent satisfaction and pleasure derived from the autonomy, competence, and relatedness that stem from these activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_pNfjTua">When these universal psychological needs are met, individuals become intrinsically motivated to set and meet self-determined goals that build sustained and internalized behavior change <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_EB8gkvA">To apply these theoretical tenets to the domain of children's PA, health interventions should aim to build: (1) autonomy (e.g., encouraging children to set their own PA goals), (2) competence (e.g., tailoring the intervention to each child's PA ability to encourage perceived competence <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> ) and ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) relatedness (e.g., opportunity to communicate and feel connected with peers and parents).</s></p><p xml:id="_4ANQB6Z"><s xml:id="_6B2kAkK">Emerging digital technologies afford novel features that allow researchers and practitioners to precisely tailor the intervention to each child based on individually generated data and enhance social connections to their parents and peers in scalable and cost-effective ways that were difficult in traditional health interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_v48U8Se">The precision health approach allows individuals to set the pace of their own health intervention and serve as vehicles of change, increasing the likelihood of internalizing behavior change <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_bSbjj8Y">Guided by self-determination theory, we developed and evaluated a community-level precision health intervention for children that integrates the theoretical tenets into a scalable and cost-effective PA program to increase and sustain PA in children through unstructured play-the virtual fitness buddy (VFB) ecosystem.</s></p><p xml:id="_pDZsnqX"><s xml:id="_xENXMND">The VFB ecosystem encourages children to engage with a custom virtual agent (an algorithm-driven digital dog) to set and meet selfdetermined PA goals while sharing progress with family and peers in realtime and enveloping each child with feedback and social support.</s><s xml:id="_eEWKhzU">The virtual dog encourages children to autonomously determine their PA goal for the week without externally set goals to nurture perceived autonomy for PA <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_8yP6xr7">This virtual dog is designed to assist children in setting and meeting PA goals via a mixed reality kiosk with built-in sensor-based technologies; children can experience mastering PA goals and setting new ones as they experience their PA in the real world, blending with vicarious reinforcement in the virtual world through their dog, leading to heightened perceived competence for PA <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_6QNJAKt">The virtual dog demonstrates vicarious reinforcement by becoming slimmer in appearance, faster in its actions, and more energetic in its interactions based on children's PA achievements tracked by wearable activity monitors (i.e., a Fitbit); the more PA goals children achieve, the more energy the virtual dog gains, allowing children to interact with the virtual dog for longer periods of time <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28</ref> .</s></p><p xml:id="_5XgSJ7R"><s xml:id="_nqKEudU">The motion-tracking mixed reality kiosk served as a central point of communication within the ecosystem.</s><s xml:id="_UD8Hbhc">Based on automated input from children's wearable activity monitors, the virtual dog provided precise, tailored feedback based on each child's PA progress.</s><s xml:id="_hkJKKRV">If the child met the selfset goal, the virtual dog praised the child and asked him or her to play via the motion-tracking mixed-reality kiosk through voice, hand gestures, and body movement, mimicking human-pet interactions in the real world.</s><s xml:id="_fgFt3TW">If the child's PA progress fell short of the self-determined goal, the virtual dog offered accurate feedback and supportive comments to encourage further PA.</s><s xml:id="_6s97vmy">When children interacted with the virtual dog, the kiosk automatically sent notifications to parents regarding PA progress so that parents could also send encouraging messages to their children, which were then delivered through the kiosk.</s><s xml:id="_9UEPvPM">Therefore, the VFB ecosystem allowed children to receive complementary, individually tailored social support from both their parents and the virtual dog to foster perceived relatedness and increase program adherence during the intervention and internalization of the health behavior change (Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref> .</s></p><p xml:id="_QFC2hNQ"><s xml:id="_gmtP6aD">The current study reports the results from a randomized controlled clinical trial in collaboration with the YMCA of Metropolitan Atlanta.</s><s xml:id="_REUcEws">We tested the efficacy of the VFB ecosystem across two cohorts of parent-child dyads recruited from 19 elementary schools and YMCA branches in the metro Atlanta, Georgia area, each cohort lasting for six months during the academic year.</s><s xml:id="_NG9Ye3p">Specifically, we compared the VFB ecosystem's efficacy in increasing PA among 6-11-year-old children against an active control group, which employed a computer system to assist children in setting and meeting PA goals but without social support or feedback from the virtual dog or their parents.</s><s xml:id="_xB7FF88">Our sampling targeted a wide and diverse range of communities with respect to SES and demographic factors, including 12 locations in cohort 1 and seven in cohort 2.</s></p><p xml:id="_PyPTduY"><s xml:id="_hv6fg6n">Beyond its scale, this study is unique in that we were able to track the real-time progress of 303 children's PA over six months across 19 different study sites.</s><s xml:id="_XbesBuG">Children and their participating family members were equipped with Fitbit devices for children to engage with their custom virtual dog via the mixed reality kiosk based on their PA performance for the duration of the study, as well as Actigraphs (research-grade PA tracking device) for 1-week periods at three time-points throughout the trial (baseline, 3months, and 6-months).</s><s xml:id="_vVPPGxQ">The rich data derived from these devices allowed the research team to observe patterns in children's light, moderate, and vigorous-intensity PA, as well as sedentary behavior, over 6 months during the intervention.</s></p></div>
