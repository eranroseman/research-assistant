editorial policy, content quality, and coverage of medical knowledge as the key indicators of high-quality point-of-care information summaries.</s><s xml:id="_4jhMpr6">In line with the 2008 and 2012 analyses, the purpose of our study was not to pinpoint the "winning" and "losing" products but to assess the maturity of these tools for clinical decision making and encourage transparent reporting of editorial and content development policies by publishers.</s><s xml:id="_Y8EqHtN">We further sought to guide readers in the selection of products for individual or institutional use.</s><s xml:id="_cuMZm2Z">Since 2008, there have been improvements in the general features of point-of-care information summaries and the descriptions of their editorial approaches, though suboptimal products are still on the market <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_URA6S5R"><s xml:id="_mpWfhhK">Several limitations to our study must be noted, including use of editorial policy statements to determine the implementation of a formal and structured peer-review process and the acceptance of commercial support for content development.</s><s xml:id="_4yEQRE2">We acknowledge that there may have been discrepancies between the reporting and actual implementation of editorial policies.</s><s xml:id="_HWx6kbx">Moreover, although we included quality dimensions informed by evidence in our study, our criteria for assessment may be perceived as arbitrary; users of a given point-of-care summary may have different views or experience.</s><s xml:id="_8aTwjpD">Regardless of potential differences in opinions, one observation remains clear: publishers have invested notable energy and resources to raise their quality standards in a limited time.</s><s xml:id="_w3AbRyY">Product maturity and the increasing value of reliable information in medical society may sustain the rising popularity of point-of-care summaries among health professionals.</s></p><p xml:id="_vXJFHm2"><s xml:id="_HFHwMwD">A particular challenge within our study involved the defining of the intervention and execution of the search strategy to identify relevant interventions for inclusion.</s><s xml:id="_FvP2rwW">Since our first evaluation in 2008, there continues to be a discrepancy in the terminology adopted to describe what we identify as "point of care information summaries": Web-based medical compendia that are specifically designed to deliver predigested, rapidly accessible, comprehensive, and periodically updated information to health care providers.</s><s xml:id="_ZuBveJF">These products have been additionally referred to as "evidence-based textbooks" <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[22]</ref>, "clinical point-of-care tools" <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[23]</ref>, navigators, and services <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5ueNwqd">While we recognize that other terms might be used, we have adopted point-of-care information summaries as the preferred terminology, as it embraces several key content elements.</s><s xml:id="_ezVnv34">Given the rising interest and adoption of these tools, the development of a common term and definition will facilitate their assessment by researchers as well as by hospitals and health care professionals in search of a compatible tool for use.</s><s xml:id="_8rCTs6S">A common definition might also benefit the PubMed MeSH vocabulary.</s><s xml:id="_FS649wm">In fact, the MeSH term "point-of-care systems" comprises a broad range of health care technologies outside of our intervention, such as laboratory and diagnostic instruments <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[24]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_U4hbvU7"><s xml:id="_Je7E8pC">The quality of most products is still moderate, which has also been indicated by

target="#b20">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[27]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rMBpkRf">Clinicians should become familiar with the basic concepts that make an information product a credible source of scientific evidence.</s><s xml:id="_Ys9qc6Q">Health libraries and local knowledge brokers should endorse and give preference to summaries that are committed to policies to improve editorial and methodological rigor, disclose conflicts of interest <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[30]</ref>, and ensure complete and accessible reporting of the content development procedure.</s><s xml:id="_P7RwNuC">Users should be skeptical about point-of-care summaries that do not transparently describe how information is found (search strategy), selected (cumulative or discretionary approach), evaluated (critical appraisal), prioritized (grading of evidence and recommendations), and regularly updated (literature surveillance) to maintain their relevance to practice.</s><s xml:id="_fMN9HqE">Publishers may be highly skilled in boosting clinical recommendations through propaganda and legally qualified to sell their products to doctors and hospitals.</s><s xml:id="_SybkStE">Moreover, the failure to disclose methods for product development is not in the best interests of the medical community, and might, in fact, draw the line between authoritative and fraudulent therapeutic information.</s></p><p xml:id="_M5APUNX"><s xml:id="_QdKDv3T">Point-of-care information summaries largely serve high-income countries.</s><s xml:id="_xN2Rxdc">However, information on highly effective medicines and interventions are presumably more valuable in low-and middle-income countries.</s><s xml:id="_bz2kEKp">At the same time, in an increasingly competitive market, publishers cannot make the service "free for everyone" because this would affect their sustainability and might facilitate the opportunistic use of these resources.</s><s xml:id="_G82dzeH">We encourage publishers to align the prices of their products to the purchasing power of a particular country's physicians through tiered-pricing models and to distribute access through networks active in low-and middle-income countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">32]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gVhuYmj">In addition to their affordability and access, the source of information is critical to the strength and reliability of products.</s></p><p xml:id="_XNAmAvN"><s xml:id="_VVxMsVD">Dynamed currently has links to over 17,000 guidelines, organized for high or low-to middle-income countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[33]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_vbrEU3y">While the consideration of ready-to-use recommendations is a key first step, more investments in tailoring information to local doctors and other health care providers are needed.</s><s xml:id="_wwwZBWF">For example, information on medicines was never ranked on the basis of the WHO Model List of Essential Medicines, which selects treatments that offer a cure or effective disease management in preference to those that offer only marginal benefit <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[34]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_TZ9Qa5e">Doctors are increasingly interested in knowing potential incongruence between investing resources and desired health outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">36]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7GjARM4">In this time of austerity, point-of-care summaries have to do a better job considering the social
