<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_vTcnJ7J">Introduction</head><p xml:id="_rtcBNvu"><s xml:id="_K3AYhRU">In addition to the well-established physical and mental health benefits of physical activity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[1]</ref> emerging evidence from meta-analyses and systematic reviews show that physical activity may also be important for improving classroom behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_x8jcJKM">It is possible that physical activity improves cognitive function through psychosocial mechanisms, including self-esteem and physical self-perceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KZt45my">Through improvements to cognitive function (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_qpTNyh9">attention and executive function) improvements in classroom behaviour may occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_FYNttE8">Classroom behaviour has been shown to predict later academic achievement (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_2barufb">test scores), i.e. children who displayed more on-task classroom behaviour in preschool scored better in subsequent reading and spelling tests in years 1, 2 and 4 <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_UYGbVD2">Thus, physical activity may not only benefit health, but may also benefit academic achievement via improvements in classroom behaviour and cognitive function.</s><s xml:id="_XPseRsv">This study focusses on associations with classroom behaviour.</s><s xml:id="_rCjEKe4">While recently there has been increased interest in the impact of physical activity on classroom behaviour outcomes, less is known about whether particular types of physical activity are differentially associated with this outcome.</s></p><p xml:id="_vzMa8FW"><s xml:id="_6tgWtHX">Organised sport is a specific type of physical activity and is typically defined as 'organised, usually competitive, and can be played with a team or as an individual' <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref> Sport participation provides one way in which children can accrue physical activity.</s><s xml:id="_hqGx9Bk">Organised sport is popular among children in Australia, with two thirds of children aged 5 to 14 years reporting participation in the previous 12 months <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_BkTbuGT">However, participation rates decline with age, particularly in adolescence.</s><s xml:id="_xwYMuPh">For example, in Australia approximately 84 to 89% of primary and 41 to 75% of secondary school-aged children participated in organised sport in the previous week <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[8]</ref>, contributing to the age related decline in physical activity.</s><s xml:id="_JTUqwmH">Thus, maintaining sport participation throughout childhood may be important for attaining recommended physical activity levels and associated health benefits.</s></p><p xml:id="_ecwukRv"><s xml:id="_dd7dVMt">In addition to health benefits, sport participation has been shown to be associated with many psychological and social benefits, beyond that derived from physical activity, including improvements to self-control and emotional regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HG72QNv">These distinct benefits are perhaps due to unique characteristics of sport participation, compared with other forms of physical activity.</s><s xml:id="_s2RQxuD">For example, compared with other more unstructured forms of physical activity (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_pBEThba">free play), when playing sport (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_7BuV46s">tennis, football etc.), players are constantly thinking (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_UAbqMVW">thinking quickly and strategically about the rules, their next move, and their team mates actions) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[9]</ref>, which requires a great deal of focus.</s><s xml:id="_UkaA2RC">The focus practiced on the sports field may translate to better focus in the classroom.</s></p><p xml:id="_XU4hFxw"><s xml:id="_qxPvxxr">Sport can be played as a team or as an individual.</s><s xml:id="_vrx9a9a">It is possible that these different types of sport may contribute differently to focus on the field, and subsequently focus in the classroom.</s><s xml:id="_FFj3PeM">Studies of the associations between sport participation and classroom behaviour among primary school-aged children are lacking <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Hm5fhcn">One study reported that Taiwanese boys aged 6 to 12 years with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder displayed less parent reported attention problems following a 12-week table tennis (individual sport) intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_yehbEru">It has been suggested that individual sports require a greater level of focus than team sports as players don't have their team mates to rely on and cannot "tune out" easily <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qZbbAqY">As such, children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are often encouraged to play individual sports <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rAXCcZy">Thus it is possible that individual sports may be more strongly associated with classroom behaviour, compared with team sports.</s><s xml:id="_hvSzp3U">However, another study of longitudinal associations between type of sport participation and school functioning among primary school-aged children showed school functioning scores were higher among those who participated in both team and individual sport, or in team sport alone, compared with individual sport alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_MjaFwhz">A further study also found that team sport participation was associated with better classroom engagement, while individual sport participation was not <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_nZp5NRE">With few studies and divergent results, to increase our understanding of associations between sport participation and classroom behaviour outcomes, associations with type of sport may be an important consideration.</s></p><p xml:id="_WCUqpDs"><s xml:id="_25hqRwF">Level of sport involvement (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_r2t3gdX">frequency and duration) may also influence the association with classroom behaviour outcomes, perhaps due to the extra physical activity.</s><s xml:id="_TPjJxsS">However, no studies among primary school-aged children have considered associations between levels of sport involvement with classroom behaviour outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_DPXwfBn">Previous studies among secondary school-aged children have investigated longitudinal associations between sport participation and academic achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DFZwrbY">Results demonstrated that frequency of sports participation predicted English and Mathematics achievement at one year follow up <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_KP2vnjM"><s xml:id="_psjdxF6">Two previous studies among primary school-aged children considered associations between different levels of involvement in sport and academic achievement <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ujB52Ah">Saevarsson and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref> investigated cross-sectional associations between frequency of sport participation and academic achievement among 248 children aged 9 years.</s><s xml:id="_8WHBJ3A">Results indicated children who participated in sport � once per week and 2-3 times per week had significantly lower mathematics scores, compared with children who participated in sport � 4 times per week <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_G8WrWrP">In contrast, Haapala and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref> concluded there was no association between duration of sport participation (minutes/day) in Grade 1 and academic achievement in Grades 1 to 3. That study also showed there were no sex differences in associations.</s><s xml:id="_cnb6cGD">However, no other study among primary school-aged children has investigated sex differences in associations between sport participation and classroom behaviour or academic outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_PEeMWge">Due to known sex differences in classroom behaviour outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[18]</ref> as well as sport preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref> it may be important to investigate potential sex differences in associations.</s></p><p xml:id="_x3APAzf"><s xml:id="_WBjZTtC">While results are promising, no study among primary school aged children has adjusted for overall physical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ngRXtJR">Thus, it is unclear whether improvements in classroom behaviour observed was due to sport participation per se, or the physical activity derived from sport participation.</s><s xml:id="_kMJ2MmA">A study among high school students indicated that sport participation was associated with higher grade point average independent of overall physical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_C4vjANW">This suggests that sport participation may have academic benefits beyond that derived from physical activity alone.</s></p><p xml:id="_227EAvZ"><s xml:id="_uTfzVZV">The current paper aims to expand on findings from previous studies by examining associations between (1) type (individual vs. team based) and duration (hours/week) of sport participation and classroom behaviour outcomes among primary school-aged children, and (2) whether or not associations persist after adjusting for overall physical activity.</s><s xml:id="_fREgxMJ">Sex differences in associations were explored as a secondary aim.</s></p></div>
