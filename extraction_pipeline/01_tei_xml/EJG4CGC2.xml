<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1." xml:id="_7N5J6UQ">Introduction</head><p xml:id="_F5hgpAj"><s xml:id="_7CKXC5t">The concept of ''gamification" has become more and more popular over the last few years.</s><s xml:id="_NycCTSb">Conceived in the digital media industry, gamification began to be adopted on a wide scale only in the second half of 2010 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_GpDUNhU">In fact, the first documented use dates back to 2008, under the word ''funware", which was coined by Gabe Zichermann <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_YaSSA7e">Gamification gained more notability through various books such as Jane McGonigal's "Reality is Broken" <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and Gabe Zichermann's "Game Based Marketing" <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_E4QrmPZ">Zichermann has also developed a marketing guide based on game mechanics to create brand awareness and drive customer engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_yQaB4fP">As the term ''gamification" was heavily contested within the video game and digital media industries, many designers originated new terms for their own practice to avoid the appearance of misconceptions about gamification <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_cX2E6mp">Moreover, there has been much controversy surrounding the definition of ''gamification" <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Z6zfsuq">However, the most commonly accepted definition amongst those proposed was that of Sebastian Deterding who stated that ''Gamification is the use of game design elements in non-game contexts" <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2ezTfBp">This signifies that rather than creating immersive, full-fledged games as in ''serious games", gamification is intended to affect the users' behavior and motivation by means of experiences reminiscent of games <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_4ACXgj6">Nevertheless, the aforementioned definition is related to similar concepts such as serious games, playful interaction, and game-based technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_RtvxVJY">Serious games are games designed for non-recreational purposes, focusing therefore on areas as ''serious" as economics, education, health, industry, military and politics <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WhDrfnS">The most widely conventional definitions of serious games follow the lead set by Michael <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and Stokes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> by which serious games were regarded as either being ''games that do not have entertainment, enjoyment or fun as their primary purpose" or ''games that are designed to entertain players as they educate, train, or change behavior."</s><s xml:id="_h9HtSd4">Unlike gamification, serious games appeared a long time before the proliferation of computer technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rDYuxKd">The ancestors of serious games were mainly nondigital and started to emerge in a few domains, namely, education, military and politics <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_udZdYvd">Although serious games and gamification tend to be used for purposes other than their expected entertainment use, their implementations differ considerably.</s><s xml:id="_FbtmwFx">Whereas serious games sometimes called as 'games with a purpose' afford pure gaming experiences by means of gameplay rules, game engines and mechanics, gamification attempts to create experiences reminiscent of game through a combination of game mechanics and game experience design <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_VBsyScf">Rewards (e.g. points, achievement badges, and leaderboards) are perceived as a core gamification strategy for users who accomplish the requested tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NQ5GWxB">Some of the means used to promote competition are setting challenges and making the tasks visible to other users <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7nFfuEt">Another useful pillar of gamification is leveraging social networks to increase engagement and interaction among the users <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rJc64s3">There are many additional meaningful gamification tactics, which enhance the persuasiveness of the gamified solution, such as narrative storylines, avatar-based self-representation and onboarding tutorials <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EQfw7sB">Gamification thus promises a dual improvement consisting of making the activities more pleasant while ensuring people's long-term engagement with tasks perceived to be demotivating <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7dmmvxQ">Basically, a range of emotional, cognitive and social benefits are ascribed to gamification <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_pQ7hFgV">Developing positive social relationships and promoting a feeling of integration are the key social benefits noted for gamification <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_FcndYZ8">Social influence can also invoke a sense of competition to achieve a higher status on the ranking table yielding thereby numerous emotional skills such as auto-satisfaction, self-esteem and pride <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HKarAa2">Moreover, there is a good evidence that gamification aid in cognitive development, as it stimulates the brain and promote knowledge acquisition.</s><s xml:id="_W54APdX"><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_AAcMR26">It helps develop strategic abilities of the players as long as it enhances their working memory, visual attention and processing speed <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8pXZWhR">Typically, the various game mechanics potentially involved in gamification are regarded as an anchoring point for players to ensuring a flow of cognitive skills such as reaching a state of concentration, developing problem-solving skills and acquire a sense of goal-orientation <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tjUu8GP">According to M2 Research forecasts, the gamification market will generate $2.83 billion in revenues in 2016 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_eHDVKck">Moreover, in a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center, 53% of the people surveyed believed that game mechanics will become more embedded in daily life by 2020 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tYVVNUD">In the same way, a market study shows that the worldwide Serious Games market is estimated to reach $5,448.82</s><s xml:id="_2GrQeZ3">Million by 2020 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_CAhnpvf">Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that despite the oldness of the concept of serious games, gamification genuinely steps into the mainstream whereas serious games stay in much limited scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SskHwdt">To illustrate this point, observe that gamification has already been applied in several domains, including education (e.g. to foster the engagement of students <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>), business (e.g. to engage employees and increase customers' loyalty <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref>) and environmental sustainability (e.g. to inspire and provoke engagement in environmentally positive behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_cxcC8wR">There has been considerable interest in applying gamification to the digital healthcare industry.</s><s xml:id="_2jBwu4g">This growing interest was to some extent spawned by the inequity of access to healthcare resources, the lack of adherence to treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> and the increase in healthcare costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KWZyMnG">Electronic technology has effectively contributed to the rise of gamification in many industries.</s><s xml:id="_gv98wGy">The advanced features of smartphone handsets such as inbuilt accelerometers, external sensors and GPS services have proven to be an especially useful vehicle for the seamless delivery of healthcare interventions in general, and gamified health interventions in particular <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_dkSNFdu">The tremendous power of the technological advances have led innovation and creativity to become more attractive and tempting for researchers in various domains.</s><s xml:id="_d7k7Gkg">The healthcare realm in particular has been positively affected, and highly advanced health-related systems have therefore been developed in order to promote healthy lifestyles and enhance overall wellbeing.</s><s xml:id="_2SgfjaM">For instance, health Behavior Change Support Systems (hBCSSs), whose objective is to promote changes in health behavior, have taken great advantage of the technological pace <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SxFz9xA">Gamification has also been leveraged to enhance the persuasiveness of the hBCSSs.</s><s xml:id="_WnEmHFQ">In a recent study <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[30]</ref> that reviewed gamified health BCSSs, gamification was found to have positive effects on the perceived experiences of users with diverse health conditions.</s><s xml:id="_D6s2FDD">In this respect, an automated physio-therapeutic Kinect system was built to assist patients during the period of post-surgery rehabilitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_aMrh8WT">The system was tailored to patients with specific needs (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_xGTQ66X">deaf, blind), and provides vibro-haptic feedback.</s></p><p xml:id="_6vx2rbk"><s xml:id="_9nA7aJ7">Another study <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref> similarly evaluated a physical rehabilitation home-system for the elderly.</s><s xml:id="_8AXAfbm">This system relies on animatronic biofeedback that helps users gain more control over their involuntary physiological functions through electrical sensors connected to their bodies.</s><s xml:id="_PARdw3R">Therefore, feedback as an element of gamification can significantly contribute to the enhancement of users' attention and engagement.</s></p><p xml:id="_dzjTXbS"><s xml:id="_QhpgMaW">The healthcare domain has seen a rapid ascent of the adoption of gamification and serious games in health self-monitoring and management.</s><s xml:id="_wfVdbsT">On account of the ability of serious games to motivate, engage and entertain, numerous systematic reviews have assessed their effectiveness in promoting particular health behavioural changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">34]</ref> and reducing a broad range of disorderrelated symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[35]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_d3JQBX3">In contrast, there is a paucity of evidence regarding the potency of the core gamification elements in the field of digital health.</s><s xml:id="_u2PCtQW">We, therefore, sought to carry out a systematic literature review to identify the combinations of game elements that are predominantly utilized in e-Health.</s><s xml:id="_KWcFfHQ">Additionally, we highlighted the potential effects and hurdles surrounding the integration of game elements in solutions for health-purposes.</s></p><p xml:id="_HmkrP3h"><s xml:id="_etpj37Q">This paper reports the results of this systematic review conducted on a set of studies involving serious games and gamified applications.</s><s xml:id="_9Xvy2Nk">This study firstly sought to review and analyze the existing research contributions that explicitly identify the game elements employed in eHealth.</s><s xml:id="_zWvHtky">It classified the selected studies according to their publication channels, research types, empirical research studies and application health domains.</s><s xml:id="_BESYmrv">Moreover, it examined the contributions produced over time with regards to the game elements employed and explored the perceived benefits and challenges of embedding gamification techniques in different e-Health solutions.</s></p><p xml:id="_BSt7Djy"><s
