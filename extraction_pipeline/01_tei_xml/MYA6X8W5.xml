Malicious software targets machines with open vulnerabilities, using them to gain access to important parts of the operating system.</s><s xml:id="_2Kq3Exu">Updating quickly is also important.</s><s xml:id="_SErXXDP">As soon as a vulnerability becomes public knowledge, exploit rates jump by as much as 5 orders of magnitude [?, ?]. Installing security updates closes vulnerabilities preventing attacks from being successful.</s><s xml:id="_A3vYYaW">Systems that are regularly updated have both smaller attack surfaces and less compromise attempts [?, ?].</s></p><p xml:id="_t8VsMze"><s xml:id="_TqftwVw">Prior work has shown that people do not always understand why updates are necessary or what they do [?, ?] which can lead to a decision to avoid updating software when the update is perceived as not needed [?].</s><s xml:id="_5MfC9Bd">This situation results in a dead weight loss where users might have preferred the new version, and developers would prefer to maintain fewer versions, but the user is not updating due to potential risks and unclear benefits.</s></p><p xml:id="_eVUQMnw"><s xml:id="_WseesTq">In this work we are interested in the aspects of the software update process that are the most salient to end users.</s><s xml:id="_cvkRtNB">We want to know what people remember from prior update events.</s><s xml:id="_HkezmR4">Particularly, aspects that caused them to want to install an update or caused them to avoid installing an update.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_fmVmvda">BACKGROUND</head><p xml:id="_uhvSCvp"><s xml:id="_9U7w27p">The impact of updating software on security is not obvious to end users.</s><s xml:id="_VQdkAjY">Fagan et al. showed that people have difficulty understanding the relationship between software updates and computer security.</s><s xml:id="_9P5Usyu">People are also hesitant to apply updates because they are annoyed or confused about the update message that they received [?].</s><s xml:id="_8qEA5Ct">Vaniea et al. similarly found that users avoided application updates due to: 1) unanticipated user interface changes, 2) unused and unrecognized software, and 3) liking the current software [?].</s><s xml:id="_MjNENc4">Ion et al. compared the security advice of experts and non-exerts, they found that 35% of experts mentioned installing updates as one of the top three things they do to stay safe, while just 2% of non-experts made the same recommendation [?].</s><s xml:id="_95G6bYZ">Tian et al. studied mobile application updates (apps) via a survey, they found that nearly 60% of users had previously decided to not update an app [?].</s><s xml:id="_5VRsT43">They also tested a new notification interface that highlighted update-related comments.</s></p><p xml:id="_JzVsMsn"><s xml:id="_Z3r3F2V">Our work is the first to explore the full process of updating from the prospective of an end user.</s><s xml:id="_myr3DEd">While some earlier work has looked at issues users experience most of the earlier studies are either small [?, ?] or focus on very narow aspects of the update process [?, ?].</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_PZZ6v8y">Automatic updating</head><p xml:id="_vfspF7k"><s xml:id="_rBMTSpM">While keeping the user informed is important, it is not always necessary to keep them in the loop for all security decisions.</s><s xml:id="_uUgSuqc">If the correct action is known, then it may be safe to make a decision without user involvement [?].</s><s xml:id="_Fu4RwXB">One obvious approach to improve update compliance is to automate update installation.</s><s xml:id="_FsZTWUS">Microsoft has already shown this approach to work.</s><s xml:id="_pKnP9aF">In Windows XP SP2 they enabled automatic update installation and saw installation rates jump from 5% of SP1 computers to 90% of SP2 computers [?, ?]. Wash et al. found that with the exception of the auto-reboot feature, Microsoft's automatic updating mechanism was helpful to users and kept their machines safer than they might otherwise have been [?].</s><s xml:id="_unMkwXe">Internet Explorer, Chrome, and Firefox all now support silent automatic updating.</s></p><p xml:id="_t5qYM4M"><s xml:id="_wGN7nT2">Automatically installing updates without user intervention improves installation rates and security [?], but the practice has three major limitations.</s><s xml:id="_32m9QTJ">First, updating software can cause compatibility issues with older or proprietary software [?], so users need the ability to turn off automatic updates.</s><s xml:id="_849mSp6">This is a major issue in companies where in-house software depends on specific versions of software such as Java or Adobe Reader.</s><s xml:id="_gfF3DjT">Users with disabilities also need to be able to disable updates until their accessibility programs gain comparability</s></p><p xml:id="_dUcGAZt"><s xml:id="_qtSNySM">[?].</s><s xml:id="_mjEHrXQ">Second, users have the right to decide what software gets installed on their machines [?].</s><s xml:id="_cEHaktu">When an automatic update silently does something unexpected and unwanted it may result in people feeling betrayed, causing them to loose trust in the automatic update process [?, ?]. Vaniea et al. observed 33% (8 out of 24) iTunes users stop updating after an unanticipated user interface change, even though the subsequent updates made no user interface changes [?].</s><s xml:id="_Sew7b5u">Third, when users are not involved in the update process it becomes harder for them to build good mental models [?, ?].</s><s xml:id="_XPmEqwD">Without these models users have trouble understanding what is happening as well as how to control it [?].</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_MCpAnkV">Warnings</head><p xml:id="_QCvM8Ez"><s xml:id="_9Uux4K5">Update requests have some similarity to warnings in that they are notifying the user about out-of-date software and asking the user to take action.</s><s xml:id="_qvTpq6n">Unfortunately, users do not always understand or heed the warnings presented to them [?].</s><s xml:id="_NW67bQw">SSL warnings in particular have this issue [?, ?, ?, ?] as do Firewall warnings [?].</s><s xml:id="_FWnGDyh">Users become habituated to ignoring warnings [?, ?]. Work by Bravo-Lillo et al. has looked at ways to counteract habituation through user interface designs that encourage the user to interact with the important information on the warnings [?, ?, ?, ?].</s><s xml:id="_hjErZmP">His work shows that interaction with the important information on a warning can improve people's comprehension of the warning content.</s></p></div>
