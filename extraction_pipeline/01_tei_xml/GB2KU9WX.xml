determines their later life quality (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Alderman et al., 2019)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_RvPe55y">Yet many adolescents around the world are experiencing internalizing symptoms such as depression and anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Chi et al., 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Grist et al., 2019)</ref>, self-harming <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Asarnow &amp; Mehlum, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Mehlum et al., 2019)</ref>, eating-related difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Warschburger &amp; Zitzmann, 2018)</ref>, and the externalizing symptoms such as alcohol drinking and smoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Montgomery et al., 2020)</ref> and bullying <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Gaffney et al., 2019)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_BPRTFbB">Internalizing symptoms are defined as the emotional discomfort and harmful behaviors that are directed toward one's self whereas externalizing symptoms are the delinquency and harmful behaviors directed toward the outside, and both are usually signs of emotional disturbance and negative reactions to stressful life events <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Achenbach et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qayUmmw">As these symptoms adversely affect the adolescents' wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Nash &amp; Bowen, 2002)</ref>, and even result in the tragedy of suicide in some cases <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Davaasambuu et al., 2017)</ref>, it is becoming increasingly important to investigate and understand those symptoms and their risk and protective factors, in the less studied populations such as Mongolia.</s><s xml:id="_kEP85PT">Mongolia, located in central Asia, is a developing country with a population of 3.45 million <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Kemp, 2022)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_GCnS6WT">Mongolia went through three major social structure changes, from traditional nomad herders to a socialist society under the influence of the Soviet Union, and to a capitalist, free market society in the early 1990s <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hurst, 2001)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_cFV8euH">Those radical changes and the economic and political instability created massive public stress, and mental and behavioral issues among the population (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Hurst, 2001)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zRbhXSe">Previous studies (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Davaasambuu et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Lee et al., 2019)</ref> suggest that Mongolian adolescents are suffering from internalizing and externalizing symptoms, yet, there is a lack of research on the associated factors of those symptoms.</s><s xml:id="_HqkdvrH">To develop a successful preventive intervention, it is crucial to identify which risk and protective factors predict each problem at the individual, family, and peer-school level <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bronfenbrenner, 1979)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_kYyB9Mb">Therefore, this research intended to fill this gap.</s><s xml:id="_F8sdBMx">Broadly defined, risk factors are the conditions that increase the likelihood of emotional and behavioral negative outcomes, whereas protective factors are the conditions that promote successful development and decrease the negative outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Deković, 1999)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_t3N7vpM"><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Bronfenbrenner's (1979)</ref> ecological theory is one of the most influential theories in understanding adolescents' development and argues that the multiple levels of surrounding environments play an important role in adolescents' development.</s><s xml:id="_wDvGdVW">The theory proposes five levels of environment, starting from the most immediate environment, with which the adolescents interact directly, including the contexts such as family, school, and peers, to a larger macrosystem, which indirectly influences the adolescents' development.</s><s xml:id="_bfDFWGg">The main argument is that to understand adolescents' emotional and behavioral outcomes, the environmental effects must be considered, especially the immediate environment.</s><s xml:id="_hPdFwzH">A similar argument was suggested by the problem behavior theory, which states that not only the individual characteristics such as self-concept but also the environmental factors, or the relationship quality with the significant others, particularly family and peers, predict adolescents' internalizing and externalizing symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Jessor, 1987)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_J3jcPwR">When adolescents do not have sufficient psychological skills to deal with adverse life events and do not receive adequate emotional support from their significant others, they display their frustration through such symptoms.</s><s xml:id="_5uHqb5Z">According to the latest report from UNICEF on adolescents' mental health and wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Keeley, 2021)</ref>, 13% of adolescents around the world are experiencing at least one type of internalizing symptom and the most common ones are depression, anxiety, and eating-related difficulties.</s><s xml:id="_y6eV3tg">The result was explained regarding the adolescents' relationship quality with their significant others in the family and school settings.</s><s xml:id="_bnddcz9">Moreover, the report stated that more comprehensive data is needed especially from less studied countries (such as Mongolia) to fully understand how the environment affects adolescents' wellbeing.</s></p><p xml:id="_mCvDM3V"><s xml:id="_3b4PP38">Mongolia is a country of youth and around one in five Mongolians is aged 10-19 <ref type="bibr">(National Statistics' Commission, 2021)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_pVtZNk2">Unfortunately, adolescents' internalizing and externalizing symptoms are relatively common in Mongolia.</s><s xml:id="_zAwTdYc">For example, higher prevalence of suicidal thoughts and attempts (i.e., one in three adolescents reported they have seriously considered committing suicide <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Badarch et al., 2022</ref>)), and a significantly higher prevalence of alcohol drinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dashpuntsag et al., 2021)</ref> and smoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Sodnom, 2020)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_urBU2kT">Moreover, Mongolian adolescents were the least happy, but the most anxious and lonely ones compared to the adolescents of other lowand middle-income Asian countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Lee et al., 2019)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7uDq3xs">However, previous studies in Mongolia tended to either exclusively focus on the prevalence of the internalizing and externalizing symptoms (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Vanchindorj et al., 2017)</ref>, or target a single symptom such as smoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">(Sodnom, 2020)</ref>, or suicidal ideation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Davaasambuu et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Z3y6rAq">Therefore, there is a need for a more comprehensive study that includes various externalizing and internalizing symptoms and their risk and protective factors simultaneously.</s><s xml:id="_hsgbarn">By filling this gap, this study intended to explore whether the same risk and protective factors would be accountable for different externalizing and internalizing symptoms and to provide some baseline data for further research projects and the relevant prevention and intervention program development in Mongolia.</s></p><p xml:id="_8cHzZrE"><s xml:id="_qVAHN3p">Although numerous personal and relationship-related factors were found to be accountable for the adolescents' internalizing and externalizing symptoms in the studies from high-income countries, this study decided to target self-concept and life satisfaction as individual-level protective factors, parental physical and verbal abuse, and parental emotional neglect as family-level risk factors, family cohesion as a family-level protective factor, bullying victimization and peer pressure as the peerand school-level risk factors, and school satisfaction as the peer-and school-level protective factor.</s><s xml:id="_MUFp8R6">These eight factors were selected for two reasons.</s><s xml:id="_hMGGsvq">First, the modifiable nature of these factors may make them more likely to receive attention from the decision-makers, and evolve into prevention and intervention programs.</s><s xml:id="_eVP9EHc">Second, these selected factors significantly predicted suicidal ideation among Mongolian adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Altangerel et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_v9PTvUX">Given the fact that several internalizing and externalizing symptoms were predicted by shared risk and protective factors concurrently in previous studies from other countries (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Monahan et al., 2014)</ref>, the same factors from Altangerel and others' study might have similar effects on other internalizing and externalizing symptoms.</s></p><p xml:id="_npqZP2B"><s xml:id="_qFaMSm2">Also, demographic characteristics such as age, gender, and location tend to have a significant effect in exhibiting the internalizing and externalizing symptoms.</s><s xml:id="_nZbRXcH">Particularly, older adolescence was related to an increased level of internalizing and externalizing symptoms such as depression and anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chen et al., 2020)</ref>, smoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Choi et al., 2001)</ref>, and alcohol drinking <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">(Windle, 2003)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2XZNs2v">Moreover, female adolescents tend to exhibit more internalizing symptoms, while externalizing symptoms tend to be higher among male adolescents (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Cotter et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_bN7drXA">The reason was explained as peer pressure and delinquent peer associations are higher among boys, therefore resulting in more anti-social behaviors than girls.</s><s xml:id="_DSdxRTX">Whereas the more connection-oriented relationships among girls may produce more anxiety and depression over peer rejection and conflict.</s><s xml:id="_PJjD6hD">The effect of Mongolian culture may play role in the gender differences as well.</s><s xml:id="_Ujq94Xf">Traditionally, Mongolians value masculinity and powerfulness in men and submissiveness and softness in women <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Hurst, 2001;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Rarick et al., 2014)</ref>, and this cultural effect might enlarge the internalizing symptoms among females and externalizing symptoms among males.</s><s xml:id="_xZYVKHn">However, surprisingly, it was also found that while alcohol drinking was common among male adolescents in most countries, no such gender difference was observed among Mongolian adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Azzopardi et al., 2021)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zkNg4a2">Thus, alcohol drinking can be exceptional from the gender differences, and if supported, this can be a sign that alcoholism might have become a normative culture in Mongolia <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dashpuntsag et al., 2021)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_kxAgUcA"><s xml:id="_bzkU4UN">Lastly, the impact of locational difference is huge in Mongolia as the lifestyles of the urban city, Ulaanbaatar, and the countryside have a significant difference.</s><s xml:id="_DkDbM25">Compared to living in the urban city, living in the countryside might be less harmful to mental health and wellbeing as it is closer to nature, sparsely populated, and less polluted <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">(Tillmann et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_yFwSZzU">Indeed, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Davaasambuu et al.
