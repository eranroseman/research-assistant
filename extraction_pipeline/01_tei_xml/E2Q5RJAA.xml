within and outside the field and add to existing challenges with defining and evaluating this domain.</s><s xml:id="_HE3Kw28">The extremely wide range of terms used to define user engagement likely reflects a major critique of mHealth research-that there is a lack of a science of engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_GrcSTHy">We encourage standardization in terminology used when the intention is to evaluate users' behavioral engagement with mHealth technology, rather than treatment regimen, with the most common terms found in this systematic review: "use" or "engagement."</s><s xml:id="_nN9KUt6">Integrating standard user engagement language in an internationally adopted clinical terminology system, such as the Systematized Nomenclature of Medicine-Clinical Terms, could help facilitate standardization efforts.</s></p><p xml:id="_Kb4JPQH"><s xml:id="_9NCkzWZ">Another key finding was that the use of user log-in data was the default mHealth user engagement outcome, except for wearing a device when the intervention involved a wearable device component and responding to SMS text messages and push notifications when the intervention involved SMS text messaging and push notifications.</s><s xml:id="_p2ZKfJ7">Reliance on user log-in data over the other 10 major measurement approaches likely reflects that these data can be relatively straightforward to extract from a web portal.</s><s xml:id="_GaxHmF6">A strength of the use of user log-in data is that it may indicate more effortful and deliberate interactions with the technology (the user likely needs sufficient motivation to open and navigate an app) compared with, for example, quickly responding to a SMS text message or wearing a pedometer on the wrist.</s><s xml:id="_ZYxd5YR">User log-in data may be a more accurate reflection of engagement behavior than self-report, which is potentially subject to social desirability and recall bias.</s><s xml:id="_79eSuS6">The tendency for engagement assessed using user log-in data to be characterized as "low" may reflect the higher user burden of logging in to, and interacting with an, app, in addition to the overwhelming selection of this method for measuring user engagement.</s><s xml:id="_qAcX6Bx">Reliance on user log-in data may bias interpretations of user engagement to favor higher quantities of engagement at the expense of higher-quality engagement (eg, infrequent access of a particularly effective app feature that users perceive as interesting, helpful, or motivating may be higher-quality engagement compared with frequent log-ins to the app homepage).</s><s xml:id="_MBUBSPn">Given the ubiquitous selection of user log-in data and the heterogeneity of adherence and self-management outcomes in this systematic review, it is not possible to evaluate which user engagement metric is best.</s><s xml:id="_WuPAaae">In general, investigators should select the user engagement metric reflecting essential interactions with the mHealth intervention's key technology needed to facilitate behavior and health changes.</s></p><p xml:id="_CfB8mFS"><s xml:id="_KYjqyrN">We found that the exact degree of user engagement with the interventions reviewed in this study was difficult to estimate and that the association between user engagement and adherence or self-management outcomes were rarely evaluated.</s><s xml:id="_9k7aYBd">Both findings may relate to an important secondary finding that researchers rarely set a priori benchmarks for how much user engagement is considered scientifically adequate (no minimum engagement research benchmark set).</s><s xml:id="_thTBCqx">Concerningly, when no minimum research benchmark was set, researchers tended to characterize user engagement as "high," suggesting overoptimism about study results in the absence of any hypothesized lower boundary for what constituted minimally acceptable mHealth use.</s><s xml:id="_qPECahB">Setting cut points for how much user engagement is hypothesized to be adequate would also help to guide how much and in what ways users should interact with the mHealth intervention components to experience meaningful improvements in target outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_B3ZkQyK">Matching technology dosages to minimum engagement research benchmarks, when possible, could inform whether engagement recommendations were met and allow researchers to evaluate whether exceeding expectations is associated with even greater improvement in behavior or health outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_mrwK2ZB">Of note, studies with technology dosages or minimum engagement research benchmarks seemed to demand more from participants, as evidenced by the more common use of user log-in data and manual data entry to evaluate user engagement.</s><s xml:id="_M9cKX5f">User engagement burden should be considered when setting mHealth engagement expectations.</s></p><p xml:id="_8KCsAUE"><s xml:id="_NjxbumV">Setting minimum engagement research benchmarks could also account for variability in user engagement-level characterization depending on the metric selected and help to define what constitutes effective and meaningful engagement.</s><s xml:id="_U64csZd">Specifically, engagement assessed using user log-in data tended to be characterized as "low."</s><s xml:id="_6VtUSEd">By contrast, responding to text notifications or interacting via chats, phone calls, or social media posts, which may be more socially rewarding and less effortful to complete, tended to be characterized as "high."</s><s xml:id="_N8cSArK">A similarly higher pattern of user engagement was observed in studies evaluating the use of wearable (6/63, 10% vs 0) and nonwearable devices (7/63, 11% vs 0), which is often part of the users' regular self-management routines (eg, Bluetooth-enabled pill bottle or glucometer) or passively worn (eg, pedometer) and thus may be less burdensome to use.</s><s xml:id="_9tBqSJU">A higher SMS text message response rate and comparatively lower app log-in rate may both be minimally acceptable and potentially meaningful levels of engagement to effectively facilitate behavior or health change, particularly considering the level of effort and motivation involved in each type of interaction.</s><s xml:id="_VdRumDA">Given the inconsistencies in how investigators characterize engagement levels, setting minimum engagement research benchmarks could inform whether user engagement is adequate across metrics and associated with key adherence and self-management outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_5TCRFpM">This approach could also improve precision in how engagement levels are characterized (ie, what level of engagement is considered "low" vs "high"?).</s><s xml:id="_jx3S5V3">Such efforts during the study planning phase could reduce the tendency to characterize user engagement at multiple levels due to the use of multiple metrics and analyses.</s><s xml:id="_fBUb64q">Rethinking engagement levels as "adequate," "acceptable," "effective," or "meaningful" versus "high" or "low" may better inform how much people should realistically use mHealth technology and evaluate whether engagement level is associated with behavior and health changes.</s></p><p xml:id="_R5GErWk"><s xml:id="_sYJqZWz">In the mHealth trials reviewed, an important secondary finding was that participants were rarely told how much they should aim to engage with the technology (no technology dosages).</s><s xml:id="_MHB94m6">This is in contrast to drug trials in which participants are instructed to take a specific dosage of medication on a strict schedule and trials of in-person behavior change interventions (traditional therapy) in which participants are given therapy regimens and expectations for participation (eg, attend 12 therapy sessions and complete assigned homework each week of treatment) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gXb54bj">Although an early-phase research goal may be to see how much people interact with the technology in the absence of recommendations, an important future goal is to understand how much engagement is needed to maximize behavior and health changes.</s><s xml:id="_63KxUuJ">To this end, recommending in what ways and how much users should aim to engage with the technology is necessary.</s><s xml:id="_SaTw8jT">Giving technology dosages would also allow for experimental evaluation of different levels of recommended technology use to see what recommendation helps users achieve the most positive behavior and health changes.</s><s xml:id="_GsjZE6d">Furthermore, improvements in health and wellness can take time, and mHealth users may not observe immediate benefits to using mHealth interventions, which could contribute to premature abandonment of the tool.</s><s xml:id="_m58Cszm">Providing users with clearer guidance on how much and what type of mHealth intervention use is needed to begin effecting positive behavior and health changes could help encourage sustained use.</s></p><p xml:id="_BPjFnC2"><s xml:id="_xUZVgU7">Another primary finding was that user engagement was rarely considered a research end point.</s><s xml:id="_u6EuPw9">This is a problem because it is generally expected that users will need to interact with the mHealth technology to experience clinical benefit.</s><s xml:id="_fqHWyU7">Thus, user engagement behavior is a critical aspect of the mHealth intervention itself.</s><s xml:id="_Vy86j4f">Without designating user engagement as a research end point, mHealth intervention trials risk lacking the necessary empirical data and results to help end users understand how to optimally use the technology to see maximal clinical benefit.</s><s xml:id="_GpnJZr5">Lacking these data and results may also be a barrier to informing how these digital tools can be incorporated into regular clinical practice and policy <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3ncPvRD">Thus, in addition to carefully measuring the treatment adherence, self-management behavior, and associated health outcomes directly targeted by the mHealth intervention, equal care should be given to evaluating user engagement, such as how user engagement with the technology may change over time and potentially influence outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_YdN6puB">Shifting user engagement from afterthought data to an actual research end point would likely improve the quality and rigor of mHealth research and help develop mHealth interventions that motivate users to interact with the technology [318], and, ideally, experience greater clinical benefit.</s></p><p xml:id="_C5RMDXx"><s xml:id="_BkVhAEc">Our exploratory analysis of studies that provided monetary compensation for study participation versus those that did not (or did not report monetary compensation) showed that engagement-level characterizations were similar between the groups.</s><s xml:id="_8SrA5NS">It is possible that the monetary compensation was provided primarily for completing study procedures (eg, completing study surveys) rather than engaging with the mHealth intervention.</s><s xml:id="_zu8C8xW">In the studies of interventions comprising financial incentives for using the technology or meeting mHealth intervention goals (10/292, 3.4%), no clear pattern emerged for user engagement levels, although this likely reflects the small number of studies incorporating this mHealth component.</s><s xml:id="_TxHXGXz">User engagement evaluation methods were used in similar proportions between the groups, suggesting that monetary compensation was not associated with user engagement measurement selection.</s><s xml:id="_vN5eCeb">An important avenue for future mHealth engagement research is to improve the understanding of how monetary compensation is associated with user engagement levels, particularly when compensation is directed toward mHealth intervention use.</s></p></div>
