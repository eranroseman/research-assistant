open new horizons for Personal Informatics (PI) systems, defined as 'those that help people collect personally relevant information for the purpose of selfreflection and gaining self-knowledge' <ref type="bibr">(Li, Dey, and Forlizzi 2010, 558)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_yRsb2UP">A plethora of personal data can be currently collected automatically, from physiological parameters and psychological states to performance values and habits.</s></p><p xml:id="_yaauSWQ"><s xml:id="_87NbhPV">This act of collecting data on one's own behaviour is known as self-monitoring in clinical psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Elliot et al. 1996)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EkTtejA">Conceived originally as an assessment method to gather information about behaviours undetectable by an external observer <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Foster et al. 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Korotitisch and Nelson-Gray 1999)</ref>, it has been employed as an intervention technique because of its reactivity, i.e. the fact that the process of behaviour recording produces a change in behaviour itself <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">(Miltenberger 2007)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Qa32XxD">PI systems improve the act of self-monitoring by allowing individuals to track data everywhere at any time, potentially enabling the arising of self-reflection and triggering processes of behaviour change.</s><s xml:id="_vbJp699">At the end of the last century, PI systems started to be used by researchers and technology enthusiasts, such as the members of the Quantified Self community <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Marcengo and Rapp 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_GuUyqrb"><s xml:id="_aWMb4MB">We recently witnessed the spreading of a variety of ad hoc wearable devices and applications aimed at monitoring users' behaviours in the consumer market.</s><s xml:id="_wDG3tpc">Adding to this, advancements in wearable and ubiquitous technologies could make the gathering of personal data less obtrusive in the near future, by automatically detecting a variety of states that now still rely on the conscious act of self-reporting.</s><s xml:id="_9C2pZEf">Such advancements could foster the adoption of PI tools among a larger audience of potential users, making their personal data readily available to them <ref type="bibr">(Rapp et al. 2015</ref><ref type="bibr">(Rapp et al. , 2017))</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_MKne8XA">These 'potential users' might be curious regarding PI to discover something about themselves: however, they might not have impellent needs to self-track, as well as knowledge about using trackers effectively.</s><s xml:id="_2WrFwbT"><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Kim, Paulos, and Mankoff (2013)</ref> identified two stages of how people adopt technology: in the first stage, interest, engagement and fun are the main motivations, whereas in a later stage the instrument is integrated into daily routines <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Huang et al. 2015)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KsJWjaq">Reflecting on how we could design better trackers to engage individuals who show interest in self-monitoring, but do not have any prior experience in this practice, becomes then essential to favour the adoption of PI tools among a wider user base.</s></p><p xml:id="_EHWB3pr"><s xml:id="_8J6MeHX">In this new landscape, a question arises: should PI systems be rethought in order to better fit the needs and desires of individuals who are curious about PI tools and who have not tried them yet?</s><s xml:id="_rZ4vmSA">Despite the favourable market forecasts (IdTechEx 2014), there is an increasing scepticism about the real capabilities of PI devices in providing users with real benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Hunter 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b65">Maddox 2014)</ref>, especially those who are not expert in dealing with 'numbers' <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Hilviu and Rapp 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rapp et al. 2016)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SBePV8K">A recent research stressed that one-third of the Americans who purchased a tracker abandoned it after only six months <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">(Ledger and McCaffrey 2014)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_XFjEC5h">Despite the success of PI devices among specific categories of individuals (such as the Quantified Selfers, who are keen on tracking per se <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[Choe et al. 2014]</ref>, and users motivated to change their behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[Fritz et al. 2014]</ref>), such a phenomenon suggests that people find it difficult to engage with tracking technologies.</s></p><p xml:id="_Sutmgqh"><s xml:id="_vxFt5Xr">Moving from this issue, our research aims at finding how PI systems can be better integrated into everyday life, by identifying specific barriers that may prevent their widespread adoption and finding new solutions to overcome them.</s><s xml:id="_j88HphE">The main contributions of this article are the following: (i) it proposes a new PI system that embeds five specific user requirements aimed at engaging and satisfying users without prior experience in self-tracking; (ii) it validates such requirements through a qualitative user study, showing how naïve and expert users differently value the system; and (iii) it proposes three further design opportunities that could orient the design of future PI tools.</s><s xml:id="_RKaUzhR">The paper is structured as follows.</s><s xml:id="_ntzd5Tn">Section 2 presents related work, while Section 3 describes the user requirements we found through the initial study.</s><s xml:id="_QFCg4YJ">Section 4 outlines the system we developed according to such requirements and Section 5 presents the evaluation study.</s><s xml:id="_uQbzEu2">Finally, Section 6 highlights the limitations of our work, while Section 7 closes the paper with conclusions and future work.</s></p></div>
