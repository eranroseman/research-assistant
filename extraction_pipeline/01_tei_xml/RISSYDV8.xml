to be 387 million, and is expected to increase to 592 million by 2035 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WXHBQCd">This prevalence imposes a substantial burden of disease, mainly due to life-long multi-organ complications <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, leading to increased disability and premature deaths in low-and middle-income countries (LMIC) as well as high-income countries (HIC) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_Dv6SGMj"><s xml:id="_qsGgQrQ">Available evidence suggests that better control of blood glucose, blood pressure, and cholesterol levels would delay the onset of complications, and thereby prevent premature deaths among those already diagnosed with diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rCcEjDq">Lifestyle modification focusing on healthy diet is an accepted component of management <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, alongside promotion of physical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_XsrhKJq">However, patients with diabetes do not always follow advice about recommended changes in diet and physical activity, and therefore do not achieve optimal control of risk factors.</s><s xml:id="_PQfY7b8">Reasons for this are multifactorial, including psychological, social, and health care related factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_dSAhHzx"><s xml:id="_MmRBWHf">Recommendations for supporting diabetes self-management are now widely incorporated in clinical practice guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_jTQMhxN">However, strategies for providing effective continuing support and motivation are not well developed, and facilitating sustained behavior-changes remains an important challenge.</s><s xml:id="_EgRKaBW">Emerging evidence suggests that mobile health (mHealth) interventions may improve cardiovascular-related lifestyle behaviors and disease management <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_g5x4K8k">Interventions based on brief messages delivered via mobile device technologies, such as short message service (SMS) technology, are one of the most studied types of mHealth interventions, and available evidence suggests that they may contribute to behavior-change <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7z8uAeR">Messages can be readily delivered at a wide-scale and at a low cost, and can be used to provide information through one-way (unidirectional) systems, but also to facilitate two-way communication (interactive or bidirectional).</s><s xml:id="_qJSWa9p">In contrast to more resource-intensive one-to-one clinician-patient contacts in clinics, the use of brief messages can be attractive for patients in terms of convenience, acceptability, and user-friendliness <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_MsFK3cZ">This type of intervention could address non-adherence to lifestyle recommendations by providing frequent reminders, motivational support and prompts to action, as well as timely access and feedback to relevant health information, while making patient-provider communication much easier <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_FXFbZ36">Although their impact in different resource settings is still unclear, automated messaging technologies could be especially relevant in low-resource settings, given their ubiquity, low cost, and potential to underpin a developing health care infrastructure (eg electronic medical records systems).</s><s xml:id="_BZcWqra">All of these features are leading to an increasing interest in the use of brief messages as a part of public health interventions.</s></p><p xml:id="_hh8MrrV"><s xml:id="_Rk3RtZS">A number of systematic reviews have provided evidence for the effectiveness of mobile-phone based interventions on self-management of long term conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr"

has specifically reviewed the potential impact of automated brief messages on promoting lifestyle modifications in patients with type 2 diabetes.</s><s xml:id="_3hRburb">In addition, the theoretical basis for this type of intervention is not well established, and the usefulness of basing messages on established behavior-change techniques is not known.</s><s xml:id="_gERTh4n">These gaps in knowledge may partly be due to inadequate characterization of the techniques being used, which prevents the identification of those that might be helpful.</s></p><p xml:id="_HStxQwD"><s xml:id="_R9rfMB3">The primary objective of this systematic review was to examine the effectiveness of brief messages in improving glycemic control through promoting healthy eating and increasing physical activity, compared to usual care.</s><s xml:id="_8bwbeyV">We focused specifically on interventions delivered via mobile devices to people with type 2 diabetes.</s><s xml:id="_yz27PV9">Secondary objectives included 1) examining the extent to which interventions have used explicit theory, 2) examining the behavior-change techniques used, 3) examining the acceptability of the interventions, 4) examining their impact on lifestyle-change behavior and its determinants, 5) examining their impact on other clinical (blood pressure, lipids, and weight) and patient-reported outcomes, 6) comparing the impact of unidirectional vs bidirectional messages, and 7) exploring the specific impact of the interventions in HIC and LMIC.</s></p></div>
