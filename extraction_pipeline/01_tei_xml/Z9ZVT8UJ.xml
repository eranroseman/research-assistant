<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_EPXzsHe">Objectives</head><p xml:id="_hNf8fac"><s xml:id="_4gRM3Jr">The European Union funded the research project Integrated Health Technology Assessment for Evaluating Complex Technologies (INTEGRATE-HTA) (<ref type="url" target="http://www.integrate-hta.eu/">www.integrate-hta.eu</ref>)</s><s xml:id="_XfXNM6E">across seven institutions and five European countries.</s><s xml:id="_R9sCVUE">The project aimed to develop concepts and methods for HTA to enable a patient-centred, integrated assessment of the effectiveness, the economic, social, cultural, legal, and ethical aspects of complex interventions, taking into account context and implementation.</s><s xml:id="_4NTm4wv">Within this project, logic modelling was emphasised as an important means of handling complexity as well as integrating findings across different areas of assessment.</s><s xml:id="_CgNcFTU">We developed templates for logic models of complex interventions <ref type="bibr">(Rohwer et al.,2017b)</ref> to help those conducting a systematic review or HTA to think through all key elements in relation to the research question.</s><s xml:id="_RsxrM4P">We also sought to reconcile the above described contrasting uses of logic modelling, which is the focus of this paper.</s><s xml:id="_reahk9c">To do so, we develop a logic modelling approach that combines the strengths of the two above described distinct traditions, propose a taxonomy of logic models, and provide guidance on how to choose between different approaches and types of logic models in systematic reviews and HTAs.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_4nwqKHA">Methods</head><p xml:id="_MsrC2rj"><s xml:id="_3tr5fej">In order to inform development of logic model templates, we identified systematic reviews and HTAs that employed logic models through systematic literature searches, complemented by snowballing in the grey literature and expert consultations.</s><s xml:id="_572d8z5">Annex 1 provides more detailed information on our searches and lists the systematic reviews and HTAs containing logic models that we identified.</s><s xml:id="_nFKS7Zq">We also conducted snowballing for existing guidance on how to use logic models in primary research, systematic reviews and HTA.</s></p><p xml:id="_sWcQjHN"><s xml:id="_xK7u5zK">Using the identified examples of logic models in systematic reviews (which had almost exclusively adopted an a priori approach) and the existing guidance, we examined the specific aims and various elements of logic models.</s><s xml:id="_WRF8JrJ">Drawing on these as well as the conceptualisation of complexity used within the INTEGRATE-HTA project <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Craig et al., 2008)</ref>, we developed core elements of logic models for use in systematic reviews and HTAs and developed two distinct logic model templates.</s><s xml:id="_T7UTMhe">System-based logic models describe the system, in which the interaction between participants, intervention and context takes place; process-orientated logic models display the causal pathways that lead from the intervention to multiple outcomes <ref type="bibr">(Rohwer et al., 2017b)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_muxVtmy"><s xml:id="_c7GD45d">We applied these logic model templates in a demonstration HTA on home-based palliative care within the INTEGRATE-HTA project <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Brereton et al., 2016)</ref>, as well as three systematic reviews undertaken outside of the INTEGRATE-HTA project, i.e. an ongoing Cochrane review of interventions to reduce particulate matter air pollution <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Burns et al., 2014)</ref>, a Campbell review of e-learning to increase evidence-based health care competencies in healthcare professionals <ref type="bibr">(Rohwer et al., 2017a)</ref> and a review of interventions to reduce exposure to lead through consumer products and drinking water within a guideline developed by the World Health Organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Pfadenhauer et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_aSYjVjP">While a priori logic modelling was considered to be appropriate in the systematic reviews, the application in the demonstration HTA on home-based palliative care soon revealed that the logic model we had developed would not remain fixed.</s><s xml:id="_N5dVjcp">This was in part due to involvement of and regular interactions with a range of stakeholders (i.e.</s><s xml:id="_2NDcmd7">palliative care professionals and experts, patients, lay care givers) and in part due to the need to integrate various separate evidence assessments (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_nUqCYWu">regarding ethical aspects, contextual factors).</s><s xml:id="_8CfbdCT">These multiple sources of information shaped our understanding of the intervention in context, and made it apparent that several relevant elements had not been incorporated in the initial version of the logic model.</s><s xml:id="_ckAfa4m">We felt that this demonstration HTA did not lend itself to a pre-conceived static framework but required careful revision over time in relation to substantive new insights gained.</s></p><p xml:id="_vbK4Zbn"><s xml:id="_zcxGasn">In parallel, we conducted additional searches, specifically to identify systematic reviews that had used iterative logic models (Annex 1).</s><s xml:id="_dyhZK5h">Those identified were included in the overview of systematic reviews and HTAs containing logic models (Annex 1).</s><s xml:id="_DAmUX7A">We debated the specific advantages and limitations of a priori versus iterative logic modelling in relation to (i) accepted scientific practice in the field of systematic reviews and HTA, (ii) feasibility considerations, and (iii) the purported roles of logic models in relation to scoping the review, defining and conducting the review and making the review relevant to policy and practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Anderson et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rzmsd8C">From this evaluation it became clear that neither of the currently pursued approaches could make full use of the potential roles of logic models across all stages of the systematic review or HTA process.</s><s xml:id="_KhcdMAH">Indeed, some systematic review projects (in particular those combining multiple quantitative and/or qualitative systematic reviews to tackle a given problem) and many HTA projects evolve in response to the needs of stakeholders, capitalise on timely inputs of new data and revise their methodologies to counter challenges.</s><s xml:id="_Q34btCu">These types of projects require an approach that facilitates a balance between minimizing bias and allowing flexibility, where an initial logic model guides the early stages of the process but may be revised as our understanding of the problem advances or plans change in response to stakeholder input.</s><s xml:id="_yx2uRTx">Yet, to minimise subjectivity and to maximise transparency, iteration must take place in a controlled manner, which avoids overstating surprising findings (e.g. by undertaking revisions only following a new systematic review or well-defined piece of analysis), critically appraises the internal and external validity of findings and explicitly reports why, how and on which basis changes are made (e.g.</s><s
