earlier Lifeline evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Gould et al., 2016)</ref> found that higher levels of engagement enhanced counselors' chances of mitigating imminent suicide risk through collaborative interventions and reduced needing to involve emergency services.</s><s xml:id="_vWwT8rg">Lifeline chatters' engagement with counselors-measured by the feeling that their counselors were genuinely concerned for their well-being and understood them, or that they agreed with the counselor on plans-had the strongest associations with chatters' perceptions that the chat was effective.</s><s xml:id="_MzqCRtC">Counselors' success in engaging callers, chatters, and texters may facilitate "comforting communication" to reduce emotional distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Caplan &amp; Turner, 2007)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_nMcxmZk">These findings support CTL's emphasis on training volunteer CCs in building rapport using "good contact" techniques (Crisis Text

xml:id="_qKTJWcG">While CTL appears to address the needs of individuals aged 24 years or younger, who represent three-quarters of CTL texters, more attention is needed to appeal to and more effectively intervene with texters across the lifespan.</s><s xml:id="_r52jfWw">Lifeline's chat services were similarly more effective for minors than older age groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gould, Chowdhury et al., 2021)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_ZJHYX9R"><s xml:id="_Cbbwfte">To our knowledge, this is the first study examining the association of a crisis service's

about disparities in health care quality in the U.S. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Fiscella &amp; Sanders, 2016)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HXNbVZy">Texters who identified as Black or African American had higher odds than White texters of reporting being more overwhelmed or suicidal at the end of the conversation, even after controlling for all covariates.</s><s xml:id="_9DkSccK">However, the magnitude of the differences in outcomes reported by Black or White texters was relatively small and, importantly, no differences emerged concerning perceptions of CCs' genuine concern, the conversation's overall helpfulness, or their hopefulness or depression at the conversation's conclusion.</s><s xml:id="_jAzRV3y">Texters who identified as Hispanic/Latinx/ of Spanish origin provided more favorable feedback than White texters about the helpfulness of CTL's conversations.</s><s xml:id="_KZaKrvb">This is consistent with findings from an evaluation of Lifeline's crisis center follow-up initiative showing that Hispanic callers had a more positive perception of the intervention-specifically, they had higher odds than non-Hispanic callers of saying that follow-up calls stopped them from killing themselves and kept them safe <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Gould et al., 2018)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_sRBNYnS"><s xml:id="_w7AaJTX">Given the high prevalence of mental health symptoms among CTL texters and the small proportion who reported receiving professional help <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Pisani et al., 2022)</ref>, our findings underscore a need to focus within and beyond CTL on long-term needs of texters with the most severe mental health concerns.</s><s xml:id="_cBFDv5k">Several of the current findings highlight that the most distressed texters (those with high depression, anxiety, social isolation and frequent texting) felt less relieved at the end of their crisis conversation than asymptomatic texters or those who texted only once during the study period.</s><s xml:id="_5mFCyxh">Depressed, anxious and socially isolated texters had lower odds than less symptomatic texters of reporting the conversation as helpful or feeling more hopeful afterward and had significantly higher odds of reporting feeling more depressed, overwhelmed, or suicidal at the end of the conversation.</s><s xml:id="_mJhCKKW">Individuals who frequently texted (i.e., 10 or more times in the one-year study period) had a similar pattern of results as symptomatic texters.</s><s xml:id="_XuFXEA3">Providing relevant and accessible referrals to texters is a key component of CTL's training (Crisis Text Line, 2017); its enhancement is recommended to build more effective ways of connecting the most distressed texters with various kinds of follow-up care and evidence-based interventions.</s></p><p xml:id="_8ukz69x"><s xml:id="_F6C3y63">Crisis Text Line's ability to reduce suicidality in nearly half of suicidal texters can be considered a clinically meaningful accomplishment.</s><s xml:id="_Jsfkefh">This reduction in risk at a moment of crisis can provide texters with an opportunity to seek further help and engage in additional interventions that could save lives and have prolonged impact.</s><s xml:id="_DJ2uGKS">Our finding that nearly half of suicidal texters reported feeling less suicidal after the text conversation is comparable to the reduction in suicidal ideation among chatters at the end of Lifeline crisis chat interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gould, Chowdhury et al., 2021)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_AsFtVnq">This level of improvement mirrors the range of improvements reported after psychotherapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Strauss et al., 2021)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KGr3MNv">In contrast to CTL's positive outcomes, yet consistent with Lifeline crisis chat outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gould, Chowdhury et al., 2021)</ref>, a small minority of all texters did not feel their conversations were helpful (13.5%) or felt less hopeful (6.4%), more depressed (5.9%), more overwhelmed (6.3%) or more suicidal (5.1%) after their conversations.</s><s xml:id="_QCDSmK2">While it would be ideal to have all or nearly all texters experiencing an improvement at the end of conversations, this is an unrealistic expectation given this population's distress levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Pisani et al., 2022)</ref> and similar findings of worsening symptoms for a small portion of patients following psychotherapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Strauss et al., 2021)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_vPh2YkZ"><s xml:id="_798tRj7">This study has several limitations.</s><s xml:id="_H2sWGzr">Firstly, only 22.5% of texters completed the voluntary post-conversation survey.</s><s xml:id="_9XJr9qc">The survey weighting strategy we explored did not add meaningfully to our understanding of the population <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Pisani et al., 2022)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tjqsMrc">However, there are likely to be other factors, not measured in this study, that are associated with the completion of the survey and could yield some unknown bias.</s><s xml:id="_DAkFE7J">Second, we defined our sample for the current evaluation based on whether texters answered the first item in the survey.</s><s xml:id="_BF2EXRb">While this choice produced the largest sample size, it introduced a great deal of itemlevel missingness.</s><s xml:id="_U32yApF">This was the rationale for conducting weighted analyses to account for missingness in both covariates and outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_HmfDZWQ">Third, this evaluation focused on post-conversation surveys from texters who exchanged at least 10 messages in their conversation.</s><s xml:id="_NXKgyjT">Thus, we do not know anything about individuals who disengaged before reaching a CC or abandoned the conversation before exchanging 10 messages.</s><s xml:id="_ucM6A9A">Finally, this evaluation covers short-term self-reported outcomes, and includes no follow-up beyond the immediate post-conversation period.</s></p><p xml:id="_PGywK2B"><s xml:id="_ZDCTJgh">Notwithstanding these limitations, the study has numerous strengths.</s><s xml:id="_Y7RRgUv">This is the first study to estimate the effectiveness of CTL, the largest provider of crisis text-based services in the U.S. Furthermore, the size and diversity of the sample provided enough statistical power to assess the differential effectiveness of the intervention by race-the first such assessment for any crisis intervention.</s><s xml:id="_wpxzUHH">The large sample size also allowed us to examine the relationship of the outcomes with several texter characteristics and their perceived engagement with their CCs, crucial elements to person-centered care.</s></p><p xml:id="_MxpjFFg"><s xml:id="_nXr5jD3">In conclusion, our study offers novel empirical evidence for the short-term effectiveness of CTL's services.</s><s xml:id="_rGHvTGH">The vast majority of texters reported that the conversation was helpful, and a sizeable minority reported feeling more hopeful, less depressed, less overwhelmed, and less suicidal after their conversation.</s><s xml:id="_bv3AETb">The finding that nearly half of suicidal texters reported feeling less suicidal after the intervention aligns with Lifeline crisis chat intervention's reduction of suicidal risk and may represent the level of accomplishment that is feasible in one crisis session.</s><s xml:id="_Q2FmHky">Our findings also provide some empirical evidence for CTL's success in addressing unique needs of racially and ethnically diverse populations.</s><s xml:id="_K58zasZ">Overall, texters across different races and ethnicities perceived their CTL CCs as having genuine concern for them and the effectiveness of the service was largely similar for all texters.</s><s xml:id="_fsEV3vN">This is a step toward overcoming racial and ethnic disparities in mental health care in the U.S. <ref
