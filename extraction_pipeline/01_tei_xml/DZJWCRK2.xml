is critical because even if an evidence-based intervention is available and shown to be effective, its impact could be limited by an unsuccessful and inequitable design, implementation, and

PRISM to align contextual needs with the design and evaluation of healthcare and public health interventions from a systems thinking perspective, b) a co-creation engagement approach to actively

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_hvsP6M2">Discussion</head><p xml:id="_yhCctjH"><s xml:id="_3gEcvCP">We propose an integration of PRISM, systems thinking perspective, and a co-creation engagement approach to guide practitioners and researchers on the alignment of complex interventions to local contexts that is centered on inclusion and equity.</s><s xml:id="_YRy4ZdK">It is critical that researchers and practitioners complement integration efforts with pragmatic assessments that allow partners to evaluate the extent to which engagement has been equitable and cocreation has occurred <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[70]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2kMj3f4">Researchers and community partners can often have very different perceptions about how much this has happened.</s><s xml:id="_8fXhtVH">This work contributes to the field by offering conceptual guidance on the application of the PRISM model to align intervention to context and with an equity focus through the use of complex systems concepts and a cocreation engagement with partners.</s><s xml:id="_2EEBp69">PRISM is a suitable model to address equity because it is context-based and offers a practical and straightforward way for researchers and practitioners to address four contextual domains that have been shown to impact equity (e.g., structural domain with a history of lack of access to quality education, healthcare and economic opportunities for women, and among racial and ethnic minority groups in the United States) <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">72]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3wgsEbC">This first step of elucidating conceptual linkages and practical application of the PRISM model can guide and inform future empirical efforts to test them.</s><s xml:id="_zgaSUG8">Although we have focused on the integration of co-creation with the PRISM framework, similar integration could likely be achieved with other implementation science frameworks.</s></p><p xml:id="_FYBXySq"><s xml:id="_3JBKQS4">This paper offers novel recommendations to this alignment process.</s><s xml:id="_ZnEDUbg">First, a co-creation research engagement that supports the alignment of contextual needs, values, and resources to an intervention's core functions and forms can better inform participatory research including which dimensions of equity will be prioritized (e.g., representativeness of participants reached by the intervention; or incorporation of equity-focused measures into the tracking/evaluation system) <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[73]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tergvk6">Second, we emphasize representativeness and reporting across all five RE-AIM outcomes and not simply reporting the most often used outcome (e.g., Reach (in its most basic form-the number of participants) <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[74]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_UV9CTgU">Third, the concept of the RE-AIM 'Cascade' and examples of actions that can be taken to prevent or mitigate inequities that can emerge at any step in this sequential implementation cascade is novel.</s><s xml:id="_SGKcEsw">Finally, the emphasis on iterative applications of PRISM as operationalized most recently in the iterative PRISM (iPRISM) webtool <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[73]</ref> noted above is essential for long term success and sustainment of equitable outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[75]</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_3FQsJhX">Recommendations for research and practice</head><p xml:id="_hkzDm3c"><s xml:id="_S23rAHs">We recommend additional research on several key areas discussed.</s><s xml:id="_bDbXctn">First, research on key PRISM domains and how they relate to equity is needed such as the study of whether some domains are more strongly related to certain aspects of health equity (e.g., the domain of 'Patient Perspectives' may be more strongly related to equitable reach than other PRISM domains such as the Implementation and Sustainability Infrastructure).</s><s xml:id="_3Zvx8yD">There is a need for more specific guidance for practitioners on the amount of time, facilitation, and guidance needed.</s><s xml:id="_WFWdHPQ">More research is needed on implementation costs to apply PRISM co-creation engagement methods.</s><s xml:id="_av7Xn2P">Last, we ponder whether pragmatic measures of co-creation can be developed and validated, and whether greater intensities (dose) of recommended co-creation engagement are associated with more equitable intervention implementation and outcomes.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_PyDBEex">Conclusions</head><p xml:id="_8qgQAV9"><s xml:id="_WFh2fGA">IS emphasizes a need to understand local contexts through ongoing participatory engagement to improve service delivery and address disparities.</s><s xml:id="_zdjBJEm">PRISM is a pragmatic accessible IS framework that can guide research efforts seeking to embed local contexts' characteristics, including multi-level drivers of equity, into the design and evaluation of interventions.</s><s xml:id="_4qARvXv">This 'context to intervention alignment' can help complex health interventions to achieve their goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[34]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fcypzRr">PRISM and its iterative 'RE-AIM Cascade' component can help programs achieve key implementation outcomes (e.g., reach, adoption, sustainability) with an explicit focus on equity.</s><s xml:id="_kgwbQMu">In summary, we address future directions for the application of the PRISM RE-AIM framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[76]</ref> by presenting a concrete way to align an intervention to local contexts using a complex systems perspective with the concepts of functions and forms.</s><s xml:id="_JG8yjT7">We propose the use of co-creation processes in health-related research because it is a type of engagement to inform this alignment process, and contribute to equity being addressed.</s><s xml:id="_zV2E7nj">Therefore, 'there is no equity without engagement, and no engagement without equity' .</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p xml:id="_JVj5C3z"><s xml:id="_TSb47E4">Fig. 1 Illustration of the Practical Implementation Sustainability Model (PRISM) and RE-AIM Outcomes</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="3,155.92,476.26,283.44,231.60" type="bitmap" /></figure>
