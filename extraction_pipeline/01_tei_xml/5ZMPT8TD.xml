xml:id="_z3mDAUT">Thus, in some cases, the participants could not pick up the phone and listen to voice message.</s><s xml:id="_m3xQaZ9">For example, a previous study in Afghanistan reported that the

pregnant women in Ghana, more than 80% of the participants picked up the phone and listened to at least 50% of the length of each message prenatally, while less than 54% of the participants did so postnatally <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_yQmeaUM">The aforementioned study in Bangladesh reported that only a third of the participants (29.9%) picked up six or more phone calls of a total of eight voice messages delivered in a month.</s><s xml:id="_vCZHf5s">The primary reason for not picking up the phone was the commitment to household chores.</s><s xml:id="_4cpVaEY">Additionally, only 35.5% of those having picked up a phone completed listening to voice messages to the end <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_j2Qee98">In India, most participants (88.1%) picked up the phone and completed listening to a 19-second voice message targeting CSWs.</s><s xml:id="_SMctUHH">However, only 58.5% of the participants completed listening to a 31-second voice message <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WU2A75c">These studies imply that ensuring participants' adherence to voice messages is crucial for

intervention.</s></p><p xml:id="_GtfxE84"><s xml:id="_yQQGMer">In this study targeting the area in Lagos that includes urban slum communities, 14 consecutive voice messages on MCH were delivered to the participants.</s><s xml:id="_kXr8XCp">In the urban slum communities, mothers were less likely to use MCH services, and the maternal mortality ratio was high (1050 per 100000 live births), compared

type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and most the women in Lagos State (85.9%) owned mobile phones <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, voice message on MCH was employed as an appropriate

the core message part of a voice message.</s><s xml:id="_YpxQNtu">Then, we attempted to assess the intervention adherence in picking up the phone calls and in completing listening up to the core
