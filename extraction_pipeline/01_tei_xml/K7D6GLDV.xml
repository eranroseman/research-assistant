payments are time-limited as it lasts only 3 years for a specific technology or specific indication; the maximum payment is limited to 65% of the cost, and only if a hospital's costs for a specific stay exceed the MS-DRG bundled payment amount, which means the hospital has to show financial loss; finally, it requires 'newness', cost, and substantial clinical improvement criteria for the technology, which are difficult to satisfy-though FDA breakthrough status for new technology can satisfy newness and clinical improvement criteria, newness may only last until utilization claims data exists.</s><s xml:id="_jVGVeQJ">Other technologies may become eligible for the NTAP in-patient should they satisfy the very stringent requirements for the add-on payment, as viz.ai and Caption Health have already been able to achieve.</s></p><p xml:id="_kjSpyHj"><s xml:id="_psBn4yP">Given the above limitations, others have tried to develop incentive frameworks for AI but only in a limited context, without considering existing, complex multi-payor US healthcare coverage and reimbursement systems, and ignoring the role of affected stakeholders <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s></p><p xml:id="_QCVqmUh"><s xml:id="_SUgUP2D">Instead, we propose a comprehensive framework that: (a) maximizes alignment with ethical frameworks for healthcare AI 1,2 , (b) allows more optimal alignment between the ethical, equity, workflow, cost, and value perspectives for AI services, (c) enhances support and involvement by affected stakeholders, (d) is transparent, and (e) maps onto the existing payment amount and coverage systems in the US.</s><s xml:id="_FbFfgpD">Its goal is to quantify and estimate the payment amount, which can be optimized by finding an optimum for the framework.</s><s xml:id="_dtRGxEF">One such optimum might be where it cannot be improved for some stakeholders, without making it less optimal for others, called a Pareto optimum <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s></p><p xml:id="_2CePhS4"><s xml:id="_8wpFsYP">While we focus on the US landscape, this framework can be a useful template for any healthcare system.</s><s xml:id="_URhDNb4">The framework is focused on payment for the use of AI, and while implementing an AI may have downstream effects, such as more patients being recommended for treatment, or a provider needing a more or less complex E/M visit, is beyond its scope, as there are existing methodologies and frameworks to adjust payments for such cases if appropriate.</s><s xml:id="_fQu4zEb">As a practical example, we provide a case study to demonstrate how this framework, involving affected stakeholders, can lead to insurance coverage and sustainable reimbursement for a specific validated autonomous AI service.</s></p><p xml:id="_nkDvbpV"><s xml:id="_xEBRXxz">Finally, we alert the reader that the first author is an AI creator, and therefore is potentially biased towards monetary reimbursement for AI; a similar conflict exists for JG.</s><s xml:id="_yw2rwKv">While all potential conflicts have been fully disclosed, we have sought to ensure a balanced discussion as the other authors are not conflicted, are on the professional and payor side, and do not have financial or other interest in any AI receiving monetary reimbursement.</s></p></div>
