however, the impact was greater during 2020 due to the extension of the spring break, as mandated by the university in an effort to adapt to the pandemic.</s><s xml:id="_WNwmaRm">The proportion of total hours spent screening during March 2020 (346.5 hours) was significantly less than the proportion of total hours spent screening during March 2019 (241.8 hours; P&lt;.001).</s><s xml:id="_J3jRMuz">This discrepancy could be attributed to the time it took for the research team to modify its recruitment protocols to adapt to the ongoing changes to safety regulations.</s><s xml:id="_UsHtpts">The research team does not require its screeners to continue screening throughout academic breaks, thus contributing to the decrease in screening coverage seen in March 2020.</s></p><p xml:id="_R5VEcvR"><s xml:id="_6Ge3r6g">After the recruitment site and the university halted human-subjects research on March 13, 2020, and March 15, 2020, respectively, the research team expeditiously decided to convert all consenting shifts into screening shifts.</s><s xml:id="_VRvJFmZ">This decision positively impacted screening coverage in April 2020.</s><s xml:id="_4JnwvPh">There was a significant increase in the proportion of hours spent screening in April 2020 (611.5 hours) when compared to April 2019 (470.5 hours; P&lt;.001).</s><s xml:id="_Dt8Aaeq">Additionally, there was no significant difference in the LOS between April 2020 (33 minutes) and April 2019 (36 minutes; P=.77), demonstrating the research team's efficient transition of recruitment practices.</s></p><p xml:id="_YfGeXgN"><s xml:id="_Qz89tbA">There was a significant increase in the total number of hours spent screening in July 2020 (513.5 hours) when compared to July 2019 (404.3 hours).</s><s xml:id="_AAEFkXz">The research team recruited a new cohort of research assistants in May 2020, all of whom were trained to screen quickly and efficiently.</s><s xml:id="_2UAwM34">With enrollment efforts still halted, the research team encouraged the new cohort to begin screening in the summer, thus increasing screening coverage during a time that otherwise experiences a decrease in coverage.</s><s xml:id="_HHRxJgF">This also positively impacted the LOS during July, as there was a significant decrease in LOS in July 2020 (22 minutes) compared to July 2019 (42 minutes; P=.01).</s></p><p xml:id="_2Pnmn2J"><s xml:id="_ANDbYqz">In addition to improved screening coverage, there was greater accuracy with respect to more charts being opened for further screening where the individual was deemed eligible to approach.</s><s xml:id="_UhdCd3j">Although there was a greater proportion of candidates (charts opened) in 2019 than in 2020 (P&lt;.001), there was a greater proportion of potential participants (cases deemed approachable) in 2020 than in 2019 (P&lt;.001).</s><s xml:id="_M8WTDxZ">The proportion of potential participants was significantly greater overall in 2020 than in 2019 (P&lt;.001) and at every measured time point.</s><s xml:id="_GEBjnTN">This further reflects the need for continued enrollment efforts and highlights the impact of the pandemic on the biobanking efforts of the parent study.</s><s xml:id="_DBHyvWd">The improvement in screening accuracy may be due to changes in training and laboratory protocols;
