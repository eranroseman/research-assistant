by HCPs serve to aid those HCPs, there are also AI/ML-enabled devices that make a clinical decision without human oversight, including the first point-of-care autonomous AI system on the US market

<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">25</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_Ab7fQ7k">This is especially the case where the systems that utilize AI do not adhere to rapidly

of a widely-used AI system showed that while its stated goal was to identify patients who needed extra help with their complex health needs, its actual objective function (its "achieved goal") was to predict healthcare costs.</s><s xml:id="_uqc6jfy">This use of the AI system out of context resulted in sicker, Black patients receiving similar care to healthier, White patients despite needing higher

appropriate level of care <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">25</ref> .</s></p><p xml:id="_9TAfgJu"><s xml:id="_Tzdn2FG">These ethical and other concerns with AI in healthcare have been shown by a number

Considerations on Algorithmic Interpretation (FPOAI) workgroup of the Collaborative Community on Ophthalmic Imaging published their "Foundational Considerations" <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">32</ref> on AI as a start to developing metrics for ethics, including metrics for "Equity" <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">33</ref> , in order to be able to evaluate how specific AI

xml:id="_4VKDMzS">In its recent Artificial Intelligence/Machine Learning (AI/ML)-Based Software as a Medical Device (SaMD) Action Plan 10 , FDA articulated the importance of addressing bias in the

principle of beneficence, it can be a common metric such as sensitivity, specificity, or clinical outcome, while for the principle of equity, it can be sensitivity disaggregated by demographic subgroup, differential clinical outcome across subgroups, or even population achieved sensitivity or specificity to measure the impact of access to the process, as we have defined previously <ref

healthcare process (that may include AI) meets the equity principle.</s><s xml:id="_RxVmFGq">To illustrate, a given process may improve healthcare outcomes for a patient, or a population, on average.</s><s xml:id="_xhztbT5">However, when we consider outcomes across the population in more detail, this assumed improvement through integration of the AI system may not be evenly distributed across the population, though disease characteristics including prevalence, severity and prognosis may be otherwise equally distributed.</s><s xml:id="_2wCPghB">The AI may affect a large variance in

1 .</s><s xml:id="_NwY2xCy">Examples of such groups are groups that are defined by racial, ethnic, age, sex, gender, national origin, disability, religion, political, or genetic information characteristics 1 .</s><s xml:id="_Vg6HPwV">Thus, such bias reduces the bioethical principle of "Justice," as Char et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">28</ref> and Abramoff et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">32</ref> described.</s><s xml:id="_fG5ApKV">On the basis of such ethical frameworks, and the continuing development of "metrics for ethics," bias can be quantified as differential impact of a healthcare process on a particular group.</s><s xml:id="_mQm8YYJ">Humans delivering healthcare can also exhibit bias; for example, a recent study showed provider bias, where providers' charts documented Black patients' symptoms and signs in a more pejorative manner, with the potential to exacerbate health disparities <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">37</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_UMcq56e">Other

.</s></p><p xml:id="_3WmxZrw"><s xml:id="_68B2VXd">How much any process, whether partially delivered or aided by AI, or fully delivered by humans, meets the "equity" bioethical principle can be quantified in various ways.</s><s xml:id="_MKur7qz">Such measurements are necessarily specific to the use case and patients' risk of harm being considered, but an emerging set of studies draws on new data to measure algorithmic performance.</s><s xml:id="_rXRwcTn">In fact, such measurements have shown that AI systems can counter bias by human decision makers <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_FtqgPsa">Similarly, in a diagnostic process, there may be concern about equity in accuracy.</s><s xml:id="_PMkkr8B">Subgroup statistical testing for the presence or absence of an effect on diagnostic accuracy ("accuracy disaggregation") could be used to determine how well the equity principle is met <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">41</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_2hzJJNX">As an example, where there is concern about access to a diagnostic test, population-achieved sensitivity and specificity, which measures the impact of both access and sensitivity, has been proposed as a way to understand the impact of bias on population health, when including so-called invisible populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">32</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_kzBCPFv">By allowing optimization of populationachieved sensitivity and specificity, this metric can aid in improving population outcomes through diagnostic assessment, including those performed by AI.</s></p><p xml:id="_zkvKAsN"><s xml:id="_2HyQUZb">Ultimately, understanding and mitigation of AI bias starts with assessment and quantification of possible sources of bias along the entire lifecycle of an AI device.</s><s xml:id="_wc9spRC">Identification of bias is only part of mitigation, and stakeholders will have to decide, based on the AI context and perceived benefit/burden ratios, the extent to which identified biases can and should be mitigated.</s></p><p xml:id="_mF5yYqV"><s xml:id="_U4hS2Ss">The AI total product lifecycle Bioethical analysis of the AI lifecycle by Char et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">28</ref> highlighted the pipeline, ranging from conception over development to deployment ("access") of AI systems, and the parallel pipeline of evaluation and oversight activities at each stage.</s><s xml:id="_yVH3tVS">On top of this model, we analyzed the key factors associated with ethical considerations, from the existing literature as well as newly identified.</s><s xml:id="_kxzNvBT">This pipeline model framework is useful for systematic ethical appraisals of AI systems from development through deployment, and for interdisciplinary
