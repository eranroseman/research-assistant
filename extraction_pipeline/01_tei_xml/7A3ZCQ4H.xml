<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_49XH3FA">SECURITY AND DATA GOVERNANCE</head><p xml:id="_QbwR5vw"><s xml:id="_swwyGTU">Considerations of cybersecurity and data rights are preconditions for the mass adoption of DTx.</s><s xml:id="_kZfe2Tb">Similar to prior work regarding connected sensors in medicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16</ref> , as DTx transfer information over the internet, risks of unauthorized access and manipulation of these products and underlying data could compromise both trust in the product and patient care.</s><s xml:id="_uMWEWnB">Draft guidance from the FDA regarding cybersecurity in SaMD and networked medical devices was released in October 2018 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">17</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_MrSsKTq">At this time, medical device manufacturers must comply with federal quality system regulations to address cybersecurity risks of their products both pre-and post-FDA review.</s></p><p xml:id="_dFZbmgK"><s xml:id="_PCDyJWV">The FDA has defined two "tiers" of devices according to their perceived cybersecurity risk: Tier 1 (higher cybersecurity risk) devices are those capable of connecting, either wired or wirelessly, to another medical or nonmedical product, a network, or the Internet, and for which a cybersecurity breach affecting the device could directly result in patient harm to multiple patients.</s><s xml:id="_byCnM2a">Tier 2 (standard cybersecurity risk) devices are those for which the criteria for a Tier 1 device are not met.</s><s xml:id="_DrfwMR5">However, while the FDA has issued guidance regarding cybersecurity device design, labeling, and documentation for premarket submissions, the agency does not currently mandate the completion of premarket security audits for medical devices.</s><s xml:id="_KJ42kKV">The current review model relies on device manufacturers to determine the level of cybersecurity risk associated with their product and include a set of cybersecurity design controls to minimize that risk.</s><s xml:id="_F7SBcTz">The FDA then evaluates the manufacturer's design and risk management documentation for reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness.</s><s xml:id="_NyuTYnk">However, one study found that from 2002 to 2016, only ~2% of softwareenabled device FDA product summaries included cybersecurity content <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_639jb63">In 2016, the most recent year in the study sample, 5.5% of product summaries included cybersecurity content.</s><s xml:id="_DDp7kVr">Although information about device cybersecurity may be present in a product's full FDA dossier, device summaries are some of the primary public-facing documents used by stakeholders to evaluate a product's safety and effectiveness.</s><s xml:id="_sVzz59d">This discrepancy raises the concern that patients and clinicians will be unable to make informed decisions about potential product risks.</s><s xml:id="_xHvWUEr">Another study found that hundreds of US medical device recalls were due to software defects, some of which risked patient harm <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">19</ref> .</s></p><p xml:id="_3Cec5kQ"><s xml:id="_WJdybfd">As more networked medical devices and SaMD are developed and commercialized and new cybersecurity threats continue to emerge, inclusion of a standardized, public cybersecurity "bill of materials" in premarket applications, as has been called for by some regulators <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">17</ref> , may help resolve the information gap between manufacturers and purchasers of SaMDs.</s><s xml:id="_yv9QzSm">In addition, security audits for Tier 1 products subject to premarket approval, whether conducted by the medical device manufacturer or a third party, would be a worthwhile inclusion as a required, rather than currently recommended <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">20</ref> , component of FDA Annual Reports following commercialization.</s><s xml:id="_EmpkjYz">As Annual Reports are not required of devices cleared through the 510(k) pathway, requesting that those product manufacturers submit an independent cybersecurity risk assessment documentation annually may ensure continued device safety.</s><s xml:id="_dXcRbQx">The annual nature of this documentation may help manufacturers account for new technologies that may compromise existing encryption standards and machine learning models, such as quantum computing and adversarial attacks, respectively.</s><s xml:id="_DZU8Krg">Although security audits alone do not guarantee comprehensive security, requesting audit results, and thus ensuring that manufacturers remain vigilant in making design decisions that minimize risk, may reduce the risk of security breaches.</s></p><p xml:id="_q2bu6bS"><s xml:id="_gf6wJBx">In regard to data rights and governance, manufacturers may employ End User License Agreements, Terms of Service, and Privacy Policies to establish and convey company and user data rights for monitoring, evaluation, and distribution of collected data.</s><s xml:id="_Mvp2YEx">The FDA retains oversight for DTx classified as medical devices per Section 3060(a) of the 21st Century Cures Act and may police unauthorized distribution of patient-reported, behavioral, or biometric data.</s><s xml:id="_3FNjvJx">However, because medical device classification by the FDA is based on the intended use of a product rather than the capabilities of the hardware or software itself, determining whether or not a product falls under FDA purview is often ambiguous.</s><s xml:id="_xgcW4QC">This is often the case for many connected sensor technologies in medicine, which instead may fall under the oversight of the Federal Trade Commission, Federal Communications Commission, National Institute of Standards and Technology, and Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology.</s><s xml:id="_JbPuYCp">The obscure nature of oversight responsibility highlights the importance for early engagement with the FDA regarding the regulatory designation of DTx products under development.</s></p><p xml:id="_XbN9738"><s xml:id="_YkcDADt">REIMBURSEMENT Despite significant lobbying efforts from DTx manufacturers, the Centers for Medicaid and Medicaid Services (CMS) has not yet issued clear guidance for reimbursement of DTx.</s><s xml:id="_WYesbyb">Although CMS guidance is typically a regulatory bellwether for commercial payers, CVS and ExpressScripts, the two largest pharmacy benefit managers, launched inaugural digital health formularies in late 2019 <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">21</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_ZVeM7ps">Pharmacies and payers typically rely on FDA National Drug Code (NDC) and National Health Related Items Code (NHRIC) numbers for medical device reimbursement within pharmacies.</s><s xml:id="_fpgHp6X">For some state public insurance programs, receiving reimbursement following award of an NDC is commonplace.</s><s xml:id="_aqXSwb3">Early DTx, such as Welldoc's Bluestar, received these numbers for the purpose of inclusion in drug compendia and reimbursement <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">22</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_96d95ey">However, in 2016 the FDA ruled that SaMD will be ineligible to receive NDC codes after September 2021 <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">23</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_uCyHgHZ">Instead, DTx may apply for a unique device identification (UDI) number from the FDA.</s><s xml:id="_TMx2Xzc">Consequently, there has been concern from DTx stakeholders that the purchasers of DTx, including pharmacies and payers, are not yet prepared to transition away from use of NHRIC or NDC numbers, which are only 11 digits compared to the UDI's 14, presenting a bizarre and nontrivial technical challenge.</s><s xml:id="_B6uu5Wv">Education regarding the rigor of DTx product development and clinical testing as similar to traditional pharmaceuticals will be crucial in achieving acceptance from payers, PBMs, clinicians, and patients.</s><s xml:id="_Mu8uJZr">Given challenges with traditional medication adherence, it will also be important for DTx developers to design products that engage patients over long time periods, particularly for older patients that may be less comfortable with smartphones or tablets.</s><s xml:id="_NCD7pNM">In addition, it is imperative that, moving forward, the data collected by DTx be designed to make inperson visits between patients and clinicians more efficient and actionable rather than burden clinicians with additional paperwork and information.</s><s xml:id="_tgh9MzQ">Finally, as DTx offer the added benefit of collecting patient-reported outcomes in real-time, they may be more likely to take on value-based reimbursement arrangements.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_fWqBvJX">FUTURE DIRECTIONS</head><p xml:id="_RNSQsPd"><s xml:id="_REY99TK">Although DTx companies have largely focused on behavioral and chronic conditions to date, some manufacturers have begun transitioning the scope of their products into acute conditions.</s><s xml:id="_EcSdBZN">For example, Click Therapeutics is developing a DTx for Acute Coronary Syndrome 24 .</s><s xml:id="_ZKxT2GH">But as more acute scenarios are being contemplated for DTx, it will be even more critical for regulatory agencies to proactively evaluate, label, and issue guidance for these products.</s><s xml:id="_WxgF2Sd">CMS should, at the least, develop Healthcare Common Procedural Coding System code(s) for DTx to facilitate payer reimbursement in the absence of dedicated FDA NDC codes.</s><s xml:id="_E7qSAbU">In addition, the FDA should require submission of either manufacturer-directed or external security audits as a component of annual reporting to the agency following commercialization.</s><s xml:id="_VMEq96e">This additional requirement may help address trust and security concerns in the aftermath of recent significant breaches in both medical and consumer technology software services.</s><s xml:id="_B6cSjaa">Finally, as DTx companies continue to expand indications and reach the clinic, it will be crucial to both educate stakeholders about their clinical value as well as hold their products accountable to the same levels of scientific rigor and oversight that are expected of traditional prescription drugs.</s></p></div><figure
