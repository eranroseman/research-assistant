select tracking tools based on features, aesthetics, and conveniences <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_FxBH5eZ">Our participants chose to use Instagram because it provided an easier, more fun, and more social way to track what they eat.</s><s xml:id="_wtCtc2r">Contrary to the individual focus of the lived informatics model, they also often wanted to motivate and encourage others to maintain their health.</s><s xml:id="_nFHzxfJ">Many participants had experience with or were concurrently using other tools to record calories and nutrient details in addition to recording food photos on Instagram, such as MyFitnessPal (I01, I02, I05, I06, I07, I09, I11, I14), the official Weight Watchers app (I06, I16), iTrackBites (I15), or YouFood (I15).</s><s

xml:id="_TURYGCg">Photo-based food tracking is perceived as fun Participants considered tracking and sharing food photos on Instagram as an engaging experience, which helped them sustain their interests and keep a record of what they ate.</s><s xml:id="_WT7Khqy">Food photos feel closer to people's experiences than text descriptions: "I think the fact that Instagram is much more visually stimulating [than MyFitnessPal], really makes the people more real, or it makes the goals more real."</s><s xml:id="_YBPvS9u">(I07).</s><s xml:id="_TwQDqdU">I05 described how this increased engagement helped her maintain food journaling not just on Instagram, but also on MyFitnessPal: "I have a streak on MyFitnessPal since February (over five months at the time of interview).</s><s xml:id="_7qvaq7n">Before I would just use MyFitnessPal for maybe two weeks and then be like, this is too hard and I stop.</s><s xml:id="_aT2mu6R">… It's really helpful to have all the photos because

as socially appropriate Consistent with prior evaluations of mobile-based food journaling [16], participants considered using photos to record what they eat easier and more socially appropriate than a traditional mobile food journal: "If I was out with friends or something, then a quick snapshot of the food would be easier than saying, 'Hold on guys, I need to pull up MyFitnessPal and put everything down and the right serving size'" (I07).</s><s xml:id="_gqG7bgE">As a result, some participants believed tracking with photos better supported their health goals because they could easily take a photo whenever they ate rather than entering all food entries at the end of the day or when they are free: "[I'd rather] post frequently throughout the day and have short little posts [on Instagram] than do big long posts and do them once a day [using other tools]" (I15).</s><s xml:id="_XQD9s9R">Instagram helps people find community support Many participants chose Instagram for the social support they can gain through the many people using Instagram for healthy eating goals.</s><s xml:id="_G7zefG5">Participants discovered these communities through prior experiences using Instagram for general use (I01, I02, I03, I04, I07, I09, I11), friend recommendations (I05, I12), or other health communities such as Weight Watchers (I06, I10, I15, I16) or Bikini Body Guide (I08, I13, I14).</s><s xml:id="_RJgWePc">Many participants found Instagram users more supportive than users of other social media platforms.</s><s xml:id="_mRq5k5N">For example, I05 did not think Facebook was a proper place to share her everyday diet and workout: "A lot of my friends on social media are acquaintances or old coworkers … they have some connection to you but not enough so that they care about actually supporting you."</s><s xml:id="_5YmkFdB">To find communities, participants often augmented their posts with hashtags.</s><s xml:id="_HtfPpgv">They decided which hashtags to use based on other people's posts or popular food hashtags from Instagram's autofill features.</s><s xml:id="_aFuEXKq">They also learned new hashtags by noting ones that were used concurrently with the ones they knew.</s><s xml:id="_k6xjpHM">After determining whether the hashtag caught the attention of people they wanted to attract (e.g., people belonging to specific communities, such as #weightwatchers), they gradually settled on a fixed set of hashtags used for most of their posts.</s><s xml:id="_PtFwWQ3">I07 explained: "I think the hashtags [help] us find each other ….</s><s xml:id="_YerQGkZ">If I was just posting these photos to an empty wall, there was no way that I'd be connected to others with similar goals to me." Hashtags are especially useful for people following a specific program or participating in an event.</s><s xml:id="_HTSK2W8">I08 met other women participating in the same health challenge through hashtags (e.g., #oneperfectweek) and would use such tags to find updates from others at a similar stage of progress.</s><s xml:id="_xDqA5NC">Many participants also use hashtags to find people across communities.</s><s xml:id="_QUXxxyF">For example, participants who investigated hashtags like "#caloriecounting" or "#weightloss" often encountered Instagrammers who subscribed to alternate diet plans.</s><s xml:id="_bNtSXh3">Through this exploration, they discovered different diet and exercise routines.</s><s xml:id="_J6AJrC6">Instagram allows people to motivate and educate others Some participants chose Instagram because it gave them a way to share their experience with, motivate, and educate other people.</s><s xml:id="_fZn5t5N">I06 mentioned that she started posting food and workouts on Instagram because she wanted her weight loss experience to motivate others: "Like people that are trying to lose weight and get healthy and might need some extra motivation or just feel stuck or maybe discouraged.</s><s xml:id="_vNvNtRz">I had hoped they would find me, and I could help inspire and motivate them in some way."</s><s xml:id="_Z24NWvx">Similarly, I04 started to share her cooking on Instagram to help friends who wanted to improve their cooking skills to eat healthier.</s><s xml:id="_U5yH9mx">These cooking posts often led to comments, messages, and even phone calls from friends wanting food preparation details: "'What flour did you use, and how did you get it?</s><s xml:id="_Er7Tnsv">Can you come and teach me?'
