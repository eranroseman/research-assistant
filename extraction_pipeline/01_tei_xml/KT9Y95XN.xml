xml:id="_DrvG7fd">The third section brings these two research streams together, discussing how AI language models can generate health awareness messages and introducing recent research in this area.</s><s xml:id="_kc74edg">We then present a series of studies with the hypotheses and research questions.</s><s xml:id="_Cx7ywXA">Finally, we discuss the results and their implications.</s></p><p

happened between 2010 and 2020, have equipped computers with impressive capacities.</s><s xml:id="_39bVWeY">Deep learning uses artificial neural networks that are stacked across multiple layers (hence: deep) and are trained to perform specific tasks (hence: learning).</s><s xml:id="_MYugTY3">The tasks include automatic speech recognition (e.g., for voice dictation) and image recognition (e.g., labeling objects in photographs).</s><s xml:id="_YxrRc4b">DLfueled applications are integrated in every cell phone and computer <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">(Schmidhuber, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Hassabis et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chollet, 2021)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_4WPQgdY">While these capacities were initially geared more toward perceptual and receptive tasks like speech and image recognition, the field soon expanded to include generative, productive tasks, such as text or image synthesis.</s><s xml:id="_3efnBEm">For example, every text processing software now includes the ability to auto-complete words from their beginning or even suggest entire sentence continuations.</s></p><p xml:id="_kADTpZ6"><s xml:id="_KARwhmu">To provide readers with a non-technical intuition of the underlying principles, we ask you to consider the sentence "I take my coffee with cream and . . .</s><s xml:id="_JcuqadQ">."</s><s xml:id="_T688nBR">Most people will predict the next word as "sugar."</s><s xml:id="_t2yvmqM">Logically, given the semantic context set up by the preceding words, the word sugar is very likely-certainly far more likely than e.g., "socks."</s><s xml:id="_4BfM6gq">Language models (LMs) used for natural language processing (NLP) are powered by artificial neural networks trained to complete next-word prediction tasks like the example above.</s><s xml:id="_M7vNHHT">During the training process, large amounts of texts are gathered and fed into the neural networks, and the neural networks repetitively perform next-word-prediction by computing conditional probabilities that a word will come after another word (or sets of words).</s><s xml:id="_tNASnzR">Once this training process is complete, the model will have learned the hidden statistical relationships between words in a large corpus of natural language <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Hirschberg and Manning, 2015)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_JKprsKf">When prompted with a text like "I take my coffee with cream and . . .</s><s xml:id="_EU9pDDP">, " then for every word processed during the training process, the neural network will be able to calculate the probability that the word will come after the text.</s><s xml:id="_Nn8ucte">If trained well, the language model will assign the word "sugar" with the greatest likelihood of being the next word.</s><s xml:id="_kx2tcdM">This principle can be applied over multiple scales, from letters in words (like when a word starts with "th" it is likely that the next letter will be an "e") to words in sentences (like in the example above), and beyond.</s></p><p xml:id="_2HzSKg2"><s xml:id="_6XnWfcK">A subfield of DL called generative deep learning (generative DL; <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">Goodfellow et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Chollet, 2021)</ref>, takes this idea of next-word prediction to the next level by using pre-trained language models for text generation <ref type="bibr"

apps and email programs that can suggest next-word candidates or autocompletion options for sentences are powered by such language models.</s><s xml:id="_VDts2b3">One can enter a sequence of words in the system, and the LM will compute conditional probabilities of the next word, so that the texting or the email system will select the word with the highest probability to either recommend to the user or to autocomplete the text.</s><s xml:id="_t7BR8Wh">Recent advancements in generative DL have led to so-called large language models (LLMs) that can move beyond simple next-wordprediction tasks to generate complex content that appears natural to humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Rashkin et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">Tunstall et al., 2022;</ref><ref type="bibr"

ChatGPT, along many others (e.g., Google's BARD and Huggingface's Bloom).</s><s xml:id="_pT2BSkn">Although many limitations still exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Bender and Koller, 2020)</ref>, recent advancements in this area are very relevant for communication science and have many theoretical implications.</s></p><p xml:id="_Yb394vu"><s xml:id="_ph79cdd">First, LLMs' capability to generate messages that closely mimic human natural language provides new opportunities for communication scientists to study principles of message generation.</s><s xml:id="_Z2DSQYC">Message generation, as conceived here, consists of developing the prompts to feed to the LLM (similar to message production; <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Greene, 2013)</ref> and adjusting the statistical parameters of the LLM (mimicking the process of language production via the human neural system).</s><s xml:id="_HAVhwrc">Indeed, although we can rely on many principles and theories for communication

type="bibr" target="#b44">(Hodgkinson et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_4uMU2HG">As such, we must acknowledge that there is a gap in our understanding of how humans naturally come up with new messages.</s><s xml:id="_X58JhsB">However, with LLMs, which are created to mimic natural human language, researchers can get a glimpse into the</s></p><p xml:id="_tPGFfXg"><s xml:id="_3Y6m5pA">We acknowledge that definitions of communication, message, and theory can vary, and there are many longstanding debates about what counts and what does not count as communication, message, or theory.</s><s xml:id="_YZ8v8dQ">Clearly, the field of NLP is closer to engineering and computer science and has to a large degree ignored communication science (e.g., Bender and Koller, ).</s><s xml:id="_HxT3QaR">Nevertheless, there have always been theoretical connections, like between computer-mediated communication and voice assistants, or using computational methods to analyze communication.</s><s xml:id="_U82CEar">The advent of text generation methods-although they still certainly lack many if not the most central characteristics of human communication (e.g., intent, goals, pragmatics, etc.)-is clearly bringing the fields into closer contact.</s><s xml:id="_p48efDQ">As such, we believe that it will be in communication scientists' best interest to engage with this development, which is already influencing key aspects of communication in the st century.</s></p><p xml:id="_z9nGZV9"><s xml:id="_HdfYcSH">To be clear, one could certainly view the entire literature on rhetoric as being focused on message production and delivery, like the notion of 'inventio' in Aristotle's theory, which can be considered the birthplace of communication science.</s><s xml:id="_tGeguZw">Likewise, work on communication goals and strategic communication also have action-or production-oriented elements.</s><s xml:id="_mqfxaEc">However, these approaches are geared toward more abstract levels, and they are all silent about the actual nuts and bolts of message generation.</s></p><p xml:id="_tz7sYyH"><s xml:id="_Ef2XP7M">Frontiers in Communication

of the key goals of this paper.</s></p><p xml:id="_phK96y5"><s xml:id="_5YcqJxH">A second argument as to why AI-based message generation research is theoretically relevant is because theory and method evolve in a synergistic relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Greenwald, 2012)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ETpGkwr">In particular, technological advances often promote new theory and stimulate theoretical advances, which then provide the basis for new methods.</s><s xml:id="_rkQCqPp">Applying this to the current context, we expect that the abilities to generate messages (see the paragraphs above) hold promise to expand our theoretical understanding of what has so far remained enigmatic, namely how new, coherent messages can be created.</s><s xml:id="_f7h2yyC">Within health communication, we have already seen how computational methods have been used to test and expand existing theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Chen et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">Rains, 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Lee et al., 2023)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wVDzc7n">In this sense, putting method and theory in opposition is-although common-actually misleading.</s><s xml:id="_zY8FXre">Instead, we expect that the nexus between AI, message communication, and message reception research will lead to synergistic benefits between theory and method.</s></p><p xml:id="_RtUepws"><s xml:id="_X2BmZBn">Third, as methods promote theory and vice versa, we often see the emergence of entirely new fields of research.</s><s xml:id="_pwq6vBP">For instance, when computers came into contact with communication, the field of CMC arose, which in turn stipulated theory.</s><s xml:id="_pmMbkPB">As AI emerged into communication research, especially within the field of CMC, AI-mediated communication arose as a field <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Hancock et al., 2020)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_U2efN6b">Similarly, theory and methods from communication and neuroscience are converging, giving rise to the field of communication neuroscience <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Huskey et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Schmälzle and Meshi, 2020)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rJR3PcA">Together, these three arguments underscore why the nexus of AI and communication is a theoretical wellspring: 3 DL-approaches for text generation help explain a henceforth mystic process and they provide us with a principled approach to generate thousands of novel messages, which we can analyze.</s><s xml:id="_VBu5fhm">This development has started to impact many fields of communication, including health communication.</s></p><p xml:id="_cDt48kF"><s xml:id="_rfbsB2d">Finally, LLMs' capability of generating hundreds of messages within a short period of time also provides new opportunities for communication researchers to test existing theories regarding message processing and effects.</s><s xml:id="_4npHq6A">Within communication, a plethora of research regarding message effects (e.g., emotional appeals; <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Nabi et al., 2020;</ref><ref type="bibr">Turner and Rains, 2021, message tailoring;</ref><ref

<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Baclic et al., 2020)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_J9DuBEt">As argued above, we deliberately focused on awareness as a fundamental goal of health communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Bettinghaus, 1986;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">McGuire, 2001)</ref>, but clearly, it will be promising to explore the potential of this approach to influence health-related attitudes and behaviors.</s><s xml:id="_UWBT9ZK">Furthermore, given the rise of image generation as a visual complement to text generation, it would also be interesting to start generating healthrelated imagery and combine such messages with AI-generated texts <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Crowson et al., 2022)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Y6FcEpY">This is especially important because newer social media platforms are increasingly depending on visuals (e.g., Snapchat, TikTok).</s><s xml:id="_hFXAn8C">Overall, we anticipate that this work will find many applications in health communication in the near future, and similar cases could be made for other communication topics (e.g., environmental and political communication) or applied business communication (e.g., AI-copywriting systems, which are already offered commercially).</s></p><p xml:id="_G7chRJV"><s xml:id="_aEa8DYs">Going beyond the obvious application potential, we next ask about the theoretical potential and contributions of this work.</s><s xml:id="_whyReuN">At first glance, it might be tempting to view AI message generation as a methodological innovation only, but we argue that the advent of natural text generation systems holds immense potential for method-theory synergy <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">(Greenwald, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">Weber et al., 2018)</ref>: Specifically, a healthy mix of theory, measurement, and control is central to the progress of any science <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Bechtel, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Chalmers, 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Craver and Darden, 2013)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_CXwPVZV">Put simply, our theories affect the phenomenon we can conceive of and use to explain the phenomenon in question.</s><s xml:id="_kcDyW94">Our measures, in turn, determine what phenomena we can "see" and with which precision.</s><s xml:id="_2WBCHK3">Lastly, the ability to control lets us "push things around, " manipulating or intervening causally on variables to test our theories.</s><s xml:id="_sGhUdZE">In physics, chemistry, and biology, the triad of theory, measurement, and control enabled everything from understanding atoms and genetics (on the basic science side) to building mechanical engines and synthetically assembled vaccines (on the applied side).</s><s xml:id="_H67ZnVm">In NLP, the advent of powerful theories that enable machines to generate natural text clearly represents a breakthrough in the quest to understand, measure, and control linguistic or even cognitive capacities <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(LeCun et al., 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Mitchell, 2019)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_XyQGmCv">As we saw from the results of this study, this advancement from powerful theories in NLP has many implications for communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Hassabis et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Lake et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Dubova, 2022)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_Fs3t8GJ"><s xml:id="_djCsNkQ">Critically, however, we are not claiming that these advances have solved long-standing theoretical questions about the nature of language, let alone symbolic communication-it's quite the opposite.</s><s xml:id="_J4wxn7j">So far, progress in language modeling has focused on language-intrinsic aspects (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_Xrpt5a4">syntax and semantics; <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Bender and Koller, 2020)</ref>, whereas pragmatic and extralinguistic processes that are critical to communication have been almost ignored.</s><s xml:id="_AjrEpV6">However, the verbal distinction between semantics and pragmatics has always been cumbersome since the underlying phenomena appear to gradually blend into each other.</s><s xml:id="_zPSCw93">The current work thus represents a step to bridge between NLP and communication, albeit only an initial one.</s><s xml:id="_aA26eEc">Moreover, the fact that human participants evaluated the AI-generated messages as even better than human-generated ones (and as better as even the most highly shared humangenerated messages) underscores the importance of this approach.</s></p><p xml:id="_XPG4bak"><s xml:id="_hwKsEw5">In addition to potentially surpassing human-level performance for message generation, another theoretical benefit of AI systems is that they are rigorously quantitative.</s><s xml:id="_46xKR3N">While it is often claimed that deep learning is like a "black box" <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">(Marcus and Davis, 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b110">Xu et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Chen et al., 2020)</ref>, this is actually not the case: Rather, each of Bloom's over seven billion parameters are computed and thus, in principle, objectively knowable.</s><s xml:id="_dpdCRfc">This again points to a key feature of science because it affords better measurement, better control, and ultimately better theoretical understanding.</s><s xml:id="_ZkVF4kN">Indeed, one could perhaps compare AI models to the "Petri dish" in chemistry, i.e., as providing a precisely controlled experimental setting in which researchers can generate synthetic messages under controlled laboratory conditions, and later test how they fare in the market.</s><s xml:id="_D63GJq4">This promotes insights into properties that make messages effective, an issue that still remains insufficiently understood <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Harrington, 2015</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Harrington, , 2016;;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">O'Keefe and Hoeken, 2021)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WS6uSVM">In this sense, especially the prompt engineering process, which has been successfully applied here, has barely scratched the surface of what is possible-and needed-to fully realize the potential of this applied fruit of a theoretically matured science of messages.</s></p><p xml:id="_PdFPE68"><s xml:id="_ppq8XM5">The emergence of AI-based methods for communication content generation clearly raises important ethical issues.</s><s xml:id="_pfffqRV">Examples of existing issues include bots in the political domain (which spread misinformation), online troll farms (which stoke conflict), or general misuse of persuasive technologies for target advertising or mood, and emotion intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Solaiman et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Kreps et al., 2020)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_dWm9eQK">At this point, there is no clear regulatory framework for these technologies.</s><s xml:id="_5K38ddE">Although a few "responsible AI" initiatives exist, the novelty of the topic and the evolving nature of the underlying science prevent any final judgment.</s><s xml:id="_mW5vj48">However, the creators of Bloom have attempted to address this issue by releasing Bloom under a RAIL license (responsible AI license, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Contractor et al., 2020)</ref>, which includes a number of disallowed use cases, like generating law-violating content.</s><s xml:id="_k3FfyEJ">Among these cases is using Bloom for medical purposes.</s><s xml:id="_C8Vb6As">Clearly, given the LLMs' lack of medical knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">(Schmälzle and Wilcox, 2022)</ref>, it would be irresponsible to use the model to generate diagnoses and prescribe treatment.</s><s xml:id="_qu3ZZRn">On the other hand, using the model to improve general health awareness information seems like a particularly beneficial use case for how LLMs (under supervision by health communication experts acting as message curators) could be used for social good and to improve the quality of public health information.</s><s xml:id="_rXFZNJb">With this in mind, we also want to underscore the importance that communication researchers engage with and help shape this debate.</s></p><p xml:id="_Bk4nXbH"><s xml:id="_kFhaF95">Like all research, the current paper has several limitations.</s><s xml:id="_GNRE5n4">First, we tested only one topic, folic acid.</s><s xml:id="_edFpSmM">Although this was an informed choice based on the characteristics of this particular health topic, it will be necessary to expand these findings to other domains.</s><s xml:id="_TtMfAyt">Second, we focused only on health messages designed to raise awareness but ignored more downstream topics like attitude and behavior change.</s><s xml:id="_2GZSfJR">Again, we argue that this provides a logical starting point, but that more work needs to be done to expand Granted, this mindboggling complexity prevents us from understanding the system behavior intuitively, which is what people mean when they call it a black box.</s><s xml:id="_p4Z2sdT">However, except for deliberately random parameters, the systems behave deterministically, and, in this sense, the black box metaphor is mistaken.</s></p><p xml:id="_k3Sp7FR"><s xml:id="_sJdKQSB">to other topics within health communication.</s><s xml:id="_et9hfNQ">Relatedly, we only generated relatively short messages, such as the ones we find on social media (primarily twitter).</s><s xml:id="_ar84Xec">However, health communication takes many forms, and as such more work is needed to generate e.g., health-related stories (longer text) or images (no text at all, but a different modality).</s><s xml:id="_tzJc6eA">Third, the computational and human evaluations of the generated messages could be improved.</s><s xml:id="_GxPeZ6q">Regarding the computational analyses, we only focused on a number of salient and quantifiable characteristics, like NGrams, sentiment, and reading ease.</s><s xml:id="_7QyPVuv">However, there are additional topics that were not explored, such as similarity of the entire corpora of human and AI-generated messages, other theoretical concepts (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_zsnHkNS">use of politeness instead of general sentiment <ref type="bibr" target="#b112">Yeomans et al., 2019</ref>, or the use of specific kinds of persuasive strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Armstrong, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">Tan et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">O'Keefe and Hoeken, 2021)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EGP9vUz">Again, this limitation is explained by the early stage of this research-this is only the third study of this kind that we are aware ofand we look forward to future work expanding the scope of computational message analytics.</s><s xml:id="_fNZRAWq">Finally, human evaluation is not without limitations either.</s><s xml:id="_386bfST">In particular, one could criticize the narrow measures and the sample.</s><s xml:id="_D9jUvzc">Regarding the latter, we argue that the populations we sampled from (college students and young adult women living with a partner) overlaps with the target population for a FA awareness campaign (potential parents and particularly women of childbearing age), but it would be advisable to also test how broader audiences respond to these messages.</s></p></div>
