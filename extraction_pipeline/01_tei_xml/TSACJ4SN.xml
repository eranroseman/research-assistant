xml:id="_6TkkBRW">The prevalence of hypertension in China is 27.9%, yet the control rate is only 16.8%, entailing a large treatment gap. <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref></s><s xml:id="_pZYP7x6">Moreover, a study in the US suggested that the established o ce-based approach yields only a 50% blood pressure (BP) control rate and low levels of patient engagement. <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref></s><s xml:id="_FhnuY8g">Unlike conventional clinical visits, for which patients have to present physically at a health facility, telemedicine allows remote sessions among patients and healthcare professionals to discuss health concerns, treatment plans, and outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_jtwJ2jH">It can ideally increase patient access to care and provide effective healthcare services at a distance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref></s><s xml:id="_hPjaGU9">It is a promising approach to managing chronic health conditions like hypertension and can also facilitate the process of task-shifting from doctors to other health professionals to bene t patients who may not bene t as much from traditional doctor o ce visits.</s><s xml:id="_4hTnRMT">Many hypertension patients fail to meet treatment goals due to limited literacy about medications, suboptimal adherence, and inappropriate coping strategies for chronic health conditions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref

patient education and counselling services, identifying and intervening cases of non-adherence, and titrating antihypertensive therapy to achieve BP control. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref></s><s xml:id="_fsnv6Ru">In some countries, pharmacists have used telemedicine technology to manage patients with hypertension.</s><s xml:id="_TX2KfDh">Reductions were seen in

in the elderly is gradually increasing with the aging population.</s><s xml:id="_nS2Sv9u">Besides, elderly patients with hypertension also have a low awareness rate, low treatment rate, and low control rate, which may not be solved only by doctors or through increased clinical visits. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref></s><s xml:id="_2TzpsbE">Other health professionals such as pharmacists can thus facilitate the management for elderly patients with hypertension.</s><s xml:id="_FTKMjhy">In China, pharmacists have long been involved in managing patients with hypertension and diabetes through clinic or telephone visits, and have achieved remarkable results.</s><s xml:id="_wKTVPsE">But such services have been limited by sometimes infrequent monitoring of patients' clinical indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> as elderly patients often had di culties in attending in-person clinical visits, which may lead to delayed identi cation of nonadherence and health risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_Mkx3AWN">Fortunately, pharmacists can break through this limitation with the help of telemedicine management.</s><s xml:id="_y8jApZV">In addition, Hypertension in elderly patients is characterized by simple elevated SBP, large BP differential, large BP uctuation, postprandial hypotension, abnormal circadian rhythm of BP, and so forth, therefor managing elderly patients with hypertension requires close monitoring and ne regulation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> which highlights the importance of transferring measured health indicators in real-time.</s><s xml:id="_F7JfWnU">However, past telemedicine programs led by pharmacists often were structured around website, <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref> blood pressure telemonitoring (BPT), <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> and video telehealth <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> , which lacked such critical function of real-time data transfer.</s><s xml:id="_R6k2caJ">Therefore, we aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of managing elderly patients with hypertension led by pharmacists through a telemedicine system which could transmit BP data in real-time in this study.</s></p></div>

telemedicine system.</s><s xml:id="_skg3BkU">A study showed that the most commonly reported barriers of adherence to treatment were having too much medication to take (31%) and forgetting whether medication was taken at a particular time (24%). <ref type="bibr">[26]</ref></s><s xml:id="_P8XfH2t">The medication reminder function of the Yaoshiyi® APP could help patients take medications on time.</s></p><p xml:id="_q3bGYvA"><s xml:id="_WbEmF63">Reasons for not adhering to treatment also included patient's concern about the side effects of medication. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref></s><s xml:id="_UEwgPjP">In our study, when patients didn't take medicine as prescribed or showed poor disease management as suggested by their clinical indicators, pharmacists proactively communicated with patients through the Yaoshiyi® APP to discuss the necessity of medication adherence, the risk of side effects, possible measures to take medications as instructed, lifestyle adjustment as well as the possibility of altering treatment plans.</s><s xml:id="_qkVWjct">During this study, pharmacists provided medication interventions for 695 times, medication consultations for 431 times, and medication educations for 1186 times.</s><s xml:id="_eSukYGq">These critical communications facilitated patients to improve adherence and developed strategies to cope with hypertension before major adverse health outcomes developed.</s></p><p xml:id="_srD6DxG"><s xml:id="_z6yDhwJ">The Yaoshiyi® telemedicine system could be used successfully in both elderly patients and low educated people.</s><s xml:id="_u6TqAUe">Elderly patients often couldn't use smart phones smoothly.</s><s xml:id="_K47mFqa">However, signi cant improvements in BP, HbA1c and LDL-C indicated that pharmacists can provide effective healthcare services for elderly patients through Yaoshiyi® telemedicine system, even Taikang patients with the highest mean age (76.25±8.01 years old) were the same.</s><s xml:id="_rmx4vqA">In Yongning community, 39.39% of the patients' highest education is primary school, yet college was only 1.01%, which was far lower than that in Taikang community and

the previous telemedicine technology, the Yaoshiyi® telemedicine system had some characteristics (1) Free and using easily: In previous studies, telemedicine technologies used by pharmacists mainly

connections and a personal computer, yet accessing Internet and navigating computer screens greatly limited their accessibility for many elderly patients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref></s><s xml:id="_Z9HFfkj">Using telephone to transfer BP data was real-time, which took up a lot of patients' personal time.</s><s xml:id="_66XX69M">Transferring BP data via SMS required manual input by patients, which was ine cient and might introduce participant bias.</s><s xml:id="_DwZztaY">BPT measurement required an extra equipment named home monitor that stored and transferred BP data to a secure website via a modem. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref></s><s xml:id="_AsgW2Ku">Video telehealth also required dedicated video communication facilities such as Clinical Video Telehealth, <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> which entailed increased costs for patients and the health facility.</s><s xml:id="_2CVS7g8">Compared with the above method, the Yaoshiyi® APP in our study had the advantages of free installation, simple measurements, non-real-time conversation and low learning di culty, which encouraged elderly patients to engage in telemedicine services.</s></p><p xml:id="_vACrATD"><s xml:id="_8SHxwqf">(2) Continuous monitoring and early intervention of abnormal indicators: In previous studies on telemedicine disease management for hypertension patients, pharmacist monitored patients' BP discontinuously, such as communicating with patients via telephone once every two weeks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref></s><s xml:id="_kab7nXA">When the patient's BP was out of control but BP data were not tranferred to the pharmacist in real-time, the patient's health needs remained unmet and might remain unmet until serious adverse health events arose.</s><s xml:id="_7fF3RV3">In this study, the Yaoshiyi® telemedicine system transferred BP data in real-time, so the pharmacist could continuously monitor the patient's BP, which was different from the telemedicine technologies reported in previous literature.</s><s xml:id="_wUJbdQn">When the patient's BP exceeded normal values, the pharmacist would be warned by the Yaoshiyi® APP.</s><s xml:id="_CeATkc5">When the patient's BP raised slightly, the pharmacist would just closely follow the patient's BP for several days.</s><s xml:id="_2JJ9Mxj">If the patient's BP returned to normal after a transient rise, the pharmacist would not take any intervention.</s><s xml:id="_EY27adN">If the patient's BP continued to rise during the follow-up, the pharmacist would provide MTM services for the patient.</s><s xml:id="_qncvVD9">When the patient's BP remained at a high-risk level (SBP≥180mmHg), the pharmacist would immediately contact and instruct the patient to take quickacting antihypertensive drugs and refer to a doctor timely.</s><s xml:id="_qPbXSTy">Therefore, the patient's abnormal BP was quickly intervened by the pharmacist and returned to normal in this study, which ensured that the patient's BP could be maintained at a normal level most of the time.</s></p><p xml:id="_Y5TAV4X"><s xml:id="_84TmNRZ">(3) Individualized precise adjustment of BP: The circadian rhythm of BP in elderly patients was sometimes abnormal and thus the peak of BP was not easily predicable, which made it di cult to take antihypertensive drugs at the appropriate timing.</s><s xml:id="_Csgjuh3">For example, taking anti-hypertensive drug in the morning routinely sometimes would not imply proper control over BP. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> The Yaoshiyi® APP could depict the BP uctuation curve of patients within a day, which is similar to the effect of ambulatory BP monitoring.</s><s xml:id="_kvEVrqb">The pharmacist could guide the patients to adjust time of taking antihypertensive medication, dose and selection of antihypertensive medication according to their individual BP uctuation curve to improve the BP.</s><s xml:id="_qSarxjC">In this way, pharmacists could adjust patients' anti-hypertensive drug regimen for several consecutive days until the BP returned to normal, which could waive the need for elderly patients to visit the hospital.</s></p><p xml:id="_gDAcqws"><s xml:id="_u3GFBeQ">Our study has some limitations.</s><s xml:id="_xYYufje">Firstly, not only some of the patients' indicators such as BP and HbA1c</s></p><p xml:id="_CfZXC9w"><s xml:id="_vmhZabT">were within the normal range at baseline, but the sample size was relatively small, which might leaded to limited room for improvement of indicators after intervention and might explain why patients recruited from Huilongguan and Yongning communities experienced improvements but without statistical signi cance in BP after receiving telemedicine management by pharmacists.</s><s xml:id="_Hsu3QKk">Secondly, the loss to followup was high in our study.</s><s xml:id="_G45NaHC">A total of 358 eligible patients were recruited from the three communities.</s></p><p xml:id="_Maz56ph"><s xml:id="_q9yabGu">During the follow-up, 56 patients were removed from the study due to the failure of remain engagement or moving to other

have high mobility.</s><s xml:id="_5CnutfG">Once patients left the community, the follow-up was failed.</s><s xml:id="_XKXgqsJ">Finally, the Yaoshiyi® telemedicine system required patients to be able
