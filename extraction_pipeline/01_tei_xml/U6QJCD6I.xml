or if LLMs are developed for, adapted, modified or directed toward specifically medical purposes.</s><s xml:id="_9jbh4fH">Even if currently widespread LLMs won't fall into either category, the medical alternatives of LLMs specifically trained on medical data and databases probably will.</s><s xml:id="_FbKKxvh">One prominent example is Med-PaLM that DeepMind and Google researchers have published about.</s><s xml:id="_8c6PCtr">In that study, authors proposed a framework for human evaluation of model answers along multiple axes including factuality, precision, possible harm, and bias.</s><s xml:id="_4UuXxzC">In addition, using a combination of prompting strategies, their model achieved 67.6% accuracy on the US Medical License Exam questions, surpassing prior state-of-the-art by over 17%.</s><s xml:id="_2rRX2Xe">As human evaluation reveals key gaps in the responses provided by the LLM, they introduced instruction prompt tuning and the resulting model, Med-PaLM, performs encouragingly, but remains inferior to clinicians.</s><s xml:id="_nvtn9Vm">Since then, GPT-4 could achieve an accuracy over 85% on the same exam <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> .</s></p><p xml:id="_UcZ2jHh"><s xml:id="_FTsm58S">With the release of GPT-4 that can analyze not only texts but images, it can be expected that the model will grow to analyze uploaded documents, research papers, hand-written notes, sound, and video in the near future.</s><s xml:id="_kmHfBjm">(Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">2</ref>).</s></p><p xml:id="_rTb7qNr"><s xml:id="_srZZbuc">This underscores the notion that it is not enough to regulate current LLM models as the new iterations with those advanced capabilities can be expected to get implemented at a similar rate of the previous iterations.</s><s xml:id="_QSZpVmw">Without taking these future additions into consideration, a regulation that focuses on language models only could miss important updates by the time those updates become widely accessible.</s></p><p xml:id="_DAbnbBy"><s xml:id="_SAXhdRq">Companies with approved devices that decide to implement LLMs into their services face an additional challenge.</s><s xml:id="_ncVt6YV">Namely, how will the FDA regulate an AI-based medical technology recently infused with LLM if the technology was already approved for medical uses?</s><s xml:id="_Q9Tjqw4">Table <ref type="table">3</ref> summarizes the regulatory challenges.</s></p><p xml:id="_jcpaEB3"><s xml:id="_44uDnkD">There have been proposals about regulating LLMs, although those come from outside healthcare.</s><s xml:id="_RbmjZpc">In a working paper, Hacker et al. suggests a novel terminology to capture the AI value chain by differentiating between developers, deployers, professional and nonprofessional users, as well as recipients of LLM output.</s><s xml:id="_yssxP5F">Authors also suggested four strategies to ensure that these models are trustworthy and deployed for the benefit of society at large.</s><s xml:id="_nnkV4zu">In details, regulation should focus on concrete high-risk applications, and not the pre-trained model itself, and should include (i) obligations regarding transparency, (ii) risk management, (iii) nondiscrimination provisions, and (iv) content moderation rules <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> .</s></p><p xml:id="_zktEg8S"><s xml:id="_qHMhJH8">M√∂kander at al pointed out that existing auditing procedures fail to address the governance challenges posed by LLMs, and offered three contributions to fill that gap namely 1) establishing the need to develop new auditing procedures that capture the risks posed by LLMs; 2) outlining a blueprint to audit LLMs in feasible and effective ways by drawing on best practices from IT governance and system engineering; and 3) discussing the limitations of the prospect of auditing LLMs at all <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s></p><p xml:id="_jK2rnsp"><s xml:id="_ru8YWRf">Such potential solutions could serve as a benchmark for new regulations in healthcare.</s><s xml:id="_SQWYjuq">In either case, regulators and lawmakers need to act fast to keep track with the dynamics of the unprecedented evolution and progress of LLMs.</s></p><p xml:id="_xw3BMkC"><s xml:id="_VRmDNTe">As a sign of the rising pressure on regulators, in March 2023, a group of prominent computer scientists and technology industry executives such as Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak called for "all AI labs to immediately pause for at least 6 months the training of AI systems more powerful than GPT-4" <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_RgkT5T5">Their letter mentioned that "recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no onenot even their creatorscan understand, predict, or reliably control.</s><s xml:id="_CgHJwcd">This pause should be public and verifiable, and include all  Notable AI experts such as Andrew Ng objected the idea and instead, called for seeking a balance between the huge value AI is creating vs realistic risks.</s><s xml:id="_HeAkPwV">We agree that a moratorium cannot be implemented in practice unless governments step in; and "having governments pause emerging technologies they don't understand is anti-competitive, sets a terrible precedent, and is awful innovation policy" <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s></p><p xml:id="_6zDbWBR"><s xml:id="_rqYYu2G">To reinforce our concerns, it is worthy of mention that Italy became the first Western country to temporarily block ChatGPT in April 2023 due to privacy concerns and the lack of proper regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> .</s></p></div>
