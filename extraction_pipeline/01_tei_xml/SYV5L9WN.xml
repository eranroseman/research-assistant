18-June 16, 2020 as the "COVID-19" period (thirteen weeks).</s><s xml:id="_zWMUevQ">We chose March 18 to define the start of the COVID-19 period because Medicare announced expanded telehealth coverage

using Medicare's expanded list of outpatient Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes, excluding all codes that were specific for clinical settings outside of clinician offices (for example, emergency department, hospital inpatient, nursing home, or dialysis facility codes; see online appendix exhibit 1 for a full list). <ref type="bibr">27</ref></s><s xml:id="_VbMMBH8">We identified both

Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-10-CM), diagnoses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">30</ref></s><s xml:id="_sk9GntM">We also categorized visits by clinician specialty using specialty designations defined by OptumLabs.</s><s xml:id="_rkZvcU3">Because of the large number of categories for clinician specialties (92 specialties) and diagnostic codes (499 diagnostic categories), in our main analyses we focused on the top quartile of diagnostic categories and top quartile of clinical specialties (including physician and nonphysician specialties) by volume during the COVID-19 period.</s><s xml:id="_HtVTHss">These diagnostic categories and specialties accounted for the vast majority of all visits in the COVID-19 period (126 diagnostic categories accounting for 88 percent of visits and 22 specialties accounting for 87 percent of visits in the COVID-19 period; see appendix exhibit 1 for both lists). <ref type="bibr">27</ref></s><s xml:id="_q5BGWrv">nrollee Characteristics We captured age in years (categorized into seven bins: 0-19, 20-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-64, and 65 and older), sex, rural-urban commuting area, fourcategory US census designation, 31 insurance type (commercial versus Medicare Advantage), and enrollee county-level race and poverty indicators from the 2010 US census and county-level COVID-19 cases per capita on April 16, 2020.</s><s xml:id="_jt6dYuD">We selected April 16 because it was thirty days into the pandemic, and COVID-19 burden early in the pandemic likely affected telemedicine use.</s><s xml:id="_Sr6n7SU">We divided county-level measures into quartiles (that is, percentage of county residents who were White, percentage of county residents with incomes below the federal poverty level, and COVID-19 cases per capita).</s><s xml:id="_KdWNTz9">Using the Elixhauser Comorbidity Index, <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">32</ref> we also captured the number of twenty-nine comorbidities for each enrollee, defined as at least one claim in any diagnostic field between July 2019 and December 2019 (before the study period).</s></p><p xml:id="_sJjq5mZ"><s xml:id="_QUPRjEH">Study Outcomes We examined changes in telemedicine and total (telemedicine plus inperson) outpatient visit volume from the "pre-COVID-19" period (January 1-March 17, 2020) to the "COVID-19" period (March 18-June 16, 2020) across the range of diagnosis categories, clinician specialties, and demographic characteristics described above.</s><s xml:id="_yMtqHC2">Specifically, within each diagnostic category, specialty, and demographic characteristic, we calculated the percentage of total visits delivered by telemedicine, defined as the number of telemedicine visits divided by the number of total visits, in the COVID-19 period.</s><s xml:id="_2JcJ9zG">We also calculated the percentage change in total weekly visits (both telemedicine and in person) from the pre-COVID-19 period to the COVID-19 period, defined as the difference between the mean number of total visits per week in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods divided by the pre-COVID-19 period mean in each group.</s><s xml:id="_qWb3y23">For telemedicine visits, we focused on the percentage of total visits in the COVID-19 period alone rather than the change between the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods because telemedicine volume was consistently low for nearly all specialties in the pre-COVID-19 period.</s></p><p xml:id="_hcNDqQX"><s xml:id="_zfEaPd7">At the enrollee level, we captured whether people used any in-person or telemedicine services before or during COVID-19 and the number of those services.We also calculated the proportion of clinicians in each specialty delivering any outpatient care via telemedicine during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods.</s><s xml:id="_wqUcus9">The numerator for these proportions was clinicians billing for any outpatient telemedicine encounter in the given period.</s><s xml:id="_bQeNSvp">The denominator was the number of unique clinicians in each specialty billing for any outpatient service during the entire study period (in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods).</s><s xml:id="_gqfuSwd">We used the entire study period to ensure that we included clinicians who may have stopped providing care entirely after the pandemic began.</s></p><p xml:id="_UT7pdVm"><s xml:id="_etzESqM">Statistical Analysis We used chi-square tests to test for bivariate differences between the characteristics of enrollees using any telemedicine service during the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods.</s><s xml:id="_q64jMeh">To assess whether any demographic characteristics were independently associated with use of telemedicine and total outpatient care in the COVID-19 period, we fit four separate, enrollee-level Poisson regression models with outcomes of the mean number of telemedicine and total visits per week, expressed as weekly visits per 1,000 members, in the pre-COVID-19 and COVID-19 periods.</s><s xml:id="_jw8UNqc">Models included each enrollee characteristic as defined previously (see appendix exhibit 1 for model specification). <ref type="bibr">27</ref></s><s xml:id="_y7qBrUk">We fit the Poisson regression models using a random sample of 5 percent of all enrollees to facilitate model convergence, given a study sample of nearly 17 million enrollees.</s><s xml:id="_94fmRXU">Because of the strong correlation between age category and insurance type (r = 0.95), we omitted insurance type from analyses to avoid collinearity.</s><s xml:id="_rkbxdPQ">We also calculated average marginal effects for each explanatory variable using SAS, version 9.4.</s></p><p xml:id="_f56BF8s"><s xml:id="_fPF9nUy">Some of the most recent data in the Optum-Labs Data Warehouse may be underpopulated because of the typical lag of up to several weeks between service delivery and the processing and reporting of medical claims. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">34</ref></s><s xml:id="_2pDRNGq">We tested the completeness of claims during each week of our study period by calculating the weekly rates of childbirths per 1,000 female enrollees ages 15-44, based on the assumption that the rate of childbirths would remain stable despite the COVID-19 pandemic.</s><s xml:id="_YFgbfb4">The weekly rate of childbirths remained stable from January 1 until June 16, 2020 (see appendix exhibit 1 for analysis), indicating that claims were complete through this period. <ref type="bibr">27</ref></s><s xml:id="_rFk5U3A">imitations Our analysis had several limitations.</s><s xml:id="_Ts6nquJ">First, these findings might not generalize to other populations, such as those with traditional Medicare or Medicaid coverage.</s><s xml:id="_zqv5PYm">Second, our study period runs through June 16, 2020, providing only thirteen weeks of COVID-19 data.</s><s xml:id="_BRExVKy">As a result, our estimates of outpatient volume and telemedicine adoption might not reflect longer-term trends.</s><s xml:id="_WNmJGzR">Third, despite our sensitivity analyses to assess completeness of data, recent data in our analysis (for example, June 2020) may be underpopulated if lags in childbirth claims differ from lags in outpatient (telemedicine and in-person) visit claims.</s><s xml:id="_kRCqdaj">As a consequence, we may have underestimated both telemedicine and in-person visits during the last weeks of the study period.</s><s xml:id="_CmKvMKT">Finally, we were unable to distinguish audio-video from audio-only telemedicine visits because of ambiguities around coding telemedicine visits and concerns about undercoding of audio-only visits.</s></p></div>
