engagement with personal health data (e.g., phones come with pre-installed health applications and frameworks, watches function as fitness trackers, countless health-related applications are widely available).</s><s xml:id="_rkr2G9a">The ubiquity of such personal health technology provides new potential to help people engage in healthy behaviors or to help people identify and manage health conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5TfHQPc">In 2013, 69% of U.S. adults reported tracking at least one health indicator for themselves or others <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_eFqu95j">Since then, the development and adoption of innovative personal health tracking technologies has continued to progress.</s></p><p xml:id="_NnjXSKx"><s xml:id="_WBEGVKX">The growing ubiquity of personal health technology also brings increasing urgency to research questions and design recommendations examined within the personal health informatics community.</s><s xml:id="_a85Rmw2">Such research provides insight into a variety of tracking contexts (e.g., health tracking not only by individuals, but also within clinical and family contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>) and into challenges of designing health tracking across diverse health conditions (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_VTjMvPk">The research community has further called out problematic assumptions in the design of many current health tracking applications, suggesting how design recommendations from research might address those assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xQDP3KK">For example, design often assume individuals begin tracking with the objective to achieve a specific goal.</s><s xml:id="_k8bwNSn">However, research has found that individuals iterate within and across different goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref> or face challenges aligning their goals with health provider expectations <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xu2Hge9">Design assumptions can also exclude or even harm people, as in menstrual tracking apps that mis-gender people who are tracking or incorrectly assume tracking for purposes of planning or preventing pregnancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qQ67guZ">Additional research has found that the design of health tracking applications commonly fails to account for emotional experiences of health datafication <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43]</ref>, for accessibility <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>, for privacy in a collaborations related to such data <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>, and for needs of marginalized communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_GEJpRgY"><s xml:id="_8Td6PkW">Although such research and associated recommendations have the potential to positively influence design practice, practitioners often struggle to learn about, access, and implement recommendations from academic research <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DUf9KDB">These research-practice gaps are an important challenge for all areas of HCI, but warrant additional nuanced understanding within the complex and important context of personal health technologies.</s><s xml:id="_jnUyZSa">This paper therefore presents our exploration of a prototype set of design cards that aim to make related research and design considerations more explicit and to support designers in re-thinking potential assumptions about designing for personal health informatics.</s><s xml:id="_gPWRxyA">We examined these design cards in two consecutive rounds of semi-structured interviews, first with 12 student designers of personal health informatics apps and then with 12 health-focused professional designers and researchers.</s><s xml:id="_AUmhEzq">Participants discussed strategies to meaningfully engage with the content of the cards and described different potential use cases throughout their design processes.</s><s xml:id="_pBZTHWU">Reflecting on existing barriers in leveraging academic research, the cards prompted participants to share additional translational needs of health-focused designers, particularly in relation to acquiring health-specific design knowledge, advocating for corresponding design considerations, and accessing relevant evidence.</s><s xml:id="_aSywsSK">Drawing on these findings, we make the following contributions: 1) a prototype set of design cards used to explore the design of translational resources for designers in personal health informatics; 2) an empirical examination of challenges and barriers designers encounter when designing in health, with a specific focus on knowledge, advocacy, and evidence; and 3) implications for the personal health informatics research community to better support health-focused designers and researchers.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2" xml:id="_QDbE4AB">Models of Personal Health Informatics</head><p xml:id="_feMUbHz"><s xml:id="_yrmtDV9">Motivated by the potential of personal health technologies, the HCI and personal health informatics communities have engaged in extensive research on the processes by which people collect, interpret, and act upon personal health data <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Bg3DYZs">Such research includes development of models to describe an individual's progression through a tracking process (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_J9eaPyH">Although these models can provide guidance for researchers and designers, research also shows that such models struggle to account for the complexity of people's needs in health tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_aYqMnwd">Limitations of such models of personal informatics have in turn informed and motivated additional models.</s><s xml:id="_rCXWDfJ">For example, to help account for the sociocultural context of an individual, Murnane et al. applied Ecological Systems Theory to long-term mental health management <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hGjfs62">Their model highlights different social relationships and services that play a role in self-management.</s><s xml:id="_Ru96XGm">Although data and personal informatics technologies can mediate these relationships, their model does not discuss characteristics of the tracking activity itself.</s><s xml:id="_ccSKuxd">As another example, Vizer et al. recently proposed a Conceptual Model of Shared Health Informatics based on people's experience managing chronic illness <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_kPgkKyY">This model provides a detailed representation of the ongoing and iterative tracking work that happens in collaboration with informal and professional care environments.</s><s xml:id="_EBXnSch">Given the relative strengths and weaknesses of various models developed in this body of research, we believe no single model can clearly communicate all challenges and considerations design practitioners are likely to encounter in personal health technology.</s><s xml:id="_f7TtrQs">Our exploration of cards as a translational resource therefore sought to offer additional support and additional entry points for designers as they encounter and engage with these challenges.</s></p></div>
