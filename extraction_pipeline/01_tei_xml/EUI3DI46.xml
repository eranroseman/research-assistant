<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_Vsk3kwS">Overview</head><p xml:id="_3K8a5ja"><s xml:id="_w49JEx3">The present study contributes to the evidence base around experiences of overweight and obese adolescents and their parents in response to text messages designed to support behavior change in the maintenance period of a larger intervention.</s><s xml:id="_B9dnhYX">Adolescents described a sense of shame in response to the text message intervention, which was also observed by their parents, presenting a new issue for health researchers using text messaging with overweight and obese adolescents.</s><s xml:id="_p3huN25">In this study, overweight and obese adolescents' stated preferences for text messages differed from how they actually responded to such text messages.</s><s xml:id="_deqNukq">This suggests that pre-intervention testing of messages may not adequately simulate what happens in "real life".</s><s xml:id="_S9BFF6A">There may be differences between messages that adolescents say they like and those that are actually helpful in supporting behavior change.</s><s xml:id="_mqdr6nD">The consensus from adolescents was that the text messages were occasionally useful but sent too frequently and did not substantially help them to change their behaviors.</s><s xml:id="_j2k5heq">Parents agreed that the text messages were too frequent and possibly too impersonal.</s><s xml:id="_Cf39k8U">They acknowledged there were some positive responses to the messages but the majority of the adolescents did not like to be reminded about healthy behaviors.</s><s xml:id="_adCkjpx">These findings emphasize the uniqueness of overweight and obese adolescents and suggest a need to strengthen future intervention aims and evaluation methods.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_YmGAj2A">Shame</head><p xml:id="_bc33cbS"><s xml:id="_XTYDp8K">Overweight and obese adolescents experience a sense of shame regarding their health and/or body <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Wb7RTru">The results of this study show that regular health-related text messages have the potential to heighten this sense of shame, which is a new issue for consideration by researchers using text messaging with overweight and obese adolescents.</s><s xml:id="_GB9REkS">Based on the theoretical underpinnings of CAFAP <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, text messages were specifically worded to promote autonomy and support adolescent choices, yet many adolescents perceived the text messages as reminders of what they should be doing but weren't doing.</s><s xml:id="_4NP2UVV">This response from overweight and obese adolescents differs to that described in similar studies, albeit shorter term, in adolescents of differing weight statuses <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> or diabetic adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> who reported to enjoy receiving health-related text messages.</s><s xml:id="_GSsXrub">Similarly, suggestions about what other teens had found useful were not well-received as they had been in the pilot phase of a previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, rather, these adolescents reported they disliked being compared to others.</s><s xml:id="_DHkruQs">This response is potentially a significant barrier for overweight and obese adolescents to maintain healthy behaviors, with feelings of shame being related to poor mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> and in turn to poorer self-efficacy and reduced ability to engage in lifestyle changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5VCrDGJ">These feelings or circumstances may be unique to overweight and obese adolescents and suggest that results from trials involving non-obese adolescents may not be easily generalized to this group.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_JdDa537">Want Versus Response</head><p xml:id="_pr7ky7R"><s xml:id="_X378B8F">The results from this study suggest a notable difference between what overweight and obese adolescents say they prefer in a text message as opposed to what is actually useful to them in the maintenance phase following intervention.</s><s xml:id="_SmD6zc8">Adolescents reported that texts relating to their long-term goals were useful to motivate them, yet they had difficulty with maintaining behavior change and parents reported significant issues with adolescent motivation.</s><s xml:id="_drcAZUQ">Adolescents were able to point out flaws in the text message content and suggest improvements; however, many of these included strategies previously used or previously criticized by the adolescents themselves.</s><s xml:id="_NCbKqZS">Similarly, adolescents expressed a desire for practical tips to use in their daily lives reflecting current evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, yet were quick to highlight reasons that would prevent them from regularly using the tips.</s><s xml:id="_ERNaUaW">They identified a number of barriers including lack of time or lack of resources (eg, particular foods not available), but weren't able to suggest many ideas to overcome these.</s><s xml:id="_zn6gadq">Interpretation of these results suggest that adolescents are able to identify idealistic concepts for text message style and content that may make theoretical sense, but have difficulty envisioning their actual response to such messages.</s><s xml:id="_6SzqxYM">This has potential implications for researchers doing pre-intervention testing with overweight and obese adolescents because the views they express may indicate that the intervention will be useful but might not be a true reflection of their experience in a text message intervention.</s><s xml:id="_eUqyXGr">Currently, the majority of the evidence around text message development for overweight and obese adolescents is based on the assumption that adolescents know what will be helpful to them in a text message and can articulate that; however, these results suggest that this may not be the case.</s><s xml:id="_9sREHXx">Qualitative post-intervention research may provide the most contextual data regarding overweight and obese adolescents' reaction to text messages, but even within these results there are inconsistencies between what adolescents say they want and what they actually respond well to.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_vvB8HvJ">Purpose of Text</head><p xml:id="_ncdMyRW"><s xml:id="_X9eDhtb">Text messages are often used with adolescents to (1) encourage behavior change or maintenance, and (2) to foster engagement between adolescents and interventions; however, this research suggests that it may be difficult to concurrently achieve both of these aims in a weight-related intervention using text messages.</s><s xml:id="_KudA33f">The overweight and obese adolescents in this study did not like receiving text messages reminding them to maintain healthy behaviors, and thus such messages have the potential to damage the therapeutic relationship established during a face-to-face intervention and hence ongoing engagement.</s></p><p xml:id="_zrXHECR"><s xml:id="_Hjd9km9">In this study, overweight and obese adolescents' responses to the text messages became increasingly negative over time.</s><s xml:id="_3GwbDwN">This suggests that their motivation may decline over time leading to failure to maintain behavior changes.</s><s xml:id="_CamKjep">Many parents in this study reiterated that adolescents didn't like to be prompted about healthy things they could be doing, although they felt that it was sometimes useful to encourage behavior change.</s><s xml:id="_7Bbp4Pq">Despite adolescents reporting their dislike of the text messages, the healthy behavior focus may have had a positive effect on adolescents' health.</s><s xml:id="_RrcKuHp">The effectiveness of using texts as healthy behavior prompts is not clear, with some evidence suggesting that this may be effective in promoting behavior change in the long-term <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>, while other evidence suggests that eliciting a negative or shameful response to a message results in a reduction in self-efficacy and lack of behavior change <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ZFpVw2s">This delicate balance between prompting behavior change and avoiding a shameful response may account for some of the differences reported in the literature relating to effectiveness of text messaging interventions in overweight and obese adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_E3p4YUb"><s xml:id="_hVb88bU">Conversely, messages not related to weight or healthy behaviors may be more effective at keeping adolescents engaged with an intervention.</s><s xml:id="_kNsk35h">In this study, adolescents expressed a desire for more casual and positive text messages, which may have been more suited to preserving links with the intervention rather than eliciting behavior change.</s><s xml:id="_9s34UWJ">If the intervention aim was to preserve links with adolescents, then text messages would need to be carefully constructed to foster this sense of engagement but could be completely unrelated to the behavioral aims of the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_sw5Tpgr">Message development based on self-determination theory would therefore aim to promote a sense of connection for the adolescent <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_4bKrjKp">To our knowledge, the use of text messaging interventions to foster engagement has not been tested independent of behavior change and should be explored in future research.</s></p><p xml:id="_wGCNQsC"><s xml:id="_NAkdkMJ">The current findings suggest that future studies would benefit from generating clear aims for text messaging interventions specifically relating to either behavior change or engagement, and designing the texts with these aims in mind.</s><s xml:id="_JtbFnrB">Similarly, evaluation methods need to be strengthened and appropriate measures used to assess whether the text messages actually achieve their intended aims.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_rMMYwwm">Timing</head><p xml:id="_GaQb4G7"><s xml:id="_MaPaXWz">Adolescents expressed a number of differing opinions regarding the timing of the text messages, suggesting that it may be most acceptable if timing is personalized to each participant's preferences.</s><s xml:id="_MaDT8ak">In the current intervention, messages were sent three times per week.</s><s xml:id="_dMkjCZq">Adolescents and parents consistently reported that the frequency of the text messages was excessive and they found that the messages became boring over time.</s><s xml:id="_tDjDSp6">This is in contrast to other studies with even greater frequencies of contact <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> where adolescents were reported to be accepting of daily texts, although 20% of participants in one study indicated that they got bored of receiving the same or similar text messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HyAkcmT">Interestingly, only one of these studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> was directed at overweight and obese adolescents, suggesting that this group may have unique perceptions regarding the frequency of supportive text messages and this may be related to how well they are achieving their lifestyle goals.</s><s xml:id="_WfRzr28">Ngyuen et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> sent a text message once per month on average to overweight and obese adolescents but suggested that this dose was possibly too low to have an impact.</s><s xml:id="_sHzb7SJ">The desire for less frequent text messages in this study may be related to the sense of guilt overweight and obese adolescents describe when they are reminded about changes they aren't making, although it remains unclear as to whether this can prompt behavior change.</s><s xml:id="_ttxc6dh">These results highlight how messages can possibly invoke an undesirable response in overweight and obese adolescents.</s><s xml:id="_nNSfVKp">Text messages become personal because they are sent to the participant's phone and differ from other health messages on media such as television where the individual may be able to more easily ignore a message as they are perceived as not relevant to them.</s><s xml:id="_HMr7JMr">When an individual receives and reads the text message, they will make a decision as to how relevant or useful the information is for them.</s><s xml:id="_NtdpbtT">From the responses obtained, it appears that, in overweight and obese adolescents, health messages may invoke a response that reduces their motivation to change rather than stimulating them to continue to take action to increase their physical activity or improve their diet.</s><s xml:id="_Jqd4Whp">Health researchers may therefore need to modify the logistics of text message delivery to best suit the aims of their intervention, be that engagement or behavior change.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_2ESHEKq">Style</head><p xml:id="_BHZdnJ4"><s xml:id="_Ds53t9K">Focus group participants were unanimous in their call for more casually worded text messages.</s><s xml:id="_FSMNmzN">Adolescents have previously expressed a preference for health care providers to communicate via text using a natural tone while avoiding the use of text message "slang" as frequently used in adolescent-to-adolescent contact <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DNhDx4z">Despite attempts to use less formal language than in the previous study, our research suggests that the tone we used was perceived as too professional by adolescents.</s><s xml:id="_R2FT8fX">The addition of symbols and emoticons (eg, exclamation marks and smiley faces) to text messages may help to convey a less formal tone.</s><s xml:id="_RjtPbDg">Although most text messaging studies have used tailored messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>, our research suggests that overweight and obese adolescents want them to be further customized to their individual goals and experiences.</s><s xml:id="_Y4HnmqC">Adolescents also reported that negatively worded texts (eg, "don't eat junk food") were likely to increase the likelihood of actually performing those behaviors, supporting recent findings by Woolford et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zaWEc8z">These authors <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> suggested that overweight and obese adolescents often want to avoid the psychological work associated with reflection and instead prefer tips and testimonials from other adolescents, yet our results suggest that overweight and obese adolescents in actuality do not find these helpful to assist with behavior change.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_4usMztz">Parents</head><p xml:id="_qaKk6uh"><s xml:id="_JxRJzJv">No other studies to our knowledge have included parent perceptions of their overweight and obese adolescent's responses to receiving supportive text messages.</s><s xml:id="_fqVuWkt">Including parent views helps to understand the differences in opinions that adolescents might express to parents when at home, as opposed to researchers.</s><s xml:id="_mBfZzE3">This triangulation of the data provides a richer sense of what the "real" truth may be.</s><s xml:id="_UxE6XSH">The views expressed by parents in this study were generally aligned with the opinions described by adolescents and were also useful in identifying inconsistencies described by individual adolescents whose views consistently differed from the overall group.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_nAMEDtw">Limitations</head><p xml:id="_UqJdD4J"><s xml:id="_jJ8PPRu">As with all qualitative studies, there are potential limitations associated with participants reporting a view that may be perceived as socially acceptable, rather than their true opinion.</s><s xml:id="_PJQYfzg">It is possible that overweight and obese adolescents in particular may be prone to report in this way.</s><s xml:id="_XrBaSYa">The focus group facilitators in this study were known to the participants, which may have influenced participants to offer a more positive view on the use of text messages; however, the sometimes negative opinions expressed by parents and adolescents suggest this was not the case.</s><s xml:id="_uUddHDM">The small size of the focus groups may have either encouraged or impeded discussion.</s><s xml:id="_QDQkbAE">It is also not possible to determine directly how the messages affected their behavior and if they took action.</s><s xml:id="_6ZExv8N">For example, some irritation with the messages may still have served as a reminder to increase their physical activity or improve their diet.</s><s xml:id="_SpqWUJv">The strengths of this study include an appropriate qualitative design to address the research question, a range of informants with directly relevant opinions for the research question, the inclusion of parents and adolescents, and provision of novel, in-depth information about the challenging topic of providing support to overweight and obese adolescents following an intensive intervention period.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_fUvx3tP">Implications for Research and Practice</head><p xml:id="_sr9wQwH"><s xml:id="_E7bNATG">This study presents several implications to consider in future research.</s><s xml:id="_BD85e3H">First, overweight and obese adolescents may not know or have the ability to articulate how they would best be supported during the maintenance phase.</s><s xml:id="_mFH7V8B">Second, researchers should generate clear aims when planning a text message intervention, and develop appropriate methods of measuring success relative to the specific aims (for example engagement or behavior change).</s><s xml:id="_S235zsS">Third, timing and content of messages may need to be more individualized and may require ongoing input from adolescents to understand their preferences for receiving text messages.</s><s xml:id="_gnxdk7w">Fourth, reports of parent experiences may offer a useful secondary view of adolescent responses to text message interventions.</s><s xml:id="_QMgbWB7">Last, overweight and obese adolescents might be more susceptible to feelings of guilt or shame than non-obese adolescents when reminded about maintaining behavior change.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_TzfegHb">Conclusions</head><p xml:id="_2JVY4pW"><s xml:id="_MKmuZ88">Findings from this study suggest that text messages may have a useful role in interventions for overweight and obese adolescents but that adolescent opinions pre-intervention may not be very predictive of their actual experience and that it may be difficult to achieve both enhanced engagement and behavior change simultaneously.</s><s xml:id="_KY8pkeb">The results emphasize the importance of message tone, content, and timing as these factors appear to impact on how the messages will be received by overweight and obese adolescents.</s><s xml:id="_2JXQwEa">The potential to initiate feelings of shame in adolescent recipients of text messaging was identified as an important issue.</s><s xml:id="_eQKadmp">The study also supported the use of process evaluation to help inform further interventions, and highlights the value of parent and adolescent reports.</s><s xml:id="_kvmAFPg">Future research should be clear on the engagement or efficacy aims for an intervention, develop messages to accommodate adolescent preferences in conjunction with an appropriate theory, and employ appropriate evaluation measures of engagement or effectiveness.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>•</head><figDesc><div><p xml:id="_YrVbAnd"><s xml:id="_Jfqmxpz">Did you like/dislike this message?•</s><s xml:id="_tgR7X2q">What would you first think when you got this message?•</s><s xml:id="_K6xgvHM">Is it a realistic message for you?</s><s xml:id="_V5RWGfw">(Is it right for you?) • What's good about it?</s><s xml:id="_Yn8zrwQ">• What's not so good about it?</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
