<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_E7mchy6">Prior Work</head><p xml:id="_U35WKW2"><s xml:id="_gc9M9Pg">In the past decade, evidence regarding the feasibility and efficacy of AI chatbots in delivering health care services has focused on different health contexts and technological perspectives, and most of these chatbots aim to improve mental health outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_numkZkX">Of the extant systematic reviews on AI chatbots, 6 articles targeted at assessing efficacy of AI-chatbots in enhancing mental health outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, 2 examined the feasibility of AI-chatbots in health care settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>, and 1 described the technical architectures and characteristics of the AI chatbots used in chronic conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_bjqDwGj"><s xml:id="_ThWBRcp">Given the merits of AI chatbots in health promotion, recent literature has paid increasing attention to the use of AI chatbots for health behavior changes.</s><s xml:id="_pgKybNV">Oh et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> conducted a systematic review that assessed the efficacy of AI chatbots for lifestyle modification (eg, physical activity, diet, and weight management).</s><s xml:id="_N5TpQvk">However, the scope and inclusion criteria of this review had several limitations.</s><s xml:id="_pMz5vPh">First, this review did not distinguish between AI-driven chatbots and other chatbots.</s><s xml:id="_CSjBkm9">For example, the AI chatbots that performed rule-based or constrained conversation were included.</s><s xml:id="_efPcmk6">Second, the selected studies targeted only a limited set of behaviors, including physical activity, diet, and weight management.</s><s xml:id="_32CtQBA">Third, this review did not cover all platforms that could possibly deploy AI chatbots, the emerging technology platforms.</s><s xml:id="_uBPcw5w">For example, this review excluded the AI chatbots that were integrated into virtual reality, augmented reality, embodied agents, and therapeutic robots.</s><s xml:id="_ebs5XfP">Therefore, to provide a state-of-the-art understanding of AI chatbots for promoting health behavior changes, we were motivated to conduct a systematic review that covers the latest developments in AI chatbots, namely them being integrated into diverse devices (robots, smartphones, and computers) and diverse platforms (messenger and SMS text message), them performing "unconstrained" conversations, and them targeting a wide range of behavioral outcomes (smoking cessation, treatment or medication adherence, healthy lifestyle, and related health behavior domains).</s><s xml:id="_dF2Dfbv">As such, this study aimed to provide critical evaluations of published empirical studies that describe AI chatbots' intervention characteristics, components, or functionality and investigate their feasibility and efficacy in promoting a wide range of healthy behaviors on traditional and emerging platforms.</s></p></div>
