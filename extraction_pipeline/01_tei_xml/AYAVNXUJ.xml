example message which one might receive from a modern fitness tracker.</s><s xml:id="_2YYhpUT">The message represents a new trend in personal informatics devices-trackers have transitioned from providing overviews of measured, objective data (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_prD2TWV">average heart rate or step counts) to interpreted data (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_6yn2rmG">stress or energy levels).</s><s xml:id="_kp9z75j">This change is apparent both in the range of new metrics available in new fitness tracker models <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and the marketing narrative around fitness tracking.</s><s xml:id="_qmfSrja">The new (at time of writing) Fitbit Charge 5 features six 'reasons you'll love Charge 5'<ref type="foot" target="#foot_0">foot_0</ref> and four of these reasons are interpreted data: Daily Readiness, Stress Management, Heart Health and Health Metrics.</s><s xml:id="_YW3wwyf">One reason for the need to use interpreted data is the fact that leading fitness trackers on the consumer market already include advanced sensors, which generate an abundance of data points.</s><s xml:id="_hK4ymqc">Thus, processing tracker data is inevitable to avoid complexity <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_B2abdcK">Yet, processing physiological data before showing it to the user inherently involves aggregating and processing sensor data using computational tools and delegating part of the data interpretation to those who design the processing algorithms.</s><s xml:id="_Q66ct9N">Consequently, it is a challenge for Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) to understand how such derived metrics (we propose adopting this term and use it in this paper <ref type="foot" target="#foot_1">2</ref> ) can be designed in ways which effectively benefit the users' wellbeing.</s></p><p xml:id="_3TcA6Rp"><s xml:id="_Z5hrb8q">Simultaneously, the HCI field has studied the personal informatics experiences created by fitness trackers and recognises the role of metrics as a key design dimension of such experiences.</s><s xml:id="_rtRKDxk">Epstein et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> concluded that selecting tools (and, consequently, metrics) was a key step in starting a personal informatics experience.</s><s xml:id="_rb49SNj">Niess and Woźniak <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref> showed how users translated their qualitative goals into quantitative metrics to achieve a meaningful tracking experience.</s><s xml:id="_5HSURRr">These investigations and others show that effective metrics are core to a positive tracking experience.</s><s xml:id="_fbNj8Wb">Further, not only what the metrics represent, but also how the data is presented to the user affects the tracking experience.</s><s xml:id="_wkdShkX">Past work has shown that visual representations of tracker data can affect user experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> and how the users reflect upon the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qJeYChk">Thus, exploring how to present derived metrics and the data behind them in ways which foster optimal user benefit is key to improving personal informatics experiences.</s><s xml:id="_KvWjmkj">As the complexity and computing power of personal trackers increases, we need to find ways to optimally communicate the sensor information to users and ensure that they can have more agency by making more informed decisions about their wellbeing.</s></p><p xml:id="_UAA5XUu"><s xml:id="_ABJZq7J">To understand user perceptions of derived metrics and learn how such metrics can support wellbeing, this paper contributes a two-step study of different forms of derived metrics.</s><s xml:id="_3DebZS3">We conducted an online survey and an interview study which examined three ways of presenting a derived metric for health at three levels of abstraction (i.e.</s><s xml:id="_7MA7Eaa">metrics presented with varying levels of detail and vagueness, representing different levels of construal <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_eYnKwva">We determined that a medium level of abstraction produced the most reported reflection in users.</s><s xml:id="_fg2uk63">Based on the data gathered, we conclude that this was due to the fact that a medium level of abstraction allowed for construal alignment, i.e understanding the metric at a level of abstraction which enables reflection and identifying underlying reasons for the metric.</s><s xml:id="_bA9KJM8">This implies that a well-designed derived metric provides enough contextual information to avoid confusion and, simultaneously, serves to simplify the data gathered about one's wellbeing.</s></p><p xml:id="_f7GSMyb"><s xml:id="_SFqF34S">This paper contributes the following: (1) an online survey comparing three levels of abstraction of a health metric for fitness trackers; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> an interview study of user attitudes toward derived health metrics at different levels of abstraction and (3) guidelines for designing and presenting derived metrics in fitness trackers.</s></p></div>

interpretation of the derived metric to their desired level of abstraction.</s></p><p xml:id="_cn85weG"><s xml:id="_JcMCD72">We note that, in our study, we examined the three abstraction levels as

measurement supports only revisiting <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, while derived metrics may support revisiting and explanation.</s><s xml:id="_gUUFm2H">Thus, the design solution for the

impossible to fully use the tracker's potential for fostering reflection.</s><s xml:id="_Pn4DDzu">This was evident both in the quantitative data and in the metric design theme.</s><s xml:id="_puEWwUt">Yet, full transparency was also not a desired design approach as it led to a loss of reflection potential and limited actionability.</s><s xml:id="_qrfpsj3">Consequently, the design of future derived metrics should apply the 'middle way' principle.</s><s xml:id="_awR2WWP">Future trackers should reveal how a derived metric is obtained and calculated to the user to a certain
