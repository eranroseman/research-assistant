research to address these gaps.</s></p><p xml:id="_4QGum4t"><s xml:id="_rQXWu2H">Ƅ Human aspects research related gaps: Among the selected primary studies, there are only a few studies (1-2 studies) focusing on empathy, personality, skills, coordination, attitude, and competence related to developer-user interactions.</s><s xml:id="_XYpuYxx">Exploring the impact of these under-researched human aspects and determining the optimal way to integrate them into developer-user interactions in SE activities may enhance these interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SrS8jqn">These human aspects can be studied individually as well as in combination with other human aspects.</s><s xml:id="_tqUKyaz">These future studies may beneficial in exploring positive and negative impacts of these under-researched human aspects on developer-user interactions.</s><s xml:id="_84ErpZ4">Further they may assist in understanding the ways to capture these human aspects in real-world, and determining the practical ways of improving SE by incorporating their impact.</s></p><p xml:id="_D4tqyqW"><s xml:id="_hDRDpBy">Ƅ Empathy in developer-user interactions: Empathy was somewhat surprisingly found to be an under-researched area in terms of developeruser interactions in SE, as we found only two primary studies (SPR03, SBF08) regarding empathy.</s><s xml:id="_aXvKtUb">Both these studies were focused on improving developers' understanding of usability.</s><s xml:id="_w34aS9s">Empathy has been considered vital for fostering human connections in different disciplines <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[51]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_jHrspY3">However in SE, the role of empathy in developer-user interactions, effects of empathy in these interactions and the ways of improving SE outcomes and processes by leveraging empathy has not been studied so far.</s></p><p xml:id="_k5n9G7y"><s xml:id="_nshrAuw">Ƅ Research on developer-user personality: There have been numerous studies investigating the impact of personality on SE tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[52]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_D89Ed4E">Previous research has also identified SE activities that are influenced by the personality traits of SE professionals <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_GMVHbpa">However, our selected primary studies had only one study which emphasised the importance of considering personality in different SE challenges related to developer-user interactions (SBB12).</s><s xml:id="_RAXZHMJ">Therefore, it seems useful to understand how developer and user personalities influence their interactions such as developer-user communication, decision making, and conflict resolution between developers and users.</s></p><p xml:id="_N9JgdAC"><s xml:id="_fTdT3w3">Ƅ Research on attitude: We found that the area of attitude is underexplored, with only one primary study (IEEE02) addressing this aspect among the papers included in this SLR.</s><s xml:id="_C3JaKVt">This study identified user-developer attitude and user attitude towards the system as critical factors for user engagement success in system development.</s><s xml:id="_EqM8VqS">However, the broader dynamics of how positive or negative attitudes impact the willingness of users and developers to engage with each other, and the evolution of

coordination needs change over the software development life cycle.</s></p><p xml:id="_uQVS6Km"><s xml:id="_pQhCVV3">Ƅ Competence related research: Two primary studies related to competence were found and these emphasised the importance of user competence in user engagement with developers (IEEE02, SBB01).</s><s xml:id="_4NF9jbe">Similarly competence may also influence other aspects of developer-user interaction such as communication, understanding.</s><s xml:id="_4NUfccQ">Hence further studies may helpful in understanding the role of competence in fostering effective developer-user communication, reducing misunderstandings, and aligning expectations.</s></p><p xml:id="_5fhqXhp"><s xml:id="_QQ2UyTC">Ƅ Research on the relationships among different human aspects: This was identified as an area with limited studies to date.</s><s xml:id="_2z92Wds">Communication and collaboration and culture and communication human aspects combinations have been studied in more than one primary study.</s><s xml:id="_PBcD6fB">However, the other human aspect combinations were studied only once which opens several possibilities of future research areas.</s><s xml:id="_3QU8cUc">By far the majority of the selected primary studies (86%) have not investigated the relationships among different human aspects.</s><s xml:id="_gDpsMHB">Thus, more research studies are required to identify the relationships among different human aspects, and their impact on developer-user interactions.</s><s xml:id="_W8HEU8X">By exploring these relationships, researchers can provide further insights into how software teams can effectively leverage various human aspects to improve overall project success and collaboration.</s></p><p xml:id="_NDq5Qes"><s xml:id="_UAbvC2u">Ƅ Lack of a proper human aspects taxonomy: Similar to prior studies, we identified another limitation during our analysis, which is a lack of agreed definitions in studies of 'human aspects' <ref type="bibr"

xml:id="_M37fBsH">However, we used this taxonomy for our classification as the human aspects discussed in these studies are common to both developers and users.</s><s xml:id="_sXaSBUj">There is thus a need for conducting evaluations using the current taxonomies and extending them to cater to human aspects of other SE stakeholders (e.g., developers, testers).</s><s xml:id="_wezUPM9">There may be a need for developing new taxonomies to better capture diverse human aspects of these other stakeholders.</s></p><p xml:id="_gxx9w4B"><s xml:id="_hrjc33G">Ƅ Developing a taxonomy to classify the effects of human aspects: There is no known comprehensive taxonomy to classify the effects of human aspects.</s><s xml:id="_7k7XCvH">Developing a taxonomy to classify the effects of human aspects could significantly enhance our understanding of the intricate dynamics at play in developer-user interactions.</s><s xml:id="_SnbMBbT">During our SLR, we observed that several other SLRs have explored the

of human aspects.</s><s xml:id="_eUXX8QF">Introducing a new taxonomy in future research endeavours may provide a more structured approach to analyse the impact of human aspects and offer valuable insights into how the field has evolved over time.</s><s xml:id="_uRYuPnp">By reclassifying primary papers based on this new taxonomy, researchers can uncover trends, patterns, and changes in our understanding of human aspects in SE.</s></p><p xml:id="_pTEkXCN"><s xml:id="_cycpmKD">Ƅ Addressing evaluation limitations: Many primary studies had limitations in their evaluations, which were identified either as limitations within the study itself or during our analysis of the study.</s><s xml:id="_GyZSYGd">Evaluation of most of the proposed tools, theories or guidelines in the primary studies are planned to be completed as future works.</s><s xml:id="_QghuMtf">Many studies admitted issues related to self-reported information, threats to reliability, and ability to influence the direction of the discussion in semi-structured interviews.</s><s xml:id="_QXKVTsn">Many studies had small sample size, specific geographic focus, variation in participants' expertise, sample size concerns, and context-specificity.</s><s xml:id="_hUVDrYR">Therefore proposed solutions still remain to be tested and evaluated with real-world scenarios and generalised contexts.</s></p><p xml:id="_jXWC9bV"><s xml:id="_akrKx94">Ƅ Exploring the correlation between query specificity and snowballing efficacy: Future SLRs could focus on studying the correlation between the specificity of search queries employed in SLRs and the efficacy of snowballing techniques.</s><s xml:id="_sryXbUE">This investigation could involve examining how the level of specificity in search queries influences the need for and impact of snowballing in different domains.</s><s xml:id="_WuxvaVw">By gaining insights into this correlation, researchers can develop tailored search strategies that optimise the effectiveness of snowballing, particularly in domains with varying degrees of specificity in research queries.</s></p></div>

early in the project life cycle to foster a deeper understanding and alignment of objectives.</s></p><p xml:id="_japm9xe"><s xml:id="_ry9xVNS">Expressing emotions and politeness in developer-user communication: Studies have delved into the nuances of how various roles in open-source software development express emotions and politeness by analysing GitHub projects (ACM01).</s><s xml:id="_G5VWJSa">The findings revealed notable distinctions between developers and users in their expressions of emotions and levels of politeness.</s><s xml:id="_EnCSVd3">Developers' comments tend to exhibit lower levels of politeness compared to users' comments, with developers receiving a higher degree of politeness in response to their comments than users.</s><s xml:id="_FCe7VQn">Further, developers received a higher level of love and joy in the comments on their issues, while users received more expressions of anger and sadness in theirs compared to developers.</s><s xml:id="_DGMA5fx">These findings suggest that while users often strive to maintain politeness and convey positive emotions, their efforts may not always be reciprocated.</s><s xml:id="_cC7JCxa">As a result, researchers have recommended that developers exercise greater caution and mindfulness in their communications with other contributors.</s><s xml:id="_qAeAqgX">By recognising these disparities, software organisations can implement strategies to foster a more respectful and supportive atmosphere.</s><s xml:id="_2cwX7tG">Creating guidelines or best practices for communication within

techniques and conflict resolution can empower developers to navigate interpersonal challenges more effectively.</s></p><p xml:id="_XUPGwWr"><s xml:id="_pp48MB9">Enhancing developer-user communication: Many studies have offered insights into improving communication between developers and users by addressing various aspects of their interaction.</s><s xml:id="_bQsTN9t">Some of these recommendations include addressing cultural differences (SBB19, SBF10, SBF07), using intermediaries to facilitate communication (IEEE05, SBF07), suggestions on communication media selection (SBB09),

developers and users.</s><s xml:id="_zfRt3yR">Especially researchers have emphasised that cultural differences between users and developers are at the foundation of the communication gaps (SBB19, SBF07, SBF10).</s><s xml:id="_HqUMvrq">Some of the recommendations to bridge these gaps include avoiding specialist terminology and explaining key jargon, considering the use of language from different perspectives to eliminate ambiguity, providing advance notice of meetings and agenda details for adequate preparation, recognising the distinct purposes of technology use for business users versus developers, respecting values associated with different roles, and treating business users as clients by investing time in understanding their needs (SBB19, SBF10).</s></p><p xml:id="_R7gBwsH"><s xml:id="_M3TdwsB">Improving developers' understanding of usability via empathy: Research suggests a strong link between developers' understanding of usability and their empathy toward users' needs (SBF08, SPR03).</s><s xml:id="_4hKK74q">They found that engaging in user-based thinking aloud protocols during usability evaluation sessions enhances developers' empathy by exposing them to users' emotions, fostering emotional contagion and heightening empathy toward user needs.</s><s xml:id="_kECSm3y">This calls for alternative corrective measures over traditional
