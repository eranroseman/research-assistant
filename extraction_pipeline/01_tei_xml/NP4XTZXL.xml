<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_mrCMMy3">Affect and emotions</head><p xml:id="_W9jtCgD"><s xml:id="_S3FPhvG">Perhaps the most frequently mentioned biasing factors ostensibly neglected in the TPB are affect and emotions <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Conner &amp; Armitage, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Rapaport &amp; Orbell, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Richard, de Vries, &amp; van der Pligt, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Wolff, Nordin, Brun, Berglund, &amp; Kvale, 2011)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Wjj6uwN">This concern is based in part on the mistaken perception that the theory posits a rational actor who is unaffected by emotions and in part on the standard methodology that is typically used to operationalise the theory's constructs.</s><s xml:id="_sCxaEA2">In the TPB, affect and emotions enter in two ways.</s><s xml:id="_yjuDnTm">First, they can serve as background factors that influence behavioural, normative and/or control beliefs.</s><s xml:id="_PkVMV7q">Thus, it is well known that general moods can have systematic effects on belief strength and evaluations.</s><s xml:id="_9RGrcgH">Compared to people in a negative mood state, people in a positive mood tend to evaluate events (such as the consequences of a behaviour) more favourably and to judge favourable events as more likely to occur <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Forgas, Bower, &amp; Krantz, 1984;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">Johnson &amp; Tversky, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Schaller &amp; Cialdini, 1990)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_uNVpyba">In addition, affective states can also help to select the behavioural, normative and control beliefs that are readily accessible in memory <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(Clark &amp; Waddell, 1983;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">McKee, Wall, Hinson, Goldstein, &amp; Bissonnette, 2003</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_dBNrE4a">Thus, for example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">McKee et al. (2003)</ref> reported that, in a free-response elicitation session, participants in a negative mood state were more likely to emit unfavourable beliefs about smoking compared to participants in a positive mood state.</s></p><p xml:id="_p2uYsyX"><s xml:id="_gBgdGAZ">The research discussed above indicates that affect and emotions can have indirect effects on intentions and behaviour by influencing the kinds of beliefs that are salient in a given situation, as well as the strength and evaluative connotations of these beliefs.</s><s xml:id="_7n3mtJh">However, it is often suggested that affect can influence behaviour in a more direct fashion, and that this possibility is not sufficiently accounted for in the TPB.</s><s xml:id="_gkWAQzs"><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Wolff et al. (2011)</ref> follow the lead of other investigators <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Abraham &amp; Sheeran, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Conner, Smith, &amp; Mcmillan, 2003)</ref> who have argued that anticipated regret and, more generally, anticipated affect can influence intentions and behaviour independent of the other predictors in the TPB.</s><s xml:id="_GcUU7vp">Indeed, in a meta-analysis of 24 datasets, <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">Sandberg and Conner (2008)</ref> found that the inclusion of anticipated affect in the prediction equation accounted for an additional 7% of the variance in intentions and 1% of the variance in behaviour.</s></p><p xml:id="_CS3dDbc"><s xml:id="_Y8hzGE6">From the perspective of the TPB, expectations that performing a behaviour will lead to experiencing pain, pleasure, regret, fear, elation or other emotions are simply behavioural beliefs, i.e. beliefs about the likely consequences of the behaviour, some positive and others negative.</s><s xml:id="_5c22WzE">It has been argued, however, that these kinds of behavioural beliefs are not sufficiently represented in applications of the theory due to the way in which salient beliefs are elicited <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Conner &amp; Armitage, 1998;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b62">Wolff et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_nSBu2Xy">In a typical elicitation session, participants are asked to list what they believe to be the advantages and disadvantages of performing a behaviour under investigation.</s><s xml:id="_Vm6AAJe">This question tends to elicit instrumental rather than experiential or affective consequences.</s><s xml:id="_dXNhY2T">However, there is nothing in the TPB that requires a focus on instrumental outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_jynNVWp">For example, in a study on five leisure activities, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Ajzen and Driver (1991)</ref> asked participants in formative research to list the benefits and costs of each leisure activity as well as the things they liked and disliked about each activity.</s><s xml:id="_2GUWEuB">The instrumental beliefs were found to predict an instrumental attitude measure (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_rBZTQwS">useful-useless) better than an experiential measure (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_GZWwE44">interestingboring), and the reverse was true for the affective beliefs.</s><s xml:id="_KrFXM2x">The two types of attitude made independent contributions to the prediction of intentions.</s><s xml:id="_ZYBCnuP">However, equally strong predictions were obtained when the two attitudes were combined into a single measure, suggesting that they can usefully be considered parts of the same attitude.</s></p><p xml:id="_6aaUNty"><s xml:id="_GaGsRQ2">In a recent study, <ref type="bibr">Ajzen and Sheikh (in press</ref>) explored a possible reason for the finding that anticipated affect adds strongly and independently to the prediction of intentions.</s><s xml:id="_AeJuhA9">A review of the literature revealed a peculiar feature of most studies dealing with the role of anticipated affect.</s><s xml:id="_YUufjTH">Whereas the basic variables in the TPB are assessed with respect to performing a behaviour of interest, anticipated affective reactions are usually measured in relation to not performing the behaviour <ref type="bibr">(Fishbein &amp; Ajzen, 2010, Chapter 9)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_n2M43Vj">In fact, some investigators have made this explicit in their definition of anticipated affect.</s><s xml:id="_RvbK2Hu">Thus, according to <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Abraham and Sheeran (2003)</ref>, 'Anticipated regret refers to beliefs about whether or not feelings of regret or upset will follow from inaction' (p.</s><s xml:id="_mDRpQkp">496, emphasis added).</s><s xml:id="_pJjCEt8">In the study reported by Abraham and Sheeran, participants expressed their attitudes, subjective norms, perceived control and intentions with regard to exercising on a regular basis in the next 2 weeks, but they were asked how much they would regret it and how upset they would be if they did not exercise regularly in the next 2 weeks.</s><s xml:id="_mKWVMjq">If, as suggested by the TPB, measures of anticipated affect are (partial) measures of attitude, then it can be argued that studies on anticipated affect actually assess two kinds of attitude: a general attitude towards enacting a given behaviour and an affective attitude towards not performing the behaviour.</s><s xml:id="_4QVVQ8f">Because not doing is not necessarily the opposite of doing <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Richetin, Conner, &amp;
