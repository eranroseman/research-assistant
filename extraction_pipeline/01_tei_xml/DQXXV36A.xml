xml:id="_vPjsRRU">Thus, forming a bond with the client seems to be an important factor, regardless of the setting or type of professional relationship.</s><s xml:id="_JWyUqjf">However, it is still unclear whether the relationship is a mediating or moderating aspect of the SMS coaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_hEg3R3C"><s xml:id="_rut3XDV">The high level of personalization corresponds with Spark et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, who found that DHI should include "an element of human connection to foster ongoing participant satisfaction and accountability."</s><s xml:id="_qVgvg3s">A similar result was reported by Godino et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, who found that SMS was most effective when combined with monthly phone calls.</s><s xml:id="_h7E6DXS">It is important to consider whether the human connection is sufficient to support behavior change on its own.</s><s xml:id="_sw5tDHk">For example, a future study can use the following two conditions: (1) personalized SMS with BCTs similar to this study and (2) only personalized coaching where the SMS is mere encouragement and reminders, thus not actually providing BCTs.</s><s xml:id="_K6Duw4K">If the effect of these 2 conditions is the same, personal contact can be concluded to be effective, regardless of the content or the competence of the coach.</s><s xml:id="_9F5YpFZ">If so, personalized SMS could be used more freely and would not require personnel trained in either MI or BCT, making it easier to scale up.</s></p><p xml:id="_kvbPzjC"><s

target="#fig_1">1</ref> illustrates, the qualitative data, both the interviews and SMS conversations, imply that the SMS intervention increased motivation.</s><s xml:id="_FGV9aTf">An explanation for this discrepancy may be that client motivation was already high at baseline, making incremental changes difficult to detect.</s><s xml:id="_3KtRQrK">Thus, the difference observed is a reflection of what is known as "selection effects," where the motivation level among the participants was higher than that of the general population, which can make it more challenging to detect changes.</s><s xml:id="_BXEVJTZ">This is akin to the concept of "restriction of range" <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_eFkTEyU">Another related explanation may be that the questionnaire is

data may be that motivation was something that occurred in the interaction between the fitness consultant and the clients, making it more difficult to assess quantitatively at a specific time (ie, at T2 or T3).</s><s xml:id="_pcjc6jQ">In other words, the noted motivation was a product of the intervention mode, that is, the fitness consultants' experience with MI and personalized SMS <ref

cognitive facets of motivation are dynamic states shaped by the actions and conditions fostered by the design of a DHI, rather than being tied to a specific BCT.</s><s xml:id="_MFZsU3q">As noted, personalized SMS is "a mode of delivery rather than a BCT" <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Ba7Aj2d">Similarly, learning is influenced by the feedback process, where the behavior is reinforced by the observed reactions from the surrounding <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>, again pointing toward the ever-changing possibility of motivation.</s><s xml:id="_FdMtCTd">However, this separation of the "the what" (eg, BCT) and "the how" (eg, personalized SMS or MI) is merely a theoretical separation, and the practical
