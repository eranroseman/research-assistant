contrasting of self with others in the social network, without explicit discussion or attempts at persuasion taking place.</s><s xml:id="_XJYzrys">Norms about health behaviors are acquired through

xml:id="_nZTBaVH">Social control.</s><s xml:id="_MafEUsH">Another form of social influence is more active and direct.</s><s xml:id="_x44sZcQ">All theorists who focus on physical health outcomes identify social control as a key mechanism through which network ties affect health and longevity, primarily through its effects on health behaviors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Berkman et al.

monitor, encourage, persuade, remind, or pressure a person to adopt or adhere to positive health practices.</s><s xml:id="_zGSDU7r">Social control efforts can discourage risky health behaviors but can also backfire if they are perceived as overly intrusive or dominating, creating resentment and resistance to behavior change <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(Hughes and Gove 1981;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Lewis and Rook 1999)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ADJK2P9">Hence, like the social influence/comparison mechanism, social control effects can be beneficial or harmful, depending on the strategies others employ to regulate the person's behavior.</s></p><p xml:id="_gM4xqyg"><s xml:id="_zTrt49g">Social control is almost never mentioned as a mechanism through which social ties could influence mental health outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_YM9xSGK">However, psychological distress and mood, anxiety, and adjustment disorders are frequently presaged or accompanied by too much or too little sleep, too much or too little appetite, or too much smoking or drinking.</s><s xml:id="_JEeQVyK">Family, friends, and coworkers are likely to observe such behavioral changes and comment or attempt to intervene.</s><s xml:id="_zeV6zxb">To the extent that their efforts at regulation are successful, distress, anxiety, or depression may be averted or dampened.</s><s xml:id="_S8hFXxr">Additionally,

implicit or indirect form of social control that derives from the important fact that all social ties represent role relationships.</s><s xml:id="_QaDjV6f">Roles are positions in the social structure (e.g., husband-wife, parent-child, doctorpatient, friend-friend) to which are attached reciprocal sets of normative rights and obligations (one actor's rights are the other actor's obligations, and

their social roles as self-defining (i.e., as identities), they obtain behavioral guidance from role expectations.</s><s xml:id="_WkwBE78">In other words, individuals know how to behave, and in conventional roles this means conventional (nondeviant) behavior.</s></p><p xml:id="_HDSMtaT"><s xml:id="_yjX7gWp">Beyond behavioral guidance, I have argued that knowing who we are to others also provides purpose and meaning in life, which in turn guard against anxiety and existential despair.</s><s xml:id="_NDhPT3D">A concept related to this function of role identities is "mattering" <ref

person, and he or she depends on one for fulfillment of specific needs.</s><s xml:id="_2Ta8vTM">Because mattering refers to one's significance to other people, it seems conceptually close to the notion of obtaining purpose and meaning in life from relationships with role partners.</s><s xml:id="_HwRt2ex">In sum, social ties as role identities should supply behavioral guidance and purpose and
