that they logged into the website and had used PAP treatment for at least 4 h in the previous day.</s><s xml:id="_axvPQ5f">Their total possible compensation for adequate PAP use in the first week was $210.</s><s xml:id="_JjWyzva">The financial incentive payment was made at the end of the first week of treatment.</s></p><p xml:id="_UD285XK"><s xml:id="_HGT4xzN">All participants received either a

the participating sleep centers and blinded to randomization delivered the equipment to the participants and explained how to use and maintain the equipment.</s><s xml:id="_ZrT5WkN">On a daily basis, the modem transmitted data from the PAP unit to the manufacturer's server, which in turn exported the results to the Way to Health website.</s><s xml:id="_yPm4CBW">The data obtained from the PAP device for analysis included the following measures: hours of mask-on time, apnea-hypopnea index (AHI FLOW ), and amount of unintentional air leak.</s><s xml:id="_yQN5Bwh">Participants who had Web access to their PAP data were only provided their hours of mask-on time results.</s></p><p xml:id="_DNnzP6s"><s xml:id="_uwp8x93">Over the 3-mo intervention, all participants received usual follow-up care at their respective sleep centers.</s><s xml:id="_uM7AGaQ">Usual care at the sites uniformly consisted of one clinic visit with the sleep specialist within 1 to 3 mo following initiation of treatment.</s><s xml:id="_FgQrJK6">No instructions were given to the sleep specialist regarding follow-up care.</s><s xml:id="_YJUuKe4">At the time of the clinic follow-up, the sleep specialist had

health care company supplying the PAP equipment conducted routine follow-up care during the 3-mo intervention.</s><s xml:id="_Rhh3twD">This practice was not standardized or monitored but generally
