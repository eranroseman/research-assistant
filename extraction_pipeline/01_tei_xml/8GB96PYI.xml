has grown exponentially in recent years <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_QETTwh6">Between 2013 and 2014 the global use of smart phones increased by 406 million, reaching 1.82 billion devices (up 5% in a year), and Internet usage via mobile devices has increased by 81% in one year <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_uNj3jys">There were 13.4 billion apps that were downloaded in the first quarter of 2013 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, with projected figures of 102 billion for the whole year <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_yw9K34v">The portability of smart phones provides access to health information and interventions at any time in any context.</s><s xml:id="_CQmzGet">The capabilities (eg, sensors) of smart phones can also enhance the delivery of these health resources.</s></p><p xml:id="_ghaZjvP"><s xml:id="_DfbCSp8">Given the rapid proliferation of smart phone apps, it is increasingly difficult for users, health professionals, and researchers to readily identify and assess high quality apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2rkGC8w">Little information on the quality of apps is available, beyond the star ratings published on retailers' Web pages, and app reviews are subjective by nature and may come from suspicious sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_96pvHVt">Selecting apps on the basis of popularity yields little or no meaningful information on app quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_7eBqTA6"><s xml:id="_p4UZ7c9">Much of the published literature focuses on technical aspects of websites, presented mostly in the form of checklists, which do not assess the quality of these features <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Hz9TTgM">Website quality can be described as a function of: (1) content, (2) appearance and multimedia, (3) navigation, (4) structure and design, and (5) uniqueness <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_uQ52AW8">A synthesis of website evaluation criteria conducted by Kim et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> shortlisted 165 evaluation criteria, grouped in 13 groups (eg, design and aesthetics, ease of use).</s><s xml:id="_3X5mdnv">However, 33 criteria were unable to be grouped and were coded as "miscellaneous", highlighting the complexity of the task.</s><s xml:id="_SUwMUSx">While many website criteria may be applicable to mobile apps, there is a need to consider whether a specific quality rating scale may be needed for apps.</s></p><p xml:id="_3bkwD5C"><s xml:id="_rNzWDA5">Attempts to develop mobile health (mHealth) evaluation criteria are often too general, complex, or specific to a particular health domain.</s><s xml:id="_u7YPk2q">Handel <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> reviewed 35 health and well being mobile apps based on user ratings of: (1) ease of use, (2) reliability, (3) quality, (4) scope of information, and (5) aesthetics.</s><s xml:id="_QPpHpQa">While these criteria may cover important aspects of quality, no rationale for these specific criteria was provided.</s><s xml:id="_yF2mE7x">Khoja et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> described the development of a matrix of evaluation criteria, divided into seven themes for each of the four stages of an app's life-cycle: (1) development, (2) implementation, (3) integration, and (4) sustained operation.</s><s xml:id="_u2yhDq3">While this matrix provides comprehensive criteria for rating app quality, the complex and time-consuming nature of the evaluation scheme would be difficult to apply in routine practice and research.</s><s xml:id="_efEtCyt">Furthermore, the matrix omits any evaluation of the visual aesthetics of the app as a criterion.</s></p><p xml:id="_5BmVTpN"><s xml:id="_6U3kb2J">Guidelines for evaluating the usability of mHealth apps were also compiled by the Health Care Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KQmcHX3">These guidelines use a "Strongly agree" to "Strongly disagree" Likert scale to rate each criterion, which does not provide an indication of their quality.</s><s xml:id="_m9xsHhb">Strong agreement that a criterion is met (ie, clarity in whether a feature is present) is not necessarily equivalent to meeting the criterion to a high degree.</s><s xml:id="_tc87jh6">While the HIMSS criteria were extensive, and included usability criteria for rating efficiency, effectiveness, user satisfaction, and platform optimization, no criteria for rating information quality were included.</s><s xml:id="_mup33Fh">This is problematic, as failure to evaluate the accuracy and appropriateness of the health information contained in mHealth apps could compromise user health and safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_2XjvBfK"><s xml:id="_cnaPdMq">A reliable and objective instrument is needed to rate the degree that mHealth apps satisfy quality criteria.</s><s xml:id="_mV2ewtu">This scale should be easy to understand and use with minimal training.</s><s xml:id="_QUa3wpS">This scale will initially be used by researchers, but may later be made available to app developers and health professionals, pending further research.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_Q6ddCSK">Principal Results</head><p xml:id="_rh43nQu"><s xml:id="_23dUAhr">The MARS is the first mHealth app quality rating tool, to our knowledge, to provide a multidimensional measure of the app quality indicators of engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information quality, as well as app subjective quality.</s><s xml:id="_DWSFUY2">These app quality indicators were extracted from previous research across the UX, technical, human-computer interaction, and mHealth literature, but had not previously been combined in a singular framework.</s><s xml:id="_eVQnAPv">Previous attempts to develop mobile app evaluation criteria have been too technical or specific to a particular health domain.</s><s xml:id="_3xwgPrw">They have also not been developed and piloted in a systematic manner using an expert panel of health professionals, designers, and developers of health Web and mobile apps.</s><s xml:id="_KJvnnAK">In contrast, the MARS is an easy-to-use (with appropriate training), simple, objective, reliable, and widely applicable measure of app quality, developed by an expert multidisciplinary team.</s><s xml:id="_XDwYmHd">Although the generalizability of the MARS is yet to be tested, the scale can be modified to measure the quality of nonhealth related apps.</s><s xml:id="_GB9j8jx">The MARS total mean score describes the overall quality of an app, while the mean engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information quality subscale scores can be used to describe its specific strengths and weaknesses.</s></p><p xml:id="_PCXrWrn"><s xml:id="_fMa2wUD">The use of objective MARS item anchors and the high level of interrater reliability obtained in the current study should allow health practitioners and researchers to use the scale with confidence.</s><s xml:id="_ZzAt7aP">Both the app quality total score and four app-quality subscales had high internal consistency, indicating that the MARS provides raters with a reliable indicator of overall app quality, as well as the quality of app engagement, functionality, aesthetics, and information quality.</s><s xml:id="_ShkDDAx">The exclusion of the subjective quality subscale from the overall mean app quality score, due to its subjective nature, strengthens the objectivity of the MARS as a measure of app quality.</s><s xml:id="_wRbkKg2">Nevertheless, the high correlation between the MARS quality total score and its overall star rating provides a further indication that it is capturing perceived overall quality.</s><s xml:id="_VnkPGGJ">It should be noted that the MARS overall star rating is likely to be influenced by the prior completion of the 19 MARS app quality items.</s><s xml:id="_UXXYrBx">Nevertheless, the iTunes App Store star ratings available on 15 of the 50 mental health apps rated were only moderately correlated with the MARS total score.</s><s xml:id="_xYaSg6H">This was unsurprising; given the variable criteria likely to be used by different raters, the subjective nature of these ratings, and the lack of reliability of the iTunes star ratings, as has been highlighted in previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zp6geKj">In addition, the MARS overall star rating score was only moderately correlated with the iTunes App Store star rating.</s><s xml:id="_s8UsEsb">The MARS star rating is likely to provide a more reliable measure of overall app quality, as it is rated following completion of the entire MARS, and is therefore informed by the preceding items.</s></p><p xml:id="_bTp4d4x"><s xml:id="_eC8TFGe">It is recommended that MARS raters complete a training exercise before commencing use.</s><s xml:id="_CK9tFrP">Training slides are available from the corresponding author.</s><s xml:id="_NbsQEvF">If multiple MARS raters are utilized, it is recommended that raters develop a shared understanding of the target group for the apps, clarify the meaning of any MARS items they find ambiguous, and determine if all MARS items and subscales are relevant to the specific health area of interest.</s><s xml:id="_xY7KvAp">App-quality ratings should be piloted and reviewed until an appropriate level of interrater reliability or consensus ratings are reached.</s><s xml:id="_PBmSN79">The MARS also assumes that raters have undertaken a detailed exploration of the app's content and functionalities.</s></p><p xml:id="_Wf7HBz3"><s xml:id="_WdJWCUG">Due to the generic nature of the mHealth app quality indicators included in the MARS, it is recommended that a number of "App-Specific" items are added to obtain information on the perceived impact of the app on the user's knowledge, attitudes, and intentions related to the target health behavior (see App Specific section of the MARS).</s></p><p xml:id="_pHmFWmf"><s xml:id="_2A67stB">For convenience, the MARS was piloted on iPhone, rather than Android apps.</s><s xml:id="_MtRZefN">Since initial testing, however, the scale has been applied to multiple Android apps and no compatibility issues were encountered.</s><s xml:id="_KNJyjt9">However, future research should explore the reliability of the scale with Android apps.</s></p></div>
