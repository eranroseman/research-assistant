barriers, the internal anonymous feedback collected from staff evaluated the tool positively.</s><s xml:id="_RNQn9sn">Fourth, the stakeholder feedback collected from patients' caregivers and CHECK staff occurred independent of each other.</s><s xml:id="_C64Rf9z">Thus, there was no all-inclusive, connected conversation to simultaneously gauge stakeholder interest from each group.</s><s xml:id="_jV6YRuj">This was intended to be sensitive to the patient population's needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> where such a crossover may create a more intimidating environment or reduce patients' openness to discuss their experiences with existing services.</s><s xml:id="_qwzFTGu">Fifth, design thinking was the primary framework used to develop the tool, which did not take into account other considerations such as technology acceptance, behavior change, or patient engagement models.</s><s xml:id="_tyUeFKF">Sixth, we were not able to implement a free-to-end-user mechanism for our SMS text messaging tool.</s><s xml:id="_vvPRrng">Seventh, in adapting the design thinking process to develop the prototypes sequentially instead of in parallel, we limited the product optimization by concentrating on 1 solution.</s><s xml:id="_ujJZZPm">It is possible that sequential prototyping is not as effective as parallel prototyping <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zbuMvhd">Finally, in alignment with the design thinking step 1 of understanding and empathizing with the audience, we put the primary focus on ensuring all stakeholders felt a part of the process and opened up about their experiences without feeling judged.</s><s xml:id="_mqbuK2Y">During all phases, we highlighted the importance of anonymity for this purpose and thus did not collect the demographic information of the participants.</s><s xml:id="_2TNw9qm">A strength of this study is the scalability where, in prototype 4, we had 4 CHWs service 800 patients (ie, 200 patients per CHW).</s></p><p xml:id="_RjE8J9p"><s xml:id="_yNKWT9V">There are a number of areas for future research.</s><s xml:id="_bxsqTtq">First, future research should study if our approach of 1 CHW per approximately 200 patients would work with a larger number of total patients such as 5000 or 10,000 patients.</s><s xml:id="_FzmqVup">Second, future research also should study if when working with a larger number of patients whether the CHW work load can be increased to more than 200 patients per CHW.</s><s xml:id="_JE6Xadt">Third, in addition to the focus of this study on the process of tool design, it would be useful in future research to determine how this tool or another similar tool would address and potentially positively impact health disparities and social determinants of health.</s><s xml:id="_6fHTd4t">Fourth, with an SMS text messaging tool, there can be many additional ways to tailor content.</s><s xml:id="_Y8WuzjS">The final version of the texting tool was developed to meet patient needs on an individual and personalized level.</s><s xml:id="_FPhRVhM">We did not tailor messages based on variables such as diagnosis, response tone, or response frequency as these needs were all addressed on an individual level with personalized texting rather than with large bulk SMS text messages to a larger group of patients.</s><s xml:id="_CUcGEpr">Future research with other SMS text messaging tools that emphasize bulk SMS text messages should consider other areas of tailoring such as tailoring based on disease type, length of sickness, response tone, preferred frequency, and time of day.</s><s xml:id="_mgmYsxa">Finally, with a typical texting tool, it is important to track the opt-in/opt-out of patient participants.</s><s xml:id="_kFCtnct">We did not track this measure for the text messaging tool on the latter prototypes as we relied on the opt-out measure for the CHECK program.</s><s xml:id="_yrxk29w">Future research should track both measures to accurately measure end-user differences on program preferences versus SMS text messaging tool preferences.</s></p></div>
