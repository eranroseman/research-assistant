personalized and tailored to the user; highly structured; semi-self-guided to fully self-guided; interactive; enhanced by graphics, animations, audio, and video; and often able to provide follow-up and feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KKDety2">The advantage of making treatment available to people with Internet access at any time and any location is considerable.</s><s xml:id="_kHfMzKf">Online treatments can reduce traditional face-to-face treatment barriers (i.e., inconvenience of scheduling appointments, missing work/school, traveling to and from a clinician's office) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, increase adherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, and reduce treatment time and costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_Rk9tZJt"><s xml:id="_Q8m5NWq">Although there has been a recent proliferation of Internet health interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>, there has been no published theoretical model underlying these programs.</s><s xml:id="_UF5q8Ar">The field needs a model of Internet interventions to help: (1) describe (and explain) how behaviors change and symptoms improve through use of Internet interventions; <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> guide program development and facilitate testing of the intervention; and (3) firmly establish this method of treatment with a theoretical foundation.</s><s xml:id="_fMFbemR">To address this void, we have developed a model of behavior change and symptom improvement using Internet interventions.</s></p><p xml:id="_gfVG8jw"><s xml:id="_JRHTvZV">Although the words are often used interchangeably, the term "model" should be distinguished from "theory."</s><s xml:id="_N5AVURT">While theories help explain or predict events by illustrating the relationships among a set of variables, models pull from a number of theories and other models to help explain a particular problem in a specific setting or context <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_J6pNfex">As is often true with models, our model of behavior change through an Internet intervention is informed by multiple theories, as well as empirical findings and clinical experience.</s><s xml:id="_NNNkc97">No single theory or model fits all cases, and many theories will overlap as they predict the route to symptom improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_y5Xwq6h">Using models will help us better understand both behavior and symptoms, allowing us to translate our empirical findings into useful strategies for improving health outcomes.</s></p><p xml:id="_cVPXhYj"><s xml:id="_wEBmuKw">In designing this Internet intervention model, multiple theories from numerous disciplines were integrated to help conceptualize behavior change, measure the change, and identify the factors that might contribute to symptom improvement.</s><s xml:id="_hjNBgRz">Specifically, this model combines information from theories of motivation, other psychological models, social marketing/advertising strategies, Web-based design/development techniques, information architecture and design, models of knowledge transfer and behavior change, and general research and clinical experience <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_uvE3Jpb">Although various books provide recommendations for effective website design <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, we are unaware of literature documenting how technology, specifically the Internet, can be used to promote behavior change and subsequent symptom improvement with an underlying theoretical model.</s><s xml:id="_f57fZaR">The Internet intervention model facilitates this goal by providing a framework to develop and test Internet interventions designed to promote symptom improvement, helping to conceptualize, identify, and measure factors that may determine behavior change and symptom improvement.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_ShZsMRh">The Internet Intervention Model</head><p xml:id="_DshksgS"><s xml:id="_htkJrEv">We hypothesize that effective Internet intervention programs will produce change in behaviors and reduce unwanted symptoms (as well as maintain improvement) via the following steps: the user, influenced by environmental factors, affects website use and adherence, which is influenced by support and website characteristics.</s><s xml:id="_vHhv6c5">Website use leads to behavior change via different mechanisms of change (e.g., knowledge and motivation).</s><s xml:id="_muaTkbz">Behavior change impacts physiology and target behaviors to bring about symptom improvement, and treatment maintenance helps users maintain these gains.</s><s xml:id="_Fwa3CjM">See Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">1</ref> for a depiction of these steps.</s></p><p xml:id="_MHtvFF3"><s xml:id="_qrjQf47">There are nine major components to the Internet Intervention Model (e.g., Website).</s><s xml:id="_Rq2A6C3">Each of these model components contain areas that can be observed, evaluated, and in many cases, manipulated (e.g., appearance).</s><s xml:id="_Cy7eGPE">The elements are the specific examples in each area (e.g., color usage, layout).</s><s xml:id="_aKMqAc2">Each of the major components will be presented along with the associated areas and elements.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_3VPjseN">User Characteristics</head><p xml:id="_ahJpH5E"><s xml:id="_HrJkxSW">The user (patient, research participant, consumer) of Internet interventions brings the most complicated and diverse set of variables or characteristics for evaluation.</s><s xml:id="_s3YpcHr">Some of the characteristics are fixed and cannot be manipulated, such as age or gender, but many can be modified (e.g., cognitive factors, beliefs and attitudes, and skills).</s><s xml:id="_jQU2K5b">In fact, these user characteristics may serve as predictor variables <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref> or be targeted for change along with the identified problem.</s><s xml:id="_Ef6nzJq">In addition, interventions can be tailored based on an individual user's characteristics.</s><s xml:id="_Dz6hzz6">For example, treatment recommendations could be matched to fit a particular user's stage of readiness to change.</s></p><p xml:id="_pDZ2nZp"><s xml:id="_wjkjv25">There are seven main areas of user characteristics incorporated into this model.</s><s xml:id="_cCbejEu">They include disease, including pathology and severity of the disease, and the problem being targeted; demographics, including age, gender, and socioeconomic status (SES); traits, including personality, temperament, and intelligence; cognitive factors, including cognitive style (verbal vs. visual), information processing, developmental stage, goal setting and pursuit, decision making, judgment, self-efficacy, knowledge, and self-regulatory strategies (e.g., planning); beliefs and attitudes, including treatment expectations, intentions, interest, motivation, readiness for change (stage of change), self-efficacy, and perceived benefits and barriers to treatment; physiological factors, including motor functioning; and skills related to both psychological mindedness and computer abilities.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_snFBhk7">Environment</head><p xml:id="_aMha9Ph"><s xml:id="_zQdbP6u">The environment is composed of multiple influences, including family/significant others/ friends, employer/organization/school, the health care system, community, and societal level influences, such as the media, policy and cultural factors.</s><s xml:id="_uEncrAB">The environment can provide support or serve as a barrier to individuals implementing a self-help treatment program <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_VtFechc">In the Internet intervention model, environmental factors, similar to Glasgow's "Pyramid of Influences," <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> can impact each component of the model in potentially significant ways.</s><s xml:id="_YPwGHqj">Environmental factors can influence user characteristics by shaping a user's knowledge or motivation to use this treatment approach.</s><s xml:id="_gKVGpeJ">Use of the website is partially determined by the support or hindrance of environmental factors such as level of ease accessing the Internet or family members encouraging or discouraging use.</s><s xml:id="_XpmJHWg">Change mechanisms can be influenced by the support of the user's school; for example, within a weight loss intervention, a school lunch program that makes nutritious lunches available can affect the motivation of obese children.</s></p><p xml:id="_txeYaJY"><s xml:id="_3MS48tw">Behavior change is also affected by environmental factors; family and the community can shape behaviors through positive or negative reinforcement.</s><s xml:id="_UBRnAPz">Symptom improvement can be influenced by changes in the user's surroundings that help to reduce significant symptoms.</s><s xml:id="_MWy3ad4">For example, in insomnia treatment, users are encouraged to examine environmental factors that may contribute to their sleep difficulties, such as noises (e.g., cars honking, loud music from neighbors) or extreme temperatures.</s><s xml:id="_GuRVkQc">Problematic sleep symptoms can be reduced if environmental triggers are identified and corrected.</s><s xml:id="_ad3zbTS">Finally, maintenance of treatment can be influenced by larger societal factors such as public policy.</s><s xml:id="_r4WpaAj">For example, laws restricting smoking can enhance smoking cessation outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_enqKXCw">Connections between environment and other components of the model can be identified, measured, and evaluated to provide critical information regarding the overall impact of the environment.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_NYQWBaP">Website</head><p xml:id="_BT5FcNh"><s xml:id="_N4XHhqK">The web program, or website, is the application by which the treatment is delivered.</s><s xml:id="_S5wCSQh">The website component is made up of eight main areas, including appearance, behavioral prescriptions, burdens, content, delivery, message, participation, and assessment.</s><s xml:id="_XpbfrHs">Together, these eight areas comprise how the application is developed and functions.</s><s xml:id="_jP83m3u">Each of these areas contains elements that can be manipulated and modified to provide the most robust treatment.</s><s xml:id="_upjdvFG">Although preliminary research has demonstrated the importance of some of these elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref>, additional work is necessary to determine the best use of each.</s><s xml:id="_tW8zyVD">However, determining an optimal set of elements is complicated by the wide range of intervention types, patient populations, computing systems, and technologies as different elements of varying degrees will likely be necessary depending on the program focus area.</s><s xml:id="_NEAEXQB">These elements dictate the development and use of an Internet intervention.</s></p><p xml:id="_QfSGVDs"><s xml:id="_6Z4tdJT">Appearance is simply the look and feel of the application.</s><s xml:id="_S5md3sx">Elements include use of color, page/ screen layout, organization of content, and screen size.</s><s xml:id="_hdxtVf5">This will, in part, dictate the program's appeal to the user.</s><s xml:id="_YagtGhb">Although this issue may seem unimportant, appearance may be critical as it likely encourages initial (and continued) use of the website and may increase overall engagement.</s></p><p xml:id="_T7WBcPD"><s xml:id="_gmZ3JfS">Behavioral prescriptions instruct the user on what to do to address the targeted problem.</s><s xml:id="_gN8xjvA">These prescriptions are part of the treatment and are also designed to increase commitment and boost adherence.</s><s xml:id="_V3v569Z">Behavioral contracts, concerning what the patient is willing to do (and when), and written instructions are known to enhance behavior change <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mApZGDS">Additionally, incorporating prompts to engage the user in the prescribed behaviors has also proved beneficial <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_92XsHtQ">Examples of such prompts include: automated e-mails sent to all users or users meeting certain conditions (e.g., those who failed to complete an assignment); personalized e-mails sent based on predetermined algorithms or from an individual (e.g., e-mails sent by a clinician when users endorse suicidal ideation); and phone calls triggered by the program or clinician.</s><s xml:id="_G9SzGhB">The use of prompts has significant potential, particularly given the possible integration of mobile phones, PDAs, pagers, and other wireless devices that can all be employed in the deliverance of prompts <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_D2eSWEr"><s xml:id="_eECRUP3">Burdens of using the website are different from the barriers to using the program specified in the environment section.</s><s xml:id="_qKVjAXH">Unlike barriers, burdens are specific to the content of the program and not the technological or environmental obstacles to accessing the Internet or to using the program.</s><s xml:id="_MP6peCq">This includes difficulty of use, covering issues such as poor application navigation and intervention length.</s><s xml:id="_nb5weDm">At this point, it is not clear how much content is necessary to impact behavior change.</s><s xml:id="_MzsAE9e">It is possible that only core components of a treatment are necessary to reduce symptoms, suggesting that developers and researchers might consider creating "short form" Internet interventions.</s><s xml:id="_jeh4FXh">It is also possible that, if the treatment is too long, users may not be able to persevere, potentially resulting in premature withdrawal and poor outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_fSdsmJe">Although intervention length may vary by the targeted problem, research focused on this area may help establish some general guidelines regarding amount of time individuals are willing to use these applications both on a per sitting, as well as total use, basis.</s></p><p xml:id="_y3DP2Qs"><s xml:id="_hceQGNe">Dismantling or deconstruction studies, where individual components of an intervention are examined to determine which components are producing the greatest impact, will be an important avenue of research.</s><s xml:id="_PaMUXxe">In fact, Internet interventions lend themselves perfectly to deconstruction studies given that the treatments are standardized and controlled.</s><s xml:id="_Etpm7xa">The ability to precisely provide only certain aspects of a treatment as a way of determining the critical treatment components sets this form of treatment apart from others.</s><s xml:id="_TehK2Ay">Identifying which core components of treatment are necessary for everyone, as well as determining which additional modules are needed by only some users, can help provide treatments that are more efficient, effective, and relevant.</s><s xml:id="_ssBgMPZ">Some researchers have already begun conducting these important deconstruction studies with computer and Internet-based programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[33]</ref>, and continued research could help lead to the discovery of findings rarely possible before this mode of delivery.</s></p><p xml:id="_G762Ncn"><s xml:id="_wa2c7G5">Content, the actual treatment information, of the website may be the single most important component of the program.</s><s xml:id="_GH9ZmDT">Without good content, it is unlikely that behavior would change or symptoms would improve.</s><s xml:id="_Z5bGWPT">Given that there is a significant amount of misinformation on the Internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[34]</ref>, providing accurate, clear, and simple information is critical to creating and delivering efficacious applications that will be well-received.</s></p><p xml:id="_UCvbB6k"><s xml:id="_RKb7vs8">The delivery area of the website component contains ways in which the content can be delivered.</s><s xml:id="_q5zXafC">These include using animations, audio (sound that either coincides with the screen text or sound that provides additional content), illustrations/graphics, text, video (recorded content of live or animated
