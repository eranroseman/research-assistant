<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_XfN7xgR">Adherence to eHealth Technologies</head><p xml:id="_F5RdKvU"><s xml:id="_C6ND6cQ">For eHealth technologies, several definitions for adherence can be identified in the existing literature.</s><s xml:id="_8JTnhd2">For example, Christensen et al defined adherence as "the degree to which individuals experience the content of the Internet intervention" <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fmHYJAe">However, the concept of "following the prescribed recommendations" (as implied by the WHO's definition) is missing from this definition.</s><s xml:id="_NM6aFEY">Therefore, Donkin et al referred to adherence as "the degree to which the user followed the program as it was designed" <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8BBwaYu">In accordance with the WHO definition of adherence, this definition contains the concept of intended use, or "the extent to which individuals should experience the content to derive maximum benefit from the intervention, as defined or implied by its creators" <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_aEezmb8">According to these definitions, the intended use is thus the minimum use to establish adherence.</s></p><p xml:id="_3uDJ6DY"><s xml:id="_UGVwkpu">Although adherence is related to other measures such as engagement or nonusage attrition, these terms do not refer to the same or inverse concepts.</s><s xml:id="_txxkJaF">After all, not using the technology as defined or implied by its creators does not necessarily mean that a participant is not using the technology at all (as implied by the definition of nonusage attrition) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_RFZcybk">Moreover, definitions of engagement usually incorporate the more subjective attributes of challenge, positive affect, endurability, and aesthetic and sensory appeals <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, whereas adherence is mostly based on measures for usage behavior.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_ryuGhPs">Determining Adherence</head><p xml:id="_FBd5ftA"><s xml:id="_rpgKJum">There is now increasing attention for studying the adherence rates and reasons for nonadherence in eHealth evaluations.</s><s xml:id="_TYTYkn2">However, it still can be a challenge to operationalize the intended use for individual eHealth technologies in a certain context.</s><s xml:id="_ZVfYMJt">In the pharmaceutical industry, the intended use (ie, agreed recommendations) is mostly based on the observed or rationalized working mechanisms and the dose-response curves of the medication for a certain condition.</s><s xml:id="_Pa4rqDf">As a result, the dosage of one particular medication can vary depending on (the severity of) the condition and the patient's characteristics (eg, age, gender, or weight).</s><s xml:id="_sGCm9BS">This is in contrast with many prior eHealth studies, which often assume that all users should experience all of the elements of a technology to obtain effects, and in which adherence is thus often operationalized as using everything the technology offers.</s><s xml:id="_uZnFvpG">However, a technology can be designed for multiple target groups and, depending on the individual user goals and the desired outcomes, technology can be used in many different ways in terms of the features that are used, as well as the frequency, time, and place of use <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mbWeumU">Furthermore, the amount of use that is needed to obtain the desired outcomes may vary a lot across different user groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2rGSfGJ">This implies that users do not always have to experience all of the available elements of a technology or have to use the same elements because usage goals may differ across users as well.</s><s xml:id="_E46AV3g">Moreover, individuals may also stop using the technology because they have reached their personal goals (early completers or e-attainers) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, and nonusage dropout is thus not always a consequence of losing interest (as stated by Eysenbach) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_Ttdcrak"><s xml:id="_c8dqZyn">To summarize, based on the definition of adherence, we suggest that the following three elements are necessary to determine adherence to eHealth technology: (1) the ability to measure the usage behavior of individuals; (2) an operationalization of intended use; and (3) an empirical, theoretical, or rational justification of the intended use.</s><s xml:id="_c5YvASa">However, to date, little is known about how to operationalize the intended usage of and thus the adherence to different types of eHealth technology.</s><s xml:id="_JGHmMJ7">Many systematic reviews gaining insight into adherence to eHealth technology focus on the extent to which individuals use different types of technology and what the reasons for nonadherence are, without a proper operationalization of intended use and adherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_grPhnkY">These reviews therefore fail to provide insight into how adherence and intended use have been operationalized.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_AWXQsH4">The Goal of the Review</head><p xml:id="_7wgkBbE"><s xml:id="_mrA7SMz">The goal of this systematic review was to improve evaluations of eHealth technologies by gaining insight into when, by whom, and how the concept of adherence has been used in previous eHealth evaluations, and finding a concise way to operationalize the adherence to and the intended use of different eHealth technologies.</s><s xml:id="_Byqb3pY">We do this by providing insight into how the usage of the technology was measured across previous studies; how adherence to different types of technologies (eg, structured interventions, patients platforms) was operationalized; and if and how the intended use of eHealth technologies has been justified with theory, evidence, or rationale.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_QduetV8">Principal Findings</head><p xml:id="_94aBthT"><s xml:id="_3UHFUQu">We included 62 studies in this review, all published after 2005.</s><s xml:id="_8V92ubN">The majority of the technologies described in these studies were structured or hybrid Web-based interventions targeting mental health (mostly cognitive behavioral therapy [CBT] interventions) or unstructured technologies for lifestyle support.</s></p><p xml:id="_fJun94k"><s xml:id="_5dEStBg">We observed a growing number of studies that studied adherence to eHealth technologies since Eysenbach's plea for reporting the levels of nonusage attrition with eHealth technology in 2005 <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_YCYbjP4">Although the "prescribed recommendations" or the intended use of a technology form an important element of the definition of adherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, and although there is evidence that users do not always have to complete an intervention to experience effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, half of all operationalizations are based on the assumption of "the more use, the better" and do not include a threshold for intended use.</s><s xml:id="_jdDR57J">Sometimes, we do not know (yet) what the intended use of a technology is, or defining the intended use is not necessary to answer the research question(s) of the study.</s><s xml:id="_KGzC5Mm">Then, a Category A operationalization suffices for answering the research questions.</s><s xml:id="_fxUkcA3">However, a Category A operationalization only refers to the actual usage of a technology without comparing it with its intended usage.</s><s xml:id="_Dz7zdAF">According to the definitions used, they should therefore not be referred to as adherence.</s></p><p xml:id="_byfQB9y"><s xml:id="_8ckAe4H">When the intended use for the technology was reported, only a minority of all included studies featured justified Category C operationalizations, making the comparison of adherence across different eHealth technologies more complicated.</s><s xml:id="_NKKmMvW">However, we were still able to observe a small increase in Category C operationalizations since 2015.</s></p><p xml:id="_3VpyyfY"><s xml:id="_RuTuwSq">Remarkably, the proportion of evaluations of mental health technologies reporting a justified (Category C) operationalization of intended use is lagging behind compared with evaluations of lifestyle and chronic care technologies.</s><s xml:id="_65XEnNB">This is unexpected because the majority of mental health technologies is based on (principles of) CBT, which is the most studied treatment for depression and has proven effective in many studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[79]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_QACUX49">However, a meta-analysis of Van Ballegooijen et al revealed that participants complete approximately 84% of their CBT program in both offline and online treatment.</s><s xml:id="_ZsPR2eK">Although a longer treatment duration is associated with better effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[80]</ref>, this still implies that users do not necessarily need to finish the complete program to experience reduction of their complaints, and that there should be a threshold for intended use.</s><s xml:id="_aU9kVuA">As such, it seems that this knowledge could be used to define and substantiate the intended use of a CBT technology, but in the studies included in this review, this notion has not been put into practice yet.</s></p><p xml:id="_SxJDz5e"><s xml:id="_uFTtPFk">We were also able to observe some interesting patterns in the composition of measures for adherence and intended use.</s><s xml:id="_wkzcKZB">When the operationalization of adherence consists of a combination of four or more measures, it is most likely a Category A operationalization, whereas most Category C operationalizations consist of one or two measures.</s><s xml:id="_9hM3v3j">This implies that for many Category A operationalizations, a scattershot approach was used when it comes to measuring adherence.</s><s xml:id="_DmCNbvJ">In contrast, the results indicated that justifications of intended use are often based on the goal of the technology and/or the assumed working mechanisms, leading to more focused operationalizations that do not require additional measurements to evaluate adherence to the technology.</s><s xml:id="_MDzTN6Y">In other words, more measures are not necessarily the key to knowledge if they are not sufficiently specific.</s></p><p xml:id="_aDknqAr"><s xml:id="_wwggH5C">No significant differences could be found between the kinds of measures that are used for all three levels of operationalizations.</s><s xml:id="_G5aAmB3">Category A operationalizations most often contain the number of modules that a user started or completed, the number of features accessed or used, and the time spent online.</s><s xml:id="_UHJV8vs">This seems obvious, as this level of operationalization is mostly used for structured or hybrid mental health interventions consisting of different modules that users have to follow.</s><s xml:id="_PNazfvt">Category C or justified operationalizations are more often defined by the number of days, weeks, or months that the technology is used by people.</s><s xml:id="_KqSVsYU">This can be explained by way of the finding that Category C operationalizations are used for a large proportion of unstructured and hybrid technologies.</s><s xml:id="_3dWpGtq">As people are able to use the features of these technologies more or less at their own convenience, the development of use over time would probably provide more information regarding adherence than use of the technology's content at fixed points in time only.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_r6KS556">Implications and Recommendations</head><p xml:id="_96GVfFR"><s xml:id="_hnhHzj9">An important reason for the lack of justifications for the intended use of eHealth technologies might be that there is a lack of knowledge regarding the working mechanisms of technology-based applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_kT24fcw">However, the included Category C operationalizations did show that knowledge of the working mechanisms of the technology is not a prerequisite for defining the intended use.</s><s xml:id="_eKVFGEJ">After all, the intended use or the "therapeutic dose" can be justified just as well using existing guidelines for healthy living and medication use <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b77">77]</ref> or using previous research regarding other technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[75,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">76]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tJsfupB">Moreover, the intended use has also been operationalized by linking the (positive) outcomes of individual users to their usage patterns to find the most effective patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[78]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_srZE4Jx"><s xml:id="_GjkHCbm">The fact that we did not find a justification of intended use based on existing models for behavior change was unexpected.</s><s xml:id="_7JSrN8t">For instance, Kaushal and Rhodes found that exercising for at least four times per week for 6 weeks is a minimal requirement for establishing exercise habits <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[81]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gUpAhtq">These kind of findings can also be used for determining intended use; for example, a user of a technology to improve physical activity is adherent when using (specific elements of) the technology at least four times a week and 6 weeks in a row.</s></p><p xml:id="_eFArDe6"><s xml:id="_fphNEq7">Another example comes from Kelders et al who found that a group of users dropped out from an intervention for reducing depressive complaints after a lesson that focused on applying newly acquired skills in practice, as doing so can be confrontational <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tx8XmyJ">However, following this lesson can also be seen as an important precondition for gaining effects from using the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_8rcMxvg">The intended use of this intervention could thus be operationalized as following the intervention until that critical lesson is completed at the very least.</s><s xml:id="_UkP6SN8">An important aspect of operationalizing the intended use of a technology is therefore to keep the goal of the technology and the desired outcomes in mind.</s><s xml:id="_dFkrJeF">What use is necessary at minimum to reach that goal (eg, to experience certain effects or establish new skills and habits), and how can we translate this into measures for adherence?</s></p><p xml:id="_T4umMxK"><s xml:id="_a2guafV">Although it has previously been suggested that a combination of a range of different variables for technology usage provides a more meaningful measure of adherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, the results of this review show that a limited but deliberate set of only one or two different measures in accordance with the goal of the technology can also be used for operationalizing intended use.</s><s xml:id="_a6KmZam">At the moment, eHealth evaluations often fail to demonstrate the dose-response relationship (the usage that is minimally needed to experience certain effects) or simply define it as "the more use, the better."</s><s xml:id="_QmsQ7yP">However, the results of this review indicate that Category A and B operationalizations of adherence often do not take the characteristics of the technology (eg, goal, persuasiveness, and user-friendliness) into account.</s><s xml:id="_PmU4YcC">It is thus very possible that dose-response relationships might become more apparent when the measures used to operationalize adherence match the goal of the technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[82,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">83]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_a9nWffK"><s xml:id="_bqp3zxG">All of the measures for adherence in this review are based on data regarding technology usage.</s><s xml:id="_Mtt5mT3">However, the results of a recent literature review of theoretical perspectives on adherence showed that adherence is a multidimensional concept, influenced by a range of technological, environmental, and individual factors altogether that cannot be evaluated by technology usage alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b84">84]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_sqv2yR8">Therefore, additional measures are needed to determine whether and why users are or have been adherent to technology.</s><s xml:id="_aeEKd49">For example, a mixed-methods approach that combines usage data with questionnaires, health measurements, and/or interviews could provide important knowledge regarding why people do or do not use the technology, how people learn from using the technology, the minimal use that is needed for users to experience certain effects or to reach certain goals, and how the skills acquired while using the technology are then applied in daily life.</s><s xml:id="_ZWzDS9T">These outcomes could then in turn be used for determining the intended use of the technology and translating that concept into concrete measures for evaluating adherence.</s></p><p xml:id="_YAbAbUF"><s xml:id="_yqze5UP">In their review, Donkin et al state that it is difficult to compare adherence with different technologies when the measures that are used across the different trials vary <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_kNFqyHM">However, this statement is based on Category A operationalizations of adherence where more use is better.</s><s xml:id="_TVcxgV3">When using Category B or (preferably) Category C operationalizations, the actual usage of each individual can be compared with the technology's intended usage.</s><s xml:id="_P84Drps">In turn, the percentage of people who adhered to the intervention can be calculated, making adherence a more objective and standardized concept <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_CrpTYvN">This approach simplifies the comparison of adherence across technologies with the same goal (eg, improving physical activity) but different technology characteristics (eg, features of the technology, persuasiveness, and user-friendliness) and a different operationalization of intended use.</s><s xml:id="_3J7ymU8">At the same time, this approach also simplifies the comparison of adherence of different users of a specific technology.</s><s xml:id="_qQRdJBC">Ideally, when individuals have different goals for using a technology, they should also have an individual intended usage, which could be used to get more fine-grained, personalized measures of adherence.</s><s xml:id="_qJvnxJf">This will be of added value for both developers and researchers, as this approach will provide better insight into how adherence to the various elements of different technologies contributed to the outcomes that are found, and for whom.</s></p></div>
