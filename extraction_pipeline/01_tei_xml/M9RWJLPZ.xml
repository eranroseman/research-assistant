Hemodialysis facilities may increase the risk of COVID-19 transmission and other respiratory droplet infections because each patient is in frequent, close contact with other patients and HCPs: most dialysis centers are large spaces without separation between patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KbUTGYN">The efficiency of transmission in this setting is also increased by the fact that a small team of HCPs usually attends to a larger set of patients, and that dialysis unit HCPs are difficult to replace due to their specialized skills.</s><s xml:id="_PK5SPyN">Furthermore, patients undergoing dialysis experience additional healthcare exposures beyond their usual hemodialysis center.</s><s xml:id="_jAyRX4F">For example, patients on dialysis are frequently hospitalized and often reside in nursing homes <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_abvdmTg">In addition to acquiring COVID-19, dialysis patients may be at greater risk of developing more severe cases as they often suffer from many chronic diseases, e.g., diabetes and hypertension, that have been linked to greater COVID-19 morbidity and mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_QCTWp9t"><s xml:id="_p69fVVA">This paper explores the effectiveness of simple, practical, and low-cost non-pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) in reducing the spread of COVID-19 in one specific healthcare setting: the outpatient dialysis unit.</s><s xml:id="_YyNf3KM">Our work uses computational modeling and discrete-event simulations to evaluate the effectiveness of six specific simple, low-cost NPIs in reducing the spread of COVID-19 in a dialysis unit.</s><s xml:id="_2CNTfrP">Our high-fidelity simulations are based on fine-grained HCP movement and interaction data collected in an outpatient hospital dialysis unit at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics (UIHC).</s><s xml:id="_aQV5nPP">We have used this data in previous work, wherein we have simulated the spread of Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in a dialysis unit and investigated the effectiveness of interventions such as architectural changes to the unit <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_MmU3PnB">In this work, we test the candidate NPIs both alone and in combination, using a set of disease models that represent alternate possibilities of how COVID-19 is transmitted and unfolds.</s><s xml:id="_3FZbaaR">The NPIs under study are: (i) voluntary self-isolation; (ii) active syndromic surveillance and compulsory isolation; (iii) the use of masks (HCPs, patients) and/or N95 respirators (HCPs); (iv) improved social distancing among HCPs; (v) increased physical separation between dialysis stations; and (vi) patient isolation combined with the preemptive isolation of exposed HCPs.</s><s xml:id="_caPzwnq">A description of these NPIs appears in the section Methods: NPIs.</s></p><p xml:id="_SARAZZR"><s xml:id="_EVnHk8K">As we evaluate these NPIs, we focus not just on their effect on COVID-19 spread, but also on the cost of implementing these NPIs.</s><s xml:id="_EGVxf4N">For the NPIs we consider, cost can be measured by the number or HCPs temporarily replaced and the duration of this replacement, the number of N95 respirators used and the duration of this usage, and the number of dialysis patients sent to isolation unit.</s><s xml:id="_5KAQ5N6">The main takeaway from our work is that even though under pre-COVID-19 usage conditions COVID-19 can have near-100% attack rate in the dialysis unit within 30 days of the first agent becoming infected, it is possible to design and implement a low-cost NPI bundle that leads to a substantial reduction in the attack rate and likelihood of COVID-19 spread in the dialysis unit.</s></p></div>

time window.</s><s xml:id="_mx7MuJK">This process identifies, for every dialysis chair some time windows as the start/end times of patient dialysis sessions.</s><s xml:id="_erYGBDC">This process is described in more detail in <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Htjv2A5">Moreover, because data were collected anonymously thereby precluding linkage across multiple days, our simulations rely on repeating a single day's data to create a 30 day simulation.</s></p><p xml:id="_FsCNuYR"><s xml:id="_w6RPXxN">Our system for imputing dialysis sessions detected between 13 and 20
