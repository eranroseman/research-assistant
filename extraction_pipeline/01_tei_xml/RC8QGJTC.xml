that can be understood partly in terms of well-known theoretical models and specific substantive constructs, it is also the case that the measurement of adherence and the context of research are important determinants of research findings.</s><s xml:id="_yUQyEGE">As hypothesized, these data show that higher levels of adherence are achieved with more circumscribed regimens (medication as opposed to pervasive health behaviors) as well as in situations in which patients have greater resources (such as education and income), but not simply as a function of illness severity or the demographic characteristics of age and gender.</s><s xml:id="_C3FnHbc">This research also shows that, as predicted, methodologic factors such as whether adherence is measured objectively or subjectively and the contextual factors surrounding the research such as its recency and the specific disease and population under study have noteworthy effects on the results.</s><s xml:id="_HyXKtDe">These findings underscore the idea that adherence might not be a unified construct and that although the general notion of adherence might be useful, what is learned from its study is affected by the decisions made about its research design.</s></p><p xml:id="_nD5WYeT"><s xml:id="_KuGzMGZ">Of course, there are limitations to the present work and caveats to its interpretation.</s><s xml:id="_cWVGZgR">The search strategy could have missed some relevant studies such as those catalogued primarily by disease condition, and this meta-analysis excludes adherence

significant results could have a greater likelihood of publication (although the "fail-safe n" corrects for this potential) and researchers could even conduct studies only on diseases or regimens for which certain results are expected (eg, problematic adherence rates, correlations with certain demographics).</s><s xml:id="_HE3jcEP">The conceptualization and measurement of adherence have changed over 50 years, and although some of that change has been documented and analyzed here, some may have affected conclusions in ways not yet understood.</s><s xml:id="_St6g75f">Unlike large-scale multidimensional studies, moderator variables are examined primarily across studies (and rarely within them).</s><s xml:id="_nrzNQg7">Interaction among these categories cannot be studied (eg, certain
