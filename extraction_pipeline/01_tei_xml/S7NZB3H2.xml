(b) to examine the associations between SRPs and OCD-related functional impairment, family accommodation (FA), parental distress, comorbid disorders, and current use of medication; and (c) to examine whether SRPs predict poorer response to intensive CBT at posttreatment and at 3-month follow-up.</s><s xml:id="_UtaQQxN">It was hypothesized that (a) SRPs would be high among youth with OCD and more frequently endorsed by females, younger versus older children, and those with higher comorbidity; (b) SRPs would be associated with baseline anxiety and depressive symptoms, internalizing and externalizing problems, OCD severity and impairment, FA and parental distress; (c) SRPs would uniquely predict increased baseline OCD severity and functional impairment, after controlling for age, FA, comorbid internalizing and externalizing symptoms; and (d) SRPs would predict poorer treatment response at posttreatment and at 3-month followup, after controlling for baseline OCD severity, age, FA, comorbid internalizing and externalizing symptoms.</s></p></div>

Mindell, 2008)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_68rHsbq">Moreover, youth with OCD and a comorbid anxiety disorder, compared to youth with OCD without a comorbid anxiety disorder, were more likely to report feeling overtired.</s><s xml:id="_vXhejKm">Previous findings suggest that anxious youth experience more SRPs and increased pre-sleep arousal due to thoughts and worries <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Alfano et al., 2010)</ref>, which may impact sleep initiation, quality of sleep, and, thus, tiredness the following day.</s></p><p xml:id="_PXmzdpZ"><s xml:id="_mxugvuw">As noted above, it was found that more baseline SRPs were associated with greater OCD-related functional impairment and internalizing problems.</s></p><p xml:id="_xYZrHPb"><s xml:id="_jgtSQsW">These findings are consistent with prior literature demonstrating the co-occurrence of SRPs with anxiety and mood disorders in pediatric community samples <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Gregory &amp; O'Connor, 2002)</ref>, and clinical populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Caporino et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_vYE9XSx">However, no significant associations were found between SRPs and OCD symptom severity, externalizing problems, FA or parental distress.</s><s xml:id="_mTgSgCX">These findings may be partially due to the low prevalence of externalizing disorders relative to internalizing disorders.</s><s xml:id="_Xmbfcjm">Furthermore, SRPs were not found to be significant predictors of baseline OCD severity and functional impairment.</s><s xml:id="_DxuXkt5">Although inconsistent with existing pediatric OCD studies, it should be noted that the current study controlled for the effect of age, internalizing and externalizing problems, as well as FA, while prior studies did not.</s><s xml:id="_Af8ex2A">Unsurprisingly, FA was found as the strongest predictor of both OCD severity and OCD-related impairment, followed by internalizing problems.</s><s xml:id="_AZ2PzpQ">Given the strong association found between SRPs and internalizing problems in prior literature (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Ivarsson &amp; Larsson, 2009)</ref>, it would seem that SRPs  may be more strongly associated with comorbid internalizing conditions rather than OCD.</s></p><p xml:id="_7t6KeAF"><s xml:id="_Pv997x3">Finally, baseline SRPs was not an independent predictor of treatment response at posttreatment 3month follow-up.</s><s xml:id="_RwcvYr9">It was somewhat surprising that none of the other OCD-related factors emerged as significant independent predictors of poorer treatment outcomes, as numerous empirical studies describe these factors as significant predictors of treatment outcomes in youth with OCD (for a review, see <ref type="bibr">Öst et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_JbdrZjq">However, the CBT-ERP treatment used in the current study was more intensive than the CBT-ERP used in previous trials.</s><s xml:id="_KSvFxEM">In line with prior research, the current study found a positive effect of intensive CBT-ERP on OCD and a trend towards ongoing improvement in the months following CBT; with 76% of youth classified as treatment responders and 32% remitters at posttreatment, and 49% responders and 63% remitters at 3 months follow-up.</s><s xml:id="_ZrgZMKg">These findings suggest that intensive CBT-ERP may be more robust to baseline predictors of response relative to weekly CBT <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Rudy et al., 2014)</ref>; however, future randomized controlled trials are needed to examine this empirical question.</s></p></div>
