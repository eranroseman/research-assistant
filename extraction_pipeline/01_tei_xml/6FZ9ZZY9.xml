<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_MaV8mEg">Concluding Remarks</head><p xml:id="_GxhX9Rr"><s xml:id="_fVsSqjD">The present theoretical formulation orders variations in the level of behavioral changes produced by different modes of treatment; it accounts for behavioral variations displayed by individuals receiving the same type of treatment; and it predicts performance successes at the level of individual tasks during and after treatment.</s><s xml:id="_x2cy8Wy">It is possible to generate alternative explanations for particular subsets of data, but the mechanism proposed in the present theory appears to account equally well for the different sets of findings.</s><s xml:id="_8D6cwhR">It might be argued, for example, that self-efficacy proved to be an accurate predictor of performance in the enactive mode of treatment because subjects were simply judging their future performance from their past behavior.</s><s xml:id="_yMBj4TT">However, an interpretation of this type has no explanatory value for the vicarious and emotive treatments, in which perceived selfefficacy was an equally accurate predictor of performance although subjects engaged in no overt behavior.</s><s xml:id="_et8HyGN">Even in the enactive treatment, perceived self-efficacy proved to be a better predictor of behavior toward unfamiliar threats than did past performance.</s><s xml:id="_Vj9KRWn">Moreover, self-efficacy derived from partial enactive mastery during the course of treatment predicted performance on stressful tasks that the individuals had never done before.</s></p><p xml:id="_aFBqNgJ"><s xml:id="_wfS7sXS">As an alternative explanation, one could invoke a superordinate mediator that controls both efficacy expectations and behavior.</s><s xml:id="_84vmBaK">Although such a possibility is not inconceivable, the mediator would have to be an exceedingly complex one to account adequately for the diverse sets of relationships.</s><s xml:id="_b4Camkp">To cite but a few examples, it would have to affect differentially efficacy expectations and be-havior resulting from maximal enactive mastery; somehow, it would have to produce different levels of self-efficacy from equivalent reductions in emotional arousal; and it would have to generate some variation in efficacy expectations from similar partial mastery experiences.</s><s xml:id="_b8e8Hcj">The theory presented here posits a central processor of efficacy information.</s><s xml:id="_EB3Dt3p">That is, people process, weigh, and integrate diverse sources of information concerning their capability, and they regulate their choice behavior and effort expenditure accordingly.</s></p><p xml:id="_Xg5jxbq"><s xml:id="_ucJkXg3">Evidence that people develop somewhat different efficacy expectations from similar enactive mastery and fear extinction warrants comment.</s><s xml:id="_eFen7XX">One possible explanation for the variance is in terms of differential cognitive processing of efficacy information.</s><s xml:id="_keeYt4s">To the extent that individuals differ in how they cognitively appraise their arousal decrements and behavioral attainments, their percepts of self-efficacy will vary to some degree.</s><s xml:id="_gvKyd9v">A second possibility concerns the multiple determination of self-efficacy.</s><s xml:id="_FFWweTY">Because people have met with different types and amounts of efficacy-altering experiences, providing one new source of efficacy information would not be expected to affect everyone uniformly.</s><s xml:id="_Ts3Q5hf">Thus, for example, extinguishing arousal to threats will enhance self-efficacy, but more so in individuals whose past coping attempts have occasionally succeeded than in those who have consistently failed.</s></p><p xml:id="_GhPXZsE"><s xml:id="_vJ98BbK">The research completed thus far has tested the predictive power of the conceptual scheme for efficacy expectations developed through enactive, vicarious, and emotive-based procedures.</s><s xml:id="_eUZfPrj">Additional tests of the generality of this approach need to be extended to efficacy expectations arising from verbal persuasion and from other types of treatments aimed at reducing emotional arousal.</s></p><p xml:id="_amMhfF4"><s xml:id="_kU7fERv">Cognitive processing of efficacy information, which is an important component function in the proposed theory, is an especially relevant area for research.</s><s xml:id="_kpmM6qd">A number of factors were identified as influencing the cognitive appraisal of efficacy information conveyed by each of the major sources of selfefficacy.</s><s xml:id="_BUauFKA">Previous research from a number of different perspectives demonstrating that some of these factors affect attitudinal and behavioral changes has suggestive value.</s><s xml:id="_WcmsKcT">But it is investigations that include assessment of the intervening self-efficacy link that can best provide validity for the present theory.</s></p><p xml:id="_pUNjV2c"><s xml:id="_vPvXKgG">The operative process involved in the relationship between efficacy expectations and action also requires further investigation.</s><s xml:id="_ps4yrrr">It will be recalled that efficacy expectations are presumed to influence level of performance by enhancing intensity and persistence of effort.</s><s xml:id="_gbsWNJk">In the preceding experiments, the behavioral tasks were ordered in level of difficulty and subjects either persisted in their efforts until they completed all of the tasks or they quit at varying points along the way.</s><s xml:id="_9frH8Qa">The number of tasks successfully completed reflects degree of perseverance.</s><s xml:id="_YaEuxcS">As a further step toward elucidating the intervening process, it would be of interest to measure the intensity and duration of effort subjects exert in attempts to master arduous or insoluble tasks as a function of the level and strength of their efficacy expectations.</s><s xml:id="_YUss5Hy">Further research on the processes postulated in the present theoretical formulation should increase our understanding of the relationship between cognitive and behavioral change.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p xml:id="_eq7H2Bu"><s xml:id="_FCGza3G">Figure 1.</s><s xml:id="_q8egY4K">Diagrammatic representation of the difference between efficacy expectations and outcome expectations.</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
