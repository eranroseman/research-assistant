<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_DxZAbrF">Introduction</head><p xml:id="_77hkBM3"><s xml:id="_Tw4gCNC">Evidence-based psychological interventions are a mainstay of the treatment approach to mental disorders in most developed health-care systems (as recommended, for example, by the American Psychological Association <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> and UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence 2 ).</s><s xml:id="_G9NqtXq">However, the effects of psychological interventions could be culturally specific. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s xml:id="_Z4duY2E">Both the conceptualisation and the treatment of mental disorders are arguably best understood in a culturally specific frame of reference. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s xml:id="_mrEyDk5">onfucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism have fundamentally shaped Chinese culture, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> which is characterised by strong collectivism and emphasises social hierarchy, including respect for authority and filial piety. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s xml:id="_hcZJVeC">These cultural values have shaped Chinese conceptualisations and manifestations of mental health problems (eg, the notion of integrating body and mind proposed in Taoism might mean that Chinese people are more likely to somatise mental health symptoms). <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s xml:id="_KEzfSMF">As a result, help-seeking from mental health services might be lower among Chinese populations than other ethnic groups, leading to more severe clinical profiles at treatment initiation and an increased likelihood of poor treatment outcomes or treatment dropout. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s xml:id="_f7rMAmP">Therefore, psychological interventions developed in North America and western Europe that are grounded in Western epistemological and philosophical traditions might be culturally incongruent for people of Chinese descent (ie, ethnic Chinese populations) living in China or around the world, who might have a different cultural and social context. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s xml:id="_uFWsqKA">For example, assertiveness is a component of some evidence-based interventions developed in North America and western Europe, but there is no equivalent term in Chinese. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s xml:id="_PP57265">ultural adaptation has been defined as the systematic modification of evidence-based interventions to consider language, culture, and context so that the interventions are congruent with the cultural background of service users. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s xml:id="_YtsMpRv">Substantial efforts have been made to understand and assess culturally adapted psychological interventions to improve outcomes in diverse ethnic groups. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s xml:id="_GWt8pr8">vidence from systematic reviews and meta-analyses <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> suggests that these adaptations have been successful, but a lack of consensus on describing or categorising the different types of cultural adaptations that have been implemented has hindered understanding of which types of adaptation might be the most beneficial.</s><s xml:id="_sgHAXKS">Furthermore, these analyses have combined adaptations for different cultures, meaning that differences between cultures might be missed.</s><s xml:id="_MPUrjKd">Several cultural adaptation frameworks have been developed to address the lack of consensus, notably the ecological validity model from Bernal and colleagues. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s xml:id="_mHHbpNU">A meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> used the eight dimensions (ie, language, persons, metaphors, content, concepts, goals, methods, and context) of the ecological validity model to assess the level of cultural adaptation of minimally guided interventions for common mental disorders, and noted increasing intervention effect sizes with increasing numbers of dimensions adapted.</s></p><p xml:id="_YuBbg3r"><s xml:id="_FrPt27k">A conceptual typology drawing on common factors shared across psychological interventions and competence frameworks has been developed on the basis of cultural adaptations reported in previous studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref></s><s xml:id="_cbUrpXZ">This typology incorporates important service-level adaptations (ie, service design and delivery considerations) beyond the psychological intervention itself, and it has been associated with improved clinical outcomes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s xml:id="_JsANXej">In this Article, we are adopting this typology to distinguish therapist-related (eg, changes to support the development of the therapeutic relationship, such as ethnic matching of therapists to service users, whereby service users are matched with therapists of the same ethnicity), content-related (eg, cultural modifications of the use of terms in materials and resources), and organisational (eg, changes to service design and provision) adaptations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s xml:id="_WEeDsge">nother approach to providing culturally adapted treatment is the development of culturally specific interventions informed by alternative cultural, philosophical, or religious beliefs that address culturally specific issues. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref></s><s xml:id="_eXemSNK">The core principles
