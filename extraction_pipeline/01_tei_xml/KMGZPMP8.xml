encompassing both the inpatient and outpatient setting.</s><s xml:id="_2VgQs5H">These data suggest that infants who experience increases in air pollutants primarily associated with traffic (CO, NO 2 , and NO) were more likely to have a clinical encounter for bronchiolitis.</s><s xml:id="_GdKRYSP">These pollutant-based estimates are supported by the use of the crude measure of road proximity: a higher risk was also observed in association with very close residential proximity to major highways (within 50 m).</s><s xml:id="_5kPA6fV">Increased exposure to SO 2 was also associated with a very modest increase in risk.</s><s xml:id="_EUuxVyU">Primary sources of SO 2 in this region include point source industrial emissions and marine vessels.</s><s xml:id="_8GzbCrY">Similarly, a higher

relationship between ozone concentrations and fine particulate matter was considered a likely explanation for this finding and, in those studies, the ozone effect did not persist in two pollutant models that included both ozone and PM 2.5 .</s><s xml:id="_K24JmUx">A similar argument can be made in the region of this study where ozone is negatively correlated with the other pollutants investigated.</s><s xml:id="_KFb8TNn">The Pearson correlation coefficients of ozone and the other pollutants range from 20.24 (for PM 10 ) to 20.86 (for NO).</s><s xml:id="_QzjCxnK">The correlation for ozone and CO, the latter being the pollutant most strongly associated with an adverse effect on bronchiolitis in our study, was 20.82.</s><s xml:id="_dsRPHsP">Nonetheless, it remains unclear why the relationship of ozone in our data was positive (increased risk but notsignificant) for hospitalization but negative (decreased risk) for the combined outcome measure that included outpatient encounters.</s><s xml:id="_xJ59xhq">None of the other pollutants showed this pattern, and this may be due to chance alone.</s><s xml:id="_2VUjtHq">An alternative explanation would be if the specificity of the true associated health outcome is maximized in the summer high ozone months due to a specifically summertime viral etiology (or other summer-specific factors).</s><s xml:id="_KU2gzPg">Also, our study was based on spatial variability in infant exposures, and much of the variability in our population's exposure to ozone is temporal.</s><s xml:id="_5zh5ZSn">In addition, the greatest spatial contrasts in ozone in our region occur in areas of moderate population density, so a small proportion of our population experiences the highest exposures.</s><s

xml:id="_KeCqUX8">This observation may reflect an increased importance of air pollution as a risk factor for less-severe cases, whereas, for hospitalized cases, other key risk factors overshadow the modest air-pollution impact.</s><s xml:id="_pHR2Y2d">Alternatively, because by necessity the identification of outpatient clinical encounters was based on less-specific ICD9 coding, the effect observed could be attributed to an air-pollution effect on other lessspecific respiratory outcomes that were not specifically bronchiolitis but coded as 466 (acute bronchitis and bronchiolitis) such as other early childhood lower respiratory tract diagnoses with similar clinical presentations including asthma and bacterial bronchitis.</s><s xml:id="_Sf2kBYe">We have previously evaluated use of these nonspecifically coded outpatient clinical encounters in infancy and found support of their use as a proxy for identifying acute bronchiolitis.</s><s xml:id="_QhsKpYn">For example, these encounters mirror the seasonality and age distribution associated with acute bronchiolitis in the first year of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ejdNtF3">In addition, although this lack of diagnostic specificity is a limitation in assessing the relationship between air pollution and bronchiolitis in these data per se, they are still meaningful.</s><s xml:id="_aHu8VDe">This is because the observed risks with the less-specific ICD9 466 reflect a health care utilization-public health burden related to ambient air pollution.</s></p><p xml:id="_cCwaVJS"><s xml:id="_U9AP29a">In this analysis, as well as in a related study of these air pollutants on birth outcomes, we observed risk estimates based on the monitor-based estimates of

study, the exposure estimates from LUR and the monitoring network data for the same pollutant were only moderately correlated (r 5 0.5-0.6).</s><s xml:id="_jNk2geJ">We discuss this in the birth
