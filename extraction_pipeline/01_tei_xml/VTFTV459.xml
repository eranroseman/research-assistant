( <ref type="formula">2021</ref>) found a similar phenomenon: Spanish-speaking women were highly interested in participating in fitness apps, yet the apps were unavailable in their primary language, making it user-friendly to only those well-versed in English.</s></p><p xml:id="_Sv3vXYq"><s xml:id="_3jYw5gY">Digital health continues to be ableist throughout our society, with limited to no accessibility options.</s><s xml:id="_WJvqHnG">Bunyi et al. provide several examples of ways to promote accessibility.</s><s xml:id="_5Bjs8W6">For example, those who are deaf need in-app captions.</s><s xml:id="_KtH8gBJ">Minimal apps offer this feature.</s><s xml:id="_GChcgnu">Also, those on psychiatric medications could experience various side effects like tremors, memory impairments, and blurry vision.</s><s xml:id="_AXg9e57">Most apps have text-heavy content, small print, and overanimation.</s><s xml:id="_YCN5c7k">This can be challenging, both visually and mentally, for many people.</s><s xml:id="_mJEtMrS">This article highlighted three areas of improvement that combat ableism: standards, research, and recognition.</s><s xml:id="_K2vEr4p">It explains that we must continue making strides to challenge and change digital health standards.</s><s xml:id="_aWHzSrT">Standards must be remade that is inclusive of all populations.</s><s xml:id="_NG7Vpk6">Likewise, we must highlight the research being done into digital health delivery.</s><s xml:id="_eqz8UTW">Healthcare delivery must be measured with diverse populations.</s><s xml:id="_5My2JcK">The only way we will change how digital health delivery is by creating new ways that are inclusive and equitable.</s><s xml:id="_qAxZwXv">Finally, we must transition our healthcare delivery to include user feedback.</s><s xml:id="_JqvuVFD">By recognizing user feedback, we create healthcare delivery methods that work for individuals vs. guessing what would work best for them.</s></p><p xml:id="_tPYZSkj"><s xml:id="_Q9CQuGE">Since the 1970s, manufacturing has shifted from engineercentered to user-centered designs (Stiles-Shields et al.).</s><s xml:id="_4GhkxNX">Popular models for designing and deploying digital health technologies integrate human-centered design methodologies.</s><s xml:id="_ck6vdr9">These methodologies offer opportunities for users to contribute to developing technologies by co-designing and evaluating.</s><s xml:id="_yqz5gzZ">Humancentered designs are an effective method for technology development and promote usability with the general population.</s><s xml:id="_ESFSTyU">However, some groups do not experience high levels of usability as they are commonly not involved in human-centered design or testing.</s><s xml:id="_RyKUrF4">For example, many technologies are developed for younger populations without input from these young individuals.</s><s xml:id="_vkm3bDV">Even adults aged 65+ increasingly use technologies that are not adequately designed for them.</s><s xml:id="_VKFDeBW">For example, smartwatches offer the opportunity to track steps and heart rates.</s><s xml:id="_Wc7YSs9">They also monitor sleep, among many other things.</s><s xml:id="_VzCrsHp">As people age, a normal aging process is thinning the skin.</s><s xml:id="_RYFEHjf">Wearing a smartwatch that is not sensitive to thin skin may lead to cuts or bruises.</s></p><p xml:id="_sYg4enP"><s xml:id="_ttK4Bza">Incorporating a participatory human-centered design with users from populations who experience health disparities may help facilitate engagement and decrease unanticipated, technologygenerated inequalities.</s><s xml:id="_SnJvYWm">Using feedback from intended users may minimize the gap between creating an intervention for someone and creating an intervention with someone.</s><s xml:id="_cVePj2W">It allows us to work handin-hand with intended users to create user-friendly and relevant interventions that people want to engage with.</s><s xml:id="_8ZhP842">This approach shifts the focus from the idea of "expert" or professionally driven design "for" the users to designing "with" users collaboratively (Porche, et al.) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ZrCtYCY">Co-design can reduce potential harm or misuse by including people from vulnerable communities in decision-making (Porche et al.) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_uSEwyky">This allows local knowledge and expertise from marginalized voices to inform the development of more culturally relevant, trusted solutions.</s></p><p xml:id="_kVdQcKq"><s xml:id="_trSw2M5">Several studies show success with participatory human-centered interventions.</s><s xml:id="_qxHfmST">Open2Chat is a stigma-free space for young people to articulate their concerns, share opinions and experiences with a peer, and discuss the idea of professional counseling or psychotherapy <ref type="bibr">(Mittmann et al.)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EVARV5x">The results of this study showed value in codevelopment, like Open2Chat.</s><s xml:id="_BfYYdG5">Another study focused on a participatory human-centered design intervention for youth and families.</s><s xml:id="_r2EPXSK">This study pertained to mental health support, focusing on ways to boost self-determination.</s><s xml:id="_C9wfgNF">This intervention empowered participants to be informed and involved in their own treatment plans <ref type="bibr">(Porche et al.)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_YwuhQM2">It also found that participatory humancentered design interventions created greater trust and safety among all parties involved.</s><s xml:id="_ur8hDD9">This fostered a more profound collaboration and community among users and researchers.</s></p><p xml:id="_6vZGFW7"><s xml:id="_YQ5SVHa">The results of these articles show a mix of benefits and concerns regarding digital health.</s><s xml:id="_C2BZvfW">While digital health can help reach diverse populations and create additional ways to access healthcare, it also raises concerns.</s><s xml:id="_Z7xkdEd">Considerable research and work must be done to close the gap between healthcare delivery and issues of equity, accessibility, and inclusivity.</s><s xml:id="_sDfcymc">It was shown to be successful and beneficial through participatory humancentered design, but most studies showed a lack of generalizability and raised questions of concern.</s><s xml:id="_tW6BuNn">Multiple forms of digital health have the potential to optimize healthcare.</s><s xml:id="_Es4FBrn">However, as we have new innovative ways to address healthcare, we must be conscious of populations we might be leaving behind due to inaccessibility and inequity.</s><s xml:id="_2BvSymd">Throughout the editorial, we found evidence that most people will engage with digital healthcare if given access.</s><s xml:id="_Shg6Yku">Yet, we also found considerable concerns about how digital health is set up.</s><s xml:id="_HbDvQET">We must make it a point to incorporate accessibility accommodations in every digital technology we utilize in the future.</s><s xml:id="_kgaU6xr">More studies should be done with these digital health interventions that eliminate the possibility of furthering inequalities.</s><s xml:id="_MdMSvXy">We look forward to building upon this set of studies and continuing research on digital health that centers on equity.</s></p></div>			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" xml:id="foot_0"><p xml:id="_SXvZcfJ"><s xml:id="_ReUh9kf">Crowe-Cumella et al.  10.3389/fdgth.2023.1184847</s><s
