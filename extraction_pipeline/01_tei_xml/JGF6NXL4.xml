patient and the rehabilitation team work together to establish meaningful and achievable treatment goals" in rehabilitation services <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> (p.6).</s><s xml:id="_cGH22HN">Goal-setting has been defined as the establishment or negotiation of rehabilitation goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> and is recognized as a complex process that has the potential to enhance client outcomes and autonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_kgGKN4k">The Medical Research Council (MRC) highlight that to understand how a complex intervention works, one must first identify the 'active ingredients' <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hB54FBv">Whilst purposes and mechanisms for goal-setting in rehabilitation are varied <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, active ingredients in the goal-setting process include, interdisciplinary teamworking <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>, shared decisionmaking (SDM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, setting specific and meaningful goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and incorporating action

target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_kQ7Jwdc">A previous study in this program of research found that rehabilitation clinicians set poorly defined goals as individual disciplines, and included limited action planning and review of goal progress <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_xDqfvS3"><s xml:id="_DtAx5Tg">The evidence practice pipeline by Glasziou and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> highlights reasons why evidence is not implemented into clinical practice.</s><s xml:id="_a2CtT46">Firstly, implementation can only occur if clinicians are aware of and accept the evidence.</s><s xml:id="_ngHDCW9">In rehabilitation, clinicians have previously demonstrated a lack of knowledge about the evidence for goal-setting in rehabilitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9HHmZJp">Secondly, clinicians must accept the evidence is relevant to their practice and have the capability to implement the evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qdQpYUm">In rehabilitation, clinicians have demonstrated differing beliefs about the importance and timing of goal-setting and demonstrated a lack of skill in implementing aspects of goal-setting such as shared decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Kt7W89A">The final step in the evidence practice pipeline <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> is for clinicians to act on and implement the evidence with clients who have the capability of adhering to the recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DXfjfzq">Factors affecting clinicians' ability to implement goalsetting in rehabilitation settings include nursing shift work <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, staff turnover <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and competing priorities such as discharge planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_AYAPCbw">Furthermore, changes to a client's cognitive and communication abilities influence clinicians' beliefs about the capability of rehabilitation clients to participate in goal-setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zzZzTbY">Research into barriers and enablers to implementing goal-setting in rehabilitation has predominantly been conducted with condition specific population groups in the UK, Europe and New Zealand limiting the generalisability of findings to varied casemix rehabilitation services in Queensland.</s><s xml:id="_FtnN3d7">It has been proposed that tailoring interventions and addressing context specific barriers and enablers improves the likelihood of successful implementation of evidence into practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_tWQpx9J"><s xml:id="_7sJrzUD">Implementing evidence into clinical practice requires careful planning using structured process models and determinant frameworks to support clinicians to change their practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qCm5FRg">The Knowledge to Action (KTA) framework is one process model that is simple to operationalise and aligns with existing quality improvement cycles within healthcare <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2qhcjPx">Phases of the KTA can occur iteratively and include, synthesising the evidence base, determining the evidence-practice gap, identifying barriers and enablers, adapting knowledge to context, selecting and tailoring interventions, monitoring intervention implementation and evaluating and sustaining the change.</s><s xml:id="_cxqdPeb">At the centre of the KTA framework, lies the development and synthesis of knowledge.</s><s xml:id="_7mT4t2j">Several systematic reviews on goal-setting in rehabilitation have already been published <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3QAH868">Moving to the seconds stage of the KTA framework the first study in this program of research used medical record audits and client interviews to highlight evidence practice gaps in goal-setting practices across varied case mix rehabilitation services in Queensland <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_vXb3sr2">Evidence-practice gaps included limited shared decisionmaking, a focus on therapist-led goal-setting within a multidisciplinary model, limited inclusion of meaningful activity and participation goals, limited specificity of goal statements and limited action planning, feedback and review <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_DuxtR3z"><s xml:id="_3hzngWU">The subsequent three stages of the KTA framework: identifying barriers and enablers, adapting knowledge to context, selecting and tailoring interventions, are the focus of this study.</s><s xml:id="_A4BKXqy">There are several determinant frameworks that support analysis of barriers and enablers including the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8fZBCHj">The TDF was originally designed to understand health professional's behaviour and promote understanding of barriers and enablers to implementing evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ruS9c62">The TDF is often used in conjunction with the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) framework that identifies the intervention functions (intervention functions include a broad range of categories by which an intervention can change behaviour) and behaviour change techniques (BCT) (an active component of an intervention designed to change behaviour) <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> that are likely to overcome specific barriers to implementation.</s><s xml:id="_H3A7bmR">How an intervention is developed may impact the uptake and implementation of an intervention in clinical practice.</s><s xml:id="_8zc4h2V">Incorporating both clients and clinicians into the co-design of research may improve intervention uptake through enhanced awareness, acceptance of the evidence and ownership of the intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Suj4SCd">Therefore, unlike previous goal-setting studies, a participatory co-design approach was used to develop the interventions in this study.</s></p><p xml:id="_MR9uFnM"><s xml:id="_rwSYcC7">In addition to how an intervention is developed it is important to consider how an intervention will be implemented ensuring it is clear exactly what behaviour needs to change i.e. who, will do what, when, where and how <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_U7FZakj">To address known barriers, and to implement a clearly defined behaviour, behaviour change techniques such as facilitation, prompts, audit and feedback promote problem solving and enhance uptake of interventions in the clinical setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wJTaqHd">Facilitation roles involve individuals with the appropriate skills and knowledge to support clinicians through change, these roles can be both external (i.e.</s><s xml:id="_TpFVSAN">external researchers) or internal (i.e.</s><s xml:id="_YNzyRDv">local team leaders) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_T46wYbe">Audit and feedback may be more effective when delivered by a colleague or supervisor and when action plans are developed to act on the feedback provided <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_AmUyDEu"><s xml:id="_6DTyWsw">Incorporating facilitation roles, audit and feedback within implementation plans can ensure interventions are implemented as intended, that implementation is closely monitored and that clinicians are supported to agree and act on the evidence with clients <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_mmAXPGH"><s xml:id="_fx6sCP6">This study uses a theoretically informed conceptual framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, following an implementation process model (KTA) and determinant framework (TDF) to progress previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and support the understanding of barriers and enablers in varied casemix rehabilitation services.</s><s xml:id="_mgMmB7k">Therefore, the aim of this study is to analyse site specific barriers and enablers to implementing goal-setting and to co-design tailored interventions and implementation plans to address the evidence practice gap surrounding inclusion of goal-setting 'active ingredients' across five varied casemix rehabilitation services in Queensland, Australia.</s><s xml:id="_6RzmatK">This study will clearly describe the detail of intervention development to

xml:id="_j7z6bWW">Clinicians also demonstrated a lack of fundamental knowledge about the different components of rehabilitation goal-setting, specifically the difference between goals and actions.</s><s xml:id="_hVtDfzk">This was complicated by tensions between clinicians perceived obligations to set goals that aligned with organizational priorities rather than the priorities of the client.</s><s xml:id="_72DVyty">Other keys barriers and enablers related to clinician skills to implement shared decision-making and some clinician's beliefs about the consequences associated with goal-setting.</s><s xml:id="_FGxy3qv">The interventions developed and the site-specific implementation plans in this study were influenced by these identified TDF domains, which were mapped against the BCW intervention functions and behavior change techniques.</s><s xml:id="_hXB3pd7">All sites chose to include staff training and education sessions into their implementation package.</s><s xml:id="_DtBmbpr">Education and training sessions were targeted to enhance clinicians' knowledge, specifically focusing on understanding the components of goal-setting including action planning, feedback and review and ensuring that clinicians had the skills to set specific and meaningful, client centred goals.</s><s xml:id="_t4hbefy">Clinicians in this study frequently misunderstood the difference between a goal and an action, often identifying staff actions as rehabilitation goals.</s><s xml:id="_5gxmREH">The confusion of actions and goals may reflect a clinicians focus on health system expectations rather than client's goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Uae4K5G">When clinicians discussed goals, these were often framed to reflect the needs of the organisation rather than the client; i.e. 'getting them out of hospital' rather than 'the client going home to live with their family' .</s></p><p xml:id="_KXEnUFY"><s xml:id="_xaRdJ64">In keeping with previous research <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, clinicians in this study also spoke of the pressure to be able to accurately predict recovery to set realistic goals with clients.</s><s xml:id="_evmxYJt">Conversely, consumer voiced literature emphasises the need for clinicians to include hope and dream based goals in rehabilitation to enhance the motivational aspects of goal-setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_baeFpNp">Whilst some clinicians acknowledged that goal-setting can be motivational they still felt that goals should be realistic.</s><s xml:id="_gxm5AAx">If clinicians continue to only set 'realistic goals' with clients and not include aspirational goals, it is likely that goals will remain subjective to the clinician's expectation for recovery and therefore unlikely to enhance the motivational aspects of goal-setting that may impact client outcomes.</s></p><p xml:id="_duYpVZg"><s xml:id="_8CJq4PC">The focus on setting goals to meet perceived organisational needs and the inflexibility in clinicians' perspectives of including aspirational goal-setting led to clinicians demonstrating a therapist led model of goalsetting.</s><s xml:id="_xD4CSpj">The therapist led model of goal-setting has been seen previously in Queensland rehabilitation services <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wSxgqHc">To move forward from a therapist-led model of goal-setting, education and training should focus on supporting clinicians to engage clients in shared decision-making to set client-centred goals and to clinically reason to support inclusion of tangible short-term goals and longer term aspirational goals across the rehabilitation journey.</s><s xml:id="_k3K3CQQ">In this study, the client workbook and case conference templates were designed to facilitate setting of longer-term aspirational goals and allow shorter term goals to be broken down from these longer-term goals.</s></p><p xml:id="_qWbzMBy"><s xml:id="_kwhc6xV">The client workbook was designed to ensure a common client centred goal focus was established among the team (including long term and short-term goals) and that components of action planning and review were included in the goal-setting process.</s><s xml:id="_dNGkKKE">The client workbook was designed to provide information to clients to enhance their knowledge and to assist clinicians to develop skills to structure their goal-setting discussions with clients.</s><s xml:id="_8kVt7fn">Therefore, the client workbook was developed to target both client and clinician behaviours.</s><s xml:id="_XBjGCff">Developing interventions to target both the client and clinician is a novel approach in rehabilitation research with previous studies suggesting that it may enhance shared decision-making more than targeting only one group <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_Gwtpk2S"><s xml:id="_x2Ax6nR">Of interest in this study was the way in which rehabilitation teams chose to work together and include the client to achieve an interdisciplinary common goal focus.</s><s xml:id="_mxQRMNa">The case conference format was redesigned to include a common goal focus rather than discipline specific reporting and to include specific staff and client actions.</s><s xml:id="_Fdp4rEm">In this study two sites chose to use the case conference forum (including feedback to the client) to achieve a common, team goal focus.</s><s xml:id="_ktEE7vQ">Interdisciplinary models of rehabilitation involve clients as a member of the team however, clinicians in this study were unwilling to involve the client with the team in goal-setting discussions within the case conference.</s><s xml:id="_27EGXGd">There is limited literature about the inclusion of clients in rehabilitation case conference meetings.</s><s xml:id="_Pr6987b">One study reported that goal-setting ward rounds that include the client were more beneficial than meetings without the client <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_68eFYWw">However, previous studies have found barriers to including clients in team meetings including; a lack of clinician skill and confidence to facilitate team discussions in goal-setting meetings with the client present <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> and a belief that this approach would be too time consuming <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tADgjYm">When reviewing the time commitment involved in including the client in goal-setting meetings one study showed that clinicians spent over 4 h longer each week in goal-setting meetings that included the client than those without the client <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_eBSSbNE">To ensure goal-setting is truly interdisciplinary the client should be considered a member of the rehabilitation team and be included in shared decision-making at each point in the goal-setting process.</s><s xml:id="_9BVHgp6">How this can be achieved in a cost-effective manner with or without the client attending team meetings requires further research.</s><s xml:id="_h2mUtZ6">One strategy suggested in this study was to introduce a further expansion on the key worker role to ensure dedicated time was set aside to relay goal-setting information discussed in the case conference with the client.</s></p><p xml:id="_XSkCp8e"><s xml:id="_HzNjazS">Three sites implemented or built on existing key worker roles to enhance communication and include feedback channels to clients.</s><s xml:id="_QJXpNva">A lack of time was reported as the biggest barrier to implementing the key worker role.</s><s xml:id="_vNTPCCX">Clinicians across all sites were concerned that adding specific these roles to their clinical practice may detrimentally impact their workloads.</s><s xml:id="_ZTfYxad">In this study clinician's suggested strategies such as pre-population of the client goal boards to reduce time spent repeating documentation, whilst case conferences were monitored to evaluate time taken to introduce the changes.</s><s xml:id="_fAPNWQR">In Site 2 the client workbook was given on admission to give clients time to read the resource and ensure key worker discussions could be facilitated quicker.</s><s xml:id="_WVrSnbE">Concerns about a lack of time to conduct goal-setting activities has also been reported in many other rehabilitation goal-setting studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_PheTGKt">Clinicians in this study demonstrated a perception that organisational priorities and length of stay presented a barrier to having more time for engaging clients in goal-setting discussions.</s><s xml:id="_W8T6CP2">Some clinicians referenced their lack of staff resourcing as a reason for being time poor in rehabilitation settings.</s><s xml:id="_xaS76aG">A previous study undertaken in the United Kingdom found staffing ratios as well as time spent in information exchange and in non-clinical activities significantly impacted the face-to-face therapy delivered to stroke survivors <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_UXwqC87">Whilst many Queensland rehabilitation services have staffing levels below recommended national benchmarks <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>, how Queensland rehabilitation services are structured and how clinicians structure their day-to-day clinical practice to maximise time for goal-setting discussions is unclear.</s></p><p xml:id="_ZHjxF6T"><s xml:id="_ybjYTdC">Supporting the need for a co-design approach clinicians at all sites stated that they had different requirements for goal-setting interventions and needed to tailor interventions to their service delivery models and different service settings.</s><s xml:id="_3pWHx6D">Also of interest is the number of interventions sites chose to implement with some sites choosing one intervention in addition to education and training and another site choosing to implement all interventions to complement each other.</s><s xml:id="_2RkCQUJ">There is little evidence to support implementation of multifaceted interventions over single interventions.</s></p><p xml:id="_j9FJaMH"><s xml:id="_eku6sxq">The co-design process was hypothesised to engage staff and to enhance ownership over goal-setting interventions.</s><s xml:id="_PkuU6WR">Sites within this study demonstrated differing levels of engagement and required different levels of direction to design and tailor goal-setting interventions.</s><s xml:id="_UQE3fgE">All teams in this research study required substantial facilitation throughout the co-design workshops to define solutions to intervention challenges, to develop implementation plans and allocate roles and responsibilities to individual team members.</s><s xml:id="_tzfPutQ">Healthcare services should consider the need for funding, as well as the level of facilitation skills required by individuals to support change when aiming to develop holistic, theoretically informed co-designed healthcare interventions.</s><s xml:id="_BPEAUyA">Further research to explore the impact of these interventions in clinical practice and how teams go about implementing the interventions is warranted.</s></p></div>
