<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_GQC6qrK">Results:</head><p xml:id="_dU8Q8ZS"><s xml:id="_7kdbjd2">The term eHealth only came into use in the year 2000, but has since become widely prevalent.</s><s xml:id="_xkrGB4J">The scope of the topic was not immediately discernable from that of the wider health informatics field, for which over 320000 publications are listed in Medline alone, and it is not explicitly represented within the existing Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) taxonomy.</s><s xml:id="_YEz2GAZ">Applying eHealth as narrative search term to multiple databases yielded 387 relevant articles, distributed across 154 different journals, most commonly related to information technology and telemedicine, but extending to such areas as law.</s><s xml:id="_HRAMMrV">Most eHealth articles are represented on Medline.</s><s xml:id="_FgEuw4C">Definitions of eHealth vary with respect to the functions, stakeholders, contexts and theoretical issues targeted.</s><s xml:id="_h5RFtS8">Most encompass a broad range of medical informatics applications either specified (eg, decision support, consumer health information) or presented in more general terms (eg, to manage, arrange or deliver health care).</s><s xml:id="_YqvRvtC">However the majority emphasize the communicative functions of eHealth and specify the use of networked digital technologies, primarily the Internet, thus differentiating eHealth from the field of medical informatics.</s><s xml:id="_m9be5RA">While some definitions explicitly target health professionals or patients, most encompass applications for all stakeholder groups.</s><s xml:id="_nCXqxPP">The nature of the scientific and broader literature pertaining to eHealth closely reflects these conceptualizations.</s></p></div>

health care has grown exponentially over the last 15 years and its potential to improve effectiveness and efficiency has been recognized by governments worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ybzCfWB">National strategies aimed at developing health information infrastructures and "infostructures" are emerging across North America, Australia, Europe and elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5wSgV9A">These are united by a vision to improve the safety, quality and efficiency of patient care by enabling access to electronic health records and by supporting clinical practice, service management, research and policy though availability of appropriate evidence and data.</s><s xml:id="_nj5kguA">In addition, these strategies emphasize the importance of standards and policies for ensuring interoperability and data security, and many incorporate a commitment to facilitate consumer empowerment and patient self-care through provision of electronic information and/or telemedicine facilities.</s><s xml:id="_Npp684D">In the United Kingdom, these principles are reflected in the National Information Strategy for Health and are being addressed via the UK National Programme for Information Technology (NPfIT, now called Connecting for Health) and related initiatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr">7]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_zArCtzw"><s xml:id="_qt2vB47">While such initiatives have been taking place, the focus of health care information technology (IT) has been changing, from an emphasis on hardware, systems architectures and databases, to innovative uses of technology for facilitating communication and decision making, coupled with a growing recognition of the importance of human and organizational factors.</s><s xml:id="_JPXMs4r">At the same time, Internet technologies have become increasingly pervasive.</s><s xml:id="_SmKWqtw">In parallel, the language of health care IT has been changing, and references to the concept of eHealth have proliferated in international health policy, management and research arenas.</s><s xml:id="_bvhCTza">Despite the clear interest in and apparent marketability of eHealth, it was not evident, at the time this research was commissioned, what exactly was meant by the term.</s><s xml:id="_GVw6f9A">It had been variously used as a synonym for health informatics, telemedicine, consumer health informatics and e-business, as well as more specific technological applications, but no consensus existed on its conceptual scope and it was unclear whether it indeed represented a new concept, or simply a linguistic change.</s><s xml:id="_s3JyE6Z">An international call for definitions of eHealth posted in 2001 failed to generate any published responses and the call was updated in June 2004, suggesting that this is still a grey area <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">9]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_5FfkSu7"><s xml:id="_yRcF9Hd">In view of these uncertainties, it was considered important by the UK National Health Service (NHS) Research and Development Programme to define eHealth and to assess its scope and value for the future of health care, in particular to synthesize the available evidence relating to its potential impact, likely trajectory, and implications for service development and organization.</s><s xml:id="_DJNqVaK">The current paper reports descriptive work to profile and define the field, which was conducted independently of, but complements, the systematic review of definitions of eHealth provided elsewhere in this volume <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Nrus7sv">This work produced a framework for locating evidence on the effectiveness, promise and challenges of eHealth, as well as recommendations for future research, which are reported elsewhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_K8TDyky"><s xml:id="_e3Ppsmn">Potential areas of eHealth considered at the outset of the project are shown in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_PJuQvng">This was derived by group discussion among the research team, utilizing team members' a priori knowledge of topics and issues in medical informatics (drawing on backgrounds in health care research, practice, policy, and computing), key eHealth discussion papers, and the results of a preliminary Medline search suggesting that eHealth is closer to the emerging area of health informatics than to medical informatics as a whole.</s><s xml:id="_Jc99g6U">While it was established that eHealth is about the use of information technology to facilitate patient and citizen health care or service delivery, rather than technology per se, uncertainty remained about what specific topics or issues, among those shown, fall within the scope of, or have relevance to, the concept.</s></p><p xml:id="_FbrjwEb"><s xml:id="_KYVr495">It was recognized that in order to fully explore the area, multiple sources of information would need to be examined.</s><s xml:id="_ECWBYDs">While identifying the scope of eHealth research was a crucial objective, the published research literature presents a filtered record of activity and thinking and, given the fast-moving pace of the field and its importance beyond academia, nonresearch sources are likely to yield rich information about the current status of eHealth and future trends.</s><s xml:id="_DpQgpmW">For this reason we conducted two parallel, large scale reviews-one focusing on the medical and related scientific literature and the other drawing on alternative sources available via the World Wide Web, including independent scoping exercises (of which there have been several), policy documents and technology reports.</s><s xml:id="_mAXYCbc">The results of these exercises were converged in order to derive a conceptual map and are considered together in this report.</s></p><p xml:id="_yeGuQa5"><s xml:id="_zsVeUMS">Table 1.</s><s xml:id="_ava2mff">Potential eHealth areas and

support, patient-provider interaction, education, health service management, health communities and telemedicine, among other functions.</s><s xml:id="_w6duF9t">A general theme relates to electronic
