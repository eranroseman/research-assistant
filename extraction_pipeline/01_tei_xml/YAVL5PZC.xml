Norman, 2015 for a review).</s><s xml:id="_5EMErf4">Furthermore, researchers have drawn upon these theories (and models) to develop a number of frameworks of behaviour change, including more perspectives such as intervention mapping, MINDSPACE and STD/HIV framework as well as those used by the private sector such as Weight Watchers and Slimming World, which similarly draw upon psychological theory (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">Davis, Campbell, Hildon, Hobbs, &amp;

<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Hagger and Chatzisarantis (2009)</ref> mapped out a means to integrate the Theory of Planned Behaviour and Self-Determination Theory and <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">Gibbons, Houlihan, and Gerrard (2009)</ref> proposed the prototype-willingness model as an integration of intentional social cognitive with dual process perspectives.</s><s xml:id="_j5sHYYK">One integrated model which has transformed research over recent years is the COM-B with its focus on capability, opportunity and motivation and the associated Behaviour Change Wheel <ref type="bibr">(Michie et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Michie et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr">Michie &amp;
