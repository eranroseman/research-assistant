5.9% in the usual care group.</s><s xml:id="_sscJYKz">Rates of lipid screening at 3 months in usual care were higher than anticipated before the study launch.</s><s xml:id="_U4yyfZb">Adding text messaging to mailed outreach yielded a small and nonsignificant 2.4percentage point improvement in uptake.</s><s xml:id="_PdpkJJr">However, at 6 months, there was no significant difference between bulk ordering and usual care.</s><s xml:id="_cTNuxBq">At 6 months, completed lipid panels enabled the calculation of an ASCVD risk score among older patients, identifying 11 new patients (12.7%) at high risk.</s><s xml:id="_HpPqxwN">Lipid testing was not associated with an increase in prescription of statin medications at 3 or 6 months.</s></p><p xml:id="_MMUskuf"><s xml:id="_wBZxDZV">There are a few reasons that might explain these findings.</s><s xml:id="_KqPEvH2">Lipid screening is a preventive routine check that might not be proposed to patients who otherwise do not show cardiovascular risk factors and who consult their PCP for different and more urgent needs.</s><s xml:id="_cMxxVCB">Bulk ordering for lipid screening facilitates this screening for both the PCP and the patient: it acts as a default on both sides and makes the process of screening by removing the need for a clinic visit.</s><s xml:id="_MzJsvGT">In addition, this trial was informed by prior outreach studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7</ref> and a smaller pilot study of 100 patients with qualitative feedback that the outreach should include PCP endorsement, a time-limited call to action, a physically mailed laboratory order, and scheduling assistance.</s><s xml:id="_HzR9rzd">Indeed, reaching out to patients via the electronic patient portal may not be as effective as through mailed letters, because even among electronic portal users, some patients are more likely to overlook this information than an official mailed letter or possibly not know how to use an electronic laboratory order.</s><s xml:id="_wMmhaNX">From an equity perspective, mailed letters are the only cost-effective option for patients with limited internet use.</s><s xml:id="_TYpxGMT">However, a notable finding is that the magnitude of the effect from bulk ordering and outreach was lower than in other studies, which found that hepatitis C screening went from 19% for direct outreach alone to 42% with bulk ordering with a similar laboratory slip <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">8</ref> and that opt-out mailed colorectal cancer screening tripled participation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7</ref></s><s

for preventive screening.</s><s xml:id="_buDpC9M">Convincing patients of the importance of screening may require more interaction with a health professional.</s><s xml:id="_stZz4nH">Practical barriers may also need to be addressed for certain patients, for example, by home testing.</s><s xml:id="_QESjUT7">Another notable conclusion is that we did not find an effect from bulk ordering and outreach at 6 months.</s><s xml:id="_7Btd2gR">The fact that the intervention was only effective in the short term may suggest that there was some spillover in prescribing of lipid panels by the clinicians or
