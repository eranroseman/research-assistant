integration strategy documentation from Medtrix.</s><s xml:id="_CtEj3eQ">During technical calls with Medtrix, it was determined that EPTR's current capability to send and receive EHR HL7 messages externally through a third-party integration vendor, made EPTR a great candidate for this type of integration.</s><s xml:id="_VTHpdu4">For providers, they would continue to use the existing computerized physician order entry (CPOE) function to request CGM data within the EHR.</s></p><p xml:id="_vhkf2fv"><s xml:id="_HGPKG59">With recent security breaches within the healthcare industry, EPTR's information security and legal teams have implemented a variety of processes to mitigate liability and risk.</s><s xml:id="_VVry6gT">EPTR's IT security team requested comprehensive technical details of Medtrix's IT security posture and data management.</s><s xml:id="_BWAsteX">In addition to executing the vendor's Data Subscription Agreement, detailing the services and cost of the integration, a separate security addendum provided by EPTR was added.</s><s xml:id="_a8UxfBg">The addendum ensures Medtrix has industry standard security practices and maintains certain service levels.</s><s xml:id="_WkNEQt7">With Medtrix's status as a hybrid covered entity under HIPAA, no Business Associate Agreement needed to be executed.</s><s xml:id="_HCrWAes">From a legal perspective, the type of data provided through the integration service falls under the Treatment, Payment, and operations clause, but to decrease liability, data is requested via CPOE orders and not pushed automatically to the EHR.</s></p><p xml:id="_khU9fSA"><s xml:id="_NGjjgqW">EPTR's financial assessment consisted of three considerations: Medtrix's annual data subscription fee of $8,000, internal project team labor cost, and cost of maintaining the integration.</s><s xml:id="_aMPgtG8">Much of the project team's cost will come from IT design/development work and testing of the HL7 messages and CPOE order sets.</s><s xml:id="_Vzc3Swp">Maintenance cost was determined to remain relatively low.</s><s xml:id="_yr9MCCP">Any additional data being requested through the CGM integration can be worked on by EPTR's internal clinical systems and integration team.</s></p><p xml:id="_SZkv3Xr"><s xml:id="_ZkWXc2s">Even though the main objective of a CGM data integration is meant to reduce or eliminate repetitive administrative workflows, it does introduce new ones.</s><s xml:id="_7zndaVH">Previously, clinical staff was tasked with logging into Medtrix's data platform to download, print out an AGP report, hand it to the physician, and scan the document into the EHR.</s><s xml:id="_XkQSM5f">With the new CGM data integration, clinical staff were now tasked with submitting CPOE orders to ensure patient consent and account linkage.</s><s xml:id="_Xz8HDye">Once consent is provided by the patient via email, clinical staff can submit a secondary CPOE order to request CGM data for a particular timeframe.</s><s xml:id="_9KvaF9K">Fortunately, no additional staff was needed to accommodate this new workflow but did require adjustments to clinic workflow.</s></p><p xml:id="_kWC5fhm"><s xml:id="_6pg6wnQ">After a comprehensive review of the feasibility of this effort, clinical and IT leadership created a business case to present to EPTR's capital committee.</s><s xml:id="_AvccfF4">Not only was the business case essential to requesting capital funds to implement the project, it also provided the institution the rationale of how this new technology was beneficial to their patients and clinicians.</s><s xml:id="_ncf7WVE">The benefits consisted of the following: remote patient monitoring within the EHR, improve clinical documentation with structured glucose metrics (see trend analysis in a flowsheet/results review), eliminate need to print out and scan reports, use structured data for population health management, help achieve value-based metrics, and may provide additional reimbursement.</s></p><p xml:id="_7SFktPn"><s xml:id="_qVH9EUE">Once the budget was approved and contracts were executed, a project manager was assigned to implement the data integration.</s><s xml:id="_aAv8kSm">A project charter was developed to provide a detailed project plan and to receive approvals from the various stakeholders involved.</s><s xml:id="_nRmEbA2">After assigning project resources internally from clinical and IT dept, a project kick-off call was held with Medtrix's project team.</s><s xml:id="_tAqDxcQ">It was at this stage where a communication campaign was created, to make providers and staff aware of the implementation of the CGM integration.</s><s xml:id="_2krP7y4">This allowed the Endocrinology dept and its staff to understand the new technology, but also become aware of the change in their workflow.</s></p><p xml:id="_GSCxJDs"><s xml:id="_3cAaHDU">The actual implementation of the CGM data integration was carefully planned out and documented within the project charter.</s><s xml:id="_XaUJfVJ">For the design phase, the clinical project team worked to define the glucose metrics and the data timeframe preferred.</s><s xml:id="_8krGjpj">Once defined, IT resources began to work on defining the HL7 messaging to send and receive data for the integration.</s><s xml:id="_VQ4Mbw7">In addition, a CPOE order set</s></p><p
