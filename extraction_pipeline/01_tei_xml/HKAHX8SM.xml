prototypes.</s><s xml:id="_JncgzEn">Driven by a theoretical concern, the goal of these studies was to understand how the customisation of trackers supports people's tracking needs and practices.</s><s xml:id="_tbZvJvt">For instance, Kim et al. developed OmniTrack, a mobile application that allows people to create customised trackers by choosing what data they want to track, how their data should be tracked (i.e.</s><s xml:id="_THAvQwW">manually and/or automatically) and the timing and frequency of tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[63]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NBgSWxH">A field study of

foster experiences of agency <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">54]</ref> and empowerment <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[82]</ref> as people make decisions on when and how to track, and fit trackers to their individual needs and practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">54]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ujRegd2">However, a challenge with these customisable tracking tools is that they often result in "goal creep", or designing tools with more potential goals to monitor and interesting data to collect than is feasible to review <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[89]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_aAAeqzk"><s xml:id="_sZ28hay">Other studies have looked at the role that cosmetic changes play in how people use trackers, such as how data is visualised and the form of trackers.</s><s xml:id="_4x9r2ju">Kim et al. developed DataSelfie <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[61]</ref>, a web-based interactive system that allows people to create visual mappings of their personal data.</s><s xml:id="_kgTXjgc">Simlarly, Ayobi et al drew inspiration from bullet journaling to create Trackly, a mobile application that created customised trackers by allowing people to select and colour pictorial shapes that would represent their data <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_QJgJTtT">In both studies, people experienced a strong sense of identity with their trackers through creating meaningful pictorial trackers that documented and represented essential aspects of their lives.</s></p></div>

xml:id="_rmUuGkU"><s xml:id="_3SQgGcU">To identify opportunities for health and wellbeing visualisation on smartwatches, Amini et al. worked with graphic designers to envision different visualisations

's suggestion that people are more likely to engage with watchfaces which they feel closely align with their personal identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[56]</ref>, and findings in other domains like microblogging where customisation has been empirically shown to improve engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[90]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9gtckCC">However, it remains an open question how specific the desire to blend personal interests and tracking needs are to the parameters of tracking via a wearable device.</s><s xml:id="_ZcACZmc">We suspect this interest largely draws from use of a passive ambient display for viewing data, as people more regularly make the association between the two.</s><s xml:id="_HvUR3fG">This would suggest that similar desires for blending might emerge when tracked data is represented on other devices like lock screens of phones or public displays, but might be less valuable if tracking exists only in a dedicated app that is opened with a tracking or reflection task more clearly in mind.</s></p><p xml:id="_HWAp4Sz"><s xml:id="_6wgPcS6">Our work points to the value of creating authoring tools to help people integrate their data needs into their own personally meaningful watchfaces.</s><s xml:id="_wUs7TwW">In particular, we believe there is room in the design landscape for lower-threshold creation tools, beyond direct engagement with the native APIs of smartwatches only accessible by people with expert knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[27]</ref> or highly expressive tools like FitFace <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ZTtA4h3">A main challenge is designing tools which allow blending data with aesthetic and personal meaning needs, where improving the experience of searching and browsing for watchfaces that others created is unlikely to support people's individual preferences and ways of creating meaning.</s><s xml:id="_E6ranJg">For example, allowing people to create watchfaces which annotate pictures they find meaningful with the data fields they value could enable people to better connect personal meaning with data needs.</s><s xml:id="_dtT2Xru">Such tools could further support people's aesthetic preferences through enabling customising the locations and colors of different data fields on the watchface, mirroring the flexibility of paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WbgAnym">Finally, authoring tools could leverage triggers <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[63]</ref> to support watchfaces in changing based on events, such as achieving a daily step goal or changing from month to month.</s><s xml:id="_8VEWy7j">Improving tagging and filtering of watchfaces in public galleries by data, aesthetic, and personal meaning needs could also make it easier for people to find watchfaces they appreciate, similar to tracking apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[67]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ckVfEP2">But we suspect that improving selection alone is insufficient for supporting people's highly individual needs around customisation.</s></p><p xml:id="_8FgapbT"><s xml:id="_5PZMJty">It is worth reiterating that our study parameters likely overemphasised perspectives of people who customised their watchfaces, while many people do not.</s><s xml:id="_EjjUXkj">In the future, it is therefore worth examining whether people who have not customised would benefit from doing so, such as identifying new goals, avoiding discomfort from measures they do not wish to see, or finding greater personal meaning.</s><s xml:id="_V6sZTfb">And if so, it is worth considering how we can design tracking technologies to further encourage their customisation.</s><s xml:id="_AkuxDHt">We also expect that some of our findings around meaning-making may not fully apply to people who are deeply motivated to monitor performance towards health and wellbeing goals, such as use of sports watches <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[91]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_jhjPnEH">For some people, monitoring the tracked metrics may be sufficient for maintaining interest, paralleling differences between the Quantified Self movement and Lived Informatics <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b83">86]</ref>.</s></p></div>
