<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_b4Tm5E2">We found most of the studies included were small (100 participants or less) of short duration (3 to 6 months), focused on people with poorly controlled HbA1c levels (defined as a HbA1c &gt; 7%) and compared intervention to usual care, although usual care varied across studies.</s><s xml:id="_eMxjGv7">There was variation in the content and dosage of the intervention but no obvious dose-response pattern.</s><s xml:id="_ZYyjyaB">In most of the studies, both intervention and control arms showed a fall in the level of HbA1c including those studies where the between group difference was not significant which is consistent with our findings.</s><s xml:id="_2n4U6Kk">It is possible that willingness to take part in a trial may also be associated with changes in motivation relating to medication use and other lifestyle behaviours.</s><s xml:id="_v4tvkjv">Larger studies and those carried out over a longer period did not identify statistically significant differences in measures of HbA1c between intervention and control groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, with one widely reported exception <ref type="bibr"

glucose lowering medication and insulin and the intervention included graphical feedback of blood glucose readings <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DgZrQyy">The closed-loop communication between participants and providers in the New Zealand study may have enhanced the impact of the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_FrmVGa9">We involved clinicians in the design of the

people with type 2 diabetes in LMIC.</s><s xml:id="_xyhdPSB">The level of HbA1c in the population was high in both sites and despite the long duration of type 2 diabetes, many people were still on oral monotherapy and had not been prescribed additional treatment.</s><s xml:id="_JTvxY8C">The numbers of people who died during the 1 year of the trial emphasises the extent of morbidity and

regular use of medication <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, but there was no similar impact on HbA1c.</s><s xml:id="_45CXpZf">Some of the messages focussed on cardiovascular risk factors and cardiovascular disease prevention.</s><s xml:id="_j978f2E">In pre-specified sub-group analyses, we found evidence of interaction by the level of HbA1c at the start of the trial and by the duration of diabetes (self-reported time since diagnosis).</s><s xml:id="_Aqp97vz">The results suggest that it is possible that people with higher starting HbA1c and shorter duration of disease may have benefitted more from the intervention than those with lower baseline HbA1c or longer duration of disease.</s><s xml:id="_9bFqDWC">However, the effect is small and the mean difference in HbA1c is not non clinically relevant.</s><s xml:id="_wNr2HHD">These results show the limited scope for an effect from SMS text-messages on glycaemic control in the absence of treatment intensification or increased levels of support.</s></p><p xml:id="_uqFgpak"><s xml:id="_pX3YdBK">A cost-effectiveness analysis had originally been planned.</s><s xml:id="_RhxRBng">However, findings showed no difference between

collected blind to randomly allocated group and with minimal loss to follow up.</s><s xml:id="_xZJxrzv">The design of the study excluded interim HbA1c measures that may have identified an early, but transient change in HbA1c level (potentially at the expense of modifying the impact of the trial interventions) in contrast to other shorter-term studies.</s><s xml:id="_jC6r227">We did not, for similar reasons, have additional measures in place to self-report whether messages were read, but our formative work did not indicate this would be a problem, we tracked whether participants were receiving messages on their mobile phones, and they reported receiving and reading them in interviews after the trial had finished.</s><s xml:id="_Ea8ZeND">We did not measure health literacy as a dependent variable and did not measure whether people had the messages read to them, but most participants interviewed in our qualitative study had basic knowledge, although lacked personal information about what might be needed to stabilise their blood sugar.</s></p><p xml:id="_xKtQf9r"><s xml:id="_PK7jEbS">This trial provided a good test of the pragmatic impact of messaging without additional support beyond usual clinic care.</s><s xml:id="_sxSBxDF">As a test of efficacy, this study was limited by wide inclusion criteria including participants with comorbid conditions and those with a varied degree of glycaemic control.</s><s xml:id="_dVXNgcy">The study builds on previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, with an increased frequency of sending messages and a
