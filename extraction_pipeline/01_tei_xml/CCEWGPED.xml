(positive predictive value of 70% for predicting unplanned events).</s><s xml:id="_88yhWFe">A randomized controlled trial with 214 patients for 6 months (the largest trial we found in the review in terms of number of enrolled participants and duration) showed a reduction of 50% in the number of unplanned hospital events of participants in the intervention group compared with control.</s><s xml:id="_kfvgBsS">The most common response to an alert indicating that a patient needed attention (red alert) was to phone the patient the next day to reassess the situation and contact their general practitioner (3% of calls), suggest or plan a visit to their general practitioner (11% of calls), or call an ambulance (&lt;0.01% of calls).</s><s xml:id="_Bg9T4dx">In summary, the authors reported that predictive analytics on an ongoing basis could be used to signify risk of hospitalization and guide the health care system to take appropriate actions.</s></p><p xml:id="_argPY6W"><s xml:id="_K5pzndf">Morrison et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> used push notifications to enhance engagement of smartphone users for stress management.</s><s xml:id="_7s6RYjt">They used a naïve Bayes classifier to predict whether a user would respond to a notification, thereby building a personalized intelligent mechanism for notification delivery, based on the times within a day a user was more likely to view and react to the received messages.</s><s xml:id="_adKZJFJ">However, this exploratory study with 77 participants showed no statistically significant difference between participants receiving the messages sent "intelligently" and those receiving a message daily or occasionally within 72 hours (Cohen d=0.14 for intelligent vs daily group and d=0.5 for intelligent vs occasional group, for actions taken in response to messages).</s><s xml:id="_M2RuwXT">Although notification delivery based on time had no effect on the study groups (ie, response to notifications was no different), the authors concluded that frequent daily messages may not deter users from engaging with digital health interventions.</s></p><p xml:id="_anhQT9V"><s xml:id="_8gRa2qJ">Ortiz-Catalan et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> applied myoelectric pattern recognition algorithms for the control of a virtual limb in patients with phantom limb pain and used gaming along with augmented and virtual reality for treatment.</s><s xml:id="_db7w5NG">This single-group study with 14 participants revealed that patients' symptoms of phantom limb pain were significantly decreased (by about 50%) at the end of the provided treatment for 6 months (P=.0001 for reduction in intensity and quality of pain).</s><s xml:id="_b4cqWgc">The authors suggested that their novel treatment could be used after failure of evidence-based treatments such as mirror therapy and before proceeding with invasive or pharmacological approaches.</s><s xml:id="_n2UDp3g">Sadasivam et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> used a recommender system to send motivational messages to individuals, targeting smoking cessation.</s><s xml:id="_FzrHGxc">The system was based on Bayesian probabilistic matrix factorization to predict message rating, through the processing of data from the user's previous ratings of messages, along with other users' ratings.</s><s xml:id="_c9B7NAx">This randomized controlled trial with 120 users showed that the system was more effective at influencing people to quit smoking than were standard tailored messages (rule-based system) with proven effectiveness (P=.02) and resulted in a similar cessation rate.</s><s xml:id="_jqp7Tgt">The authors concluded that their recommender system could be used instead of standard systems for influencing smoking cessation because it was more personalized (it learned and adapted to a person's behavior) and could incorporate a considerably greater number of variables; however, larger trials would be needed to demonstrate the system's effectiveness.</s></p><p xml:id="_YuBUypb"><s xml:id="_ffq5CBp">Zeevi et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> used gradient boosting regression to predict the postmeal glycemic response of individuals in real life, according to blood parameters, dietary habits, anthropometrics, physical activity, and gut microbiota.</s><s xml:id="_czxxrmM">The results from this randomized controlled study with 24 participants showed that a personalized diet based on postmeal glycemic predictions could statistically significantly modify elevated postprandial blood glucose (P&lt;.05 for predicting low levels of blood glucose ["good diet"] vs high levels of blood glucose ["bad diet"], which was comparable with diets selected by experts).</s><s xml:id="_SwhktXU">The authors reported that their approach could be used in nutritional interventions for controlling or preventing disorders associated with poor glycemic control, such as obesity, diabetes, and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease.</s><s xml:id="_xmwWWRv">However, evaluation periods of months or even years would be needed first to clearly indicate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_uMZYEm6">Principal Findings</head><p xml:id="_J23jV3W"><s xml:id="_kNngy2a">This review is, to our knowledge, the first to systematically examine the features and outcomes of digital health interventions incorporating machine learning that were implemented and assessed in real-life studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_GfrYZ7w">With this aim in mind, we differentiated our review from previous investigations that focused only on the broader use of artificial intelligence in medicine in the context of specific diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, machine learning techniques <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>, or risk prediction models, such as through mining of electronic health records <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>, and did not consider real-life evaluation of the respective interventions.</s><s xml:id="_kVYTEdq">The need to demonstrate evidence of an intervention's effectiveness in the real world has been highlighted in several other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KfbbAdK">Our main finding is that most of the digital health interventions showed significantly positive health outcomes for patients or healthy individuals, which demonstrates the virtue of machine learning applications in actual clinical practice.</s><s xml:id="_hrBRWGa">However, given the small number of studies identified in this review and their considerable limitations highlighted above, further work is warranted to demonstrate the effectiveness of digital interventions relying on machine learning applications in real-life medical care.</s></p><p xml:id="_TsryPsx"><s xml:id="_aAmsWBm">Our review found 8 different cases of machine learning applications in a real-life setting: depression prediction and management, speech recognition for people with speech disabilities, self-efficacy for weight loss, detection of changes in biopsychosocial condition of patients with multiple morbidity, stress management, treatment of phantom limb pain, smoking cessation, and personalized nutrition based on glycemic response.</s><s xml:id="_bWuwTke">The reviewed studies had several implications for clinical practice, such as better engagement of patients with interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, the identification of risk for hospitalization <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, or the introduction of novel treatment methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Ka49xcJ">Among the studies, those for speech recognition of people with speech disabilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and notification delivery for stress management <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> clearly reported insignificant outcomes, whereas 6 studies showed significant outcomes, but they were of low to moderate methodological quality.</s><s xml:id="_pZMVgdt">Only 3 studies were in the form of a randomized controlled trial, which limited the ability to fully identify the added value of machine learning-enabled interventions compared with standard care.</s><s xml:id="_N5TfVCa">To this end, further rigorous studies with adequately powered samples (recruiting considerably more participants than the average number of 71 participants found in this review) are needed, which would generate the evidence base for the effectiveness of machine learning in clinical practice.</s><s xml:id="_Qfxpx5P">To that effect, large trials and publicly accessible databases that have become available over the last few years, such as the UK BioBank and the Physionet database, are providing rich resources that could facilitate insights.</s></p><p xml:id="_bQRrFbz"><s xml:id="_97hvJ5Q">The delivery of motivational messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref> or stories <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> for health behavior change and engagement seems to be an emerging area of digital health interventions incorporating machine learning.</s><s xml:id="_7J7tvAu">These studies also demonstrated the latest efforts to promote individuals' personalized self-management and to put them at the center of health care <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_r2SpS5p">Considering the effectiveness of tailored messaging in influencing health behavior change <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, further research in this area is warranted.</s></p><p xml:id="_bcsfZmh"><s xml:id="_ARma6FS">The surprisingly small number of identified pragmatic studies in our review might raise some concerns and indicates the substantial challenge of systematically evaluating digital health interventions that incorporate machine learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_QUcTNEs">In this context, the retrospective validation of algorithms and models, given the availability of one or more datasets, constitutes only the first step in the evaluation process <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_GZXjVj5">The second step involves the integration of the algorithms and models within a digital health tool, such as mobile phone-based tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, internet-based tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, or an aid device <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ug5FScu">The third step requires the assessment of the developed tool as a digital health intervention in a real-life research setting (eg, through a randomized controlled trial), together with patients or health professionals, or both <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">41]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_6JGD6sA">The final step would be the monitoring of actual uptake and use of the intervention in real-world settings and outside of a research setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>, which is, however, rarely reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_d5dx6Wj">Admittedly, this process is challenging and anything but trivial.</s><s xml:id="_EZfcNff">It requires a significant amount of time and resources, which might not always be available, and multidisciplinary collaboration among experts in different fields, such as engineering, computer science, behavioral science, and medicine, which might not be straightforward.</s><s xml:id="_Xx9JqfV">However, such synergistic collaborative approaches are likely necessary in the development of evidence-based, sustainable, and impactful digital health interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45]</ref>.</s></p></div>
