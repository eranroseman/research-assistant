<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_X33GTcB">I. INTRODUCTION</head><p xml:id="_wr5Gtus"><s xml:id="_uG62PxN">Sustained growth in medical spending has prompted policy makers, insurers, and employers to search for ways to reduce health care costs.</s><s xml:id="_H8MRsU6">One widely touted solution is to increase the use of "wellness programs," interventions designed to encourage preventive care and discourage unhealthy behaviors, such as inactivity or smoking.</s><s xml:id="_RnK7gny">The 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) encourages firms to adopt wellness programs by letting them offer participation incentives up to 30% of the total cost of health insurance coverage, and 18 states currently include some form of wellness incentives as a part of their Medicaid program (Saunders et al. 2018).</s><s xml:id="_dVqNk7C">Workplace wellness industry revenue has more than tripled in size to $8 billion since 2010, and wellness programs now cover over 50 million U.S. workers (Mattke,  Schnyer, and Van Busum 2012; Kaiser Family Foundation 2016).</s><s xml:id="_SUaHWSk">A meta-analysis by Baicker, Cutler, and Song (2010) finds large medical and absenteeism cost savings, but other studies find only limited benefits (e.g., Gowrisankaran et al. 2013; Baxter et al.  2014).</s><s xml:id="_jA7YACD">Most of the prior evidence has relied on voluntary firm and employee participation in workplace wellness, limiting the ability to infer causal relationships.</s></p><p xml:id="_QrnfvWG"><s xml:id="_SQtHGKz">Moreover, the prior literature has generally overlooked important questions regarding selection into wellness programs.</s><s xml:id="_C6bzyEx">If there are strong patterns of selection, the increasing use of large financial incentives now permitted by the ACA may redistribute resources across employees in a manner that runs counter to the intentions of policy makers. <ref type="bibr">1</ref> For example, wellness incentives may shift costs onto unhealthy or lower-income employees if these groups are less likely to participate.</s><s xml:id="_TBBq4TS">Furthermore, wellness programs may act as a screening device by encouraging healthy employees to join or remain at the firm-perhaps by earning rewards for continuing their healthy lifestyles.</s></p><p xml:id="_prGUzpW"><s xml:id="_VRDeSAX">This article investigates two research questions.</s><s xml:id="_gufhWDE">First, which types of employees participate in wellness programs?</s><s xml:id="_qFy7e2V">While healthy employees may have low participation costs, unhealthy employees may gain the most from participating.</s><s xml:id="_2K8g2Rg">Second, what are the causal effects, negative or positive, of workplace wellness programs on medical spending, employee productivity, health behaviors, and well-being?</s><s xml:id="_H7ZZ3xc">For example, medical spending could decrease if wellness programs improve health or increase if wellness programs and primary care are complements.</s></p><p xml:id="_h8Z3YHR"><s xml:id="_pUHvBQf">To improve our understanding of workplace wellness programs, we designed and implemented the Illinois Workplace Wellness Study, a randomized controlled trial (RCT) conducted at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). <ref type="bibr">2</ref> We developed a comprehensive workplace wellness program, iThrive, which ran for two years and included three main components: an annual on-site biometric health screening, an annual online health risk assessment (HRA), and weekly wellness activities.</s><s xml:id="_ZWEx9CW">We invited 12,459 benefits-eligible university employees to participate in our study and successfully recruited 4,834 participants, 3,300 of whom were assigned to the treatment group and were invited to take paid time off to participate in the wellness program. <ref type="bibr">3</ref></s><s xml:id="_xPhqfQJ">he remaining 1,534 subjects were assigned to a control group, which was not permitted to participate.</s><s xml:id="_wY4BNb8">Those in the treatment group who successfully completed the entire two-year program earned rewards ranging from $50 to $650, with the amounts randomly assigned and communicated at the start of each program year.</s></p><p xml:id="_hyqRz2X"><s xml:id="_bDyv3q9">Our analysis combines individual-level data from online surveys, university employment records, health insurance claims, campus gym visit records, and running event records.</s><s xml:id="_NCxJCGe">These data allow us to examine many novel outcomes in addition to the usual ones studied by the prior literature (medical spending and employee absenteeism).</s><s xml:id="_76qzEGT">From our analysis, we find evidence of significant advantageous selection into our program based on medical spending and health behaviors.</s><s xml:id="_nUPdGJY">At baseline, average annual medical spending among participants was $1,384 less than among nonparticipants.</s><s xml:id="_rme7Dv7">This estimate is statistically (p = .027)</s><s xml:id="_cYYtVrS">and economically significant: all else equal, it implies that increasing the share of participating (low-spending) workers employed at the university by 4.3 percentage points or more would offset the entire costs of our intervention.</s><s xml:id="_PvCZzbz">Participants were also more likely to have visited campus recreational facilities and to have participated in running events prior to our study.</s><s xml:id="_eEp6Yh6">We find evidence of adverse selection when examining productivity: at baseline, participants were more likely to have taken sick leave and were less likely to have worked more than 50 hours a week than were nonparticipants.</s></p><p xml:id="_ktNpauU"><s xml:id="_7KQYxrx">Despite strong program participation, we do not find significant effects of our intervention on 40 out of the 42 outcomes we examine in the first year following random assignment.</s><s xml:id="_9ukxRwx">These 40 outcomes include all our measures of medical spending, productivity, health behaviors, and self-reported health.</s><s xml:id="_RcCWmPS">We fail to find significant treatment effects on average medical spending, on different quantiles of the spending distribution, or on any major subcategory of medical utilization (pharmaceutical drugs, office, or hospital).</s><s xml:id="_qKfyZnh">We find no effects on productivity, whether measured using administrative variables (sick leave, salary, promotion), survey variables (hours worked, job satisfaction, job search), or an index that combines all available measures.</s><s xml:id="_GmNkB3s">We also do not find effects on visits to campus gym facilities or on participation in a popular annual community running event, two health behaviors a motivated employee might change within one year.</s><s xml:id="_7zeGrkz">These null effects persist when we estimate longer-run effects of the two-year intervention using outcomes measured up to 30 months after the initial randomization.</s></p><p xml:id="_YufBZVj"><s xml:id="_wCAdjen">Our null estimates are meaningfully precise.</s><s xml:id="_ZZ4j59F">For medical spending and absenteeism, two focal outcomes in the prior literature, the 95% confidence intervals of our estimates rule out 84% of the effects reported in 112 prior studies.</s><s xml:id="_XVzqGVC">The 99% confidence interval for the return on investment (ROI) of our intervention rules out the widely cited medical spending and absenteeism ROIs reported in the meta-analysis of Baicker, Cutler, and  Song (2010).</s><s xml:id="_spZDySf">In addition, our ordinary least squares (OLS) (non-RCT) medical spending estimate, which compares participants with nonparticipants rather than treatment to control, agrees with estimates from prior observational studies.</s><s xml:id="_v2wGkJh">However, the OLS estimate is ruled out by the 99% confidence interval of our instrumental variables (IV) (RCT) estimate.</s><s xml:id="_4KYZsPK">These contrasting results demonstrate the value of using an RCT design in this literature.</s></p><p xml:id="_2rpHr8m"><s xml:id="_VV52Gw3">Our intervention had two positive treatment effects in the first year, based on responses to follow-up surveys. <ref type="bibr">4</ref></s><s xml:id="_5PJMbAv">First, employees in the treatment group were more likely than those in the control group to report ever receiving a health screening.</s><s xml:id="_j52pn6r">This result indicates that the health screening component of our program did not merely crowd out health screenings that would have otherwise occurred without our intervention.</s><s xml:id="_r5jnwGG">Second, treatment group employees were more likely to report that management prioritizes worker health and safety, although this effect disappears after the first year.</s></p><p xml:id="_N2Ebs2T"><s xml:id="_PY4x6Kt">Wellness programs may act as a profitable screening device if they allow firms to preferentially recruit or retain employees with attractive characteristics, such as low health care costs.</s><s xml:id="_xnMjWhD">Prior studies have shown compensation packages can be used in this way (Lazear 2000; Liu et al. 2017), providing additional economic justification for the prevalent and growing use of nonwage employment benefits (Oyer 2008).</s><s xml:id="_AwpCXAs">We find that participation is correlated with preexisting healthy behaviors and low medical spending.</s><s xml:id="_QkNGNaZ">However, our estimated retention effects are null after 30 months, which limits the ability of wellness programs to screen employees in our setting.</s></p><p xml:id="_Y3Xv7Kt"><s xml:id="_g7MvZ7Z">The results speak to the distributional consequences of workplace wellness.</s><s xml:id="_YCZDvhu">For example, when incentives are linked to pooled expenses such as health insurance premiums, wellness programs may increase insurance premiums for unhealthy low-income workers (Volpp et al. 2011; Horwitz, Kelly, and DiNardo 2013;  McIntyre et al. 2017).</s><s xml:id="_y4GEsHf">The results of our selection analysis provide support for these concerns: nonparticipating employees are more likely to be in the bottom quartile of the salary distribution, are less likely to engage in healthy behaviors, and have higher medical expenditures.</s></p><p xml:id="_Sn9Jt2H"><s xml:id="_2T2mHBX">We also contribute to the health literature evaluating the causal effects of workplace wellness programs.</s><s xml:id="_9PrdK3T">Most prior studies of wellness programs rely on observational comparisons between participants and nonparticipants (see Pelletier 2011; Chapman  2012, for reviews).</s><s xml:id="_fYxEyPN">Publication bias could skew the set of existing results (Baicker, Cutler, and Song 2010; Abraham and White  2017).</s><s xml:id="_vn8eTU6">To that end, our intervention, empirical specifications, and outcome variables were prespecified and publicly archived. <ref type="bibr">5</ref></s><s xml:id="_8tDXPht">Our analyses were also independently replicated by a Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL) North America researcher.</s></p><p xml:id="_HVVGFae"><s xml:id="_fyy6FwW">A number of RCTs have focused on components of workplace wellness, such as wellness activities (Volpp et al. 2008; Charness  and Gneezy 2009; Royer, Stehr, and Sydnor 2015; Handel and  Kolstad 2017), HRAs (Haisley et al. 2012), or on particular outcomes such as obesity or health status (Meenan et al. 2010; Terry  et al. 2011).</s><s xml:id="_GcY4YGG">By contrast, our setting features a comprehensive wellness program that includes a biometric screening, HRA, wellness activities, and financial incentives.</s></p><p xml:id="_3SAJ9PE"><s xml:id="_ktf9FQX">Our study complements the contemporaneous work by Song  and Baicker (2019) of a comprehensive wellness program.</s><s xml:id="_qWJ6bjz">Similar to us, Song and Baicker (2019) do not find effects on medical spending or employment outcomes after 18 months.</s><s xml:id="_HAkUBkU">Relative to Song and  Baicker (2019), our study emphasizes selection into participation, explores in detail the differences between RCT and observational estimates, and includes a longer postperiod (30 months).</s><s xml:id="_5ZhVySy">In contrast to our study, which randomizes at the individual level, Song  and Baicker (2019) randomize at the worksite level to capture potential site-level effects, such as spillovers between coworkers.</s><s xml:id="_pyC3G7y">The similarity in results between the two studies-and their divergence from prior work-further underscores the value of RCT evidence within this literature.</s><s xml:id="_8uavDer">In addition, our finding that observational estimates are biased toward finding positive health impacts-even after extensive covariate adjustment-reinforces the general concerns about selection bias in observational health studies raised by Oster (2019).</s></p><p xml:id="_aZ3fy8e"><s xml:id="_EevvAKm">The rest of

sets.</s><s xml:id="_7UQXx7q">Section III outlines our empirical methods, while Section IV presents the results of our first-year analysis.</s><s xml:id="_pUBuWeC">Section V presents results from our

Background</head><p xml:id="_65T6GwC"><s xml:id="_ARD6xzy">Workplace wellness programs are employer-provided efforts to "enhance awareness, change behavior, and create environments that support good health practices" (Aldana 2001, 297).</s><s xml:id="_vJ6C78h">For the purposes of this study, "wellness programs" encompass three major types of interventions: (i) biometric screenings, which provide clinical measures of health; (ii) HRAs, which assess lifestyle health habits; and (iii) wellness activities, which promote a healthy lifestyle by encouraging specific behaviors (such as smoking cessation, stress management, or fitness).</s><s xml:id="_EeeJVdN">Best practice guides advise employers to let employees take paid time off to participate in wellness programs and to combine wellness program components to maximize their effectiveness (Ryde et al. 2013).</s><s xml:id="_JpfwfjP">In particular, it is recommended that information from a biometric screening and an HRA help determine which wellness activity a person selects (Soler et al. 2010).</s></p><p xml:id="_2z9XG2p"><s xml:id="_wn9z7YT">Wellness programs vary considerably across employers.</s><s xml:id="_z8ZbZ9V">Among firms with 200 or more employees, the share offering a biometric screening, HRA, or wellness activities in 2016 was 53%, 59%, and 83%, respectively (Kaiser Family Foundation and Health  Research &amp; Educational Trust 2016).</s><s xml:id="_6yE4ucS">These benefits are often coupled with financial incentives for participation, such as cash compensation or discounted health insurance premiums.</s><s xml:id="_cd7xJZM">A 2015 survey estimates an average cost of $693 per employee for these programs (Jaspen 2015), and a recent industry analysis estimates annual revenues of $8 billion (Kaiser Family Foundation 2016).</s></p><p xml:id="_c5g7AzY"><s xml:id="_KbvS7Ag">Several factors may explain the increasing popularity of workplace wellness programs.</s><s xml:id="_eFZPcpT">First, some employers believe that these programs reduce medical spending and increase productivity.</s><s xml:id="_EhP5UxQ">For example, Safeway famously attributed its low medical spending to its wellness program (Burd 2009), although this evidence was subsequently disputed (Reynolds 2010).</s><s xml:id="_VrqzDBF">Other work suggests wellness programs may increase productivity (Gubler,  Larkin, and Pierce 2017).</s><s xml:id="_NTb4F3J">Second, if employees have a high private value of wellness-related benefits, then labor market competition may drive employers to offer wellness programs to attract and retain workers.</s><s xml:id="_ZZb7FUD">Third, the ACA has relaxed constraints on the maximum size of financial incentives offered by employers.</s><s xml:id="_cwPdMrb">Prior to the ACA, health-contingent incentives could not exceed 20% of the cost of employee health coverage.</s><s xml:id="_rCwwuaN">The ACA increased that general limit to 30% and raised it to 50% for tobacco cessation programs (Cawley 2014).</s><s xml:id="_mgsskdw">The average premium for a family insurance plan in 2017 was $18,764 (Kaiser Family Foundation  and Health Research &amp; Educational Trust 2017), which means that many employers can offer wellness rewards or penalties in excess of $5,000.</s></p><p xml:id="_xjDEeub"><s xml:id="_G9mAZdF">Like other large employers, many universities also have workplace wellness programs.</s><s xml:id="_Mtx3Efy">Of the nearly 600 universities and liberal arts colleges ranked by U.S. News &amp; World Report, more than two-thirds offer an employee wellness program. <ref type="bibr">6</ref></s><s xml:id="_gSBFfXj">rior to our intervention, UIUC's campus wellness services were run by the University of Illinois Wellness Center, which has one staff member.</s><s xml:id="_BRR9a4E">The Wellness Center only coordinates smoking cessation resources for employees and provides a limited number of wellness activities, many of which are not free.</s><s xml:id="_PN3KXV6">Importantly for our study, the campus did not offer any health screenings or HRAs and did not provide monetary incentives to employees in exchange for participating in wellness activities.</s><s xml:id="_tdGv9rX">Therefore, our intervention effectively represents the introduction of all major components of a wellness program at this worksite.</s></p></div>
