<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_3wpqU4a">PRO review</head><p xml:id="_jVfFqbb"><s xml:id="_psAfAKR">Providers were expected to review PRO results to identify patient issues, but many physicians did not do so routinely, considering PRO review to be time-consuming, disruptive, and a distraction from discussion with the patient.</s><s xml:id="_dxcHhfz">As an oncologist said, "When you've got 20 min with the patient before the next one is in the room, it needs to flow, not be interrupted" (P12).</s><s xml:id="_j3amDyg">Moreover, oncologists regarded PROs as redundant because they "already asked patients things like fatigue and distress" (P12) in routine visits.</s><s xml:id="_wgNrQta">Given that PROs were administered presurgery and postsurgery in orthopedics, surgeons reviewed PROs occasionally during the visit if a patient was unsatisfied with his or her improvement.</s><s xml:id="_8MFPk6q">In this  specific situation, PROs were used to compare the patient's preoperative-and postoperative-health status to demonstrate progress.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_ARgRCAY">Data visualization for PRO review</head><p xml:id="_guujnfv"><s xml:id="_RHNzzZW">Physicians desired easier access to PRO results and more visualization options.</s><s xml:id="_nrHHRZf">For example, they expected to pull up the PRO graph using "fewer clicks" (P6).</s><s xml:id="_Ukjkcrw">When viewing the results, they wanted to have a variety of data display options that allow providers to "select the representation of data and the interpretation of results in the manner that best works for them" (P3).</s><s xml:id="_SZejUqG">Physicians also wanted the functionality to automatically insert PRO results into the clinical note, in conjunction with a description of the meaning of the score.</s><s xml:id="_tD7PZHj">This would help them to identify patient issues "within a few seconds" (P12) and save time for the clinic visit.</s></p></div>
