<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="_Bwr2qMt"><p xml:id="_8PwrF2q"><s xml:id="_A4BuaBW">Introduction E-mental health (i.e. the use of Internet and mobile phones for delivering mental health treatment) has enormous potential to increase access to evidencebased interventions for mental and behavioural disorders, particularly in middle-income countries with wide smartphone use and Internet coverage such as Lebanon <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Arjadi et al. 2015)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ttnV3f3">Lebanon is a small country with a high mental health care need due to a history of conflict and political unrest, an under-resourced and an influx of almost 1.5 million Syrian refugees <ref type="bibr">(UNHCR, 2018)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_pfatxCy">Estimates from 2006 suggest that just 10% of people in Lebanon who had a mental disorder had access to treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Karam et al. 2006</ref>), a figure that has possibly worsened since the refugee crisis.</s><s xml:id="_6Me4whs">Smartphone use and Internet coverage in Lebanon are high, with an estimated 96% of people having a mobile phone subscription and 76% of people regularly using the Internet <ref type="bibr">(International Telecommunications Union, 2017)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KXmtWaN">A recent United Nations report estimates that Syrian refugee communities are also known to have high accessibility to smartphones and the Internet, at approximately 80% household usage <ref type="bibr">(UNICEF et al. 2017)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_82ScrPr"><s xml:id="_grCXM67">The World Health Organization (WHO) has developed an Internet-delivered behavioural activation intervention to treat symptoms of depression among adults, called Step-by-Step <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Carswell et al. 2018)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DmEZsnF">The intervention consists of five approximately 30 min sessions that are delivered on a weekly basis over 8 weeks (to allow flexibility of pace for users).</s><s xml:id="_tbTtPFE">Step-by-Step predominantly uses psychoeducation, behavioural activation (including specifically a session on social support activation) and some simple relaxation techniques.</s><s xml:id="_dU2nfFW">The Step-by-Step sessions consist of a narrated story of a character who has learned how to better manage his/ her mood from their doctor and an interactive part where the user can plan his/her own activities for the week to come.</s><s xml:id="_A9Yzhh4">This story can be watched via video of a slideshow of still images and a voice over, or read like a comic book where the user swipes to see the next illustration with the text beneath.</s><s xml:id="_z3KKwWz">A story was used as the vehicle to transmit the therapeutic content, as stories and storytelling were deemed to be globally and culturally universal and engaging from an anthropological perspective.</s><s xml:id="_STW3CHt">The intervention includes audio-recorded breathing and grounding exercises that beneficiaries can listen to.</s><s xml:id="_UfKdTXp">The companion in the story is tailored according to the gender of the client, and users can choose between characters that may resonate with some of the cultural groups in Lebanon (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_zbjhsU3">woman with/without a headscarf or man with/without a beard).</s><s xml:id="_f8TMuPg">It is noteworthy that the story content is common to all genders in terms of symptoms expressed, with slight adaptations in the activities to enhance relevance to each gender.</s><s xml:id="_BD94fex">Beneficiaries are asked to apply the exercises and activities between the sessions.</s><s xml:id="_vp26ESW">The intervention is supported by trained non-specialist assistants (called 'e-helpers') who have weekly phone or message-based contact with users to provide support and guidance, lasting around 15 min per week.</s></p><p xml:id="_rtRVrhy"><s xml:id="_UjEakan">The WHO, the Ministry of Public Health (MoPH) in Lebanon and other project partners are currently testing the feasibility of using Step-by-Step in Lebanon in a pilot study.</s><s xml:id="_rRYkswU">Following this initial pilot, Step-by-Step is being tested in a number of fully powered randomised controlled trials in Germany, Sweden, Egypt and in <ref type="bibr">Lebanon, commencing in 2018.</ref></s><s xml:id="_2Gjsa6v">Step-by-Step had been written in a generic manner and with global usage in mind, but in order to use <ref type="bibr">Step-by-</ref>Step in Lebanon, it was necessary to sensitively adapt the intervention to the culturally diverse local setting, considering the three main population groups: Lebanese, Palestinians and Syrians.</s></p><p xml:id="_Z6DJPty"><s xml:id="_nnduu7M">Lebanon has a varied cultural landscape, owing to rich religious diversity, a complex colonial and migration history and a highly politicised post-conflict environment.</s><s xml:id="_yNvdwJq">A systematic review identified 22 studies on the use of Western-developed interventions in the Middle East.</s><s xml:id="_Dvqe5VK">In this review, cultural incompatibility accounted for the majority (54%) of barriers to implementation.</s><s xml:id="_BE3nQMc">Further barriers were lack of public awareness around mental health; gender-related norms; stigma and diminished social status of people with mental health problems; and language and presentation of distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(Gearing et al. 2013)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ASMWQtd">This review shows that when delivering psychological interventions in Lebanon that are based on Western concepts of mental disorders, cultural adaptation is needed.</s></p><p xml:id="_PzkDupd"><s xml:id="_bwZgGrk">Cultural and contextual adaptation is an important step of formative work in delivering a pre-existing mental health intervention to culturally divergent client groups <ref type="bibr">(Heim et al. in press)</ref> in potentially diverse settings.</s><s xml:id="_bVSPRYN">Several studies showed that adapted interventions have high effect sizes and that adapting psychological interventions to the local culture can increase their effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Hall et al. 2016)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_s4wckUp">Two meta-analyses found higher effect sizes of adapted interventions than non-adapted ones <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Griner &amp; Smith, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Benish et al. 2011)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_84Evdpb">One additional meta-synthesis that included studies testing depression treatments in non-Western populations found high effect sizes [standardised mean difference (SMD) of -0.72] for adapted interventions compared with their various control conditions (but not compared with the same unadapted intervention) <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chowdhary et al. 2014</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_s9MsREN">Finally, one study compared effect sizes of self-help or minimally guided interventions (i.e.</s><s xml:id="_PtDcxNE">books or online interventions with approximately 15 min of personal guidance per week) that were used cross-culturally.</s><s xml:id="_7tvCw6j">The authors found a high pooled effect size of adapted interventions (SMD = 0.81) and that the efficacy of the intervention increased with a point increase in the extent of cultural adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Harper Shehadeh et al. 2016)</ref> showing a dose-response effect.</s><s xml:id="_hQVqaxf">On the other hand, in a recent meta-analysis of studies testing psychological interventions for the treatment of depression in low-and middle-income countries, cultural adaption did not affect effect sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Cuijpers et al. 2018)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_n4UPhJH">To what extent and what kind ofcultural adaptation is important is still subject of current research.</s></p><p xml:id="_fZwaSN4"><s xml:id="_qcfpdqs">One shortcoming in cultural adaptation research is that adaptation methods are not often described in detail by authors, with two of the above metaanalyses citing incompleteness (within publications) or difficulty in attaining information on cultural adaptation methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Chowdhary et al. 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Harper Shehadeh et al. 2016)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_cZ8MKv4">This highlights a need for research teams or intervention implementers to publish their methods of adaptation and report adaptations in a concise way.</s></p><p xml:id="_Gk333XN"><s xml:id="_Byw27bN">Some common elements of methods used across studies that cite adaptation methods include ensuring that cultural adaptation should be ecologically valid and informed by research with stakeholders, use flexible methods with the aim of improving engagement, be acceptable and relevant while maintaining a balance of fidelity to the original intervention, and have a cultural fit <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Saez-Santiago et al. 2017)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_t2u2XFN">It is important to document adaptations as well as the reasons for them <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bernal &amp; Rodriguez, 2012)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_GS6bPFJ">For systematic documentation and dissemination of methods, it is necessary to conceptualise and report the adaptations that have been made, which can be complex when considering the abstract nature of cultural needs and specificities.</s></p><p xml:id="_pNsnPb6"><s xml:id="_fPt45XQ">The aim of this article is to share experiences and methods that were used during the contextual adaptation of the Step-by-Step e-mental health behavioural intervention.</s><s xml:id="_EZdvTDQ"><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Hwang (2006)</ref> stresses the importance of using bottom-up processes in cultural adaptation, i.e. involving community members and key informants when developing culture-specific interventions, as opposed to top-down cultural adaptations of an existing unadapted treatment developed for other groups.</s><s xml:id="_xhdKZA8">This view parallels the distinction between etic and emic research in mental health.</s><s xml:id="_yCWghED">The etic perspective assumes that diagnostic categories of mental disorders and corresponding treatments are universally applicable, whereas emic approaches address cultural concepts of distress and recommend using cultural-specific treatments and outcome measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Kohrt et al. 2014)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_F7V3FX4">We opted for a careful balance between these two approaches: Step-by-Step is based on evidence-based techniques and designed by the WHO, thus developed primarily top-down, but the process of cultural adaptation was based on a bottom-up approach, as described below.</s></p></div>
