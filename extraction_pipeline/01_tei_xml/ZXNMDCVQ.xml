xml:id="_pnKEFhG">With increasing volumes of requests for help <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> that are triaged on a first-come-first-serve basis, time-sensitive crisis messages from high-risk individuals may wait in a queue behind less urgent messages.</s><s xml:id="_rKZfhdN">We built CMD-1, an NLP-enabled system that detects and surfaces crisis messages to enable faster triage from a crisis response team.</s><s xml:id="_mu2mD8w">We deployed CMD-1 within a large, national telehealth provider platform and performed a prospective validation on over 120k messages coming from over 30k distinct patients.</s><s xml:id="_TxUSQep">We found that CMD-1 was able to detect high-risk messages with high accuracy (97.5% sensitivity and 97.0% specificity) and enabled crisis specialists to triage crisis messages within 10 min (median) of message receipt.</s></p><p xml:id="_A2K4Q2B"><s xml:id="_KJwZkcs">The speed at which a high-risk individual in crisis is contacted is especially important because immediate intervention can ultimately divert them away from a suicide attempt (Kelly et al., 2008;  McClatchey et al., 2019).</s><s xml:id="_XZAManK">CMD-1 reduced response times to crisis chat messages by nearly two orders of magnitude, from over 9 h on average to 9 min (median).</s><s xml:id="_WAKDq8c">This supports the findings of previous work using ML to enhance a clinical team's capability to satisfactorily address the crises of high-risk individuals (Crisis Text Line, and Xu et al., 2021).</s><s xml:id="_PdBGa3V">For example, Crisis Text Line used a machine learning model to reduce wait times for high risk texters from 8 min (median, 75th percentile: 35 min) down to 3 min (median, 75th percentile: 11 min).</s><s xml:id="_Vn5zza9">One key advantage of CMD-1 is that it was integrated within the patient's clinical workflow, allowing clinicians to be notified of patient crises as they happen.</s><s xml:id="_xdQP6pW">Indeed, we have shown that notifying clinicians of patient crises can lead to more timely follow-up care .</s><s xml:id="_gghqwum">Crisis response systems that are integrated within provider organizations have the potential to impact key aspects of patient care.</s><s xml:id="_BDqzwHe">Future work might investigate the impact of CMD-1 and response times on downstream health outcomes such as hospitalization or ED utilization.</s><s xml:id="_hQDuEUM">Despite growing interest in ML applications in healthcare in recent years, ML models are rarely deployed in health systems, with most studies presenting model development without translation to clinical care <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">14</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_HaRwYdz">Deploying a ML model into clinical workflows requires technical considerations (e.g., model accuracy),

type="bibr" target="#b13">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_PhecufV">In developing CMD-1, a cross-functional team of clinicians worked together to address these

performance of CMD-1 in the prospective test set compared to the retrospective test set warranted further investigation.</s><s xml:id="_WuTzGdh">We hypothesized that the higher AUC (0.98 vs. 0.82) and higher specificity (0.97 vs. 0.12) in the prospective test set compared to the retrospective test set was due to differences in both the data sampling methodology as well as class imbalance.</s><s xml:id="_pjB5TRu">To increase the prevalence of true crises in the training and retrospective test sets, we included all messages sent in the seven days prior to a true crisis, as recorded in a crisis event tracker.</s><s xml:id="_3PY2UVQ">While this enabled us to enrich our training set with true crisis messages, the included non-crisis messages were not representative of non-crisis messages in the deployment setting.</s><s xml:id="_sWzJM9t">We hypothesized that the non-crisis messages preceding crisis events were more difficult to distinguish from crisis messages than non-crisis messages not associated with crisis events, and that this explained the lower AUC and specificity during retrospective evaluation.</s><s xml:id="_KDyrhCJ">For example, the message "I want nothing.</s><s xml:id="_yBUu52R">I used to want things, now I don't want anything… I sense a danger", which preceded a crisis, was likely more difficult to accurately classify as a non-crisis than the message "Thanks for helping me meet with someone," which did not precede a crisis.</s><s xml:id="_SFAnt4C">The fact that non-crisis messages in the prospective test set were shorter than those in the training and retrospective test sets lends further support to this idea.</s></p><p xml:id="_jYwvbKs"><s xml:id="_q8Hu4Cy">To confirm this hypothesis, we show that the median predicted probability for non-crisis messages in the retrospective test set was 0.079 [IQR: 0.026-0.170],</s><s xml:id="_7gm9zw9">while the median predicted probability for non-crisis messages in the prospective test set  was 0.019 [IQR: 0.0027-0.069],</s><s xml:id="_Bhdkeph">which is much to the model's decision boundary of 0.01 (SI Table <ref type="table">5</ref>).</s></p><p xml:id="_PtdHTnh"><s xml:id="_a3CkrVF">In addition, the difference between retrospective and prospective test set values caused by data sampling methodology was exacerbated by the increased proportion of non-crisis messages in the prospective test set.</s><s xml:id="_vVqjRdG">To further confirm this hypothesis, we conducted a sensitivity analysis where we randomly downsampled the proportion of non-crisis messages in the prospective test set so that the event rate matched that of the retrospective test set.</s><s xml:id="_bYfTB8g">Over 100 iterations, the median AUC on the modified prospective test set with down-sampled true negatives was 0.82 [IQR: 0.82-0.82],</s><s xml:id="_DWC3GNb">which nearly exactly matches the AUC of 0.82 in the retrospective test set (SI Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_8ea4Kwq">This suggests that the performance of CMD-1 was comparable in both retrospective and prospective test sets, and that differences in AUC could largely be attributed to differences in the proportion of and type of noncrisis messages.</s><s xml:id="_qMkEMP5">Other contributing factors to the differences in model performance may include changes in the patient population between April and October 2022.</s><s xml:id="_MjXtn7e">For example, compared to patients in the retrospective test set, patients in the prospective test set were more likely to be male, to have generalized anxiety disorder, and to have been in treatment longer.</s></p><p xml:id="_YfTRzfS"><s xml:id="_yAap8W3">One limitation of our approach is our use of the crisis terms filter.</s><s xml:id="_YBcCemz">As discussed above, the terms filter excluded messages from being evaluated by the NLP model if they did not contain at least one phrase from the filter.</s><s xml:id="_g2BEdmx">While our filter was broad and curated manually by experts, some messages that may otherwise be flagged as crises could be filtered out by the terms filter.</s><s xml:id="_8eYNFAY">One way to quantify this would be an ablative study-removing one term from the terms list at a time and quantify changes in our experimental outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_BeskWNf">Using this, one can estimate the number of messages that would be flagged as crises after adding more terms to the filter.</s></p><p xml:id="_fKe6EA6"><s xml:id="_NZSEDjG">Another limitation is the size of our training set and the fact that we artificially enriched the training set for true crises.</s><s xml:id="_qAaeJUM">As described in "Methods" section, due to the low prevalence of crisis messages (&lt;1%), we enriched the training set and retrospective test set for crisis messages for efficiency of data labeling.</s><s xml:id="_NEwpmDF">The training set was 721 messages, and the prevalence of crisis messages in the prospective test set was 0.6% compared to 32% in the training and retrospective test sets.</s><s xml:id="_JK63pTM">Applying a prediction model to a dataset with a different event rate than the dataset used to train the model can result in mis-calibrated predicted risks, thus impacting downstream classification <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">17</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_3PQtXmX">Further, class imbalance corrections like random under-sampling of non-events without subsequent recalibration has been shown to lead to miscalibration.</s><s xml:id="_y8JNe4f">There are two reasons why these risks of miscalibration were mitigated when deploying CMD-1.</s><s xml:id="_jJQaEnB">First, CMD-1 is a classifier and not a continuous risk prediction model, meaning that the impact of miscalibration on model discrimination is limited to predicted risks close to the classification threshold.</s><s xml:id="_mXXuBMN">This is reinforced by the strong sensitivity and specificity of the model on the prospective test set.</s><s xml:id="_q4Pm8D7">Second, deploying CMD-1 in a population where the event rate is lower than that of the training dataset would be expected to lead to inflated predicted risks and therefore more false positives, not more false negatives.</s><s xml:id="_5z5m4Bx">This is acceptable given our 20 to 1 preference for false positives over false negatives for this use case.</s></p><p xml:id="_gdfUD8U"><s xml:id="_aasdzcE">The moderate PPV of CMD-1 could also be considered a limitation.</s><s xml:id="_UDm5Mbq">With approximately four out of every 10 messages surfaced being a false positive, there is ample opportunity to improve the accuracy of CMD-1 to decrease wasted human effort of triaging false positives.</s><s xml:id="_py8uxpp">Exploring the performance of other word embeddings like word2vec or other prediction functions like support vector machines, random forest, or deep learning architectures such as large language models could improve the PPV of CMD-1 without sacrificing sensitivity.</s></p><p xml:id="_UC2xH7J"><s xml:id="_N9aXnBV">Overall, CMD-1 serves as a promising model for ML-enabled solutions to drive improvements in mental healthcare delivery.</s><s xml:id="_MYRJHPD">By using technology to automate a manual task, CMD-1 increases operational efficiency and reduces wait times for patients.</s><s xml:id="_J4MKqQS">With demand for mental health services far exceeding supply, providers must leverage technology and data to increase access to care and make the best use of available human capacity.</s></p></div>
