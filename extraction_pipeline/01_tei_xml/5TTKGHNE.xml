<ref type="bibr">Ryan et al., 1997)</ref>; rather, it examines the conditions that elicit and sustain, versus subdue and diminish, this innate propensity.</s></p><p xml:id="_xApecBN"><s xml:id="_Ua49HP3">Cognitive evaluation theory (CET) was presented by <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">Deci and Ryan (1985)</ref> as a subtheory within SDT that had the aim of specifying factors that explain variability in intrinsic motivation.</s><s xml:id="_nrUqgvZ">CET is framed in terms of social and environmental factors that facilitate versus undermine intrinsic motivation, using language that reflects the assumption that intrinsic motivation, being inherent, will be catalyzed when individuals are in conditions that conduce toward its expression.</s><s xml:id="_VsZgGAE">In other words, it will flourish if circumstances permit.</s><s xml:id="_2REfRDJ">Put in this way, the study of conditions that facilitate versus undermine intrinsic motivation is an important first step in understanding sources of both alienation and liberation of the positive aspects of human nature.</s></p><p xml:id="_YUjFWxZ"><s xml:id="_XjeE3Bd">CET, which focuses on the fundamental needs for competence and autonomy, was formulated to integrate results from initial laboratory experiments on the effects of rewards, feedback, and other external events on intrinsic motivation, and was subsequently tested and extended by field studies in various settings.</s><s xml:id="_b2hTnXc">The theory argues, first, that social-contextual events (e.g., feedback, communications, rewards) that conduce toward feelings of competence during action can enhance intrinsic motivation for that action.</s><s xml:id="_75jvYpx">Accordingly, optimal challenges, effectance-prorooting feedback, and freedom from demeaning evaluations were all found to facilitate intrinsic motivation.</s><s xml:id="_2zTEdQg">For example, early studies showed that positive performance feedback enhanced intrinsic motivation, whereas negative performance feedback diminished it <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Deci, 1975)</ref>, and re- search by <ref type="bibr">Vallerand and Reid (1984)</ref> showed that these effects were mediated by perceived competence.</s></p><p xml:id="_zervMkZ"><s xml:id="_jDfG2rM">CET further specifies, and studies have shown <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Fisher, 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Ryan, 1982)</ref>, that feelings of competence will not enhance intrinsic motivation unless accompanied by a sense of autonomy or, in attributional terms, by an internal perceived locus of causality <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(deCharms, 1968)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5EWH9UH">Thus, according to CET, people must not only experience competence or efficacy, they must also experience their behavior as self-determined for intrinsic motivation to be in evidence.</s><s xml:id="_fqr9yTY">This requires either immediate contextual supports for autonomy and competence or abiding inner re- s o u r c e s <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Reeve, 1996)</ref> that are typically the result of prior developmental supports for perceived autonomy and competence.</s></p><p xml:id="_DAb8brG"><s xml:id="_G8XYWfp">In fact, most of the research on the effects of environmental events in intrinsic motivation has focused on the issue of autonomy versus control rather than that of competence.</s><s xml:id="_pbtCdRS">Research on this issue has been considerably m o r e controversial.</s><s xml:id="_WGADwWX">It began with the repeated demonstration that extrinsic rewards can undermine intrinsic motivation.</s><s xml:id="_2tNQe68"><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Deci (1975)</ref> interpreted these results in terms of rewards facilitating a more external perceived locus of causality (i.e., diminished autonomy).</s><s xml:id="_4uypRqJ">Although the issue of reward effects has been hotly debated, a recent, comprehensive meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Deci, Koestner, &amp; Ryan, 1999)</ref> confirmed, in spite of claims to the contrary by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Eisenberger and Cameron (1996)</ref>, that all expected tangible rewards made contingent on task performance do reliably undermine intrinsic motivation.</s></p><p xml:id="_t5NxpVr"><s xml:id="_Q462yqA">Also, research revealed that not only tangible rewards but also threats, deadlines, directives, pressured evaluations, and imposed goals diminish intrinsic motivation because, like tangible rewards, they conduce toward an external perceived locus of causality.</s><s xml:id="_WJFq7ep">In contrast, choice, acknowledgment of feelings, and opportunities for selfdirection were found to enhance intrinsic motivation because they allow people a greater feeling of autonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_URNkeRD">Field studies have further shown that teachers who are autonomy supportive (in contrast to controlling) catalyze in their students greater intrinsic motivation, curiosity, and desire for challenge (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Deci, Nezlek, &amp;

Ryan, 1987;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b72">Utman, 1997)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_UT6Pxy3">Similarly, studies showed that autonomy-supportive parents, relative to controlling parents, have children who are more intrinsically motivated <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Grolnick, Deci, &amp; Ryan, 1997)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ZbvQA97">Such findings generalized to other domains such as sport and music in which supports for autonomy and competence by parents and mentors incite more intrinsic motivation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Frederick &amp;

Deci, 1996)</ref>, whereas the pursuit and attainment of other goals does not contribute to and may even detract from basic need satisfactions, leading to ill-being.</s><s xml:id="_xe27wp2">In accord with this reasoning, T. <ref type="bibr">Kasser and</ref><ref type="bibr">Ryan (1993, 1996)</ref> examined individual differences in the emphasis people place on intrinsic aspirations (goals such as affiliation, personal growth, and community that directly satisfy basic needs) compared with extrinsic aspirations (goals such as wealth, fame, and image that at best indirectly satisfy the needs).</s><s xml:id="_bs6HuTA">They found, first, that placing strong relative importance on intrinsic aspirations was pos-itively associated with well-being indicators such as selfesteem, self-actualization, and the inverse of depression and anxiety, whereas placing strong relative importance on extrinsic aspirations was negatively related to these well-being indicators.</s><s xml:id="_nTnCEHE"><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Ryan, Chirkov, Little, Sheldon, Timoshina, and Deci (1999)</ref> replicated these findings in a Russian sample, attesting to the potential generalizability of the findings across cultures.</s></p><p xml:id="_hUubwSY"><s xml:id="_C3XBRNt">These findings go beyond goal importance per se.</s><s xml:id="_Cd7ewCz">Both <ref type="bibr">Ryan, Chirkov, et al. and T. Kasser and Ryan (in press</ref>) have found that whereas self-reported attainment of intrinsic aspirations was positively associated with wellbeing, attainment of extrinsic aspirations was not.</s><s xml:id="_bmRcArY">Further, <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Sheldon and Kasser (1998)</ref> found in a longitudinal study that well-being was enhanced by attainment of intrinsic goals, 'whereas success at extrinsic goals provided little benefit.</s><s xml:id="_H4xXwKZ">Together, these results suggest that even highly efficacious people may experience less than optimal wellbeing if they pursue and successfully attain goals that do not fulfill basic psychological needs.</s><s xml:id="_ce3kwkp">We hasten to add, however, that the meaning of specific goals is culturally influenced, so that how specific goals relate to well-being can vary across cultures, although the relation between underlying need satisfaction and well-being is theorized to be invariant.</s></p><p xml:id="_ebGz7R3"><s xml:id="_KWvaSc5">Clearly, there are many factors that lead people to emphasize certain life goals that may not be need fulfilling.</s><s xml:id="_HZX8tj5">For example, exposure to the commercial media can prompt a locus on materialism <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">(Richins, 1987)</ref>, which provides only fleeting satisfactions and could actually detract from basic need fulfillment and, thus, well-being.</s><s xml:id="_VmzK3SM">Prior deficits in need fulfillment (e.g., from poor caregiving) might also lead individuals to yearn for more extrinsic goals as a substitute or compensatory mechanism.</s><s xml:id="_374TY5a">In fact, T. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">Kasser, Ryan, Zax, and Sameroff (1995)</ref> found that teens who had been exposed to cold, controlling maternal care (as assessed with ratings by the teens, mothers, and observers) were more likely to develop materialistic orientations, compared with better nurtured teens who more strongly valued the intrinsic goals of personal growth, relationships, and community.</s><s xml:id="_26gvN3C">In short, cultural and developmental influences produce variations in the importance of goals, the pursuit of which, in turn, yields different satisfaction of basic needs and different levels of well-being.</s></p><p xml:id="_35WUhXF"><s xml:id="_YWcYmHj">In other research, we have examined the relations of people's reports of need satisfaction to indicators of wellbeing in various settings.</s><s xml:id="_zEBCa8s">For example, V. <ref type="bibr">Kasser and Ryan (in press)</ref> found that supports for autonomy and relatedness predicted greater well-being among nursing home residents.</s><s xml:id="_hthbDkG"><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Baard, Deci, and Ryan (1998)</ref> showed that employees' experiences of satisfaction of the needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness in the workplace predicted their performance and well-being at work.</s><s xml:id="_Qzdxn6z">Such research shows that within specific domains, especially those central to the lives of individuals, need satisfaction is correlated with improved well-being.</s></p><p xml:id="_szDb2g6"><s xml:id="_PDtv8Gd">A more compelling way of demonstrating the essential relations between need fulfillments and mental health has been the examination of role-to-role and day-to-day fluc-tuations in basic need satisfaction and their direct effects on variability in well-being, while controlling for individual differences and various confounding variables.</s><s xml:id="_PjWvZbp">For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">Sheldon et al. (1997)</ref> demonstrated that satisfaction in each of several life roles (e.g., student, employee, friend), relative to the individual's own mean satisfaction, was attributable to the degree to which that role supports authenticity and autonomous functioning.</s><s xml:id="_8r3n5TN">Similarly, in a study that examined daily variations in well-being, Sheldon, <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">Reis, and Ryan (1996)</ref> used hierarchical linear modeling to show that within-person daily fluctuations in the satisfaction of autonomy and competence needs predicted within-person fluctuations in outcomes such as mood, vitality, physical symptoms, and self-esteem.</s><s xml:id="_766Ggcx">In a more recent study, <ref type="bibr">Reis, Sheldon, Gable, Roscoe, and Ryan (in press)</ref> found that variations in the fulfillment of each of the three needs (i.e., competence, autonomy, and relatedness) independently predicted variability in daily well-being.</s><s xml:id="_Z3ATJ22">These studies support the view that basic psychological needs are determinative with regard to optimal experience and well-being in daily life.</s></p></div>
