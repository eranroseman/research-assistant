<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_MWaFbqR">User Experience and Blended Treatment</head><p xml:id="_vZYbRU3"><s xml:id="_U3aEkNZ">One of the main elements clarifying the individual's use of services in general <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and eHealth services, such as blended treatment, in particular <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, is the user experience (UX).</s><s xml:id="_D7Eshdr">UX refers to what people personally encounter, undergo, or live through while using, interacting with, or being confronted passively with systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3tFGNAC">Systems can denote products, services, and artifacts-separately or combined in one form or another-that a person can interact with <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_M88z77j"><s xml:id="_8rP5SNB">Usually, the term UX refers to products, services, and objects that a person interacts with through a user interface <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gvksgaP">However, for this study, we widened the scope of this term to explore the UX of a service (ie, blended treatment) that alternately uses computer-mediated communication via a user interface and F2F communication in counselling sessions.</s></p><p xml:id="_m3q2zAX"><s xml:id="_RZnCCme">Although a number of studies have examined the blended treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, little is known about the patients' UX specifically with blended treatments.</s><s xml:id="_whhdHJJ">An evaluation study (n=7) of a blended cognitive behavioral treatment for major depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> showed that while the patients' pretreatment expectations were mainly neutral and some skeptical patients found it hard to start with the Web-based sessions, most patients appeared to have positive attitudes toward the blended treatment afterward.</s><s xml:id="_zTYNAfJ">Another study <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> (n=14) on internet-based cognitive behavioral therapy for depression supported by short F2F consultations found that a sense of relatedness in terms of feeling connected to the therapist and being able to identify with the Web-based treatment may increase patients' adherence to the blended treatment.</s><s xml:id="_QkaHjgy">Both the studies suggest that the elements of patients' UX, such as expectations, usability, and identification, play a role in adherence to a blended treatment and should further be explored.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_RCnWvms">Patients' User Experience</head><p xml:id="_RW28BCW"><s xml:id="_TDeK5vV">For the patients' perspective on the blended care treatment, Hassenzahl's model of UX from a user's perspective was adapted <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gwMg4Vf">This process-oriented constructivist model defines five key elements and their functional relations (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_YbBSdx5">Basically, the model states that while getting in contact with the features of a product or service, a process is triggered, in which the user constructs the UX (this is illustrated by the grey arrow in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_Z3RH5sQ">In the beginning, the user constructs-moderated by the person's standards and expectations-an apparent character of the product or service.</s><s xml:id="_wK9EPN2">Moderated by the specific usage situation, the apparent character will then finally mediate a number of consequences.</s></p><p xml:id="_YvBgwbW"><s xml:id="_9R3NVsN">The features of the service (in this case the blended treatment) are selected and combined by the treatment developers independently of the patients that ultimately follow the treatment.</s><s xml:id="_rSDKuVq">Since the features are not constructed by the users, the product features only play a minor role in this study.</s><s xml:id="_rqQsFRD">In turn, the focus is placed on the patients' response to the treatment's features to explore the UX from the user's perspective in a narrower sense.</s><s xml:id="_UCQJVVg">This means that the UX from a user's perspective is built based on only four of these five key elements: (1) the patient's standards and expectations, (2) the apparent character, (3) the usage situation, and (4) the consequences.</s><s xml:id="_z5NAtq9">In the following paragraphs, each key element is described and illustrated by examples of how it applies to the blended treatment in this study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_5uNg6xE">Features</head><p xml:id="_mRjtNxt"><s xml:id="_7zcPdAX">The features of a product or service refer to its content, presentation, functionality, and interaction <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ZwY75pU">The content of the treatment of this study-Blended Smoking Cessation Treatment (BSCT)-refers, for example, to the behavioral change techniques for smoking cessation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> that comprises BSCT.</s><s xml:id="_gmd9UT3">The presentation refers to the clinical surrounding as BSCT is part of the routine care setting of a hospital.</s><s xml:id="_q3UkFvK">Functionality and interaction refer to the F2F and Web-based sessions, which offer synchronous interactions with the counselor (eg, functions, such as providing feedback on behavior and building rapport) and asynchronous counselor-independent interactions with the Web-based system (eg, functions, such as self-recording of smoking behavior via a Web-based smoking diary).</s><s xml:id="_6nrQMsy">More details about the study intervention are provided below in the Methods section.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_GEnTpGv">Person</head><p xml:id="_3WKTVea"><s xml:id="_6jBUNJw">The patients' standards and expectations are based on their experiences with the other services <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> with which the patient can compare BSCT.</s><s xml:id="_CjW6nx7">If a patient compares BSCT with, for example, earlier experiences in health care, smoking cessation support, F2F treatment, or use of computers and internet, the patient may start BSCT with a subjective standard, such as "using the computer for treatment is too difficult for me," or with an expectation, such as "blended treatment will be more comfortable because I can partly do treatment at home."</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_xBsTYQ2">Apparent Character</head><p xml:id="_e37Dvhh"><s xml:id="_DHNXFaq">When confronted with a service, an apparent character is constructed by the user.</s><s xml:id="_zfgVWrK">The apparent character is a cognitive structure representing pragmatic and hedonic attributes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_MwPku4r">Pragmatic attributes refer to the utility (eg, "supporting," "useful") and usability (eg, "clear" and "easy to use") of a service, such as BSCT.</s><s xml:id="_7kHmGme">Hedonic attributes of BSCT refer to stimulation (eg, "novel and interesting" and "makes me think"), identification (eg, "my style"), and evocation (eg, "reminds me of filling in tax forms").</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_AMvDeDT">Situation</head><p xml:id="_JADUkzQ"><s xml:id="_ZQvWx6w">The usage situation moderates the consequences of the apparent character <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> and refers to the technical, task-related, physical, and social contexts.</s><s xml:id="_fm5qRsp">These situations are different between patients and over the course of the treatment, especially for the Web-based sessions.</s><s xml:id="_CfwgwRU">For example, filling in a smoking diary while being on your own in a silent surrounding may result in different consequences than doing this in the living room with a partner and children around you.</s></p></div>
