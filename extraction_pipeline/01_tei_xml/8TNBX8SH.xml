were analysed using thematic coding <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Flick, 1998)</ref> in order to make comparisons between council responses (see APSE, 2012a for fuller details of the research

target="#b36">(Halliwell, 2012)</ref>, and the focus of this paper, is the relative absence of an evidence base, by comparison with education services for example, to support the case for investment

the APSE research found, SRS are assimilated into wider cultural, community or education strategies and have weak administrative and political status (APSE, 2012a).</s><s xml:id="_aKFBjKB">Overall, SRS operate in an increasingly challenging financial and political context where the severity of the on-going reductions in local government finance may signal the rapid decline of services that

services.</s><s xml:id="_4DN3pDG">A core challenge facing local authorities is seeking legitimacy for decisions shaping the allocation of public funds where outcomes and impact are unclear.</s><s xml:id="_jaEb9s4">As <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Bennington and Moore (2011)</ref> identify, performance management frameworks employed by local authorities fail to fully capture the inputs,

of financial proxies is challenging where none have been established or there is little data available.</s><s xml:id="_pgjmPR8">Discussion of these issues is beyond the scope of this paper, but it can

number of challenges for service managers seeking to demonstrate the social value and impact of specific components in a broad portfolio.</s><s xml:id="_scqJt8g">In the current financial context, where further reductions in SRS can be anticipated, a key motivation for using SROI is to attract funding (NPC, 2010), strengthen the provider's position in a competitive environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">(Lyon et al., 2010)</ref> and SROI can enable commissioners to make more informed decisions in procurement processes <ref type="bibr">(NEF, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr">(NEF, ,

SRS within local authority provision in future years.</s><s xml:id="_eTvpAP6">Potentially, given that health is to become a component of local authority provision in 2013, a SROI analysis can be used to demonstrate the financial and social benefits of services that act as pre-care interventions.</s><s xml:id="_cwV26Bt">If however, health services are fundamentally oriented towards the defence of

preferred by councils, within an "ensuring" state model of provision <ref type="bibr">(APSE, 2012b)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5fkZ57h">"Making the case" is of course not a guarantee that services will be retained, but not having a case at all is no longer an option, if the principles of the Social Value Act are to take effect in practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">(White, 2012)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_k2CUUSr">However, limited buy-in to Social Value Act can be anticipated across many local authorities where there is little compulsion to do so unless commissioners choose to include leisure services such as sport and recreation within local corporate objectives.</s></p><p xml:id="_q4qQNeM"><s xml:id="_f2eZJzF">It can be also be argued that for SROI to have a meaningful impact on services, it will be necessary to replace an organisational culture centred on retaining service areas that operate as silos with a culture where the valued components of SRS are embedded within broader local government objectives around "place shaping", "community engagement" and "healthy lifestyles", for example.</s><s xml:id="_MepQccA">One recommendation of the APSE report is that service managers and elected members "need to look beyond municipal boundaries, departmental silos and service areas in designing services" (APSE, 2012a, p. 7).</s><s xml:id="_TgHzSRK">As the APSE research found, in only one-third of councils is there a degree of integration between leisure-related services and the wider strategic objectives of the local authority.</s><s xml:id="_jjpe8Gh">Without strategic alignment of services, there is little reason to invest in SROI, and to date, few councils have done so.</s></p><p xml:id="_aWggE6x"><s xml:id="_65dKv4u">A key potential strength of SROI is found in the transparency of the process, open to scrutiny by all stakeholders and funders.</s><s xml:id="_NBdQ2BT">Given the complexity of mapping change and proving a correlation between service objectives and outcomes and impact, SROI invites critique and encourages open discussion around what is of value, how this can be demonstrated, and critically, who benefits from public services.</s><s xml:id="_qBJzRU2">As APSE (2012a, p. 7) state, "A significant 'democratic deficit' exists at the local level with SRS needing greater visibility in and engagement with local communities" and the use of SROI can contribute to addressing this significant challenge.</s><s xml:id="_aCGYhnu">However, leisure service managers may not currently have the expertise or capacity to deliver services via a model of co-production, or pro-active leadership from elected members that aligns leisure, sport and recreation provision within a broader model of strategic commissioning.</s></p><p xml:id="_KQqJD78"><s xml:id="_YBe5HGD">More positively, given that there is a pre-existing culture of performance management in SRS, funders and budget holders may find the expression of social value in financial terms compelling.</s><s xml:id="_nPwc6Cw">Replacing centrally imposed key performance indicators (KPIs), where the focus is on inputs and outputs, rather than outcomes and impact, with measurements of value and impact set locally, offers an opportunity to local service managers that may lead to adopting SROI analysis.</s><s xml:id="_Fh78G6C">Nonetheless, many service managers may perceive risks associated with untried methods of analysis.</s><s xml:id="_EkD9MC3">For example, highly valued and protected services may not be subject to analysis in case the findings inadvertently highlight a limited social and financial value.</s><s xml:id="_2WnpNcq">APSE (2012a) make a distinction between senior officers in leisure departments that have demonstrated innovation in defending services and those authorities where, as <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Copestake (2007</ref><ref type="bibr">Copestake ( , p. 1722</ref>) observed, the organisational mission drifts over time towards</s></p><p xml:id="_3xNJ8Za"><s xml:id="_BzbcHJR">The case for sport and recreation goals that are more easily quantified, implying a "deeper problem of lack of transparency and weak performance management".</s><s xml:id="_6Cj8ns7">Discretionary services such as SRS stand at a cross-roads in local government: either service areas become a minor and marginal outpost offering a few (largely unproven or ineffective) safety-net services to residents unable to access private and third sector provision, or service leaders and local politicians with control of the leisure portfolio "make the case" for sport and recreation provision and integrate discretionary services with components of statutory provision.</s><s xml:id="_EXN57jT">In this context, SROI is one instrument that can be used to acquire a degree of legitimacy and secure resources as part of advocacy.</s><s xml:id="_q3Rfrnc">However, as the APSE (2012a) research highlighted, without political support and a degree of embeddedness within administrative processes and organisational culture, even the most conclusive evidence arrived at through the most rigorous research processes using effective tools of impact assessment will not result in retaining services.</s><s xml:id="_dbpdjYY">In this regard, APSE (2012a) make a distinction between those councils that chose to pre-empt the current financial crisis and took action to defend valued services, and those authorities that did not, or were unable to do so.</s><s xml:id="_NAHAhss">In sum, it is likely that some local authorities will utilise SROI whereas others will not, for a number of reasons, including: lack of an existing evidence base; the costs associated with gathering primary data; lack of expertise; fear of highlighting existing weaknesses in services; and budgets being committed to what it is politically opportune to retain.</s></p><p xml:id="_FbugFXF"><s xml:id="_ypq3h9s">Finally, it is clear that sport and recreation services can contribute to social policy objectives and SROI can be of value in this respect.</s><s xml:id="_C8YuXUn">For example, SROI can and has been used to assess: increasing the number of young people in education, training and employment (and reducing the costs of NEET) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Coles et al., 2010)</ref>; reducing anti-social behaviour and youth crime <ref type="bibr">(LSE,
