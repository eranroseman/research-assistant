in age, race, or insurance status between those who accepted and declined the invitation to enroll.</s><s xml:id="_mqnhnQS">Patients who did not have a health care appointment during the enrollment

escalated care via Cancer COVID Watch were managed as outpatients.</s><s xml:id="_we3r3se">There were four patients (15%) who presented to the ED without escalating via Cancer COVID Watch first.</s><s xml:id="_4yjaXhD">Since all four patients were admitted to the hospital for acute lifethreatening illnesses (COVID-19, pyelonephritis, Clostridium difficile colitis, or cancer-related chronic hypoxic respiratory failure), escalation within Cancer COVID Watch is unlikely to have changed their disposition to the ED.</s></p><p xml:id="_5eMDM8a"><s xml:id="_vsJxy7M">Strengths of Cancer COVID Watch include its integration in the EMR, high user satisfaction, and rapid implementation.</s><s xml:id="_P85yGDd">EMR integration enabled oncology clinicians to directly enroll patients for closer observation and facilitated efficient communication to the patient's primary oncology providers.</s><s xml:id="_eywEhAS">Given the ubiquity of electronic health records and no additional staff hiring or reconfiguration of roles, this intervention and its findings may be generalizable to other cancer settings.</s><s xml:id="_D9ekQw8">Cancer COVID Watch enrollees were highly satisfied, suggesting that the use and frequency of automated text messages in our program were user-friendly.</s><s xml:id="_xEmqpk8">c Overall response rate is the sum of all responses divided by the sum of all checkins, whereas the individual response rate refers to the calculation of response rates for each participant.</s></p><p xml:id="_wsQxavg"><s xml:id="_vn9VPp2">However, only four patients responded to the user satisfaction survey question, thus limiting the generalizability of these findings.</s><s xml:id="_grFqrzJ">Finally, the successful rapid development and implementation of the program was in part because of our institutional infrastructure, given similar text-based symptom-monitoring programs have been used by our institution. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s xml:id="_YwfeGzp">ere are multiple limitations associated with our singleinstitution study.</s><s xml:id="_KYvFM7m">First, Cancer COVID Watch was deployed after the initial peak of COVID-19, and thus, enrollment in this

xml:id="_Wj2waSP">Patients occasionally sent descriptive messages with their current symptoms in response to checkins (eg, "My temperature was 100.6 this morning"), which the program could not interpret.</s><s xml:id="_B3wGAtH">Clinicians who enroll patients in similar programs should emphasize that these programs cannot understand complicated responses.</s><s xml:id="_UGT2sKJ">Finally, the availability of NP and/or after-hours oncologist triage may limit the scalability of the program.</s><s xml:id="_ZXBJPFj">Future iterations of Cancer COVID Watch will explore translating text into multiple languages, adopting a voice call option, automatically escalating patients who send concerning responses, and investigating the added clinician time necessary to maintain this program in a cancer care setting.</s></p><p xml:id="_DnF6pxJ"><s xml:id="_RkChCmK">In conclusion, an automated text-based COVID-19 symptom monitoring-program is feasible in patients with cancer and suspected or
