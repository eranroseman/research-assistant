social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xgHcC5Q">Key advantages of using this innovative technology include reductions in treatment barriers such as time and geographical boundaries, and treatment costs while offering timely responses to mental health needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_js6hTq6">A meta-analysis of 17 trials of 1,480 participants showed that computerized and web-based intervention were effective at reducing depression and anxiety compared with inactive control <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qeT5hXD">A systematic review of 89 studies demonstrated that nearly 81% of digital mental health programs are effective or partially

the global need for scalable mental health interventions, the World Health Organization developed Stepby-Step (SbS), a transdiagnostic and guided digital mental health intervention primarily targeting

target="#b8">(9)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_PyFF36Q">The program utilizes narrative stories with illustrations to teach participants behavioral activation techniques and skills (e.g., activity scheduling), provide information (e.g., list for social and health service providers), augmented with nonspecialist guidance <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xu9VHNC">It consists of five 20-30 minutes sessions that teach techniques of stress management, planning physical and social activities, reducing avoidance coping, improving self-acceptance, and preventing relapse.</s><s xml:id="_2C84Cn3">The narrative stories involved a character (service recipient, the junior leading character) who learned how to better cope with daily stressors in different scenarios (e.g., family conflicts, feeling isolated) and manage their mood based on knowledge imparted by a doctor (service provider, the senior leading character).</s><s xml:id="_u3YTRn3">Behavioral activation, as the core therapeutic technique, gets participants active in daily life by scheduling activities to enhance their mood and are effective in managing depression symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_t3drFEz">In sessions of SbS, lists of activities are offered for users who can choose from these activities or come up with their own.</s><s xml:id="_Fmq7cp2">Also, a list of social and health service providers was provided to increase social interaction by seeking help from others.</s><s xml:id="_fs69h7j">The intervention content, guidance model, and mobile application are three essential components of the program <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>, which can be adapted for various cultural groups.</s><s xml:id="_Qn3Qctf">SbS has been adapted for Filipino migrant workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>, and Syrian refugees, Lebanese, and Palestinians in Lebanon <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> through a cultural adaption process involving community engagement with key local community members and stakeholders.</s></p><p xml:id="_zqrsWH2"><s

compatible with the client's cultural patterns, meaning, and values" <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(14)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qDksMH6">Incorporating cultural elements, including spiritual beliefs and social norms, and take account of the local context and needs of the target population can improve service users' attitudes toward the intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref>.</s><s

literature.</s><s xml:id="_Aynv2UC">Abi Ramia and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(12)</ref> culturally adapted a digital mental health intervention in Lebanon through learning participants' receptiveness to the program, its content, implementation, and prospective use with local communities and stakeholders.</s><s xml:id="_gtGQkfW">Garabiles and colleagues (8) completed a cultural adaptation to enhance the acceptability, relevance, comprehensibility of the intervention and its content (e.g., storyline, illustration, and characters) while maintaining the completeness of the therapeutic components.</s><s xml:id="_H7g6mwC">Previous work adopted a framework for guidance on what elements should be adapted <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref> and rationale behind adaptations <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref> to ensure the thoroughness of the cultural adaptation within the digital format.</s><s xml:id="_2YDJKPe">Digital mental health intervention adaption must meet community needs without the reliance on explanations and modifications by human supports <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21)</ref>, which highlights the

<ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(25)</ref>, elements within the intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, specific domains that have a poor fit between the intervention and the community <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref>, and heuristic considerations including patient engagement, mechanism, and treatment outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(28)</ref>.</s><s

<ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hBAnejX">The Ecological Validity Model addressed eight culturally sensitive domains within an intervention, which are language (i.e., culturally appropriate and syntonic language), people (i.e., ethnic/racial similarities), metaphor (i.e., common symbols and concepts shared within the cultural group), content (e.g., cultural knowledge about values, customs, and traditions), concepts (e.g., culturally and contextually consonant treatment constructs), goals (i.e., formation of an agreement on the treatment goal), methods (i.e., procedures/model used to accomplish the treatment goal), and context (i.e., psychological, developmental, social, economic and political context) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(32)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_kevpfem">Using the Ecological Validity Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(26)</ref>, eight culturally sensitive dimensions for intervention were explored with mental health providers to culturally adapt a web-based depression intervention for Latino adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_d4XSWGW">This study also highlighted that it is important to learn from both providers/experts and users' perspectives to enhance the applicability of the program and also maintain the therapeutic quality of the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_Hq8QtmG">Arjadi and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(33)</ref> applied the Ecological Validity Model to adapt an internet-based behavioral activation intervention addressing depression for Indonesian people.</s><s xml:id="_xBf9fbA">In addition, an internet-based intervention for depression was culturally adapted for Colombian university students using this model <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(34)</ref> and was evaluated <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(35)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ndbeXFJ">Evidence from a meta-analysis of eight randomized controlled trials showed that the effectiveness of minimally guided digital mental health interventions to reduce symptoms of common mental disorders was enhanced by cultural adaptation <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(36)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_4V3SSpr">Cultural adaptation of digital mental health interventions is a vital component to implementing interventions at scale within contexts, especially where mental health services are not well supported.</s></p><p xml:id="_JEY9BRu"><s xml:id="_uuWnKGa">Frameworks for cultural adaptation are generally used to inform adaptation dimensions

target="#b25">(26)</ref> to inform which intervention elements should be culturally adapted.</s><s xml:id="_PdSw88r">The framework, including eight culturally sensitive dimensions (i.e., language, persons, metaphors, content, concepts, goals, methods, context) was previously applied in cultural adaptation studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_38x82MQ">For the framework informing the strategies and process of cultural adaptation, the current study did not follow any existing cultural adaptation process model <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38)</ref> since they were not appropriate

the intervention content (e.g., text, storyline, and illustrations), which comprise the selfguided information received by the service users.</s><s xml:id="_w8ENNec">A process model with four phases
