all adults achieve recommended levels of physical activity, and adults aged ≥ 65 years are the least likely to be physically active. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> If they did exercise regularly, they might benefit from decreased risks of obesity, heart disease, hypertension, diabetes, and premature mortality, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> and may also have psychological and cognitive benefits. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s xml:id="_dpRemEm">One way to address this is to develop programs for older adults that promote a broadly applicable and feasible form of exercise.</s></p><p xml:id="_RhvzuU8"><s xml:id="_pb8Jr4R">Walking is one such exercise.</s><s xml:id="_fF2tGhM">Walking programs are feasible and safe, are generally acceptable and accessible to previously sedentary individuals, and do not require additional resources, unique training, or specialized equipment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s xml:id="_DwpUZPg">Walking is also measurable, with clearly identifiable individual targets that are associated with health improvements. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s xml:id="_KjrNXdz">Studies have shown that programs that implement goal setting and feedback using pedometers to record daily step counts can increase walking and improve BMI and blood pressure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s xml:id="_hPZUgB7"> complementary strategy for changing health behaviors is to offer a financial incentive if a person achieves behavioral goals.</s><s xml:id="_2yYfaTZ">This approach capitalizes on evidence from behavioral economics that suggests people generally have short time horizons and experience difficulty trading off immediate gratification for delayed health benefits. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s xml:id="_jte3Hk8">In recent research, financial incentives have been found to triple long-term tobacco-cessation rates, increase weight loss, improve medication adherence, <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and increase walking and other physical activity in the short term. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s xml:id="_G7NxPT7">lthough pedometer interventions to increase walking have been shown to be feasible for older adults, few studies have examined the effectiveness of financial incentives in this population.</s><s xml:id="_4WHQFkb">The findings to date have been mixed: One short-term study <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> found that financial incentives led to 38% of older adult participants meeting public health recommendations for weekly physical activity, compared with only 6.7% in the control arm.</s><s xml:id="_S7u3qps">In another study that tested the effects of lottery financial incentives and online peer networks on older adults' walking, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> intervention participants were no more likely to meet walking goals than comparison participants during the 16-week intervention or 8-week follow-up period.</s><s xml:id="_wWrp9u3">This study, however, enrolled participants with high baseline levels of walking, an important characteristic that may have reduced the intervention's effects.</s><s xml:id="_cR9j4JP">Further research is needed on what types of incentives would be most effective for older adults who have low levels of walking and are capable of walking more.</s></p><p xml:id="_zhYCHp4"><s xml:id="_5FP8KJS">Incentive programs for older adults can take advantage of unique characteristics of this population.</s><s xml:id="_gP4QmXN">Older adults may respond to incentives tied not simply to personal monetary gains but to emotionally rewarding social goals such as charitable donations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s xml:id="_QQDBUxw">If money donated to a social goal is as effective as, or more effective than, money given to the person, this supports an ethically appealing and potentially more cost-effective approach to incentives.</s></p><p xml:id="_CSDQCcd"><s xml:id="_SrBZgYh">The use of charity incentives could also avoid one drawback of financial incentives, which is that providing monetary rewards may reduce intrinsic motivation, thus making continuation of the behavior unlikely when incentives are taken away. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s xml:id="_C5PwS5b">Self-determination theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> suggests that charitable donations may increase rather than decrease intrinsic motivation by allowing individuals to fulfill basic psychological needs, including social relatedness and autonomy, if they have control over what charity their earnings will support. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s xml:id="_WFnQtv8">he objective of this study was to test the effects of social goals on older adults' initial uptake and short-term retention of increased levels of walking.</s><s xml:id="_2H56bD4">The study used a four-arm design to compare the effects of donations to a charity of choice, personal financial incentives, and combined effects of social goals for charity donations and financial incentives on older adults' uptake and retention of increased levels of walking, with a no incentive control group whose participants received only feedback on their walking.</s><s xml:id="_brtJtpx">It was hypothesized that walking levels would be higher in all incentive groups compared with control.</s></p></div>
