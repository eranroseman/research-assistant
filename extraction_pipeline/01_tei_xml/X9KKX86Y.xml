Depree, 1983, p. 10)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_RMkhSgP">Worry typically concerns future events whose outcomes are uncertain but that contain the possibility of one or more negative outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Sibrava &amp; Borkovec, 2006)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_VdHw4zW">Although reported proneness to worry varies continuously across the population, those diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) report particularly high levels of worry about many different topics, unlike the more specific content characteristic of the worries of those with other anxiety disorders.</s><s xml:id="_gquykAr">Indeed, the defining feature of GAD, based on the criteria set forth in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (4th ed.; DSM-IV; American Psychiatric <ref type="bibr">Association, 1994)</ref>, is chronic, excessive, and uncontrollable worry about multiple topics.</s><s xml:id="_9g4CgJD">Individuals with GAD and high levels of worry are distinguished from those who do not experience high levels of worry by their reported inability to control worry once it is initiated <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Borkovec et al., 1983)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_GzEteWY">For example, following instructions to worry about a current personally relevant topic, all participants reported more negative thought intrusions during a subsequent attention-focusing task.</s><s xml:id="_uSAg8g5">However, those who worried excessively, or those who met criteria for GAD, experienced a greater frequency of negative thought intrusions than did nonworriers <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Borkovec et al., 1983)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_XmkSGn2"><s xml:id="_4XVhCc9">The question remains of why individuals prone to worry find it so difficult to disengage from worry.</s><s xml:id="_BbAGwPc">Although anticipation of probable danger is adaptive, it is unclear why excessive worry persists when it causes frequent mental distress with few apparent benefits.</s><s xml:id="_pdZQhsD">Some research has suggested that individuals who worry excessively believe that they must continue to worry until uncertainty has been resolved <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Dugas, Gagnon, Ladouceur, &amp; Freeston, 1998)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_46Rdm32">Other researchers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Davey, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">Ruscio &amp; Borkovec, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">Wells, 1995)</ref> have found that excessive worriers often endorse certain advantages for worry (e.g., that worry helps them to solve problems), despite also endorsing negative beliefs (e.g., that worry may be harmful to health).</s><s xml:id="_Up7xGqy">In a similar vein, both positive and negative beliefs about worry have been found to be elevated in individuals with GAD <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Borkovec &amp; Roemer, 1995)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wQ9Typp">Such counterproductive beliefs regarding uncontrollability and possible benefits of worry are likely to undermine the motivation for individuals to stop worrying and thus may play a role in maintaining worry in GAD <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Wells, 1995)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_6FkTXZH"><s xml:id="_ZT54CSA">A further possibility is that such reported beliefs are secondary to more basic cognitive processes, such as cognitive biases in attention and interpretation.</s><s xml:id="_rBep6bg">Relative to nonanxious individuals, those with GAD or high levels of trait anxiety display a bias to attend to threat information (cf.</s><s xml:id="_qDR2NQG"><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Mathews &amp; MacLeod, 1994)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_QAWzk6U">Evidence for this conclusion derives mainly from experiments on attention to external threat cues (e.g., MacLeod, <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Mathews, &amp; Tata, 1986)</ref>, but there is no reason to suppose that such a bias would not equally apply to internal cognitive representations of threat, such as worrisome thoughts.</s></p><p xml:id="_g8EXSkP"><s xml:id="_qRGMyRn">In a similar light, although nonanxious individuals tend to make benign inferences about emotionally ambiguous information <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Hirsch &amp;

Mathews, 2008)</ref> has demonstrated that high worriers have less residual working memory capacity (as shown by poorer performance on a random key-press task) when worrying than do low worriers.</s><s xml:id="_ExYZXZS">Given this, the interesting possibility is raised that an additional reason that worriers find it difficult to disengage from worry might be that they have less working memory capacity available to voluntarily switch their thoughts to nonworry topics.</s></p><p xml:id="_FzkZkwF"><s xml:id="_ddXy6VG">If cognitive biases such as interpretation do indeed play a role in maintaining negative thought content, then worry might be reduced by enhancing access to benign outcomes of ambiguous information, thus countering the bias maintaining negative content.</s><s xml:id="_rdwnP98">In fact, repeated practice in accessing different meanings of emotionally ambiguous material has been found to influence anxiety reactions to subsequent stressful situations.</s><s xml:id="_T94KysT">For example, <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">Wilson, MacLeod, Mathews, and Rutherford (2006)</ref> found that participants who repeatedly practiced accessing benign meanings of homographs showed less anxiety when they later watched distressing video clips than did those who received practice accessing threatening interpretations.</s><s xml:id="_XgfG3fF">In a similar vein, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Hirsch, Mathews, and Clark (2007)</ref> found that repeated practice in accessing benign outcomes of ambiguous scenarios resulted in less anticipatory anxiety and more positive predicted performance in a stressful social situation compared to the outcome for those who practiced accessing threatening interpretations.</s></p><p xml:id="_rShBkTk"><s xml:id="_sJD6NKU">Because the research described above was conducted with nonanxious populations, the question remains whether repeated access to benign meanings reduces anxiety in high trait anxious individuals.</s><s xml:id="_DSzj2b3"><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">Murphy, Hirsch, Mathews, Smith, and Clark (2007)</ref> reported that high socially anxious individuals who were given repeated practice accessing benign outcomes of ambiguous social scenarios showed less anticipatory anxiety about a socially threatening event than did those who did not have the ambiguity resolved.</s><s xml:id="_6frMWtu"><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Mathews, Ridgeway, Cook, and Yiend (2007)</ref> also demonstrated that repeated practice in accessing benign meanings of ambiguous scenarios reduced trait scores in a high trait anxious group to a greater extent than in a control group who did not practice accessing valenced meanings.</s></p><p xml:id="_Wtg8CBh"><s xml:id="_CQZMuD6">The present study was designed to investigate whether related methods might reduce worry frequency in volunteers (university staff and students) reporting excessive worry.</s><s xml:id="_bhhYwg3">It was expected that practice in accessing benign meanings of emotionally ambiguous information related to worry would reduce the availability or intensity of incompatible negative meanings.</s><s xml:id="_4m98WxS">Hence, this would result in fewer negative thought intrusions when focusing on a nonworry task along with correspondingly lower levels of anxiety in comparison with a control condition.</s><s xml:id="_CwFdkNp">We also hypothesized that if practice in accessing benign meanings of ambiguously threatening information reduced the impact of negative thoughts, this would lead to more residual working memory capacity being available.</s></p></div>

Castonguay, 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">Clark et al., 2006)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SS4MGJu">The findings from this study provide support for this change in clinical focus by suggesting that helping clients to access benign meanings of emotionally ambiguous information may reduce some of problems reported by clients with GAD, such as worry and concentration problems.</s></p><p xml:id="_pgtZuvz"><s xml:id="_nP6KKR2">In summary, the current study demonstrated that repeated practice in accessing benign meanings of emotionally ambiguous information can reduce the number of negative thought intrusions, along with anxious mood, when high worriers attempted to focus on a task unrelated to worry.</s><s xml:id="_YrVchfG">Moreover, these methods were shown to lead to greater residual working memory capacity when engaging in worry.</s><s xml:id="_HHE3QPW">Future research is required to investigate whether these methods can produce similar changes in clients with GAD, perhaps paving the way for potential improvements in clinical interventions.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p><s xml:id="_M6UWrEU">Mean Number of Negative Thought Intrusions for the Benign and Control Groups Preworry and Postworry periods, as Rated bySelf and Assessor (Standard Deviations in Parentheses)</s></p></div></figDesc><table><row><cell></cell><cell cols="2">Preworry</cell><cell cols="2">Postworry</cell></row><row><cell>Group</cell><cell>Self</cell><cell>Assessor</cell><cell>Self</cell><cell>Assessor</cell></row><row><cell>Benign</cell><cell>0.95 (1.15)</cell><cell>1.00 (1.17)</cell><cell>1.40 (1.14)</cell><cell>1.60 (1.67)</cell></row><row><cell>Control</cell><cell>2.30 (1.63)</cell><cell>2.10 (1.52)</cell><cell>3.40 (2.04)</cell><cell>3.00 (1.78)</cell></row></table></figure>
