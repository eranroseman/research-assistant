narrow any identified inequalities, to close this gap.</s></p><p xml:id="_Ghj7ec9"><s xml:id="_JvQDBVX">Important limitations of this umbrella review need to be acknowledged.</s><s xml:id="_c7PXXDq">Most importantly, the quality of all included reviews was low, mostly due to a limited search strategy, a lack of detail on excluded studies, and inappropriate statistics used in meta-analyses.</s><s xml:id="_4A2j2XW">Furthermore, the vast majority of included reviews focused on age and gender/ sex; other social inequalities such as socio-economic status were rarely studied, despite accumulating evidence for its effects on digital intervention effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_UEa8pjy">Importantly, reviews are only able to reflect what is reported in primary studies; researchers evaluating the uptake of, engagement with, or effectiveness of digital interventions for weight-related behaviors thus should include a range of inequality indicators in their evaluations to provide sufficient primary data.</s><s xml:id="_5XGbfSC">For instance, social relationships (e.g., being married or living with children) were not studied at all in the included reviews, despite them being potentially helpful in overcoming barriers to digital technology use <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">88</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_yWWVv4e">Moreover, most studies evaluate the potential influence of individual inequality indicators, yet certain inequality indicators such as gender and income intersect <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">89</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_rygataT">Future work needs to take these interdependencies into account (see also Hollands et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">90</ref> , for a call to action for health equity research more broadly) to identify key inequality indicators so disparities can be most effectively reduced.</s><s xml:id="_TT3WRYj">Finally, most included reviews focused predominantly or exclusively on randomized controlled trials, which in themselves also suffer from selection biases and often include fewer individuals from priority populations <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">72</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_CqPqAXW">This could potentially mask differences e.g.</s><s xml:id="_Q5uQyuK">regarding socio-economic status; data on uptake, engagement and effectiveness should thus also be collected outside the study context to provide ecologically valid insights (see also Szinay et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref> for a discussion).</s><s xml:id="_RdA8Nqf">Finally, the present review focused exclusively on adults.</s><s xml:id="_s2x5dWN">Different processes might influence intervention uptake, engagement, and effectiveness in children and adolescents; most notably, at least up to
