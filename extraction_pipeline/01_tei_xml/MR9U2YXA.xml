or an anxiety disorder within the UK National Healthcare Service.</s><s xml:id="_6uxq9vB">Using Markov models built on discrete health states to compare the cost-effectiveness of different

therapy has a 'dominant' incremental cost-effectiveness ratio relative to standard care, offering similar clinical effectiveness but with shorter treatment times.</s><s xml:id="_wMaeHNC">In most healthcare systems, the clinical effectiveness of mental healthcare remains unquantified, and long treatment times are common.</s><s xml:id="_Whvv8kZ">The potential for these findings to inform mental

framework for the collection, monitoring and evaluation of clinical outcomes, which promotes value-based care using a stepped-care approach.</s><s xml:id="_wD9jaGx">This approach is founded on the

types of therapy and is delivered to approximately one-third of NHS TT patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_aQxrx2c">With proven clinical effectiveness, structured CBT
