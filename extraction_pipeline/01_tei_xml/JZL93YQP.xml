<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="1" xml:id="_kDscryt">INTRODUCTION</head><p xml:id="_azDCEbx"><s xml:id="_7HJvGPu">Self-tracking practices are important ways in which individuals record and draw patterns from personal data <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>, often with a focus on health and wellness, for instance to manage mood, symptoms, exercise, or eating habits.</s><s xml:id="_k5RRABp">In recent years, there has been a growing interest towards automatically tracking such information through sensing and digital technologies, for instance through wearable fitness devices (e.g., eyewear, rings, shoes, watches, wristbands) <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">64]</ref>, smartphone or ambient sensors to passively monitor health indicators <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>, or through semi-automated approaches that combine manual and automated tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref> such as photo-based food journaling that lowers tracking burdens while maintaining active involvement in data collection <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_n2RncxT">Alongside these advances, there has also been an increase in the popularity of purely non-digital styles of manual self-tracking, such as journaling with pen and paper <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_HjfZrRq"><s xml:id="_xDhFuYP">Bullet Journaling (BuJo) is a freeform, analog logging system for organizing tasks, events, and notes, designed to facilitate a productive and reflective lifestyle <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_664nZ9t">Mood tracking in particular has become popular as a "low-tech" bullet journaling practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_nkBAZ6C">For example, Year in Pixels is a technique where users color one square in a grid according to their mood, for every day in a year <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8bSFbNh">The practice is designed to help individuals reflect on their emotions, increase emotional self-awareness, and more effectively communicate emotions and needs to others.</s><s xml:id="_QDDsMVG">These positive outcomes may be attributed to the slow, deliberate nature of the activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xjnU2SG">At the same time, various mobile apps are now becoming available to support the simple and predefined structure of Year in Pixels, making it a well-suited case study to better understand users' practices and preferences in the modern landscape of analog and digital self-tracking tools.</s></p><p xml:id="_3MB3sj8"><s xml:id="_7pnVC5t">In this paper, we explore people's idiosyncratic, non-digital tracking practices to highlight the value found in these activities, understand what challenges people face, and identify how digital tools might best support such needs while preserving the simple but rich benefits of low-tech tracking.</s><s xml:id="_sdjX6qW">In doing so, we build on recent research from Ayobi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, who analyzed a corpus of public Instagram posts related to paper bullet journaling as a way to examine the types of information people track and how they design their journals.</s><s xml:id="_yRFsE8D">They found that "visualising data by hand can be an end in itself," as the physicality of the process promotes engagement in self-reflection.</s><s xml:id="_85KWtQ6">Moreover, they emphasize how digital tools should focus on extending current practices, rather than replacing them, and support self-tracking in ways that maintain their reflective nature, instead of focusing on automation.</s></p><p xml:id="_R93Mp6X"><s xml:id="_Ae2sZWe">To more deeply understand and unpack people's attitudes regarding physical and digital tools, we extend prior work by taking a different methodological approach.</s><s xml:id="_Efv9fBA">Specifically, we conducted a large-scale survey (N = 404) and small-scale follow-up interviews (N = 18) with people who engage in self-tracking.</s><s xml:id="_kmbCjmN">Our primary contributions include 1) novel insights about people's current practices, motivations, frustrations, and broader perceptions of different tracking approaches, as well as 2) design implications for future technologies that can support and augment reflective self-tracking.</s></p><p xml:id="_67vswZ9"><s xml:id="_CHBk2Fa">We find that for some users, the physical self-tracking practice serves as a structured and constructive form of artistic expression.</s><s xml:id="_UqbRwS3">For these individuals, writing by hand using a physical implement is imperative, and the creativity and aesthetics of trackers drive engagement.</s><s xml:id="_kEJ5mz4">Moreover, we find that the tangible artifact is integral for preservation and personal legacy but that long-term retrospective reflection is challenging using physical tools.</s><s xml:id="_a366yJg">Accordingly, we propose recommendations for the thoughtful design of future generations of digital self-tracking tools.</s><s xml:id="_JxhynSn">These include opportunities for tools that augment physical practices through duplicate data collection and post-hoc data manipulation and visualization, as well as tools that support reflective self-tracking through creative freedom, slow and calming designs, and perceived digital disconnect.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2" xml:id="_UWdDJvS">RELATED WORK 2.1 Personal Data Practices and Digital Tools</head><p xml:id="_wpNvQFs"><s xml:id="_NFjBbj6">With technology that can capture, store, and process personal information increasingly becoming part of our daily lives, a variety of cultural trends around collecting such data have emerged, such as lifelogging and the Quantified Self (QS) movement, together with the scientific study of these activities.</s><s xml:id="_r4kzwX7">We broadly refer to such personal data practices as "self-tracking".</s></p><p xml:id="_WZ9MAeu"><s xml:id="_wGez6ZQ">Foundational work in personal informatics (PI)-a term originally introduced by Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> to refer to the use of technologies for collecting and reflecting on personal information-conceptualized self-tracking as a five stage iterative process through which a person will prepare what data to collect and how, perform that collection, integrate and organize the data, reflect upon it, and eventually determine how to translate insights into a plan for action.</s><s xml:id="_RJYeK8P">Since then, researchers have continued to extend this model and develop further conceptualizations of personal data practices, including to identify additional styles of tracking (e.g., goal-driven and documentationbased activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>), stages of tracking (e.g., a maintenance phase and lapsed tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>), and social aspects of tracking (e.g., the collaborative collection, sharing, and interpretation of personal data as well as the broader sociocultural backdrop in which self-tracking is embedded <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>).</s></p><p xml:id="_jyMdYDg"><s xml:id="_7JNvgS7">The literature finds that people use personal informatics tools to track various aspects of daily life, including finances, visited locations, and meals <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, though a majority of users are interested in capturing data about fitness, health, and well-being specifically <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_MCV2J6C">There are now over a quarter of a million health apps available to smartphone users, with downloads in the billions <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">65]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_yu64DR8">Compared to self-trackers in general, the QS community has been identified as an example of "extreme users" <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> who aim to make the body a more knowable and hence "calculable and administrable object" through self-monitoring activities that represent a variety of bio-behavioral information via numerical, objective metrics <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">69]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_VRZRtd5">To capture such data at more accurate, continuous, and granular levels, technology-based measurement approaches are typically employed, for instance through on-body or even implantable sensors <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>, video records <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, and biofeedback mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_emt48Fx"><s xml:id="_KwR8P64">Digital tools are associated with a few main benefits when it comes to self-tracking.</s><s xml:id="_zm9m2NQ">First, the portability of personal mobile and wearable devices make them easy to access anytime and anywhere, especially compared to physical self-tracking artifacts that might be bulky or delicate to transport or that may be more easily forgotten.</s><s xml:id="_bjXY5pD">Digital tools' storage capabilities also enable the compact accumulation and indexing of large volumes of personal data, which can later be referenced.</s><s xml:id="_MnwY32K">In addition, self-tracking interfaces are generally designed to be quick and lightweight to use, which can make for an efficient logging session.</s><s xml:id="_UkCgusd">For example, several researchers have developed approaches that allow a user to tap icons or perform gestures on a smartphone lock screen in order to journal health information such as mood <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>, sleep <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, or water intake <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[72]</ref>, while other work has developed self-reporting prompts that enable users to record information directly from the notification panel <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wgzz2fC">Further, such notifications provide a means of proactively engaging users (e.g., by sending reminders to track).</s><s xml:id="_MHwg8UK">Finally, digital tools can help synthesize data, compute health statistics, and pull out patterns that a user can then examine to gain insights.</s></p><p xml:id="_428S23J"><s xml:id="_9zECZry">At the same time, whether performed purely "by hand" or through technology-mediated approaches, the manual capture of data is associated with several benefits.</s><s xml:id="_HGwVXPd">Non-automated self-tracking can empower users with a sense of agency <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>, and directly engaging with data can foster self-awareness <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and enhance mindfulness about behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">74]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_vzt5s6U">A number of designers have suggested a hybrid approach, combining passive sensing with opportunities for users to manually contribute self-reported information.</s><s xml:id="_mwmSsT7">The UbiFit system <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> is an early example of a system that inferred various physical activities automatically, while giving users control to edit or add data.</s><s xml:id="_tScUkEJ">More recently, researchers have formalized a spectrum from fully manual, to semi-automated, to fully automated tracking approaches, including
