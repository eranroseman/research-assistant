aging takes place in places other than high-income countries (HICs) where more than 80% of the global older adult population will reside by 2050 <ref type="bibr">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_567GF7T">Malaysia is an upper-middle-income country that shows rapid population aging <ref type="bibr">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_bVayzQx">The proportion of older adults in the total population is projected to almost double from 2015 (5.8%) to 2040 (11.4%) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[6]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_r7ynkBJ"><s xml:id="_rwXGXUe">The global rise in the older adult population is linked to an increase in the prevalence of noncommunicable diseases (NCDs), disability, and other health problems which, in turn, increase the burden on public and private health care systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr">2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_GDVscts">This is especially so in non-HICs where the increase of NCDs is far greater than in HICs <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gyf5vHa">Lifestyle factors, especially physical activity (PA) and particularly structured exercise, are commonly put forward as essential determinants of good physiological and psychological health in older age [2, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3XhKxPt">For example, exercising older adults enjoy increased brain plasticity and cognitive function <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[12]</ref>, reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[13]</ref>, and reduced metabolic risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tFTpjy3">Additionally, older adults who start following a regular strength-training regimen are likely to reduce body fat and greatly increase muscular strength <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KDHpPpv">Despite these benefits, many older adults are not exercising enough <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WHDvUyd">A recent review of PA levels in older adults reported that between 0% and 17.2% of older adults are active for 150 minutes per week when measured objectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_PQz4T7B">Because exercise is a subcategory of PA, exercise levels are even lower.</s><s xml:id="_TVSX595">Studies reporting on PA and exercise levels of older adults in non-HICs are rare <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8egSHbH">However, it seems that older adults in non-HICs, such as Malaysia, are increasingly inactive <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_t5bxvEU">This was confirmed in a recent study reporting that 88% of older Malaysians are not sufficiently active <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xSdZJaj">The unprecedented increase in the older adult population, especially in non-HICs, imposes a great burden on health care systems.</s><s xml:id="_sRQ7w2d">Because PA and specifically exercise are essential for good health in older age, there is a need for innovative and cost-effective interventions to increase exercise levels.</s></p><p xml:id="_mwKWxZy"><s xml:id="_ABkZtJN">Behavioral health interventions focusing on PA and/or exercise are increasingly delivered via mHealth approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[21]</ref>, particularly mobile phones <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_JssHNEe">However, most interventions are conducted with younger age groups in HICs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9XTXGG2">This is surprising because mobile phone penetration is increasing rapidly in non-HICs primarily because of device affordability <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[26]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qHZPS7P">This is evident in the Asia-Pacific region where approximately 3.6 billion people own a mobile phone.</s><s xml:id="_a5QZvbA">This figure is likely to increase in coming years <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[27]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_FY8TmjT">Mobile phone subscriptions are also increasing in older adults.</s><s xml:id="_YkPjV4C">A study of older adults in the United States showed that 75.9% of adults aged 65 and older own a mobile phone <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[28]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ADQxabA">Research also indicated the willingness of older adults to use mobile phone features that provide beneficial information to them, especially for health <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">30]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Za5SVKR">Short message service (SMS) text messaging is particularly popular among older adults and is the most frequently used mobile phone feature because little technological expertise is required for sending and receiving SMS text messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">31]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_K8Td9WJ">Therefore, examining SMS text messaging to promote exercise in older adults residing in an upper-middle-income
