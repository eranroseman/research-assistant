<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.2" xml:id="_StRf4uS">Personal Informatics for Mental Health</head><p xml:id="_eE9Jvz6"><s xml:id="_WJeQjWQ">PI tools, biometric sensors, and semi-automated techniques originally developed for a more general set of users (e.g., to track movement, communication, and context <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>) have become therapeutic resources for individuals managing SMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[76]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_etUHmJJ">As early as 2006, the U.S. Institute of Medicine recognized the potential of innovations in mobile technology to transform mental health services by providing more continuous and precise information on patient-specific behavior, symptoms, and medication effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[81]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_NHwtcv4"><s xml:id="_qPu5EHk">However, it can be quite challenging to develop PI technologies that are sensitive to the unique needs of individuals with mental health conditions like BD (e.g., due to degraded functional abilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[71]</ref>, inaccurate reporting <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref>, or lapsed adherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[44]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_mNUgFKA">Systems like MoodRhythm <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b99">99]</ref> and MONARCA <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref> are therefore exploring passive data collection and symptom detection that relieve some of the burdens and limitations of purely manual tracking.</s></p><p xml:id="_zmadw8K"><s xml:id="_NKe9cR2">In addition, off-the-shelf tracking technologies can support healthy self-awareness, but there is a general risk that the ways data is presented back to users can foster hyper self-scrutiny and unrealistic normative expectations of health or identity for vulnerable individuals like those with BD <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[62]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_StpEdME">These standardized data representations do not always align with the lived experiences of individuals, potentially complicating the process of using these personal records to build understanding and empathy among family and friends <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[52]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hu7YRa2">Further, streaming or "always on" data collection can make it challenging for individuals to practice intentional self-disclosure <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[69]</ref>, raising important issues of privacy and data curation <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[75]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hqZ4gzC">Finally, efforts to integrate self-tracking data into EHR systems and broader clinical practices are still in the early stages, which can lead to individuals with BD experiencing feelings of resentment and a sense of self-tracking futility when PI data goes unaccepted or unvalued by doctors with whom it is shared <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[76]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="2.3" xml:id="_TM8KXt6">(Inter)-Personal Health Informatics</head><p xml:id="_7fGgJWV"><s xml:id="_HDZzHrY">In examining the social context for tracking tools used in the long-term management of SMI like BD, the most visible and studied relationship is that between patient and provider (e.g., therapists, psychiatrists, general practitioners, neurologists, and so on).</s><s xml:id="_SCy6sF3">In fact, healthcare has long been a topic of interest to the CSCW community, often focusing on the collaborative nature of healthcare practices as well as the implications for designing technology that supports such work <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_jhwbuJa"><s xml:id="_XrfeBHm">In formal care settings such as clinics and hospitals, patient health information (PHI) is documented and coordinated through medical records <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KV3rN3X">A significant body of literature exists around the role of PHI as not only information artifacts but as mediators of collaborative healthcare work.</s><s xml:id="_MdHwUMA">Relatively new innovations, like the EHR and a host of online portals for managing personal health information, promise to improve efficiency and overall care quality, in part by improving providers' ability to communicate and share data, even when remotely located <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_P6Y8Jes">While such medical records are provider-facing, personal health record (PHR) systems are patient-facing tools for collecting, managing, and sharing information (e.g., about medical history and medications) <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[98]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2CKMn3U">In the SMI context, a common use case for such a system has been to enable patients to fill in self-assessment data as part of their daily routine, with a psychiatrist using the system's clinical portal to monitor all of his or her patients as well as review historical data together with patients during therapy sessions <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[37]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_2YfpZwU"><s xml:id="_YWNQf5m">Recently, work has begun to examine how patients and providers can also coordinate over more vernacular or individualized forms of patient-generated data, captured using commercial PI applications and other non-clinical logging instruments <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b74">74,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b104">104]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mXWmMTG">However, researchers have observed barriers to such data being effectively used as part of formalized healthcare practices.</s><s xml:id="_K2j9nqA">For instance, the volume of information collected can be overwhelming and hard to interpret <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[94]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_QN6Krq2">The introduction of digital systems can also degrade face-to-face interactions by drawing attention away from patient-clinician communication <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[58]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_58JuHhj">As self-tracked information becomes an increasingly significant part of the health data equation, researchers have therefore been making efforts to develop "shared care" systems that specifically support the integration of meaningful PI data streams as well as active engagement of both the professional care team and the patient in monitoring and treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_CkJeYxS"><s xml:id="_qFZBAvT">Researchers have also investigated how informatics technology can support collaboration around health management outside of the clinical setting, particularly in the context of family-centered practices -for instance to track on behalf of other family members including children <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[50]</ref>, deliver digestible representations of detailed family-level data streams, and manage privacy concerns especially in complex arrangements such as families with divorce <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[85]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_D7y9VWn">Work looking at coordination among patients and close caregivers, including spouses, has further identified the importance of determining and balancing values (e.g., with respect to shifting responsibilities, mutual support, and patient autonomy) when designing systems for collaborative self-care <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">82]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_AptFQQz"><s xml:id="_K7De4E3">The personal informatics literature has also identified a number of other considerations around if, how, with whom, and why people share health-related PI data.</s><s xml:id="_xwg8Pqn">Much of this work has been done in the context of contemporary sociotechnical systems like social media.</s><s xml:id="_nGKggXV">These platforms have been taken up by individuals as a way to record, broadcast, and reflect on their personal healthfor instance, by using Instagram to track and share food data <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, Twitter to seek quick health advice <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[64]</ref>, or Facebook and condition-specific sites to connect with a wide support network of peers and caregivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[75]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_866jCJC">Recent work on mental health specifically has explored the potential for remote peer support to be delivered through online chat interfaces <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[83]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_674txmG"><s xml:id="_sqQNGr3">Willingness to share personal health data in such venues is by no means the default stance, however, often due to

xml:id="_aujxtgs">Finally, we include an informatics layer in our model to capture the relational and mediating roles personal data play in socially-embedded SMI management, as described in Section 5.2.</s><s xml:id="_Zbvtbzc">In our study, we observed that PI artifacts and the representation of self embodied by captured data can themselves resemble a relational entity, which exists together with the individual at the center of the ecology.</s><s xml:id="_jpRSkUQ">We also saw that analog instruments (notebooks, stickers, paper forms, etc.) were geared more toward use at the personal or microlayer level, with practices either entirely private or shared only with close ties that participants lived with or regularly depended on for care.</s><s xml:id="_umC2zQM">On the other hand, digital technologies (self-tracking software, online platforms, etc.) enabled interactions with more indirect layers; however, more risk was associated with data captured this way, especially if participants had antagonistic relations at the exolayer (discriminatory workplaces, hostile expartners, etc).</s><s xml:id="_MkDwYmU">Further, considering personal data from a macrolayer perspective demonstrates how PI can act in service of both positive and negative cultural values (e.g., mobile self-tracking apps affording broader access to care for a vulnerable population or normative measurement scales reinforcing users' perceptions of societal stigma).</s></p><p xml:id="_3HuwQRz"><s xml:id="_cMujyFs">In addition, the informatics and temporal layers of the model can interact as well, given that PI attitudes and practices can evolve over time.</s><s xml:id="_8664DU9">For our participants, common changes included tracking more or less based on their level of understanding or progression of their illness, on shifting perceptions surrounding perceived threats to privacy, or in response to discovering new peer support communities where sharing PI could aid individual and collective needs, be they informational or emotional.</s><s xml:id="_QPQpFfm">Overall, including a PI layer in our model promotes the holistic examination of how not only current PI instantiations but also future advances in PI (e.g., to support novel formats of information and in more collective, dynamic circumstances) can impact care practices and social structures.</s></p></div>

PI systems must therefore be cautious in implementing disclosure capabilities using stereotypical role labels and disclosure or sharing permissions.</s></p><p xml:id="_cf7AwQj"><s xml:id="_H9CAKxu">Design implication 2: People find value in comparing their data to others', in many cases due to the desire to determine baselines and make normative comparisons with others with whom they feel an affinity.</s><s xml:id="_tUnbUW7">While other apps have been designed to support social comparison (e.g., of fitness data <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[93]</ref>), such comparisons can be highly problematic in an SMI context, given the aforementioned risks related to self-scrutiny and unrealistic expectations to which people with BD are vulnerable.</s><s xml:id="_yRVwEsT">Regardless of the specific representations or visualizations employed in health-centric PI tools like these, the impact of social, cultural, and normative framing is particularly important to consider in the context of supporting vulnerable populations, given the normative expectations inherent in and underlying most existing personal informatics systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[62]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_FkeX8n8">Prior work on social PI systems has found that leaderboards or other interfaces that allow for the direct comparison of multiple individuals' data can be motivating due to the sense of competition induced <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b73">73,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">92]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_UPZx6MM">However, managing chronic conditions like SMI is not a race to a goal post with clear-cut measures of success (e.g., more steps are better).</s><s xml:id="_XHZJUnv">Rather, it is a long-term, day-by-day balancing act of "staying in bounds.</s><s xml:id="_9nQqRTf">"</s></p><p xml:id="_kj58pYk"><s xml:id="_ey8aC8P">Careful consideration needs to be given to the social consequences and contracts around sharing.</s><s xml:id="_pjmW4aY">A failure to design without social interaction in mind brings consequences including limiting the types of information that can be shared (e.g., less support for exchanging rich experiential knowledge rather than just statistics), the level of control a user has over that sharing, and the ability to retroactively review and revise disclosed content <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[53]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_5PNWvFM"><s xml:id="_cUKnKAE">Design implication 3: For people managing SMI, self-tracking is about crisis mitigation and crisis management.</s><s xml:id="_pPdnfDQ">While some individuals talked about the ways in which they enjoyed or were drawn to personal record-keeping, many also described the vulnerability associated with recognizing potentially troubling patterns in those traces.</s><s xml:id="_GCP94h5">Participants described a process of spotting a problematic change in a routine or daily behavior and going directly to a healthcare provider to adjust medication or seek alternative therapies.</s><s xml:id="_jk8XNPu">Others talked about relying on trusted friends or family members to provide perspective during those times when they could not trust their own observations or interpretations of personal data.</s><s xml:id="_jJXhNZd">An impending crisis was not typically signalled by just one event, but by a series of cues.</s><s xml:id="_7DbzwD8">Some participants talked about ways that they masked or hid potentially dangerous shifts in mood by only exposing friends and loved ones to certain behaviors.</s><s xml:id="_knxZtQX">Others talked about the ways that they compared sets of tracked "variables" (our word, not theirs) in order to make sure that they were getting an accurate picture of how they were doing (e.g., an unusually large pile of boxes from Amazon on the doorstep plus a series of sleepless nights indicates that a change for the worse might be imminent).</s><s xml:id="_S8eEJxX">PI tools have the potential to support triangulation of this nature, both across behavioral and mood markers and among trusted stakeholders.</s></p><p xml:id="_aaaEC7Y"><s xml:id="_6GNQTEb">Further, participants described their tracking behaviors as being dependent on a number of factors including their phase of illness, comorbid conditions such as OCD or PTSD, strength and nature of social support networks, access to formal healthcare in the form of regular therapy and medications, and ready access to urgent care for mental health.</s><s xml:id="_8HDWY2f">In these cases, adherence to a tracking regime is not just about the interactivity a tool provides; it can also be a signal to be tracked in its own right and a significant measure of well-being (e.g., less tracking may correspond to decreased urgency).</s><s xml:id="_B3AmbxN">This recognition corresponds with a need for situated methods to articulate, measure, and evaluate use in ways that better reflect holistic PI practices, such as cases where non-tracking (or syncopated tracking) could be seen as a desirable outcome in conjunction with other factors.</s></p><p xml:id="_uvyP95K"><s xml:id="_S4qcHeE">Design implication 4: PI systems for collective engagement carry the potential of unintended consequences, related to both introducing and limiting access to personal data and particularly within the challenging and dynamic social context of managing SMI.</s><s xml:id="_hQua9WK">In our model, some of the mechanisms or trajectories of these consequences can be traced back to the interactions among levels (e.g., valence, intensity, direction, dynamism).</s><s xml:id="_D8qvXhV">Research and development in this space will need to involve careful application of participatory design techniques that enable the user-centered identification of how to best support dynamic information sharing and data-access needs required in this context.</s><s xml:id="_henXM78">Our participants shared stories of episodes in which tracking practices that seemed to offer social benefits in one context corresponded to risks or harms in another (e.g., being willing to share financial and spending data with a trusted clinician but guarding that same information from loved ones who might become alarmed, judgmental, or reactionary).</s></p><p xml:id="_snwmhqb"><s xml:id="_qce264V">Just as EST enabled us to operationalize social relations, approaches like Grounded Design <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[91]</ref> and other participatory methods can help to position PI systems as elements within a dynamic social context rather than as solutions to a single, static, "solvable" problem.</s><s xml:id="_CJSFVde">According to Rohde et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[91]</ref>, empirical design research is inherently entangled with social practice.</s><s xml:id="_sxWpTv2">Research activities exist in an environment that is dynamic, contingent, unpredictable, and organic; this means that the problem that we set out to solve has often transformed by the time we implement a system.</s><s xml:id="_DhWGeeP">Techniques like Grounded Design focus on cultivating a shared language for communicating with community members and a functional understanding of the social practices and contexts to be improved <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[91]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_H7YyW2J">This requires close collaboration between researchers and community members, which is especially important when working with vulnerable populations and in light of the complex social dynamics underlying the management of SMI, as reflected in our model.</s></p><p xml:id="_EfpPbqJ"><s xml:id="_usuCpHQ">After incorporating participants' visions and values into exemplars of this new class of collective informatics systems, appropriation studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[91]</ref> can be undertaken to examine how they fare when deployed into the "wild" and incorporated into existing and new social practices by groups of real-world stakeholders.</s><s xml:id="_ftVuuqN">This will enable designers to empirically assess the impacts of various interaction and visualization techniques.</s><s xml:id="_u94MKDX">Conducting appropriation studies over extended periods of time will also be necessary in order to capture changes in the course of one's illness or social circumstances -and the particular constellation of social relations in which that individual's condition is being managed.</s></p><p xml:id="_fHzaKwu"><s xml:id="_rU8EBYm">Additionally, if researchers and practitioners are going to take on the challenge of delineating PI ecosystems in terms of multi-tiered social relations -one of the primary outcomes that we make in this work -then we also have to acknowledge that these tools and practices are unfolding in a sociotechnical context where concerns about privacy, identity theft, surveillance, and manipulation are rampant.</s><s xml:id="_A55X5aH">Many who work in the area of PI are well aware of the sensitivity of personal data; however, significant work in data science is being done to draw ever more refined representations of people and their behaviors from larger and more complex data sets <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Dfqybqg">This work creates a moving target for ethical standards, raising issues of algorithmic inclusivity and normative data models, as well as questions about what consent looks like in our current data landscape.</s><s xml:id="_uU8F5bP">Building on the work of Bietz and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>, our findings reinforce the need for PI systems designers to be reflective about how tools like automated sensors can catapult a self-tracking app into a data security design space and require more sophisticated models and awareness of the data literacies of end users.</s></p></div>
