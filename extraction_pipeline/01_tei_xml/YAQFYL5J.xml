higher patient safety culture, in a large  university-affiliated hospital.</s><s xml:id="_MWNDhTr">At the dimensional level, EFC participation was significantly associated with nine of 12 dimensions of the HSOPS.</s><s xml:id="_eDnbtzx">The largest differences were found for three key dimensions of patient safety culture, i.e., "organizational learning," "feedback and communication about error," and "nonpunitive response to error."</s><s xml:id="_9rQwTKw">These associations remained significant after adjusting for sex, occupational group, and hospital sector.</s><s xml:id="_mwaC3de">Moreover, the professionals involved in an EFC declared reporting adverse events more often than those who did not participate in an EFC.</s><s xml:id="_pDrShqe">However, we did not find any association between the presence of an EFC in the department and professionals' patient safety culture.</s><s xml:id="_429epb3">The analysis of the subgroup of professionals who worked in a department with a productive EFC, defined as an EFC implementing at least five actions per year, showed a higher patient safety culture level for the dimensions.</s><s xml:id="_gTRsayq">Although widely implemented in French hospitals for more than 10 years, EFCs had practically never been assessed.</s><s xml:id="_G4BvNUG">Despite the observational design of this study, the results seem relevant, because they endorse the objectives, which led to the initial development of this management tool.</s><s xml:id="_KVQbNnf">Indeed, the EFC was initially developed to directly involve medical teams in patient safety management and to educate the professionals in the science of safety.</s><s xml:id="_FfPSMKk">The results reported herein are in line with several studies reporting a favorable association of similar tools on the patient safety climate, such as the Comprehensive Unit-based Safety Program in the United States. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref></s><s xml:id="_ewE6abS">nterestingly, participation in EFC activities was strongly associated with the "organizational learning," "feedback and communication about error," and "nonpunitive response to error" dimension scores.</s><s xml:id="_MnWWK8E">The "organizational learning" dimension was compounded by three items related to team organization to improve patient safety (namely, "A6 active improvement of patient safety," "A9 mistakes led to positive changes," and "A13 evaluation of the implemented actions' effectiveness").</s><s xml:id="_kwXqpYe">The association between this latter dimension and participation in EFC activities may reflect the appropriateness of the EFC framework for patient safety management, whether to implement corrective actions or to assess their effectiveness.</s><s xml:id="_kFdjNtt">Indeed, the standardized EFC framework includes two steps related to implementing corrective actions after multidisciplinary consensus and the monitoring of ongoing actions.</s><s xml:id="_HRckNfF">These actions are prompted after reviewing the RCA presented by one of the participants.</s><s xml:id="_TjerVEe">Therefore, the decision-making process is supplied by the adverse events encountered by the team

framework establishes event reports as the raw material of the meeting.</s><s xml:id="_BzGrcB4">Indeed, the EFC requires reports of adverse events at each step of the meeting, which start by a reading of all the events to choose one of them to conduct a thorough analysis, and finish by elaborate corrective actions.</s><s xml:id="_kt3XuRx">The "nonpunitive response to error" dimension, more fully developed for the EFC participants, could also limit the fear of punishment, well-known as an obstacle to event reporting. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr"

xml:id="_muuxGee">Overall, these results showed that the EFC could promote event reporting, despite all the barriers hindering self-reporting, such as the time constraints, complex forms, and the lack of feedback. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref></s><s xml:id="_9xeWE9R">hree HSOPS dimensions were not associated with EFC participation, namely

an appropriate action plan.</s><s xml:id="_TSSwdwD">One of our hypotheses was that patient safety culture would be disseminated toward professionals working in a department with an EFC.</s><s xml:id="_2gu6PK8">The lack of this association at this level highlighted the weakness mentioned previously.</s><s xml:id="_UNucnmd">Indeed, the association was limited to the direct participant,

xml:id="_FUFHAwh">Beyond these issues specifically related to the RCA practice, another explanation for this limited association was a lack of communication.</s><s xml:id="_kJYpJaA">Through
