target="#b48">(Von Wagner et al., 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Pedersen et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SwgQzjm">Addressing these gaps is made more challenging by the range of

xml:id="_FXsRj7Y"><s xml:id="_dDXeDtp">As a result of this complexity, cancer awareness programs in Uganda are often cancer specific (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_4EfVjmC">focused on cervical cancer), focused on screening or early detection, and delivered via multiple interventions, such as radio programs, outreach sessions by health professional, community health workers as educators, and use of printed

delivery methods for cancer information <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(Morhason-Bello et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Mwaka et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">Nakaganda et al., 2021)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_856AQTn">In the last decade, the ubiquity of mobile phones has led to increased attention of digital solutions, such as mobile health (mHealth), as potentially effective, and low-cost ways to address the information gaps within the general society as well as cancer patients and caregivers <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Dickinson et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">Charalambous 2019)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_kUDAbZ8"><s xml:id="_A9NzwmE">mHealth involves the use of mobile technology to provide healthcare services and could include voice, text messaging (short message service, SMS), and multimedia message services and applications.</s><s xml:id="_gu88mp8">One form of mHealth is interactive voice response (IVR), a technology that allows clients to receive pre-recorded audio information over the phone by interacting with a computer-based telephone system via touch tones or voice commands <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(Lee et al., 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Kraft and Androwich 2012)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wnR59Mf">IVR technology utilizes the mobile phone infrastructure to cost-effectively deliver health information to a large audience, while reducing the pressure on the health workers force and the need for patients to travel long distances to health facilities to get health education from health workers.</s><s xml:id="_kNzpHFz">There is some evidence supporting the use of IVR systems on a range of health conditions.</s><s xml:id="_4GYP8ux">Among young adults living with HIV in Uganda, IVR was found to be acceptable and promote anti-retroviral drug adherence and increase health knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Twimukye et al., 2021)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WKue3kM">Another study in Uganda and Nigeria on fistula barriers reported positive impressions of the IVR, especially the ability to preserve anonymity in seeking information and referral for fistula symptoms.</s><s xml:id="_pwkrE96"><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">(Tripathi et al., 2020)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rjgwHqw">Both studies reported challenges including limited mobile phone ownership, software failure, and poor cellular network connectivity.</s><s xml:id="_9dkWy8h">From similar contexts such as Ghana there is evidence that IVR was deemed acceptable to users (clinicians and parents of sick children) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Brinkel et al., 2017;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Franke et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_x4DHVe6">Reviews on IVRs have also found effects on medication adherence, physical activity, <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">(Tsoli et al., 2018)</ref> and cardio-metabolic medications <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Kassavou and Sutton, 2018)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_BqVdK6D">The reviews also emphasized behavioural change messages about 'health consequences" and messages that are "tailored", i.e. sending different messages to different participants/patients as success pre-requisites.</s><s xml:id="_mwjmEmS">However, there is currently no evidence on IVR for cancer awareness in the Uganda context.</s></p><p xml:id="_vK2F6WH"><s xml:id="_vtRJYVp">Despite the promise of IVR and other mHealth interventions, reported program outcomes are often inconsistent.</s><s xml:id="_Xefjcbf">It has been suggested that this can be related to program developers failing to make explicit the assumptions related to program activities and outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Ilozumba et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_p7YgReN">mHealth interventions are multi-layered and complex, regardless of the assumed simplicity of the technology itself.</s><s xml:id="_aDf9gEG">The interventions must be acceptable and utilized by the intended end-users and these are often influenced by multiple factors, including characteristics of the users, the technology as well as other contextual factors, which could influence the performance of desired behaviour.</s><s xml:id="_PvMHsxr">One way to improve the outcomes mHealth interventions is to adopt a nuanced approach towards understanding programs.</s><s

understand 'what works, for whom, under what circumstances, and how' <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Pawson and Tilley, 1997)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gGncjSX">Realist evaluation is generative as it operates under the assumptions that mechanisms are only activated with specific suitable contexts.</s><s xml:id="_sTa2Qpx">The first stage of a RE is the development of a program theory, which generally seeks to move beyond a more simplistic logic framework that attempts to explain how outcomes are achieved.</s><s xml:id="_mECU3v7">Rather, program theories in RE incorporate a theory of change, and present multiple hypotheses that make explicit how outcomes may be achieved, via what mechanisms and in which contexts.</s><s xml:id="_XuG4vcC">These hypotheses are often referred to as context-mechanism-outcome configurations (CMOs), which could result in a program theory.</s><s xml:id="_r8yJGrK">Program theories can be conceptualized more specifically or at higher levels of abstraction.</s><s xml:id="_63mEAkR">In this study, we adopt a narrow definition of program theory which hypothesizes the pathway by which a specific intervention leads to a goal <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Davidoff et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wnZ9Wav">An initial program theory for RE ideally is developed at the time of the design of a new intervention and refined through the intervention implementation and evaluation.</s></p><p xml:id="_G54gc7B"><s xml:id="_Gcfy75g">A well-developed program theory must involve input of multiple stakeholders to develop a holistic

including the intended users of a service <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Greenhalgh et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Az7f7DM">Co-creation holds promise for research in which there is the intention to innovate solutions that solve human experience problems.</s><s xml:id="_gpmjXYM">In this study, we focus on co-creation with potential end-users (PLWC and care-givers) and stakeholders <ref

the best of our knowledge, have any precedent.</s><s xml:id="_HCYY7nE">The development of an initial program theory also allows for an exploration of the existing CMOs within which the intervention will be implemented.</s><s xml:id="_2JAyCzv">Therefore, the initial program theory development was guided by the question 'Is the use of IVR technology for cancer information provision acceptable and

an IVR system for cancer information awareness and develop an initial program theory to guide the implementation and evaluation of the IVR system.</s><s xml:id="_abvnmMy">Our findings suggest that current cancer awareness remains low in Uganda with myths and misconceptions related to every stage of the cancer care trajectory.</s></p><p xml:id="_rcZe7ed"><s xml:id="_AKgU9Hb">One important study finding is the range in awareness and knowledge of multiple cancers in Uganda with an emphasis on only a couple of cancers.</s><s xml:id="_KCDkFVz">Participants in our study discussed that women were more likely to have increased awareness about cancers, particularly breast and cervical, for a number of reasons including an increased interaction with health professionals <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Sach and Whynes, 2009)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qdqctMg">This trend in Uganda is also visible in the number of recent studies from Uganda that have focused on breast and cervical cancer.</s><s xml:id="_qADdaSz">Although cervical cancer is the most prevalent cancer in Uganda (20%), breast, Kaposi sarcoma, Prostate, and Non-Hodgkin lymphoma all have similar prevalence rates at approximately 7% <ref type="bibr">(Global Cancer Observatory, 2021</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_38e8xrJ">Yet, these cancers receive less attention in the design of interventions and programs.</s><s xml:id="_yJZha5u">By exploring participants' understanding and perceptions of general knowledge of cancer aetiology in their communities, it was clear that while the concept of 'cancer' is not unknown in Uganda, myths and misconceptions persist about the disease, its diagnosis and morbidity.</s><s xml:id="_7gkvCWN">The finding of cancer as caused by witchcraft, spiritual origins, or associated with death is similar with findings in other studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">(Suh et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr">Ndejjo et al., 2017b;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Ngwenya and Huang, 2018;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Scheel et al., 2017)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_dtfgqUb"><s xml:id="_sFrQSXH">Myths and misconceptions about cancer can be addressed by presenting accurate information through trusted channels.</s><s xml:id="_ZQqprPh">Common sources of cancer information were radio, television, family, and community members, which is similar to findings in Uganda <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Mukama et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_BuRdekG">However, all these modes of communication have the same limitation of being available by chance.</s><s xml:id="_eSs3cN5">Participants cannot actively seek out information as or when it is required.</s><s xml:id="_XC4zNyB">This presents a major problem for the public, but particularly for PLWC and their caregivers.</s><s xml:id="_szCsDz5">While some proportion of these individuals will have access to books and the internet for information, many will not be able to access complex digital or written information formats due to cost and literacy limitations.</s><s xml:id="_sXS8MyH">This is particularly problematic for PLWC and caregivers, who attempt to negotiate cancer diagnosis, treatment, and survivorship with limited information.</s><s xml:id="_9g9rf4J">The lack of information had implications for their communication with healthcare professionals.</s><s xml:id="_qg4SfdD">While the participants did not indicate issues of abuse such as reported in domains such as maternal care <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Sacks and Kinney, 2015)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_th8S9Kc">However, there is evidence that there is a cost of ineffective communication between doctors and patients.</s><s xml:id="_6jWfCQb">It results in patients feeling dissatisfied with the information, worsens psychosocial contexts and impacts on their decision-making <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Thorne et al., 2005)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_eBJf7uc">These are all pertinent to the experiences described by our participants, and provides evidence of a gap which can be served by a tool such as our IVR for providing information <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Polit and Beck, 2010)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_NCyJWU2"><s xml:id="_AtEJSSk">Our findings suggested that participants found the concept of an IVR for cancer awareness acceptable and of potential value.</s><s xml:id="_AeuFPe7">They highlighted possible barriers to utilisation as the availability of mobile phones, the internet, and electricity as well as digital literacy and tailored messages.</s><s xml:id="_d6HGWUa">These findings are consistent with similar research on digital health in sub-Saharan and other lowand middle-income countries which have consistently found that barriers to technology utilization include lack of infrastructure such as electricity, literacy, and language <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(Khatun et al., 2016;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Kruse et al., 2019;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Dansharif et al., 2021)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Ry76aCz">However, our results indicated that after addressing these pre-requisites the next hurdle would be ensuring that, how end-users are informed about the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_mQ5frfh">This is a relevant question, particularly for digital interventions, which are rarely scaled-up or sustained beyond the pilot stage <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Jahangirian and Taylor, 2015;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">Luna et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_U5FepF7">Community awareness and uptake of the intervention would be key to be able to evaluate the intervention's effect on cancer awareness and potentially health behaviours.</s></p><p xml:id="_hbVzRAh"><s xml:id="_4WWbEwg">We attempt to synthesize all relevant contexts and mechanisms into an initial program theory provides a working framework for the intervention implementation and future evaluations.</s><s xml:id="_8czbPCc">By making explicit our assumptions about the required context for our intervention, expected mechanisms, and outcomes, we can explore the ultimate intervention outcomes and identify unintended outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_MqQy5E5">The program theory also provides a framework for the evaluation of the implemented IVR evaluation.</s><s xml:id="_Gh3V8Hd">This study provides an example of utilising co-creation principles from the initial conceptualisation of a digital technology intervention.</s><s xml:id="_Zhs587N">While the value of co-creating interventions is known, few digital interventions truly incorporate the end-users into the development of the messages.</s><s xml:id="_a7BAAUG">By including end users and other relevant stakeholders, issues that were unknown to the researchers were raised, including the gendered aspect of health knowledge, lack of demand-based cancer information, and the challenges of marketing the IVR system.</s><s xml:id="_szbxtyM">However, this strength is also linked to a key limitation of this study-the inclusion of only PLWC and caregivers currently receiving care at the UCI.</s><s xml:id="_MBcNjqS">These individuals are probably not completely representative of PLWCs and caregivers at the UCI or Uganda.</s><s xml:id="_A3uuEjz">They tended to be individuals who had prolonged contact with the health care professionals and some of them were now actively engaged in cancer awareness in their communities.</s><s xml:id="_K4c8V2f">However, for the purpose our qualitative study, a sample representative of the entire population was not essential, rather we strove to recruit participants who could serve as rich sources of information both about their personal experiences but also their communities in general.</s><s xml:id="_5yzJg4b">Additionally, the contextual knowledge of the researchers and ongoing reflections during analysis provided opportunities to question the research findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Polit and Beck, 2010)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_rGqyvjT"><s xml:id="_Xuc7NPg">In conclusion, there is a need to address the significant gaps in awareness and understanding of cancer among PLWC, caregivers of PLWC, and the general population in Uganda.</s><s xml:id="_qQrGNnX">An IVR system which addresses existing myths using local languages, positively framed, and accurate messages could contribute to increasing cancer awareness.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p
