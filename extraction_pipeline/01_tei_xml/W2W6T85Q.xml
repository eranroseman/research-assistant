unaware of university pouring rights contracts.</s><s xml:id="_nA5P4pc">This finding is not surprising considering the limited amount of research focused on university pouring rights contracts.</s><s xml:id="_2qtxDD3">In addition, most universities do not typically release details of pouring rights contracts unless specifically asked.</s><s xml:id="_z2cQMsK">This may be due to concerns of public backlash as there are examples of campus stakeholders protesting pouring rights contracts.</s><s xml:id="_j3Zy476">For example, students at San Francisco State successfully ended the universities plans to enter into a pouring rights contact in 2015. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">27</ref></s><s xml:id="_Rng9Hbb">tudents of this study reported a lower awareness of university pouring rights contracts compared to staff and faculty.</s><s xml:id="_p6pTg8h">Students were also more likely to support pouring rights contracts when compared to staff and faculty.</s><s xml:id="_wRZvVgh">These findings are consistent with the Theory of Planned Behavior, which suggests knowledge influences attitudes toward health promotion topics.</s><s xml:id="_hdcgxy2">Although this study does not allow us to confirm causation, it is possible that student's lower awareness of university pouring rights contracts and/or understanding of the health implications of high SSB intake could have contributed to their higher support for university pouring rights contracts.</s></p><p xml:id="_RUKjryN"><s xml:id="_QGA9PwY">Overall, less than half of all participants (38.0%) in the present study expressed support for their university engaging in a pouring rights contract.</s><s xml:id="_sjf6WXE">This finding is consistent with those of Howse et al. who examined pouring rights opinions among 913 Australian college students and staff.</s><s xml:id="_yCWCrPN">The majority (69%) of those surveyed were in favor of removing SSB sponsorships and promotions on campus. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">23</ref></s><s xml:id="_ghSHdAp">This finding is also consistent with past studies that have found parents support the removal of junk food vending machines from K-12 schools. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref></s><s xml:id="_hj6Z6ra">Collectively, these findings beg the question of whether public universities should be considering stakeholder's opinions prior to engaging in pouring rights contracts.</s></p><p xml:id="_NtaJjA4"><s xml:id="_3CMSQGW">Beliefs about the health impacts of SSBs were not significantly associated with support for or against pouring rights contracts.</s><s xml:id="_VhKmnXF">Nevertheless, the findings of this study are consistent with those of Howse et al. concerning participants' beliefs about the health impacts of SSBs-in both studies, nearly all (93.1% and 94.8%, ours and theirs respectively) respondents believed that SSBs are detrimental to health. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">23</ref></s><s xml:id="_dSM7v5Q">urthermore, health concerns emerged as a consistent argument against pouring rights contracts during qualitative analysis.</s><s xml:id="_nkmaxsN">This suggests that education about the health impacts of SSBs may not be an effective intervention strategy alone to change opinions about institutional SSB policy.</s><s xml:id="_xgp9y58">Our qualitative responses, in which many participants recited negative health impacts of SSBs alongside the benefits of funding provided by pouring rights contracts, demonstrated this as well.</s><s xml:id="_CZA2GRP">Again, we found results similar to Howse et al.: "While results indicated a high level of awareness of the health impacts associated with SSB products, there was some resistance to SSB regulation, particularly environment-centered regulations (p.</s><s xml:id="_JDNEGsX">7)." <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">23</ref> Beliefs about individual and environmental responsibility were strongly associated with support for and against campus pouring rights contracts and further confirmed by significant (&gt;2.0) adjusted residual values.</s><s xml:id="_3B7jcRu">These findings support our hypothesis and are in line with the findings of et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">24</ref> who found that the belief that individuals are largely responsible for their diets was negatively associated with support for upstream public policies aimed at reducing obesity risk.</s><s xml:id="_eyWc4GA">A consistent theme that emerged during qualitative analysis of the present study-the belief in individual responsibility-is also in line with these findings.</s><s xml:id="_hRFFZcF">This suggests that the barrier to support for regulation at universities is not a lack of awareness about the health effects of SSBs but rather ideology that favors individual responsibility and the free market over regulations that restrict access to or marketing of SSBs.</s><s xml:id="_wbYZ2Y8">Howse et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">23</ref> suggest capitalizing on individual-centered interventions in the present while building support for environment-centered interventions over the longer term.</s><s xml:id="_4WXRX7E">Interestingly, passage of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act suggests there is support for environmental regulations in primary and secondary school environments, although such support is not currently mirrored in university environments. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">27</ref></s><s xml:id="_s7YKPMw">Future research should investigate how support for SSB regulation varies when young adults, seen as having more agency and more responsibility for their behavior, are targeted.</s></p><p xml:id="_yT3uNkC"><s xml:id="_7FtfHzT">The results of this study may be of concern to health experts, especially regarding the

student/faculty/staff counterparts.</s><s xml:id="_QUSxDkV">SSB intake was found to be higher among males and young adults, which may indicate male undergraduates as a specific target audience to prioritize in future interventions to change opinions about institutional SSB policy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">28</ref></s><s xml:id="_GNyhvXb">t could be argued that pouring rights contracts and the marketing of SSBs on campus are in direct conflict with university health initiatives.</s><s xml:id="_gpjwCpY">Most, if not all, universities have student and campus wellness offices whose charge is to promote the health of all students, faculty, and staff.</s><s xml:id="_cXVMxyQ">Furthermore, many universities in the US have initiated large-scale research and educational programs focused specifically on diseases linked to high SSB intake, including diabetes and obesity.</s><s xml:id="_MgUkhuD">Among participants who reported arguments against pouring rights contracts in their written responses, this concern was commonly discussed (11.4% of all open-ended responses).</s></p><p xml:id="_Kpau7bK"><s xml:id="_gwC9SPC">Although policies have been implemented to improve the quality of foods and beverages provided to children in K-12 schools, few policies have been targeted specifically to young adults attending college.</s><s xml:id="_Va5BEpF">One could argue the same evidence and logic used to support policies targeted to children could be made in support of policies targeted to colleges and universities.</s><s xml:id="_TeTZmfK">The rates of obesity and diabetes among young and middle-aged adults have risen in parallel with rates observed among children over the past several decades <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">29</ref> and the costs for treating these diseases continues to rise. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">30</ref></s><s xml:id="_cYZYUc7">herefore, it makes sense from both a public health and economic perspective to explore policies designed to

xml:id="_C7Z7jca">First, given the large majority of participants agreed that universities should promote the health of students and staff, more research is needed to improve our understanding of the health effects of university pouring rights contracts.</s><s xml:id="_VgBGPyg">Second, because many universities cite financial benefits as a primary reason for engaging in pouring rights contracts in the first place, cost-benefit analyses that quantify and compare the financial benefits to the healthcare costs associated with such contracts are warranted.</s><s xml:id="_B7ECvyC">Third, because we found several knowledge-related factors predicted overall support for pouring rights contracts, studies examining the effect of SSB educational interventions on support of university pouring rights contracts are needed.</s><s xml:id="_XjMHThU">Finally, as many participants agreed that individuals are largely responsible for their own SSB consumption, it is recommended that such interventions be
