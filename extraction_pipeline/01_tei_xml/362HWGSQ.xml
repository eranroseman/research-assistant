<ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Reschly and Christenson, 2012)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tRhW2pu">In the case of student engagement, the term has been interpreted as students' motivation to learn <ref type="bibr">(National Research Council and Institute of Medicine, 2004)</ref>, state of flow (i.e., concentration, interest, and enjoyment; <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">Shernoff et al., 2017)</ref>, or school connectedness <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Jimerson et al., 2003)</ref>, each of which has a notably different meaning.</s><s xml:id="_qmPPVRU">On the other hand, labels like student involvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">(Reed et al., 2002)</ref> and academic engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b100">(Skinner et al., 2009)</ref> are arguably synonymous with certain dimensions of student engagement that are adopted in the field.</s><s xml:id="_kDAsyWE">The jingle-jangle fallacies that are prevalent in the student engagement literature thus represent a lack of consistency in the construct terminology and definition.</s></p><p xml:id="_e6jbuRV"><s xml:id="_CKWydae">Third, object ambiguity refers to the lack of specification on the object or focus of engagement.</s><s xml:id="_WxUMD53">Student engagement researchers often failed to define the object which students are engaged in, and for those who did, there was little consensus on what this object is.</s><s xml:id="_X738GuZ">For example, the object of student engagement has been identified as school and school-related activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Appleton et al., 2008)</ref>, course of study <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Handelsman et al., 2005)</ref>, and learning activities <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">(Reeve and Tseng, 2011)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2ezSz4H">Depending on the object(s) that the students are engaged in, the meaning of student engagement could vary drastically.</s></p><p xml:id="_HyTnhvS"><s xml:id="_WxvKNJY">Lastly, under-theorization represents the inadequate theoretical discourse about the meaning and nature of student engagement.</s><s xml:id="_g5J5aZJ"><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Boekaerts (2016)</ref> noted that, to date, there is not a theory that directly addresses the core meaning of engagement, and student engagement researchers tend to borrow concepts from different motivation theories in their investigations.</s><s xml:id="_ptVKDC7">There is one shortcoming for such a practice, that is, borrowing concepts from other theories poses the danger of conceptual overlap between student engagement and other different but related constructs.</s><s xml:id="_WjmyTHP">For example, student engagement is generally regarded as an outcome of student motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Appleton et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Martin, 2007)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9zUXVzh">Yet, perhaps due to a lack of an engagement theory and the over-reliance on theories of motivation, researchers tend to use motivational concepts like perceived value of school or learning (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Wang et al., 2016)</ref> as indicators of engagement.</s><s xml:id="_TTVQWFv">This has resulted in much confusion about the motivationengagement distinction in the literature and, consequently, slowed down the field's progress.</s></p><p xml:id="_hfXbuBN"><s xml:id="_zv6rk6V">In view of the theoretical-conceptual concerns, the present paper aims to critically examine the models of student engagement existing in the literature, and to put forth a student engagement framework that would help address the aforementioned issues.</s><s xml:id="_KDmYAPw">As an overview, this paper comprises five main sections.</s><s xml:id="_CGMsRVs">The first section seeks to review various perspectives on student engagement in the literature.</s><s xml:id="_4W2Rcsj">This gives us some insights on how student engagement has been conceptualized over the years.</s><s xml:id="_7bsHKgH">Informed by this review, the second section outlines our views on the current state of the construct by identifying its strengths and inherent limitations.</s><s xml:id="_wk2yYVV">For the purpose of proposing conceptual refinement, it also introduces the Dual Component Framework of Student Engagement that regards learning engagement and school engagement as two separate but related constructs.</s><s xml:id="_DnFGf6f">The third and fourth sections clarify the conceptual definitions and boundaries as well as the object and dimensions of the learning engagement and school engagement constructs.</s><s xml:id="_9cSrEzw">Lastly, the fifth section consolidates the key ideas presented in this paper and discusses their theoretical, research, and practical implications in advancing the field of student engagement.</s></p></div>
