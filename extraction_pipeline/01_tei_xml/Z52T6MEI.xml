<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_ykQmxCB">KOL Analysis</head><p xml:id="_ajEHyvp"><s xml:id="_7r3ZXYq">First, it is important to highlight that in a country with no payment or reimbursement tracks or clinical or technical validation standards specific to digital health apps, these findings are based on the individual KOL's experience and perception of the national landscape.</s></p><p xml:id="_jwn5Een"><s xml:id="_rnymSXt">Second, the interviewed KOLs mainly considered that the survey's results, despite the sample size and a possible bias in favor of digital tools, were representative of the study's intended population.</s><s xml:id="_aFfpvnP">This increased our confidence in the obtained results and, consequently, in the conclusions they can draw toward DMHA promotion.</s></p><p xml:id="_us3hcaW"><s xml:id="_XwhJvQw">Third, the fact that KOLs were unanimous regarding several issues-such as access to care, patient centricity, or (need for) mental health professionals' digital literacy draws attention to the fact that the Portuguese health system needs profound transformation.</s><s xml:id="_tzHaGB8">Alerts have been abundant since Europe's health systems suffered from the COVID-19 pandemic and its clinical backlog <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[67]</ref>, which have come on top of long-lasting struggles such as workforce skills, motivation, and retention <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[68,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">69]</ref>; speed of digital transformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[70]</ref>; or the need to foster innovation <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[71]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_E25U5MN">The reference to these topics in unison between knowledgeable people, in a blinded and independent fashion, strengthens these arguments and reinforces the need to act on a broader digital health strategy that encompasses digital health applications.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_6McME7x">Relationship With the Wider Portuguese Health System</head><p xml:id="_NP7STTP"><s xml:id="_RJyrSfZ">The reported results from the survey and the KOL analysis revealed a general immaturity in implementing DMHAs (digital medical products, services, and interventions in general) in Portugal.</s></p><p xml:id="_GdF4utY"><s xml:id="_KXvS7KC">The survey shows an explicit generalized agreement with the perceptions listed concerning potential benefits, barriers, or measures to foster adoption.</s><s xml:id="_8tZT6MY">These results seem polarized to one of the extremes, as disagreement answers were never &gt;21% for the specific questions.</s></p><p xml:id="_xpvZq5c"><s xml:id="_u8z96zF">Moreover, the topics generating the most neutral answers require some practical implementation of these tools-specifically, on the improvement of patient satisfaction, treatment success, and capability to make informed choices; on the lack of support from the manufacturer for technical issues; and on reimbursement of medical prescription, as well as integration of DMHAs in health insurance coverage.</s><s xml:id="_QyNpEu8">We hypothesize that this neutrality confirms a lack of practical experience with these tools.</s><s xml:id="_SQqdKqJ">Otherwise, professionals would have more positive or negative perceptions because of their experience and less ambiguity or one-way polarization.</s></p><p xml:id="_dsmm9Ne"><s xml:id="_yrshqxN">Our theory is compatible with other findings from the survey; although Portuguese professionals are at least as positive in their attitudes toward DMHAs as German professionals, the former group has only a smaller share of those who do intend to prescribe them, thus generating a wider gap between attitudes and prescription intentions for Portuguese mental health professionals than that found for German counterparts in the study by Dahlhausen et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[55]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_vNQxQbf">If their intentions to prescribe are inferior to their German counterparts, then it is expected that they will do so less often, aggravating the know-difference in the practical knowledge of using these tools.</s><s xml:id="_HuV46c9">They also differ regarding the perceived importance of required workflow adjustments as a limitation to adoption.</s><s xml:id="_ke3ume9">This theory is also compatible with the Portuguese health system paradigm concerning mental health as described by the KOLs, who repeatedly reported the professionals' resistance to change and novelty, as well as the intrinsic fear of being replaced by DMHAs, as barriers to DMHA adoption.</s><s xml:id="_UQnRNBS">This barrier should be taken seriously so as not to create a negative reinforcement loop that further restrains professionals from adopting and applying such tools.</s><s xml:id="_958se7a">This is all the truer as the Portuguese National Health Plan <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[72]</ref> ranks "access to mental healthcare" as the sixth most important health determinant for the country's needs but fails to set any of its 37 health objectives to address this issue and its consequences.</s><s xml:id="_xhpgATq">A specific National Program for Mental Health, responsible for producing a National Plan for Mental Health, existed from 2008 [73] until 2020.</s><s xml:id="_cUZTTsP">The National Coordination for Mental Health Policies replaced it at the beginning of 2022 <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[74]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_BQ2dtNe">Although the former has considerably failed to enact mental health care reform <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[75]</ref> and had no mention of DMHAs, the new Coordination is yet to publish its plan and objectives.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_NWE9SUG">Strengths and Limitations</head><p xml:id="_SmmpKwH"><s xml:id="_NcJxEAS">Portugal faces important challenges despite being a relatively small country (approximately 10.5 million inhabitants), namely, a rapidly growing aging population <ref type="bibr" target="#b71">[76]</ref>, declining birth rates <ref type="bibr" target="#b72">[77]</ref>, and an overburdened health system <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[46]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hPCSuwD">These challenges are similar to those encountered in many high-income countries.</s><s xml:id="_zQeKzVF">Therefore, Portugal might serve as a test bed to validate digital solutions that ease the workload on health care providers and increase patient autonomy.</s><s xml:id="_eEhRetX">Our study contributes to this understanding as it is, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first work of its kind on the Portuguese landscape concerning DMHAs.</s></p><p xml:id="_u6XdDzv"><s xml:id="_cvh2xaZ">The study elicits preferences and issues that are clearly important to understand the demand side, as it is visible, for example, through the high degree of agreement in survey answers and KOL responses.</s><s xml:id="_Nhe3vZr">Furthermore, the mixed methods methodology allows us to combine the perspective of those closest to potential users with a helicopter view with in-depth knowledge, making the derived conclusions more robust.</s></p><p xml:id="_wFyrNEJ"><s xml:id="_ePxgae9">All biases inherent to sampling and KOL selection are potential limitations of this study, with the social desirability of the provided answers and the role of expectation in the survey's answer process (ie, the belief respondents might have that they are expected to answer more favorably about technology than they would otherwise do), as well as self-selection, being among the most relevant.</s><s xml:id="_fFNGSnP">Their impact on provided answers is mitigated by the fact that in a postpandemic reality, telehealth (albeit limited to teleconsultation volume) <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[53]</ref> has proven its benefits to a large extent and certainly more than at the time Dahlhausen et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[55]</ref> conducted their study.</s></p><p xml:id="_MfSdB54"><s xml:id="_t6KteTm">The sample number may constitute a further limitation, as 160 answers only partially characterize a population of 1528 psychiatrists and an undetermined number of psychologists.</s><s xml:id="_FCGb8uM">However, the level of agreement between the elements gathered in the survey and the KOLs' assessment, both before and after seeing the survey results, leads us to believe that the underlying uncertainty in the provided answers might not be as considerable as expected.</s><s xml:id="_zsEZUBA">Furthermore, the proportion between psychologists and psychiatrists in our study and the study by Dahlhausen et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[55]</ref> is approximately the same (6 to 1, respectively).</s><s xml:id="_4ZmSgXu">This is a relevant sample characteristic that favors the comparison between the results of both studies.</s><s xml:id="_3PZ7AMX">Finally, the comparability between studies is limited by their different scopes and stages of regulatory development: the study by Dahlhausen et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[55]</ref> was produced when DiGA was starting to roll out and for all digital health applications (ie, not exclusive to mental health); as of the conclusion of this study, Portugal does not have a payment or reimbursement system in place for digital health apps in general, or DMHAs specifically.</s><s xml:id="_mZtMqDe">Even then, the similarity of methods, presentation of results, and the produced discussion allow, in our view, for a proper comparison.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_9ghqvcv">Future Work</head><p xml:id="_uXTfemr"><s xml:id="_mv6UuR5">From a general perspective of digital health apps, it would be useful to fully replicate this study to understand which points are common to all apps and which are solely applicable to DMHAs.</s><s xml:id="_MrzaRyA">Deloitte's report for Health Cluster Portugal <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[78]</ref> is the only known work on the Portuguese domestic market.</s><s xml:id="_NuewnKy">However, its high-level nature reveals how immature the market is in terms of digital health apps.</s><s xml:id="_p9SJ35U">More research is needed to understand their market dynamics, namely, when it comes to the expectations of supply and demand sides.</s><s xml:id="_m5mfMHs">To further improve the interpretation of results and have a clearer sense of the actual differences between Portuguese mental health professionals and their German counterparts, it would be helpful to implement this or similar surveys on the overall Portuguese population.</s><s xml:id="_F3HvYaz">By evaluating the differences between mental health professionals and the people they serve, one could distinguish between context and specific differences attributable to training or skillset.</s><s xml:id="_Bd4sN5n">Moreover, as this is a portrait of the landscape as far as DMHA are concerned and one of the main difficulties that we felt was survey engagement (despite extensive dissemination efforts), it would be essential to perform this extended work with further engagement from professional orders, professional societies, and market-based stakeholders (eg, developers of apps such as 29kFJN <ref type="bibr">[79]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_ZbTgXpz">Outreach to international stakeholders such as BfArM, mobile health Belgium, and market operators with products that have already secured regulatory approval by them would be beneficial.</s></p><p xml:id="_hq47rqB"><s xml:id="_y4syq7z">Given that this necessarily entails regulation, it would be interesting to expand further on the regulatory science angle and the opportunity for either regulatory tracks at the EU level (following calls for European Health Union and increasing competencies of the EU in health care <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[80]</ref>) or regulatory replication to ensure a fair, competitive, and innovative digital health market in the EU.</s><s xml:id="_r6NZDj4">This is in the interests of regulators, companies, and citizens.</s><s xml:id="_AMZw8sp">Finally, it is widely agreed that digital interventions have appreciable potential to deliver more and better health care.</s><s xml:id="_quydYV7">However, if these-or any other health interventions-are to succeed, they need rigorous planning by diagnosing the status, defining targets and priorities, establishing objectives and desirable results, and outlining the best evidence-based strategies and plans to achieve them <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[81]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_PRsMMN5">Monitoring and evaluating the attained results and deriving learned lessons are also necessary.</s><s xml:id="_KSausWf">In the authors' view, this road map for DMHAs would potentially be the most relevant future work that could be done.</s></p></div>
