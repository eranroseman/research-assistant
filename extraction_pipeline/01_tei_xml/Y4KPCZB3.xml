negative feedback loop (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>)termed negative because its function is to negate, or reduce, sensed deviations from a comparison value.</s><s xml:id="_8HCQJra">Though it may look abstract at first, the component processes of this system are really quite simple.</s><s xml:id="_MgaMDxZ">The input function is the sensing of a present condition.</s><s xml:id="_yWfEHVW">That perception is then compared against a point of reference via a mechanism called a comparator.</s><s xml:id="_r4neQ6Z">If a discrepancy is perceived between the present state and the reference value, a behavior is performed (output function), the goal of which is to reduce the dis-crepancy.</s><s xml:id="_KJEaGP8">The behavior does not counter the discrepancy directly but by having an impact on the system's environment (i.e., anything external to the system).</s><s xml:id="_EJWUw4Q">Such an impact creates a change in the present condition, leading to a different perception, which in turn is compared anew with the reference value.</s><s xml:id="_CE8ntBF">This arrangement thus constitutes a closed loop of control, the overall purpose of which is to minimize deviations from the standard of comparison.</s></p><p xml:id="_mwwecBj"><s xml:id="_XMjEKzT">As a concrete example of how these notions can be applied to behavior, imagine a person driving a car down an otherwise empty road.</s><s xml:id="_ebkwMfH">What exactly are people doing when they are driving?</s><s xml:id="_n2Hytx2">Once on the road, driving (for most people) is partly a process of maintaining a visual image of the road sweeping past the fenders and hood of the car.</s><s xml:id="_PuqDanb">One attempts to keep just the proper proportion of the road visible on one's left while the right edge of the road's image intersects the hood at just the proper place.</s><s xml:id="_WRmPrXU">But what happens if this image is not maintained?</s><s xml:id="_xKKSrkG">If, for example, the road begins to curve to the left, the driver will eventually notice that more of the road is becoming visible on the left-hand side of the car.</s><s xml:id="_nrJZ2Xs">This perception differs discriminably from the idealized perception (the standard of comparison).</s><s xml:id="_kESC8dR">For the well-practiced driver, this discrepancy is quickly countered by a slight turn of the steering wheel.</s><s xml:id="_KGGg5KE">This action brings the image of the road back into the appropriate configuration vis-a-vis the image of the hood.</s><s xml:id="_h2xRvU8">Indeed, well-practiced drivers make the adjustments so smoothly that discrepancies are consistently kept quite small.</s></p><p xml:id="_PEEG9vt"><s xml:id="_K6YQMEC">All of the component processes of Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> are used in this example: perception, comparison of the perception with a standard, behavioral output, and the effect of the behavior on the environment.</s><s xml:id="_WfUSjbV">Two elements of <ref type="bibr">Figure 1,</ref><ref type="bibr">however,</ref><ref type="bibr"></ref> have not yet been addressed in any detail.</s><s xml:id="_sX3gGBQ">These are the two influences that originate outside the loop: the reference value and what is labeled disturbance.</s><s xml:id="_gUw9C5W">Let us consider the latter influence first.</s><s xml:id="_tYkzXed">Forces from outside occasionally impinge on any system that does not exist in a complete vacuum.</s><s xml:id="_K7JtgWV">In our example, movements of the driver's hands are not the only influences on the orientation of the car with respect to the image of the road.</s><s xml:id="_8XUEhpU">Moving forward (which driving entails) inevitably introduces a variety of disturbances, as the road curves to the left or the right, as air turbulence buffets the car, and so on.</s><s xml:id="_wxfwxCu">If a crosswind shifts the car's orientation, or if one enters a curve, the visual image of hood and road departs from the desired image, and compensatory behavior is required.</s></p><p xml:id="_q3H3eDw"><s xml:id="_W7fAMVT">Note, however, that the essence of the disturbance is simply that it influences the present state separately from the system's own action.</s><s xml:id="_ptgPQCV">Though it is most intuitive to construe the disturbance as discrepancy creating, that is not its defining quality.</s><s xml:id="_qQEE5gb">Indeed, an environmental disturbance may actually be discrepancy reducing.</s><s xml:id="_NGmVuyr">Suppose, for example, that our driver enters a slight curve to the right.</s><s xml:id="_thzYx3A">A second later a sharp gust of wind sweeps in from the left.</s><s xml:id="_35WchJw">In this case, the second disturbance counters the effects of the first disturbance on the driver's perception, and the driver need not behave at all.</s><s xml:id="_sEpSCBM">The correct perception is induced by the action of the second disturbance.</s></p><p xml:id="_SzbpYPG"><s xml:id="_ZF4txan">This example allows us to emphasize the central function of a feedback system.</s><s xml:id="_KMwurnx">Its purpose is not to create "behavior."</s><s xml:id="_KhSH3QK">Its purpose is to create and maintain the perception of a specific desired condition: that is, whatever condition constitutes its reference value or standard of comparison.</s></p><p xml:id="_RvqNPC2"><s xml:id="_Hyma3FA">Where does the standard of comparison come from?</s><s xml:id="_HHuUzkZ">This is a trickier question.</s><s xml:id="_G2hqX5d">To address it usefully, we must introduce one more bit of complexity-the notion of hierarchical organization.</s><s xml:id="_KuZ5pz5"><ref type="bibr">Powers (1973a;</ref>see also <ref type="bibr">Powers, 1973b)</ref> explicitly considered the possibility that control systems can be interconnected hierarchically and argued that such an organization underlies the self-regulation of behavior in living systems.</s><s xml:id="_cdcRs2G">It is on his reasoning that we now build.'</s><s xml:id="_enFq2pQ">A hierarchically organized system by definition has both superordinate goals and subordinate goals.</s><s xml:id="_PEV3uUr">Attainment of the latter are requisite to-and intimately involved inattainment of the former.</s><s xml:id="_e2tQcBY">Consider Figure <ref type="figure">2</ref> (while keeping in

the hierarchy.</s><s xml:id="_M748MEM">That is, the behavioral output of the superordinate system constitutes the setting of standards for the next lower level.</s><s xml:id="_qfZnMEy">That lower level, in turn, behaves by providing reference values to the next lower level, and so on.</s><s xml:id="_j5966kC">At the very lowest level of the behavioral hierarchy in an animal system, the behavior is more obviously behavior: changes in muscle tensions.</s></p><p xml:id="_2ujMRue"><s xml:id="_jkKMECg">At each level of the hierarchy, the results of the behavior are presumably assessed by

indicate the present level of muscle tension and a comparator that assesses whether the desired muscle tensions are being created (though such perceptions and comparisons may not be represented in

control processes.</s><s xml:id="_qXruHT6">Powers is much more specific, however, about what qualities he believes are controlled at each level of his proposed hierarchy.</s><s xml:id="_Bbj97qZ">To illustrate his reasoning, let us return to our example.</s><s xml:id="_XBeNzPV">This time we will not limit ourselves to the processes by which a driver stays on the road and out of the ditches.</s><s

(1976)</ref> that the most useful level of construing objects for most purposes is an intermediate one-not so fine-grained that the object's overall character is lost and not so general that important attributes of the object are obscured.</s></p><p xml:id="_zSxt3Pf"><s xml:id="_x2yRRQ9">Roles thus fit easily into the general framework under discussion.</s><s xml:id="_nxScWyZ">There is, however, a difference between the schema constituting a role and schemas as we addressed them earlier.</s><s xml:id="_kGVKTeR">Specifically, the existence of one role typically implies the existence of a complementary role.</s><s xml:id="_p25SKct">The two roles thus have a behavioral interdependence that we have largely ignored.</s></p><p xml:id="_GjdtgRS"><s xml:id="_VUNeWCU">Indeed, a closer look at social behavior more generally reveals that, whether role based or not, people's interactions typically are events of greater complexity than we have addressed here.</s><s xml:id="_PApJ3zF">The behavior of one person influences the behavioral options of another in ways that are not random; the two persons are mutually guiding each others' actions.</s><s xml:id="_A9Wc9RR">As people interact in larger groups, still different forces may come into play.</s><s xml:id="_zKApeYx">"Group regulation" (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b134">Wegner, 1981)</ref> involves not just individuals but also the larger collective as an entity.</s></p><p xml:id="_xJan52H"><s xml:id="_N7PhPwE">We wish to make three points with regard to these broader cases.</s><s xml:id="_hjnY6hV">The simplest is the argument that self-regulation on the part of individuals in groups does not differ in principle from self-regulation as discussed earlier.</s><s xml:id="_WPfVTzd">Our assumption is that self-regulation in this case simply proceeds with regard to the group as a system concept rather than to the self-image.</s><s xml:id="_EpDj6Ht">What makes one or the other of these salient for self-regulation at a given time is not entirely clear, though the distinction made previously between private and public aspects of the self may have implications here (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Buss, 1980;</ref><ref type="bibr">Carver &amp; Scheier, 1981a;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">Fenigstein, Scheier, &amp; Buss, 1975;</ref><ref type="bibr">Scheier &amp; Carver, 1981, in press-c)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_6CmFQDe"><s xml:id="_SgKJ5sj">The second point concerns the mutual interdependence that characterizes much of social interaction.</s><s xml:id="_Jq6zufZ">Though such events are more complex than considered in the present article, we see them as amenable to analysis in control-theoretic terms.</s><s xml:id="_nhjNNGC">Indeed, a recent article by <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">Darley and Fazio (1980)</ref> can be viewed as making precisely this case.</s><s xml:id="_84bj3Z9">Those authors discuss the interaction process in terms of (a) one person categorizing the other, thereby choosing a particular behavior, and (b) the second person interpreting the meaning of that behavior, thereby choosing a response.</s><s xml:id="_An9yHkc">The cycle then repeats.</s><s xml:id="_8SGRaV6">Both persons may have their own overriding goals in the interaction, and each may use the behavior of the other as a partial guide in choosing a response while still attempting to attain the overall goal.</s><s xml:id="_3v8Ww4V">Thus, the behavior of each interactant can be seen as reflecting a feedback system.</s><s xml:id="_UUaB8pb">The Darley and Fazio article focused specifically on the processes of interaction that underlie self-fulfilling prophecies.</s><s xml:id="_EqRQbhe">But their position is easily generalized to social interaction patterns more broadly.</s></p><p xml:id="_xvQHJQV"><s xml:id="_V4vaUks">Finally, it is arguable (though our position here is clearly speculative) that interaction between and among persons constitutes an important (perhaps the critical) contributor to the tendency toward increased organization and abstraction of goal systems-a tendency that we alluded to earlier.</s><s xml:id="_aw6cSuD">This idea is, of course, not new to us.</s><s xml:id="_tJMHP7N">A great many theorists over the years have held that the self comes to be known, or is even created, through interaction with others (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">Cooley, 1902;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">Mead, 1934)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hkKhR9F">Others have held that self and context come to be known as distinct from each other simultaneously (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Flavell, 1963;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b102">Piaget, 1928)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_F8xXKRt">Perhaps the necessity of confronting the patterned influences exerted on us by other people ultimately induces both a sense of our own uniqueness and a sense of society, thus contributing to the emergence of the superordinate reference values that Powers termed system concepts.</s></p></div>
