<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_S4k2r3K">Potential to Synergistically Pair with Artificial Intelligence</head><p xml:id="_2PAFpmG"><s xml:id="_cShBRW3">Broadly defined, artificial intelligence (AI) encompasses algorithms that mimic human intelligence through their ability to iteratively look for hidden insights within data without explicitly being programmed to do so <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[54]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_k9ANmHs">Though it was initially coined in 1956 by computer scientist John McCarthy, AI subsequently went through what is referred to as the "AI winter" due to pessimism about the field's potential.</s><s xml:id="_8mhybkB">In recent years, however, AI has reemerged in the medical community as successful use cases have started embedding themselves into every stage of the medical discovery to care delivery pipeline both generally <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[55]</ref> and within cardiology <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[56]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8zXSj9j">Currently, the most common applications of AI in healthcare include risk prediction algorithms, image interpretation, and complex disease phenotyping.</s><s xml:id="_r8jnYC9">What remains to be fully developed is the integration of AI into clinical workflows to intelligently augment clinician decision-making, which represents an opportunity for the field of behavioral economics.</s></p><p xml:id="_vHjTHpp"><s xml:id="_wrDpHUN">A behavioral economist attempts to understand an individual's behavior by examining it through the lens of individual and contextual factors that may have an undue influence on their decision-making.</s><s xml:id="_WHHtegS">Although these factors are often predictable, as outlined in Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>, it becomes difficult to ascribe human behavior to given factors at scale.</s><s xml:id="_kQcEwMa">For example, although Patel et al. was able to separate the effect of peer comparison and financial incentives on step count in their 2016 trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, one can imagine how difficult it would be to assign this degree of causality to every possible influence on health behaviors as would be ideal in delivering optimally effective behavioral interventions at the right time to the right patient.</s><s xml:id="_fTqDaEk">AI, particularly in the form of unsupervised machine learning, could approach this challenge by utilizing large datasets to define behavioral phenotypes.</s><s xml:id="_HWY2jXp">Interventions could then be designed to target different behavioral phenotypes based on which behavioral economics principles would be most effective for each phenotype.</s><s xml:id="_TBtsfmw">In this sense, AI could be applied to understand the behaviors of patients and clinicians alike as a prosthetic to the power of behavioral economics.</s></p><p xml:id="_MhzfGXA"><s xml:id="_4Z4v6qz">The Integration of Behavioral Economics with AI to Improve Decision-Making in Cardiovascular Health Could Take Several Shapes.</s></p><p xml:id="_jNzuyZV"><s xml:id="_Xb94R5t">First, AI can be used to behaviorally phenotype clinicians or patients by the influences they are most sensitive to in an effort to inform the design of personalized behavior change interventions.</s><s xml:id="_T73GgY7">For example, Davoudi et al. analyzed hypertensive patients' interactions with an automated texting platform designed to lower blood pressure using a form of unsupervised machine learning known as k-means clustering to identify six interaction phenotypes among patients, including "perfect" users, who immediately and consistently submitted texts with no errors; "enthusiasts", who submitted unprompted messages with high character counts; and "minimalists", who engaged only when prompted <ref type="bibr">[57•</ref>].</s><s xml:id="_BzvYJ9Y">Of all phenotypes, only the "minimalist" achieved blood pressure goals.</s><s xml:id="_s4rBVAv">Similarly, Chen et al. grouped participants of the STEP UP trial into three behavioral phenotypes based on personality factors and activity level and found that each phenotype had a different response to the intervention [58•].</s><s xml:id="_dsvw7um">A similar approach could be taken to personalize behavioral interventions for other cardiovascular care contexts.</s></p><p xml:id="_gJgrw3j"><s xml:id="_u9gVWJW">Second, AI could be leveraged to predict the optimal timing and context of a behavioral intervention.</s><s xml:id="_KsyJBs6">A common theme in the behavioral economics literature is that minor details can significantly influence an intervention's efficacy, so AI-driven insights on which details matter most could have an outsized impact on the efficacy of a given intervention.</s><s xml:id="_nPqQayH">For example, a supervised machine learningbased approach could build off Oakes et al. recent study which highlighted that statins are significantly less likely to be prescribed at both cardiology and primary care appointments as clinic days progress <ref type="bibr">[59•, 60•]</ref>, indicating that a nudge to increase appropriate statin prescribing could target clinicians more precisely at the end of a clinic day, when the nudge might be most needed as patient and clinician decision fatigue sets in.</s></p><p xml:id="_k3XnF4Y"><s xml:id="_zeKSBkX">Third, clinician-facing nudges can contain machine learning-derived insights to improve clinical decision-making.</s><s xml:id="_keQMvJB">In 2020, Manz et al. demonstrated that using peer comparison and opt-out messages containing machine learning-derived mortality predictions for oncologists' patients led to a significantly higher adjusted rate of serious illness conversations between oncologists and their patients compared to a control group (4.6% vs. 1.3%; 95% CI, 2.3-4.5;</s><s xml:id="_Vb8kMwK">P &lt; 0.001) <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[61]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_srRTx2E">This reveals the power of combining insights from AI, which clinicians may not be privy or respond to otherwise, with behavioral interventions delivered to clinicians when they're most likely to use such insights to promote optimal care delivery.</s></p><p xml:id="_htCyYDz"><s xml:id="_9Jez5Tu">Finally, as the COVID-19 pandemic has catalyzed the rapid uptake of digital care solutions, the analog choice environments of brick-and-mortar clinics have increasingly transitioned to digital choice environments, like EHRs, virtual clinics, or remote monitoring platforms.</s><s xml:id="_d5hUpKx">With this shift comes an increasing opportunity for health systems to design care delivery around newly-digitalized data and levers to influence the behavior of patients and clinicians alike.</s><s xml:id="_GWp77yE">For example, step count data from patient-facing wearable devices could provide a more accurate means of assessing frailty than traditional qualitative data, better informing resource allocation to prevent falls in older individuals.</s><s xml:id="_zQa2Xm8">Clinicians' EHR use patterns could be used to tailor clinical decision support to their unique decision-making style.</s><s xml:id="_5FApYpT">Digital communication platforms could enable health systems to automatically "nudge" patients to ask their clinician about indicated therapies prior to visits.</s><s xml:id="_spwupGK">Though these solutions have a wide range of scope, one theme is common to all: they could all be paired with AI to personalize and magnify their impact.</s></p><p xml:id="_ATap4NG"><s xml:id="_AccJTgT">As decisions in healthcare become more digitalized and data-driven, AI may ultimately reduce the impact of human susceptibility to biases and decision errors.</s><s xml:id="_cwr7mkE">Until then, thoughtfully deployed nudges may facilitate catalyzing positive behavioral change to improve cardiovascular health behaviors and outcomes.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_Z7ASnxZ">Conclusions</head><p xml:id="_hDA8zhQ"><s xml:id="_mkmpRPj">In summary, principles from behavioral economics have been leveraged to enhance the impact of numerous patientand clinician-facing interventions to improve cardiovascular health behaviors and outcomes, both in the clinic and through virtual care mechanisms.</s><s
