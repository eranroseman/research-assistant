children were born to a mother with at least one mental health contact in the 5 years prior to birth, with 15% reported in the year prior to birth and the year post birth.</s><s xml:id="_FG99WzZ">There was a distinct increase in the prevalence of maternal mental health contacts between 1990 and 2013 (4-5% per year, with a peak in 2007).</s><s xml:id="_ufSjTuR">Maternal mental health contacts were associated with living in more disadvantaged areas and major cities, and having a mother aged over 20 years at birth.</s><s xml:id="_mxdhpYV">Conclusions The study affirms that mental health issues place a considerable burden on Aboriginal Australia, and suggests that many of the mental health issues that women develop earlier in life are chronic at the time of conception, during pregnancy and at birth.</s><s xml:id="_yHnqVrx">Early intervention and support for women in the earliest stages of family planning are required to alleviate the burden of mental health problems at birth and after birth.</s><s xml:id="_hXAwjgR">There is a clear need for policies on the development of a holistic healthcare model, with a multisector approach, offering culturally appropriate

three times higher than for other Australians. <ref type="bibr">6 7</ref></s><s xml:id="_vvRFgk3">These inequalities have, at least in part, been attributed to the unique post-colonisation history of Aboriginal Australia and the associated trauma of persistent discrimination, marginalisation, exclusion and dispossession. <ref type="bibr">8 9</ref></s><s xml:id="_UVvT2bk">Past policies and practices of forced removal of Aboriginal children from family and kinship networks have had a significant impact and resulted in adverse consequences on mental health and social and emotional well-being. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> The mechanisms by which parental mental health impacts on children are complex and multifaceted.</s><s xml:id="_nzQXf32">They include direct mechanisms, such as genetic inheritance, intrauterine and antenatal exposure to stress, anxiety and depression, and disrupted attachment formation between the parent and infant which can affect emotional, social and cognitive development. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s xml:id="_qE2xrRg">In addition, socio-economic disadvantage, marital discord and substance use have all been described as posing a risk to child mental health, via indirect mechanisms. <ref type="bibr">3 10</ref></s><s xml:id="_XPd5Mjw">Previous research has identified the main mental health problems

children's own educational and employment outcomes, leading to intergenerational disadvantage.</s><s xml:id="_R3vFHXG">Given the disproportionate burden of disadvantage among Aboriginal Australians, improving social and psychological conditions has the potential to reduce inequalities within Aboriginal populations that stretch across generations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s xml:id="_rUQvbtj">here is a lack of data on the prevalence of mental health contacts in Aboriginal parents in Australia, reflecting, in part, the limitations of available population data.</s><s

Aboriginal children and mental health contacts in the perinatal period.</s><s xml:id="_ZJYcH7T">Specifically, we aim to (1) quantify the prevalence of mental health contacts among Aboriginal mothers; (2) examine how prevalence rates have changed from 1990 to 2013; (3) examine the timing of maternal mental health related contacts, including events proximal to the birth (1 year prior to birth and 1 year post birth) and more distal events (up to 5 years prior to birth); and (4) test the association between maternal mental health related contacts and key socio-demographic
