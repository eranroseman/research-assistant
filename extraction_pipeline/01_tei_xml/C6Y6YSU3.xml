<ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> nontreatment protocols intended to deliver educational and motivational messages, and generic reminders; and (3) treatment protocols that pertain to conditions requiring diagnosis and treatment by a clinician, and are intended to assist patients with self-management.</s><s xml:id="_ZWAf5d4">Any VHA staff member regardless of licensure can register and confirm patient participation in the aTS as well as consent a patient to participate in a nontreatment aTS protocol; however, only licensed VHA clinicians can consent a patient for aTS treatment protocols.</s><s xml:id="_tUp2nsz">When initiating use, patients are asked to acknowledge that they understand the privacy implications of texting, which is not a secure or encrypted form of communication; they must understand that are texting with a computer system, and VHA staff may not regularly read or review the messages, making the system inappropriate for urgent issues or emergencies.</s><s xml:id="_Z49nQFS">Although VHA's aTS was designed as a patient-facing self-management tool, clinical team members can choose to view patient message exchanges and track responses over time through a staff-facing aTS portal.</s><s xml:id="_7NJbFbF">Some of the earliest aTS protocols addressed issues ranging from physical activity engagement, medication adherence, and blood glucose monitoring to colonoscopy preparation, diabetes management and foot care, hypertension management, smoking cessation, and weight management.</s><s xml:id="_qQySsWb">More recent protocols have focused on COVID-19 precautions and vaccination support, HIV treatment, chronic pain, insomnia, and maternity care.</s><s xml:id="_yFsU6Ca">Staff can tailor protocols (eg, content, periodicity, timing) based on patient needs and preferences.</s><s xml:id="_ApJ7cQU">A multidisciplinary group of VHA content and technical subject matter experts maintains the aTS protocol library and guides staff from across VHA facilities on how to adapt existing protocols, and to create, test, and implement new protocols.</s><s xml:id="_frYPd9g">In an implementation-effectiveness cluster randomized trial of the aTS, Yakovchenko et al found that test sites with enhanced aTS implementation support not only had more patients using the aTS, but these patients also reported better adherence to treatment and lower distress about failing treatment compared to usual aTS implementation sites <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_JwUyNC2">This qualitative evaluation examines the implementation experiences of early aTS adopters in VHA to inform national rollout of the system and improve its design and functionality.</s><s xml:id="_SEbahyH">Findings from this evaluation can provide other health care systems with an understanding of the implementation challenges they might face when introducing and expanding their own texting systems.</s><s xml:id="_ssAsB8N">We used the Nonadoption, Abandonment, Scale-up, Spread, and Sustainability (NASSS) framework to organize and synthesize our findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zvft5dW">The NASSS framework identifies 7 domains influencing the uptake and use of patient-facing technologies: condition, technology, value proposition, adopter system, organization, broader surrounding context, and interaction among these domains.</s><s xml:id="_AQVZeb7">An advantage of a complexity-informed framework like NASSS is its acknowledgment that complex adaptive systems develop and behave in unpredictable, dynamic, and nonlinear fashions.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_Ve88u9k">Principal Findings</head><p xml:id="_daaXB3Z"><s xml:id="_TVgXrak">Guided by the NASSS, we evaluated the implementation of an aTS in the nation's largest integrated health care system.</s><s xml:id="_8RBz3qa">The perceived value of the aTS derives from its versatility, patient and staff demand, and growing societal comfort and familiarity with technology that aids health-related communication.</s><s xml:id="_55RkARj">The aTS has considerable potential to complement traditional, in-person care as well as usage of other patient-facing technologies.</s><s xml:id="_ekGad6D">Nevertheless, implementation posed challenges related to the system's limited functionality, mixed user experiences, inadequately defined workflows, and limited interoperability with other systems like the EMR.</s></p><p xml:id="_rQgbTUD"><s xml:id="_HvdERuS">Although staff became competent in using the aTS, many were unable to integrate the system into their workflow given the limited duration of patient visits, technical challenges, and distribution of other clinical tasks.</s><s xml:id="_fgtf5CC">Staff appeared to assume that once a critical number of patients started using the aTS and the burden of educating, consenting, and enrolling large numbers of patients had passed, they would thereafter have the relatively easy task of assigning protocols.</s><s xml:id="_hM23kGy">Despite being a plausible scenario, this can place a heavy burden on early staff adopters who may be expected to perform extra short-term work in the belief they will receive long-term benefits.</s></p><p xml:id="_BV2cJCA"><s xml:id="_vJQSYuv">VHA and other health care systems are investing in technologies for remote delivery of health care services, and texting systems are arguably one of the most efficient forms of communication.</s><s xml:id="_bb2MhUa">However, we found that staff assumptions about many of their patients precluded universal offering of the aTS.</s><s xml:id="_vUGPDnh">Moving forward, safeguards must be established to protect against such bias.</s><s xml:id="_dMuz4bP">More targeted patient outreach was recommended by some participants and is supported by literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rv2FWad">Ways to increase aTS use despite staff concerns could include streamlining the aTS enrollment process by offering the system to all new patients at the time of VHA health care enrollment and providing specially trained staff for this, thereby removing clinical staff from time-consuming front-end processes.</s></p><p xml:id="_bQrdEMS"><s xml:id="_x8TYPWf">We found that some patients were skeptical about texting, whereas others felt little need to improve their self-management and therefore declined the aTS.</s><s xml:id="_nU477tV">Our data highlight how the process of tailoring aTS message content and timing not only encouraged patient use but also enhanced patient autonomy, which aligns with patient-centered care principles <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_BCFBcCd">Although many staff reported that the responses patients sent to the system would rarely change the care they provided, most of the staff wanted access to the patient messages within the aTS and related system reports <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_94DYWuV">As the potential value of patient-generated data grows, future efforts may involve using the aTS to gather patient-reported outcomes, including satisfaction, comprehension of instructions, and postdischarge follow-up assessments <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_u9SaC33"><s xml:id="_pphugpW">In cases of modest patient interest in the aTS system as well as patient memory and cognitive issues, patients and staff suggested that informal caregivers might be greater beneficiaries of the aTS than patients.</s><s xml:id="_46YRVua">Indeed, Wagner et al found text messaging caregivers directly was significantly associated with changes in diabetes outcomes for patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Pup58wr">Extending the reach of the aTS to caregivers requires further study as an implementation strategy and an approach to improving patient outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_hcgdBfw">Moreover, given the heterogeneity of past texting studies, more research is needed to determine associations between texting intervention characteristics (eg, frequency, timing, duration, interactivity) and outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_UpS74ku"><s xml:id="_7E43sTA">The NASSS is quickly becoming a prominent meta-framework for identifying complexities and their interactions in studies of technology implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_eaNZ3GS">The framework posits 3 levels of complexity-simple, complicated, and complex-which may predict technology adoption and nonadoption.</s><s xml:id="_SaXXpvX">New tools, including the NASSS-CAT, are particularly useful in explaining our data and could help guide technology implementation initiatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_X55fUuQ">We used the NASSS-CAT retrospectively; future implementation work may consider using such tools prospectively over the duration of a project.</s></p><p xml:id="_m27GffK"><s xml:id="_KZJpAXn">From our application of the NASSS framework, we determined that overall, the aTS was perceived as easy to use by patients (simple in NASSS terminology) and difficult by staff (complicated in NASSS terminology), a situation that could threaten scalability.</s><s xml:id="_cQF8QXa">In our analysis, the aspect most likely to hamper the uptake and spread of aTS was related to adopters (characteristics and experiences of intended users), principally because there was insufficient staff training, and staff roles and responsibilities for implementation tasks were poorly defined.</s><s xml:id="_xx6WcGu">We determined it as the most unpredictable and abstruse domain (complex in NASSS terminology).</s><s xml:id="_ZXbY2Rx">The only other complex domain was value (users' perceived benefit of the technology), rated as such because staff could detect the potential of the aTS but could not always detect a relative advantage given workload demands.</s><s xml:id="_KjGf544">Such staff views likely fueled their doubts that aTS would be sustainable.</s><s xml:id="_skPMaC2">Several NASSS domains presented moderate difficulty to staff and patients (ie, they were rated as complicated).</s><s xml:id="_jEzkbg3">These were condition (health issue being addressed), technology (innovation characteristics such as system usability and data generated), organization (characteristics of the health care system), and wider system (societal elements such as political and regulatory concerns).</s><s xml:id="_7ytr4AJ">A frequently cited challenge was the lack of the interoperability of the aTS with the EMR and existing patient-facing technologies.</s><s xml:id="_egaJsQX">Interoperability helps drive spread and sustainability by facilitating documentation of aTS enrollment, easily transferring patient responses to clinical notes, and autopopulating text messages unique to an individual patient's situation.</s><s xml:id="_MP26CCp">Integrating the aTS into the EMR has implications for workflows, potentially reducing staff burden.</s><s xml:id="_GPcgnxF">There may also be opportunities for integration of the aTS into population health management tools that are commonly used in VHA <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hukv62a">It is not surprising that no domains were rated as simple given the aTS is a dynamic platform that can address the needs of a range of health conditions, behaviors, and patients.</s><s xml:id="_gpMdPrc">The challenges noted above need not hamper the uptake and spread of the aTS, and since the completion of this evaluation, VHA has made iterative refinements in the aTS, some of which address these challenges.</s><s xml:id="_E8ZnQbS">A variety of practices can help with implementation of new technologies in large complex health care systems: (1) At the facility level, local champions can be identified or assigned, who can assist with multiple aspects of text-messaging promotion, such as marketing and education, technical assistance, and work groups and communities of practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wPkD2Gh">(2) At central levels, an expert panel can be created to oversee text-messaging protocol governance, and, depending on its expertise and capacity, such a panel could also work with individual facilities to develop and test new protocols.</s><s xml:id="_X8yncet">(3) Marketing and educational efforts can be effective in producing materials, supporting websites and helplines, creating training platforms, and convening a community of practice.</s><s xml:id="_3dHSHmg">(4) Finally, dashboards can be created to track new enrollment in text-messaging systems in real time at the national, regional, and facility levels.</s></p></div>
