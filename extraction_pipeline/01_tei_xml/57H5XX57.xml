<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_uVWPYWf">Discussion</head><p xml:id="_BeTrK9C"><s xml:id="_GeTJfue">In the 26 included health app-focused reviews, many of the typical procedures of a systematic literature review as operationalised for app store search and app appraisal were not reported, or not clearly reported.</s><s xml:id="_Vyy3CHe">Absences, lack of clarity or completeness of reporting were observed in: a priori review protocol registration or following a reporting guideline; the processes of screening apps in the app stores; data extraction details from the app store description or which type of device the app was downloaded to for data extraction; and appraisal tools used for assessing the clinical content, app quality or app usability.</s><s xml:id="_rHyQvQB">Further, the majority of articles did not explicitly report clinical efficacy of apps or recommendations for use in clinical setting.</s></p><p xml:id="_JcckhhP"><s xml:id="_pXpVVQH">As health apps are rapidly increasing in number and developed by multiple stakeholders, it is important that health apps are curated and appraised. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47</ref></s><s xml:id="_HRzHNFp">Health app-focused reviews conducted with methodological rigour and published in the peer-reviewed literature should be the mechanism for identifying best in class apps for a health condition.</s><s xml:id="_9Fz3E56">Our study would suggest that this potential is not being met.</s></p><p xml:id="_JtrqcTM"><s xml:id="_dAHSChX">There were few articles that described robust screening processes operationalised for app store searches as an example for other reviewers.</s><s xml:id="_GTQ9NXU">One example included two-step screening process based on app store description and subsequently downloading the apps to devices for detailed screening.</s><s xml:id="_HRa5XX2">Using this two-step approach increased rigour of screening against selection criteria and confirmed apps were available for download.</s><s xml:id="_2UCGPSD">Screening on app store alone increases the chance of including apps where the version is no longer usable in current operating system or only available with login.</s><s xml:id="_7mrebc9">Handling of multiplatform apps during screening was poorly reported, and even when the number of multiplatform apps were reported, it was usually not clear which app version(s) were assessed.</s><s xml:id="_QWYXfPB">This is important as the usability evaluation of an app can vary depending on the operating system. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s xml:id="_2juXBZM">Addressing these methodological shortcomings will require researchers to develop robust protocols and describe the methods of app screening in detail.</s></p><p xml:id="_vP2XXap"><s xml:id="_QZ25sGZ">Only a small proportion of health app-focused reviews reported the source and any adaptation made to guidelines, frameworks or instruments used to evaluate app quality or usability and clinical quality of app content.</s><s xml:id="_wrdnrY4">Bespoke tools adapted from clinical guidelines were often used for assessing clinical quality of app content. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref></s><s xml:id="_ZvDnVVg">Thus, it seems unlikely any 'standard' clinical content quality instrument could be developed and therefore explicit reporting of the criteria and source is necessary to increase confidence in recommending health apps.</s><s xml:id="_5kQDRhU">In a systematic review of 23 studies evaluating the quality of mHealth apps, Nouri et al noted high variability in quality assessment tools or criteria and identified seven classes of quality criteria, with 38 subclasses. <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48</ref></s><s xml:id="_GGykSe2">The authors concluded this likely reflects different domains for evaluating quality depending on the use-case for the apps but also emphasised the requirement for careful and non-overlapping definition of quality criteria.</s><s xml:id="_C4upax6">Health app quality can now be assessed using the validated MARS <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> -published in 2015 and cited almost 550 times.</s><s xml:id="_DZxkKGp">Only a third of the articles published since 2016 assessed app quality with the MARS although use in a higher proportion of health app-focused reviews is likely as maturing methodology and author rigour in app store search and app appraisal methodology occurs.</s><s xml:id="_P5dRTPg">There may be other domains for inclusion in health app-focused reviews.</s><s xml:id="_bQSTywp">A recent scoping review found multiple safety concerns in health apps and recommended mandatory reporting of health app safety. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49</ref></s><s xml:id="_sjedDBd">Another recent study operationalised Health on the Net (HON) Foundation principles, designed for evaluating health web pages, and used these to evaluate popular medical apps. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50</ref></s><s xml:id="_7CKUsVw">Future health app-focused reviews that aim to evaluate app content quality, usability or clinical quality appraisal should utilise the most appropriate, rigorous and contemporaneous evaluation criteria.</s><s xml:id="_cdsRbVA">Some lack of rigour is partly attributable to lack of reporting guidelines for the conduct and reporting of health app-focused reviews.</s><s xml:id="_dFw8hDF">Another contributor is the fast-changing environment in which health app-focused reviews are conducted.</s><s xml:id="_ckqWu6p">For example, only one study 7 reported a priori review registration but it seems one review registration database (i.e.</s><s xml:id="_u9fdnVt">PROSPERO) no longer accepts health app-focused review protocols (personal communication to authors CC 6th January 2018 and DD 18th January 2018).</s><s xml:id="_YJTMMsE">However, a fast-changing environment is a further reason for explicit reporting as any health app-focused review will need to be reliably repeated.</s></p><p xml:id="_UTEzkZe"><s xml:id="_FjBesEk">Another example of unstable environment is searching app stores; unlike electronic journal databases, app stores are not designed for systematic searching and exporting of data. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref></s><s xml:id="_pp9bv2f">There are challenges in removing duplicate apps from app store searches (Android and iOS) and the number of hits from using a key word search in the Google Play store can provide endless results.</s><s xml:id="_Zntan4f">To manage this issue, authors have to decide how to limit searches.</s><s xml:id="_TR8DbZz">One included study screened the first 5 pages of results and deemed this sufficient as no relevant apps were retrieved beyond the first five pages. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref></s><s xml:id="_ZRVEcdg">An app review excluded from our final sample has noted reported the endless Google play app list as a limitation in their review. <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52</ref></s><s xml:id="_XtMQY36">Further, app store searches can provide inconsistent results within a day and thus it is impossible to replicate the search strategy reliably.</s><s xml:id="_W2XyrmE">This is a key methodological challenge to be addressed for rigour in conduct and reporting of health appfocused reviews.</s></p><p xml:id="_SDZCepC"><s xml:id="_eByRT2R">While this scoping review was planned, conducted, and reported according to relevant guidelines, <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> there are limitations to this work.</s><s xml:id="_NzU3QDV">Included health app-focused reviews attested to being systematic, aiming to identify all relevant health apps available in a structured and repeatable manner.</s><s xml:id="_RJm7X8k">Our definition of 'systematic' (as defined in our inclusion criteria) may not have been sufficiently rigorous to select only systematic reviews.</s><s xml:id="_FcbqPa5">If authors used any of three key elements -the article had 'systematic review' in the title OR an a priori systematic search procedure was described in the methods section of the article OR the search process was described based on PRISMA standard flow diagram -then these articles met the inclusion criterion whether or not the authors were intentionally systematic.</s><s xml:id="_rqhxpnF">In contrast, we were very rigorous about defining and recording decision rules for our methodology to ensure consistent decision making about inclusion/exclusion, data extraction, and rating a data element as yes, no, unclear or uncertain.</s><s xml:id="_p9aBgvW">It is possible that the decision rules were unreasonably rigorous and therefore identified excessive numbers of data elements that were 'not clear'.</s><s xml:id="_haSs6Yb">It is also possible that authors conducted health app-focused reviews in a more systematic manner but reported without precision or detail, contributing to the 'no' and 'unclear' ratings.</s><s xml:id="_zJPqvqn">Thus, the health app-focused reviews may be conducted more robustly than it appears from the sample in our research.</s><s xml:id="_gAYzFES">While we registered a study protocol a priori, there was one departure from our study protocol.</s><s xml:id="_QQKBDgd">During the record identification stage, the secondary search of the Journal of Medical Internet Research (JMIR) databases retrieved a large number of potentially eligible articles for screening.</s><s xml:id="_ha7Dk6F">Therefore secondary searches of other journals were not undertaken as planned due to efficiency requirements.</s><s xml:id="_7D6C5r7">This protocol deviation may have led-to failure to identify potentially eligible high-quality health app-focused reviews.</s><s xml:id="_GyFHKDc">If included there may have been some increase in the number of data elements rated 'yes'.</s><s xml:id="_EjGzqUj">A further caution is that including only health app-focused reviews for named/diagnosed health conditions excluded health app-focused reviews of other areas of health or wellness (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_uqXcE2R">diet, exercise, mental health apps) where conduct and reporting may be more rigorous.</s></p><p xml:id="_c6EQUg6"><s xml:id="_zE6RuEc">Our operationalisation of PRISMA guidelines (Table <ref type="table">2</ref>) to health app-focused reviews may not have considered all important aspects of conduct and reporting.</s><s xml:id="_RQrY4Zv">For example, we did not extract data on type of device (computer or mobile device) on which app store screening was undertaken.</s><s xml:id="_aHwSUgf">Any future development of health app-focused review methods could use our data extraction template, modified from the PRISMA literature search and synthesis guideline as a basis for conduct and reporting.</s><s xml:id="_sgkrua7">Future researchers should also consider and extend our proposed methods for their current app environment to be as rigorous in conduct and reporting as possible.</s></p><p xml:id="_3PuETNH"><s xml:id="_gK4x3hk">People with health conditions and clinicians need ways to find apps to support and manage health conditions or augment clinical care, and have confidence these apps are fit for purpose.</s><s xml:id="_XjSSFCJ">Some authors have provided useful summaries of how to find apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53</ref> recommending use of online vendors (apps stores), online repositories (app repositories, online communities, news stories), and peerreviewed literature.</s><s xml:id="_JDhff5G">A recently published framework for finding apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref> recommends the peerreviewed literature as first source to identify both high-quality evaluations of single apps and apps identified in app store search.</s><s xml:id="_KHHdEm8">While criteria for reporting evaluations of mobile health interventions in clinical research are already agreed <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56</ref> to support the likelihood of finding a high-quality evaluation of a single app, our work suggests this is currently less likely for health app-focused reviews.</s></p><p xml:id="_xYzmqAF"><s xml:id="_R2PWqhv">In a previous overview of the quality of health app-focused reviews, the variability in quality was observed.</s><s xml:id="_VxtP9qP">BinDhim et al identified health app-focused reviews that discussed quality or quality-related aspects of health apps for consumers published between 2008 and 2013. <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref></s><s xml:id="_vzPN9Yz">The 10 identified articles were scored on 8 bespoke criteria with a mean score of 5 out of 8 and range 2 to 7. Similar to our study, 80% of articles did not include country of search, and 40% did not clearly explain if apps were evaluated based only on app store description or on app download.</s><s xml:id="_YCM5kyE">A more recent study evaluated 91 health app-focused review articles published between 2010 and 2016 based on 53 items that included the eight criteria from BinDhim et al and additional items based on scope of study, appraisal methods and on Cochrane review methodology. <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51</ref></s><s xml:id="_9mbCZKG">Overall, the assessment of reporting appropriate methodological steps had remarkable similarities to our findings.</s><s xml:id="_gZMgrAG">In line with the findings of these previous studies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">57</ref> our study confirms that the quality of reporting of health app-focused reviews, that is app store searches and app appraisal, could be improved.</s></p><p xml:id="_AcKmKxd"><s xml:id="_YVnhv5H">The goal of high-quality health app-focused reviews in peer-reviewed literature can only be fully realized in co-operation with major app stores/vendors and regulators as infrastructure and regulatory factors are outside the control of those searching for apps.</s><s xml:id="_SfWRBeD">Firstly app stores need stable search environments, not driven by algorithms to promote apps in a non-transparent nature.</s><s xml:id="_wxDStTU">Secondly app stores should require standardized app description fields for medical or health apps that explicitly report process and results of content, usability and efficacy evaluation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54</ref></s><s xml:id="_kNmHvQY">A coordinated approach will be needed to achieve this.</s><s xml:id="_BQT6mFQ">These efforts would considerably advance the efforts to realize the potential for mHealth and improve health outcomes.</s></p></div>
