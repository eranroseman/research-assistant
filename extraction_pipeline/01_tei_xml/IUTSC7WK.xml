pedometers or activity trackers, have gained significant popularity in recent years, as small wearable devices have become an integral part of many individuals' daily lives <ref

sensors, the most common of which are Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs), barometers, and GPS systems when they are used for step counting.</s><s xml:id="_jGtrjPv">IMUs are composed of accelerometers,

type="bibr">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rMWAa3w">In most circumstances, the accelerometer acts as the lead sensor while the gyroscope functions as the supplementary sensor.</s><s xml:id="_gpz92r4">There are walking patterns, such as climbing stairs, where performance improves when gyroscopic data are used due to the oscillation of the body.</s><s xml:id="_mfEX29Q">Barometers can be useful in detecting steps while climbing stairs, due to the differences in elevation detectable from atmospheric pressures <ref type="bibr">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ZB8nGMW">Additionally, GPS data can be fused with other sensor data to estimate the number of steps taken, distance and speed.</s><s xml:id="_jFsNq4t">All these sensors can be embedded in devices applied on different body locations, mostly on the wrist such as in the case of smartwatches and activity trackers.</s></p><p xml:id="_CtYfQHu"><s xml:id="_7nwZJfb">Sensorized insoles can be based on several types of sensors, commonly capacitive or piezoresistive <ref type="bibr">[16]</ref>, and differ from the previously cited technology as they are directly applied under the foot, therefore they directly sense the pressures applied on the insole and can derive the number of steps.</s><s xml:id="_XkJaVfA">Another technology of interest is ankle force myography (FMG), which is recorded by using piezoresistive sensors surrounding the ankle to register the volumetric changes during muscle activities.</s><s xml:id="_rcZVAuF">Even during a low-speed walking, where accelerometer-based step counters encounter difficulties <ref type="bibr">[6]</ref>, the contraction and relaxation of the extensors and flexors causes different force distributions on the ankle-worn band, resulting in distinctive FMG patterns, and thus allowing to count the number of steps.</s></p><p xml:id="_6bPHAne"><s xml:id="_CSN2aww">A limitation of commercial step counting wearable devices, and of wearable devices in general, is that

measurements from multiple devices and need the flexibility to customize acquisition parameters to suit their specific study needs.</s><s xml:id="_4MTHF2t">In fact, to do research effectively, a

published validation data, therefore the accuracy and reliability of such devices must be assessed before using them.</s><s xml:id="_zXjHzeb">Some studies show how different smartwatches output different numbers of steps after the same walking activity is performed <ref type="bibr">[17]</ref>, thus raising doubts about the validity of some algorithms embedded in commercial smartwatches.</s><s xml:id="_CuXJrnk">Moore et al. <ref type="bibr">[18]</ref> presented a scoping review on treadmill-based validation of step counting wearable technologies, in an attempt to provide a harmonized, empirically based set of best practices.</s><s xml:id="_Bh6Q5eA">As a recommendation on a given number of steps per day to take is being increasingly used both in individual and public health interventions, as in the case of the "10000 steps per day" recommendation from by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) <ref type="bibr">[19]</ref>, validation of wearables for
