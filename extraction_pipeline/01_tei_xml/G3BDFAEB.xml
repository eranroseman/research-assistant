(body mass index [BMI] &gt;25 kg/m 2 ), with the prevalence of obesity among adult women at 35.5% and among adult men at 32.2% <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qfVrAjc">Overweight and obesity is associated with several chronic diseases, including type 2 diabetes, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, arthritis, hyperlipidemia, and asthma <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_TUg688t">Even modest weight loss-around a 5% decrease in body weight-has been shown to have significant impacts in the decrease of chronic disease risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_qKNzxqM"><s xml:id="_ay5Jvxr">Behavioral interventions that target improvements in diet and physical activity are an effective way to help people lose weight and decrease chronic disease risk factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_TFtQa2Y">Behavioral weight-loss research programs typically involve weekly or twice-monthly, face-to-face behavioral sessions involving a group of 10-20 members and a team of weight-loss research staff <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qKfpjfY">Although this can be an effective way to help people lose weight, it is time and resource intensive and not easy to disseminate.</s><s xml:id="_enCpNwZ">Additionally, many people feel that participation in face-to-face weight-loss interventions is time consuming and often inconvenient <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_BHPwRcV">Moving away from a face-to-face setting to a mobile delivery method is a promising strategy in the delivery of a behavioral weight-loss intervention.</s></p><p xml:id="_nVZ825W"><s xml:id="_QepvvBu">Mobile technologies, such as Internet-capable mobile devices (eg, iPhone and BlackBerry), could prove to be a useful conduit for delivery of a weight-loss program.</s><s xml:id="_u8qWTJ2">The use of mobile devices has been on the rise.</s><s xml:id="_93nhzKU">In 2010, 40% of adults in the United States used a mobile phone to access the Internet or send an email or instant message, and rates of these activities increased over the previous year <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_pCyhRkS">US adults are also accessing audio using portable devices (MP3 players), with 46% of US adults reporting they own an MP3 player <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and 19% of Internet users reporting that they have downloaded a podcast (an audio file that can be listened to on a computer or mobile media player) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_vd2RmAm">Podcasts may also see a growth in use due to the popularity of cloud computing (publishing, hosting, and accessing data all online), which has made the ability to listen to and create podcasts easier <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_5NABaBf"><s xml:id="_CE7WFje">Research has been emerging on the use of mobile technologies to help people achieve a healthy weight.</s><s

type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> and dietary intake <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_4FQ2Yn5">Few studies, however, have used an entirely mobile device-based approach to deliver a behavioral weight-loss intervention.</s><s xml:id="_YnNvkN2">For example, studies may use text messaging sent to mobile devices (short message service <ref type="bibr">[SMS]</ref>) for support in addition to face-to-face group sessions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8FnMWh9">One study that used an entirely mobile-based approach was conducted by Patrick and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> among overweight men and women.</s><s xml:id="_f7Dva9h">This behavioral weight-loss intervention was delivered entirely through SMS with a mixture of standard and targeted messages to participants, who on average had lost 3.16% of their body weight at 4 months <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HNqvdep">Another technology-delivered intervention that contained a sizable mobile component targeted increasing physical activity among healthy, slightly overweight (BMI 26.3 kg/m 2 ) men and women.</s><s xml:id="_jDesUKD">Participants in the intervention group received targeted messages on overcoming barriers via the Internet and reminders to be physically active delivered via SMS and email, and had access to a message board to discuss experiences with other study participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_h7GTbua"><s xml:id="_7PsJpRw">Our previous work demonstrated that a short-term behavioral weight-loss intervention could be successfully delivered via podcast <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NJBqcjP">In that 3-month trial, 78 participants were randomly assigned to receive a podcast designed based on social cognitive theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> (enhanced) or a popular weight-loss podcast (control) available online.</s><s xml:id="_m3bmV2n">Weight losses were significantly greater in the enhanced podcast group (mean -2.9, SD 3.5 kg) than in the controls (mean -0.3, SD 2.1 kg; P &lt; .001 between groups).</s><s xml:id="_RMNRhbR">This study, however, was short-term and weight losses were modest.</s><s xml:id="_6NskbSS">A podcast-only format also limited the ability to provide participants with easy ways to self-monitor diet and physical activity and to receive social support (that would normally be delivered in a face-to-face group setting).</s><s xml:id="_AjQBMkB">To our knowledge, no previous studies have employed a combination of podcasting, mobile support communication, and mobile diet monitoring to assist people in weight loss.</s><s xml:id="_j3NaJCp">Therefore, we explored the use of this enhanced mobile approach as a way to help people lose weight in the Mobile Pounds Off Digitally (Mobile POD) intervention.</s></p></div>

intake.</s><s xml:id="_cN2Vw7e">Podcast participants may have been at an advantage with regard to diet monitoring, since they were able to choose which method they preferred to use and, if they chose to use an app (13/41, 32% of participants), they were free to choose which one would be best for their device.</s><s xml:id="_4pPyDe3">In a recent study examining differences in dietary intake between participants randomly assigned to monitor their diet via a handheld electronic device or paper journal, no differences were seen between the groups in weight loss, energy intake, or percentage of energy (kcal) from fat <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5qKYf3y">This demonstrates that adherence to monitoring is what is important for weight loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, regardless of method.</s><s xml:id="_MmtqTxQ">With both groups collapsed, we did see a significant difference in number of days per week participants reported self-monitoring diet, with participants using a mobile device recording twice as many days as those using a paper method.</s><s xml:id="_2Gnxdmt">This finding warrants further exploration in future studies and points to the possibility of recommending self-monitoring methods that are tailored to users' needs, mobile devices, and comfort level with technology.</s></p><p xml:id="_NyZXz4W"><s xml:id="_sWMdhj6">The study content was delivered mainly through podcast messages for both groups.</s><s xml:id="_E9VJ5Yv">The number of podcasts participants reported downloading from months 0 to 3 and months 3 to 6 did not differ between the groups, but the objective number of downloads from each groups' podcast site did differ significantly.</s><s xml:id="_8gqPH9j">There were significantly more downloads per person in the Podcast+Mobile group than in the Podcast group.</s><s xml:id="_JsmtF7z">This may not have corresponded to more podcasts listened to, since participants may have initiated a download of an episode but later returned to finish the episode (starting another compete download).</s><s xml:id="_p5ANfqA">It is possible that Podcast+Mobile participants may have listened to podcast episodes multiple times as well or shared the podcast links with friends.</s><s xml:id="_bBgcdXf">Since Twitter messages prompted Podcast+Mobile participants to listen to the latest podcast episode, this method may have been an additional way for participants to remember to access the podcasts or be reminded to go back and listen to an episode as a refresher.</s></p><p xml:id="_gTg8cFt"><s xml:id="_rhrFbsT">Social support has been shown to be a possible key component in behavioral weight-loss programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_YpEBN86">The present study used Twitter as a method to deliver prompts from the program and allow participants to support each other during their weight-loss efforts.</s><s xml:id="_ZBXcSMJ">The study coordinator posted 2 messages to participants per day that could be easily automated, as the messages were not in response to participants.</s><s xml:id="_QhHrxDs">An additional advantage of Twitter is that it allowed for real-time support, such as asking fellow participants about healthy dining options once a participant arrives in a restaurant.</s><s xml:id="_NETUqCP">However, the number of Twitter posts averaged 2 per week, and declined over time, so participants were not communicating with other group members frequently.</s><s xml:id="_3HaDHcZ">Podcast+Mobile participants were initially assigned to a small cohort of 10-11 people.</s><s xml:id="_2Ryxda6">This was to allow for effective communication and to prevent participants from being overwhelmed with too many posts by other members.</s><s xml:id="_6W7YCZx">Participation was sporadic, however, so during the 3-to 6-month time period, Podcast+Mobile participants were asked to follow everyone within the Podcast+Mobile group to help facilitate more active discussion.</s><s xml:id="_YWNvKhr">It is possible there was not enough interaction to provide adequate social support, or this study may be similar to other studies that found no benefit of enhancing social support among weight-loss participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Hvvvk4Z">The podcasts, which were the same for both groups, encouraged establishing a good support system for weight loss.</s><s xml:id="_bEbjHcT">Both groups felt equally supported in their weight-loss efforts, but source of support differed.</s><s xml:id="_73pGBYs">Podcast participants mainly turned to real-life friends as sources of support, whereas Podcast+Mobile participants relied on Internet-based sources, namely Twitter.</s></p><p xml:id="_VKUKCx2"><s xml:id="_pbjXZZf">Several studies have shown that targeting dietary self-monitoring, providing social support, and emphasizing both dietary changes and physical activity are key components to successful face-to-face behavioral weight-loss programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_yjpRWz7">We sought to improve on our previous trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> by enhancing these components through advanced mobile technology means.</s><s xml:id="_XsHejzm">Both groups, however, found ways to self-monitor diet and obtain social support, meaning that structural aspects of the groups differed in type but not amount, which was reflected in the weight-loss outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_ynZEVy5">Several of the components of Internet-based weight-loss interventions that have been shown to be effective were part of the Podcast+Mobile intervention, including self-monitoring, use of established behavioral strategies, and social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hD27bGC">Other effective aspects were not included, such as study counselor feedback and tailoring of messages and information <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_nZQrFV3">Future studies examining ways to enhance weight loss of participants receiving a mobile, podcast-delivered weight-loss intervention may wish to find ways to provide more individualized feedback (which could be human or automated) on dietary self-monitoring and intake, physical activity progress, and weight loss.</s><s xml:id="_agaUGzb">Additionally, ways to tailor the intervention components to participant characteristics, such as body weight, dietary intake, or physical activity, may enhance weight losses over nontailored approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hQTmDAZ">Designers of future interventions may wish to find ways to offer a multimodal intervention to appeal to diverse users.</s><s xml:id="_TkS5h7q">There were several strengths to this study.</s><s xml:id="_VpMvFeU">This intervention used a randomized design and intention-to-treat analysis.</s><s xml:id="_xmaDCak">The study also had strong retention rates, used an objective measure for weight, and included 2 unannounced days of dietary intake collected using a multiple-pass method.</s><s xml:id="_VnPRefu">This intervention is an approach that could be easily disseminated, as there was very minimal contact with participants, everything was delivered remotely, and it was low cost.</s><s xml:id="_95k7T2C">The study also had some limitations.</s><s xml:id="_sZMGXUc">The study population was mostly white and female.</s><s xml:id="_gYcyr45">The study was short-term (6 months) and so it was able to examine initial weight loss but not weight-loss maintenance.</s><s xml:id="_KH3FCSH">The groups also differed in prior experience with apps and podcasts, showing that those in the Podcast+Mobile group may have been more technically savvy or more familiar with the technology used in the study at baseline.</s><s xml:id="_7ZpTypY">This did not seem to affect the results, and equal numbers of participants from each group were members of Twitter at baseline.</s><s xml:id="_G8Pzvrm">Participants who did not complete the study were significantly younger and less likely than completers to be white, and therefore some aspect of the study may not have been well suited to this demographic group.</s></p><p xml:id="_xhudKev"><s xml:id="_TeJ7EyY">In summary, the Mobile POD, 6-month, minimal-contact intervention was effective at helping participants achieve a mean weight loss of 2.7% of their body weight, and perhaps was useful in preventing holiday weight gain.</s><s xml:id="_DBvFEEH">Both groups reported similar levels of social support and days of dietary monitoring, demonstrating that providing these components was not necessary, and that the podcasts' emphasis on directing participants to find these components was effective.</s><s xml:id="_xVDbfNK">Future studies may wish to find ways to combine podcasts with tailored feedback for participants to enhance compliance with dietary and physical activity recommendations and to improve weight loss.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure
