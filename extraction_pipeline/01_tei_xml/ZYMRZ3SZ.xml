it also attests to the strong desire among researchers and practitioners to determine its efficacy and to gather evidence to inform best practices.</s></p><p xml:id="_9jXejXP"><s xml:id="_WEzFm4Y">Despite its rapid growth, however, this area of research and practice is still in its adolescence, and it remains difficult to interpret and synthesize research findings across diverse study designs, health topics, and study purposes to effectively translate findings into best practices.</s><s xml:id="_T3Gztqe">Therefore, our review did not aim to synthesize best practices where the strength or specificity of evidence was lacking or mixed, but it focused instead on summarizing the published research review literature on TMIs and organizing it by targeted health topics, health outcomes and behaviors, and SMS intervention characteristics.</s><s xml:id="_9xPbs5S">Almost all of the 15 reviews and meta-analyses that we coded found that the reviewed TMI studies, using extremely diverse intervention characteristics, had significantly positive effects on diverse health behaviors.</s><s xml:id="_CZ7EBaf">These results were further confirmed upon review of the original TMI studies included in these reviews and removal of the duplicates that appeared in multiple reviews.</s><s xml:id="_yjhsrya">Several of the reviews we analyzed also conducted meta-analyses, which permit more meaningful numerical comparisons across studies in a standard form and allow for more inferential findings and evidence for practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(27)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_sGWNWHQ">All of the meta-analyses we reviewed concluded that TMIs had a statistically significant positive effect on health outcomes and/or health behaviors.</s><s xml:id="_Bzr9kVf">Overall, the majority of reviews we reviewed reported low-to-moderate quality of evidence (i.e., few findings were reported as high-quality evidence by review study authors) to demonstrate the effectiveness of TMIs on health behavior outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_y3zRTpk">Frequently mentioned limitations across the reviews included lack of rigorous study designs, small sample sizes, short intervention durations, and lack of representative study populations and environments.</s><s xml:id="_MexFdDX">Furthermore, to bridge the gap between mobile technological advancements and delays in RCT TMI findings, more adaptive and iterative study design and evaluation methods could be implemented, such as the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) and the Sequential Multiple Assignment Randomized Trial (SMART) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(34)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_7bD9M8T"><s xml:id="_v97z5MA">An interesting finding from some of the reviews published more recently is the inclusion or discussion of interventions using MMS.</s><s xml:id="_rBVMm8K">Since MMS is a newer, more advanced version of mobile messaging that lacks the high level of access and high frequency of use of SMS, we did not account for this term in our search strategy.</s><s xml:id="_E3N6aCp">Moreover, MMS is not yet an indexed MeSH term in PubMed, whereas SMS is; however, a few reviews included MMS within their TMI study samples, whereby recipients would receive nontext information such as links, images, or videos <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">(46)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_uTfnnM2">Although a few reviews included descriptions of SMS and MMS in their introductions as examples of mobile messaging (6, 43), the other reviews did not make this distinction, which made it extremely difficult to distinguish TMI components.</s><s xml:id="_3FQyEjz">It is likely that MMS will become a more frequent feature of future TMIs for public health, especially as most mobile users shift to smartphones with more advanced messaging capabilities.</s><s xml:id="_jWCYJFT">In addition, new mobile messaging services, such as Facebook Messenger, Kik, WhatsApp, SnapChat, and Instagram, all have functions that emulate and often surpass both SMS and MMS functionality, including the ability to add searchable tags or hashtags to content.</s><s xml:id="_Eftjgqq">Future research on TMIs for public health must also explore the potential intended and unintended consequences of these emerging and innovative mobile messaging tools, especially among their most frequent users such as younger audiences.</s></p><p xml:id="_4W8gPJh"><s xml:id="_dE68NMZ">Although inferring patterns and making recommendations on specific TMI characteristics is a challenging task given the diverse array of studies and reviews, we did find somewhat consistent evidence that TMIs generally resulted in significant positive benefits in the areas of diabetes self-management, physical activity, weight loss, smoking cessation, and medication adherence for ART.</s><s xml:id="_PYDje6H">Inclusion criteria across the reviews were mixed, with some reviews including only specific health topics or specific designs, analyzing TMI only as a stand-alone intervention, or addressing health care administration (e.g., basic appointment reminders) as opposed to public health issues.</s><s xml:id="_EFSP7CG">Regarding TMI characteristics, the reported results were mixed, and many of the reviews included studies with diverse or missing data on TMI components; however, some reasonable conclusions related to TMI characteristics could be reached.</s><s xml:id="_Na7pFQ4">For example, greater effects were associated with text messages on ART adherence that were sent less frequently than daily (such as weekly) and that used bidirectionality, personalization, and tailoring to clinical needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(18)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_U9RrU9P">Positive findings were associated with all health promotion or medication adherence TMI studies using tailored or personalized messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(36)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tquqknK">Daily to weekly TMI message frequency for weight loss appeared to increase program retention <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">40)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Se5ZmVY">Although these findings are important to consider when planning interventions in these areas, we could not infer whether increasing TMI complexity with characteristics such as personalization, tailoring, and varying delivery frequency is likely to increase intervention costs.</s><s xml:id="_jMAZhZH">Furthermore, caution toward unintended consequences of TMIs should be considered before applying them to other health areas.</s></p><p xml:id="_rNc96ny"><s xml:id="_cwhnFBG">Most notable to us were the findings from the most recently published meta-analyses and systematic reviews, because the earliest published reviews had fewer published studies to consider and may have included greater numbers of pilot studies with smaller samples and/or less rigorous study designs.</s><s xml:id="_fr385YE">For example, Fjeldsoe et al. (10) reported that TMIs showed positive short-term outcomes in 13 out of 14 studies on diverse health issues and that intervention characteristics such as tailoring and interactivity were important features of TMIs.</s><s xml:id="_jZm6Zka">In contrast, Head et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(16)</ref>, given the benefit of more published TMI research, were able to conduct a meta-analysis of the efficacy of TMIs for health promotion using only studies using RCTs.</s><s xml:id="_MqYtuvk">They found that smoking cessation and physical activity outcomes were most amenable to change through TMIs.</s><s xml:id="_P7zXqX7">Additionally, they found that message tailoring and personalization were significantly associated with increased TMI efficacy.</s><s xml:id="_gMpzXqk">Whereas the older and more health topic-focused reviews were not able to conduct meta-analyses due to a lack of available studies with rigorous designs and ample data, we would expect this challenge to diminish as a greater number of rigorous TMI studies are funded, conducted, and published.</s><s xml:id="_hJzUyrk">To this end, a majority of reviews reported on numerous ongoing TMI studies with more rigorous designs, such as larger scale RCTs.</s><s xml:id="_NgBupv4">Free et al. ( <ref type="formula">11</ref>) also listed several studies that were published after the search of their review was completed and were not included in their analysis.</s></p><p xml:id="_D2ez8BB"><s xml:id="_eFQdEbJ">Based on our review findings and the synthesized recommendations from the review authors, we believe that future studies of TMIs for health, including systematic reviews and meta-analyses, should seek to focus on specific health behaviors and outcomes, populations, settings, and TMI characteristics, including MMS components, rather than offer broad overviews of a variety of TMIs, mobile technologies, and health outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_95unuKJ">This will allow for more practical and applicable findings.</s><s xml:id="_5UFW8Ge">Future research on cost-effectiveness is also essential, particularly in developing countries and/or for more sophisticated intervention designs and characteristics.</s><s xml:id="_YVEk355">Furthermore, the variability of outcome measures and follow-up assessment durations makes it difficult, if not impossible, to make comparisons and reach conclusions across studies.</s><s xml:id="_MBXUuxe">Therefore, consensus among researchers is needed to identify and adopt standardized outcome measures and to set standardized follow-up assessment periods, such as six weeks, to facilitate future comparative assessments.</s></p><p xml:id="_ugTFAG8"><s xml:id="_SVMBudS">When considering the results from our review of reviews, it is important to note that this study was primarily limited to capturing and reporting information that appeared in systematic reviews and meta-analyses, with full-text individual studies only accessed to fill major data gaps or to assess differences regarding specific studies coded in multiple reviews.</s><s xml:id="_ybX3FCV">The broad variation in the scope and specificity of the TMI components reported complicated our task to synthesize the information across a large number of reviews.</s><s xml:id="_ztXCe9C">For example, very few reviews reported on the use of behavior theory in TMIs, so it is possible that a greater number of studies utilized behavior theory, but this information was not reported in many reviews and was therefore not available to us.</s></p><p xml:id="_84tecNz"><s xml:id="_Zy38xpT">Additionally, interpretation of our review of review findings should consider the potential omissions and errors that may be present in our coding and findings as a result of unreported errors in the original reviews and/or underlying studies.</s><s xml:id="_h7wXdBK">We sought to minimize errors of interpretation through dual coding and resolution with a third coauthor at each step of our data extraction process.</s><s xml:id="_aZmhayN">Furthermore, the presence of accurately coded duplicate studies across reviews and our efforts to resolve unclear and disparate study descriptions by consulting the original studies all contributed to the accuracy of our data.</s></p><p xml:id="_qYgeMCU"><s xml:id="_83SjEHn">Finally, in our attempt to be as comprehensive as possible, we sought to include all reviews that assessed the effectiveness of TMIs on health outcomes and behaviors, which led to the inclusion of reviews that were not specifically focused on SMS and/or included other mHealth components in addition to SMS <ref type="bibr">(11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">34)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zN3azeE">The diversity of review paper types and the inclusion of non-SMS studies in our review paper sample presented particular difficulty in the interpretation of results, as review authors provided inconsistent methods for reporting and synthesizing their TMI findings.</s></p></div>
