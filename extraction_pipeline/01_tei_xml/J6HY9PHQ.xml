Participants involved in a recent study concerning schizophrenia also expressed concerns that reliance on simple symptom scores derived from text messages might inadequately represent their experiences, suggesting that they should accompany other more traditional measurement and assessment protocols <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_w3yT4gf">Indeed, whilst automated systems may provide an opportunity to gather large volumes of data from many recipients in a quick and cost-effective manner, one obvious and practical disadvantage regarding a standard text message is that it is limited in length, to phrases comprising less than 160 characters.</s><s xml:id="_2hpmbvs">Formatting restrictions also hinder the presentation and collection of complex information, for which printed questionnaires or diaries may be better suited.</s></p><p xml:id="_tc47EvN"><s xml:id="_34C74HR">Nevertheless, text messaging may serve as a useful adjunct to more traditional methods of data collection until MMS (multimedia messaging service) and smartphone use becomes cheaper and more widespread.</s></p><p xml:id="_Ftr2K96"><s xml:id="_g7MwB8b">Text messaging may further alleviate problems of incomplete data, threatening both internal and external validity in clinical research.</s><s xml:id="_ETEaeyw">This poses a particular problem for research involving groups of people who may be less inclined to respond to postal requests or attend appointments, e.g.</s><s xml:id="_Wqq53RA">patients with depression.</s><s xml:id="_MbpPs8V">In such cases, simple text responses could provide valuable supplementary information which might be used to impute missing data gathered by more conventional methods.</s><s xml:id="_tuYJUbG">Moreover, automated SMS systems can also be used to improve data collection by reminding research participants to attend appointments, return questionnaires, etc.</s></p><p xml:id="_ARVBr37"><s xml:id="_z3b9k5p">Research on the use of text messaging for collecting outcome data on experiences of depression is extremely limited, and has not been attempted in RCTs.</s><s xml:id="_ZYqQwzr">A search of PubMed from inception to 19 th March 2014 using the terms 'sms' and 'depression', and 'text messaging' and 'depression', revealed only 70 published papers, of which just three reported original findings on the use of text messaging as an outcome measure for low mood or depression.</s><s xml:id="_rvpdm6v">Two of these studies concerned the use of weekly text messages amongst participants with bipolar disorder to plot the longitudinal course of the disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and mood forecasting <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_b922VHE">The other small case study investigated the feasibility of daily text messaging to monitor mood among patients with anxiety and depression in a remote Australian community <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_spkkNvx">The latter used a 0 to 10 rating scale, and was found to be easy to implement, resulting in good compliance, and valuable clinical data.</s></p><p xml:id="_D7eM9sv"><s xml:id="_C9ENmd5">Peer review of the present manuscript in June 2014 identified a further two relevant research articles, which were published in journals not listed by PubMed.</s><s xml:id="_wdgtsfU">The first of these describes a commercially available SMS instrument (Mood 24/7) for monitoring mood <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_MQNYzNm">Whilst this study reported good daily compliance (87%) in use amongst a non-clinical population, the instrument described does not yet appear to have been validated for use as an outcome measure amongst patients with depression.</s><s xml:id="_jganRVr">The second paper describes an exploratory study using text messaging amongst twelve, English or Spanish speaking, patients enrolled into a group based cognitive behavioural therapy programme <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fVcgdWa">This included messages asking participants to report their current mood on a scale from 0 to 10. Results from this study indicate that text messaging may provide a useful low-cost means of improving engagement and attendance for group psychotherapy.</s><s xml:id="_ccxpkeV">The average response rate to text messages was 65%, although again, the SMS mood scale developed for this study was not compared to any previously established outcome measure of depression.</s></p><p xml:id="_yzKVnMG"><s xml:id="_cXM2BSq">The present study examines the feasibility, acceptability, validity and utility of SMS text messaging as a method of collecting repeated self-rated data on experienced depression from participants in a randomised controlled trial.</s><s xml:id="_NAeRjmf">The study describes the development and concurrent validity of the 9-point SMS depression rating scale adopted by this study in relation to other established patient reported outcome measures used in evaluations of treatment for depression.</s></p></div>

loneliness.</s></p><p xml:id="_hFyTH4V"><s xml:id="_f7UqHQP">Use of the automated SMS system as a means of data collection amongst patients with moderate to severe depression was not without problems however.</s><s xml:id="_Xa4Hyhp">Responses required regular monitoring, as some participants assumed that their texts would be read by a member of  the research team upon receipt, and therefore tried to use the system to convey other information or requests.</s></p><p xml:id="_3f9wBdb"><s xml:id="_yxP7enK">In a few cases, responses received via this system indicated impending personal risk or raised other serious concerns regarding participant welfare, leading to the involvement of specialist mental health services.</s></p><p xml:id="_U3ZEswy"><s xml:id="_DmVKp5j">Other problems associated with our use of the automated SMS system described included the occurrence of a technical error, which resulted in loss of data.</s><s xml:id="_A2cUQcx">Besides system reliability, the use of third parties to distribute and gather text messages poses questions regarding data protection, which may require further clarification.</s><s xml:id="_Dsn2WgT">Rather than providing only numerical data, as requested, participants in this study sometimes sent unsolicited non-numerical information to the research team via text message.</s><s xml:id="_a4EpRPj">Therefore, in addition to ensuring that appropriate security arrangements are in place, we recommend that all research participants are informed that any information they send via SMS will be handled by a third parties, including both the SMS system provider and their mobile network operator.</s><s xml:id="_eFSawME">Systems can also be developed to reject non numerical responses, or trigger automatic alerts in response to messages containing any pre-specified words which may indicate risk of self-harm <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_T7uFGNt"><s xml:id="_buXDGva">As regards expense, text messaging cost approximately 52 to 53 pence per valid response, which excluded additional resources involved in monitoring incoming texts.</s><s xml:id="_vF8ZKp5">This compares very favourably with other data collection methods.</s><s xml:id="_KbshEv6">For example, current UK postage costs involved in sending and receiving just one questionnaire generally exceed £1, which alone does not account for additional printing and data management costs, reminder letters, or payment of licence fees for using instruments such as the BDI-II.</s><s xml:id="_cbPCjGM">Importantly, in our reporting of the development, content, and validation of the single item SMS depression rating scale, we place this instrument (the R-SMS-DS) in the public domain to be used freely, conditional only upon appropriate acknowledgement of authorship in any published work.</s><s xml:id="_bNdDkXE">Costs associated with gathering data via SMS may also be reduced further by providing study participants with access to a 'Free text' service, instead of sending each participant £5 in advance, as happen in the present study, although this in turn might actually serve as less of an incentive for participants to reply.</s><s xml:id="_rUavuXR">Comparison of responses for the R-SMS-DS with those for the PHQ-9 at three months demonstrated a moderate to high degree of convergence between instruments, thereby offering supportive evidence for construct validity.</s><s xml:id="_xV99wgT">Given the simplicity of this single item nine-point depression rating scale, and mode of administration, this is encouraging, especially when one considers that the observed degree of association between responses for the BDI-II and the PHQ-9, both psychometrically robust depressions outcome measures, was only marginally greater.</s></p><p xml:id="_ugv9J2h"><s xml:id="_NZYREJu">Additional evidence for the utility and responsiveness of the SMS depression rating scale as a valid depression outcome measure was provided by our ability to plot and identify statistically significant treatment effects emerging from both acupuncture and counselling, when compared to usual care alone, just ten weeks after randomisation (typically after eight consecutive treatment sessions), which were later detected using the PHQ-9 on questionnaires at three months.</s><s xml:id="_gbRxUuK">Moreover, the R-SMS-DS outperformed the PHQ-9 in terms of its sensitivity for measuring changes in depressions resulting from treatment.</s></p></div>
