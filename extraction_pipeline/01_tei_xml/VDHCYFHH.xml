<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_hxj5FAx">Future Research</head><p xml:id="_S6vaZa6"><s xml:id="_RXEUaWH">Future research should gather demographic information either through increased advertising for PrEPLine or short, digital surveys when each user visits the website.</s><s xml:id="_G7wFm3J">Future research could also use such data to inform predictive factors of those who spent the most time on the website and those who had the most clicks, and we could potentially link individuals who completed the Web-based demographic survey to PrEPLine and PrEP outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_Tw4pcqh">More specifically, it is essential to collect data on those who visit the P4L website to better understand how the Web-based components impact their PrEP awareness, linkage, and uptake.</s><s xml:id="_Pqyrszq">It is also important for public health campaigns, such as P4L to invite more young people and cisgender and transgender, black women to join the movement so as to ensure their health care experiences are culturally competent and sexually affirming.</s><s xml:id="_hgUjNUE">As there were no individuals who were younger than 20 years, and low numbers of cisgender and transgender, black women successfully linked to PrEP care through the PrEPLine in this analysis, more attention should be brought to these groups.</s><s xml:id="_4qcVmVg">This may include more activity on the P4L social media sites, but also potentially hosting youth-centered, female-centered, and transgender and gender nonconforming pop-up events.</s><s xml:id="_tKtkCAd">This would be a great opportunity to acquire in-person data collection that was not collected at the first 4 pop-ups (Crazy Sexy Cool, Formation, Black Joy, and Black Tea).</s><s xml:id="_aNXU6un">There were also 3 focus groups that were used to inform the campaign and analyzing data collected during those focus groups may be a substantial contribution to the sex-positive public health campaign research field as well.</s></p><p xml:id="_ZvCZmsY"><s xml:id="_MMZqHzs">P4L is the first campaign of its kind in terms of reach and scale.</s><s xml:id="_dtSdZNd">Similar grassroots PrEP campaigns have appeared across the world in response to new understandings of HIV prevention.</s><s xml:id="_cRE4BCP">Since the campaign, there have been several initiatives that have been launched that continue to promote sex-positivity and spread tingle.</s><s xml:id="_nqPfXGX">New initiatives with European partners have helped shape the P4L campaign in France [54], for example, where they have adopted the P4L campaign, recreated the photos, and made videos for their website that demonstrates the same messaging as Chicago's campaign.</s><s xml:id="_CTE2NUE">P4L has also been a local success with support offered from the Chicago Department of Public Health, which launched the second wave of the campaign in the fall of 2017 across the city's transit system.</s><s xml:id="_upCQAuF">AIDS Project of the Ozarks, a community-based grassroots organization housed in Springfield, Missouri, is launching the original P4L campaign in southwest Missouri.</s><s xml:id="_xNEc7Mg">The only adaptation is the addition of their local PrEP linkage and support information.</s><s xml:id="_hsqRN6r">P4L is a work in progress and, because of that, there is no definitive timeline of when the campaign will end.</s><s xml:id="_s3W7H6S">P4L is not done, even during times without paid advertising, it lives through its live pop-up events and ongoing social media posts and continues to track engagement and reach in the community.</s><s xml:id="_RQcf7Hx">The next steps for the P4L campaign are to launch a Latinx-specific component.</s><s xml:id="_AaGZnAJ">This paper demonstrates the success and limitations of the first wave of a data-driven, sex-positive sexual health campaign that fostered respectful community engagement.</s><s xml:id="_dCZjZCn">Through the success of this campaign we also underscore a couple of take-away points.</s><s xml:id="_8EzXkRr">First, implementing P4L required a substantial amount of start-up financial capital.</s><s xml:id="_WE45e8W">Second, the importance of readily available and accessible PrEP resources to which the campaign can refer inquiring and interested viewers.</s><s xml:id="_T8QtaxM">Finally, the success of this campaign was brought about, in part, through the relationships brokered by Jim Pickett with supportive marketing and advertising agencies.</s><s xml:id="_y9TCUxW">These resources, together, were important in the launch and success of the sex-positive P4L campaign and therefore central to the dissemination of PrEP health information, PrEP awareness, and accessibility of PrEP in Chicago.</s></p></div><figure
