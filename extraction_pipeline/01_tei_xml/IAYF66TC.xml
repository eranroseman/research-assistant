2018)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_RB2bdXt">Depression affects 322 million people globally, and depressive disorders are now the largest contributor to non-fatal health loss, accounting for more than 50 million Years Lived with Disability (World Health Organization <ref type="bibr">[WHO], 2017)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_kKVSvjS"><s xml:id="_t54SDQY">Global estimates suggest up to two-thirds of people suffering from a mental health disorder never seek treatment from a health professional <ref type="bibr">(WHO, 2001)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_kqABSHN">This may be partially explained by the lack of safe, effective, low-cost treatments for depressive symptoms in many countries.</s><s xml:id="_4PKPRmQ">The primary treatments, psychological therapy and pharmacotherapy, can be resource-intensive, costly and have side effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Allida et al., 2020)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WqQccDk">In high-income countries where treatments are more readily available, the relatively low rates of seeking treatment (46%) are likely caused in part by the stigma associated with having a diagnosis and seeking or requiring treatment <ref type="bibr">(The Black Dog Institute, 2015)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_kvrwBJX">Stigma is also a barrier in lower resource countries where the highest burden of mental illness lies, compounded by a lack of funding and workforce shortages preventing many from accessing treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Bruckner et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SvW9Snq">Confounding these barriers is the intrinsic nature of depressive symptoms which may include a lack of motivation to seek treatment or comply with lengthy courses of drugs or therapy.</s></p><p xml:id="_nbc5jCv"><s xml:id="_22t8dfG">In the last 20 years, mobile phones have almost universally integrated into daily life.</s><s xml:id="_CmBJeC2">To date, there are 7 billion people who live in an area covered by a mobile telephone network <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Sood et al.,

ownership in low-and middle-income countries has increased exponentially, faster than any other health, transport or communication infrastructure <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Abaza and Marschollek,

reduce isolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">(Proudfoot et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KHMzaWk">Qualitative interviews with HIV-positive participants in an antiretroviral adherence text messaging intervention revealed they derived greater emotional meaning from simple reminder messages, for example, recurring themes of feeling 'cared about' and 'seen' providing a theoretical mechanism of action <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">(Ware et al., 2016)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zFug5Pa">Pearson et al. found mobile phone ownership (after adjustments for wealth and education) increased mental well-being among rural Ugandans, suggesting that mobile phone interventions that increase social connectedness may also have value in mental health treatment in lower resource countries, remote locations and isolated communities, where such approaches may be more applicable.</s><s xml:id="_5WUDcMu">Other potential mechanisms of text message intervention efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Dallery et al., 2015)</ref> include altering normative beliefs, promoting acceptance of feelings, changing awareness, and increasing knowledge and motivation.</s></p><p

depressive symptoms for people presenting to healthcare professionals.</s><s xml:id="_79UpGX4">We also seek to identify what variables (content, frequency and personalisation) may influence the
