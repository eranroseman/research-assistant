be more novel i.e., previously unknown to readers or rarely seen in real news (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">Vosoughi et al., 2018)</ref> or more exaggerated <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">(Mourão &amp; Robertson, 2019)</ref>, which thus further encourage sharing and other interactions.</s></p><p xml:id="_4PgmBG2"><s xml:id="_CfVnf8N">Another telling finding is that the location of the covered incidents affected users' engagement with fake and real posts in almost oppositional directions.</s><s xml:id="_ABBSZ5G">Real posts focusing on domestic Chinese incidents attracted more comments and reposts than real posts about foreign events; but to the contrary, fake posts enjoyed more comments, posts and likes when their focus was COVID incidents in foreign countries.</s><s xml:id="_4wrmUcR">This could be attributed to the varied tonality between fake and real posts; for example, real posts about domestic events may have highlighted government achievement or people's collective actions in defending against COVID, while fake posts about foreign incidents may be filled with pejoratives criticizing other countries' failure in controlling the spread of COVID.</s><s xml:id="_VZsvHbN">Although this study cannot directly verify these explanations due to data limitations, our follow-up analyses reveal that among the microblogs focusing on

anger, fear, and disgust were more detected in fake posts than in real posts.</s><s xml:id="_UV4Sf5V">These results thus corroborate our speculation that real and fake posts may have promoted a higher level of user engagement through boosting readers' group esteem or national pride.</s></p><p xml:id="_6e4DMav"><s xml:id="_2kztZyr">In addition, this study found emotional appeals-especially anger and disgust-increased users' engagement with fake posts to a larger extent than that with real posts.</s><s xml:id="_VXgg7Us">Besides, the inclusion of videos-but not pictures-earned fake posts more user

effect.</s><s xml:id="_JT6r6mV">Regardless, these results underscore that simply infusing fake posts with the so-called approach emotions like anger or a video, is sufficient to elicit a strong motivation to attend to and engage with such content.</s><s xml:id="_kqQxdQZ">As more users comment on and repost fake posts charged with such emotions, fake news may then disseminate faster than real news and eventually reaches a larger audience <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">(Vosoughi et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5sDy7cv">Through this vicious cycle, fake news could also undermine media

in other story-level features such as expert endorsements, sound bites, or the quality of arguments that could have explained the users' stronger response to fake than to real posts.</s><s xml:id="_r6XAsrb">Switching to users, their social media literacy, bias confirmation, general trust in mainstream media, and capacity to detect falsehood information may have also led them to engage with fake posts and real posts in different manners.</s><s xml:id="_CZf5qZu">As <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">Balmas (2014)</ref> found, with increased exposure to fake news but decreased exposure to
