this blends a checklist with "attention-focusing" decision support <ref type="bibr">[66]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3jS2MT5">As our process illustrates, diagnostic checklist design requires attention to the selection of clinical criteria and diagnostic thresholds, and availability of the information with which to evaluate patient status against the criteria.</s><s xml:id="_4CHMSh2">These design considerations will be important to for designers of diagnostic checklists in contexts beyond HD.</s></p><p xml:id="_hXy7bpB"><s xml:id="_DVM4TAv">Rather than simply identifying that a patient is at risk, prior research on clinical decision support shows that is critical to suggest an action (e.g., <ref type="bibr">[67]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_48Y2Vcc">Alternative recommendations should also be provided to respect clinician autonomy <ref type="bibr">[68]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_B8hfavP">Thus, we developed a list of treatment considerations for the checklist application;
