services (OOH-TT) services has large potential for managing unplanned and OOH healthcare needs presented by the general population <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_X94sH4w">However, little is known with regards to the quality of these services in more vulnerable segments of the population such as older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tbNGN3H">Specifically, it is well known that older adults (over the age of 65) are especially difficult to triage over TT services as they frequently present with atypical symptoms of common health concerns.</s><s xml:id="_4PTNpus">At the same time, these segments of the population not only make up a large proportion of all unplanned care users <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref> but they are also known to be at the highest risks for experiencing adverse health events and safety incidents due to inappropriate care transfers <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and in cases of inappropriate triage, mis-triage <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_xnyKNgA"><s xml:id="_m7XEcC7">As a first step towards addressing this issue, a recent publication by <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Wardlow et al., (2022)</ref> aimed to better understand how telehealth-based services should be delivered to appropriately meet the needs of older adults seeking care <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_r7m9r8M">However, existing findings have largely focused on provider-focused principles and guidelines for promoting age-friendly telehealth practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gkjYV5u">Furthermore, some additional recent efforts also found that developing or adapting existing protocols to better fit population-specific criteria for triage in older adults may be effective for reducing rates of mis-triage in older adults.</s><s xml:id="_CVNeg7j">To date, these efforts have only been examined in specific and in-person triage tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and it is not yet clear how well they may apply within the larger context of medical dispatch protocols used by OOH-TT services.</s></p><p xml:id="_HAuyQaR"><s xml:id="_v3hykHa">In Belgium, there is a national OOH-TT service which aims to provide medical assistance to patients during evenings, weekends and holidays.</s><s xml:id="_aG9mMU9">Depending on the region, patients calling this number are re-directed to the local on-call general practitioner (GP) for an appointment or to a non-medical operator specialized in triage using the Belgian Manual for Medical Regulation (BHMR) for guidance on further medical assistance (more information available at: <ref type="url" target="http://www.1733.be">www. 1733. be</ref> (Dutch, French, German and English) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr"

(particularly related to concerns of safety assessed via the frequency of adverse events, errors, and patient hospitalization rates) has been shown to be associated with triaging older adults over the telephone <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_aQtd6eB">One potential problem associated with the use of existing protocols, such as the BHMR is the generic nature of the protocols.</s><s xml:id="_cpZ3gcj">It is typically the case that the same protocols are used for triaging all segments of the population (i.e.</s><s xml:id="_SphyqGg">including children and older adults who are known to be at higher risks for lower quality triage) with some limited considerations of age and medical history for vulnerable segments of the population.</s><s xml:id="_RYhYCj5">However, by incorporating key population-specific items within the protocols, the potential effectiveness, efficiency and overall quality of managing calls involving older adults in the population may be improved.</s><s xml:id="_6P8geBN">As such, this Delphi study aims to achieve expert consensus regarding key items to be addressed by non-clinical operators using the BHMR medical dispatch protocols to manage OOH-TT services for calls involving older adults seeking non-urgent unplanned care across

of triaging older adults via OOH-TT services, currently existing methods are still largely catered for providing remote medical assistance to less vulnerable segments of the population.</s><s

target="#b26">[28]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tQmdPpJ">The importance of addressing triage for older adults by using methods in which operators prioritize assessing a combination of factors (including

important and in line with the surrounding literature base which has shown that operator related characteristics (such as clinical background, length of experience, type of previous experience and

panelists to assess their judgements through several rounds of the research process <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rDeqVgG">Furthermore, it also plays a vital role for linking together existing knowledge and areas of agreement and disagreement within this field of research through a structured process that can allow us to ultimately have an impact on improving the quality of OOH-TT protocols for use in older adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">35]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HGc7qnr">A limitation that must also be considered

could represent the views of older adults who have experience with the use of OOH-TT services.</s><s xml:id="_G2hsU3e">Finally, it is important to mention that although we intended for a national representative Delphi panel (and has therefore reached out to panelists from three regions in Belgium -Flanders, Wallonia, and Brussels), we were presented with a high dropout rate of French speaking panelists leaving us with a small expert panel of 8 participants for the final consensus round.</s><s xml:id="_jd87yvN">Furthermore, the study team moderating the development of the questionnaires and
