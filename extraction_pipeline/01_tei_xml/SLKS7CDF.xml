type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ngxT6z7">The past three decades have seen a dramatic increase in the number of adults living with diabetes, with the World Health Organisation (WHO) highlighting an increase in prevalence from 108 million in 1980 to 422 million in 2014 <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>, and forecasts suggesting this could be as high as 700 million by as early as 2045 <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(5)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_phQnv9R">Unfortunately, most people living with diabetes do not meet International Diabetes Federation (IDF) treatment targets of glycemic control, i.e., glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) ≤7% for those with Type 2 diabetes (T2DM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> and &lt;6.5% for those living with Type 1 diabetes (T1DM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_P2e5UWs"><s xml:id="_FHX75zz">When diabetes is poorly managed, it can result in systemic complications such as coronary heart disease, stroke, kidney failure, retinopathy, and foot ulcers <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>, these complications can further progress to severe disabilities or even death.</s><s xml:id="_dGXuvtn">As such, the WHO estimate diabetes to be the ninth leading cause of death worldwide, with an estimated 1.5 million deaths as a direct result of diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(4)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_PgM5eT9">Additionally, diabetes workforce shortages <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10)</ref>, limited public funding, and increasing secondary care backlogs all complicate this picture, often resulting in those with diabetes failing to obtain the right support at the right time <ref type="bibr">(11)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_qjyRsRC"><s xml:id="_RpY2n9z">With the prevalence of diabetes only expected to increase, and no clear and scalable solution to solve the supply side issues faced by healthcare systems, there remains an urgent unmet need for cost-effective and widely accessible strategies which can empower and motivate people with diabetes to adhere to bestpractice diabetes self-care behaviours.</s><s xml:id="_FTjHyrt">Over the years, there has been a growing body of evidence to support the role of selfmanagement in treating Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_sAHhVQ3"><s xml:id="_HTR3zbq">Digital health technologies (DHTs), which include mobile applications (apps) have been rapidly gaining popularity in the self-management of chronic diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(14)</ref>, particularly following the COVID-19 pandemic <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(15)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qm5S5fq">Given their widespread availability, minimal barriers to access and often low cost, DHTs have been proposed as cost-effective tools to supplement clinician visits and deliver continuity of care to those who may struggle to access incumbent services.</s><s xml:id="_PPVRqmf">Specifically, the availability of these technologies for purposes including self-management of blood glucose <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(16)</ref>, insulin dosing and adjustment <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(17)</ref> and dietary advice <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(18)</ref>, has created further opportunities for self-management among patients with diabetes mellitus.</s></p><p xml:id="_K3bD43K"><s xml:id="_ZCwtxuq">To date, there have been numerous systematic reviews of DHTs dedicated to the management of either Type 1 or Type 2 diabetes which report positive intervention effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(19)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(20)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(21)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3VwhrBr">However, others have been less conclusive, with some reporting on the use of SMS messaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(22)</ref> and computerbased platforms <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(23)</ref>, while many were also conducted several years ago <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">25)</ref>, limiting interpretation given the significant rate of technological change experienced in the past decade.</s><s xml:id="_zg5n5DR">It is therefore clear that differences in study design, intervention group, outcome measures and the specific functions and features of the technologies under consideration have led to widespread variation in the estimation of the impact of DHTs within diabetes.</s></p><p xml:id="_JYSuhhs"><s xml:id="_GYUkEVS">The aim of this systematic review is to therefore summarise the available literature concerning the impact of using digital health technologies on laboratory confirmed HbA1c, for individuals diagnosed with T1DM, T2DM and
