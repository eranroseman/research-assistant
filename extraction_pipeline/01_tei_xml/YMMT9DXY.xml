inadequate housing and basic services."</s><s xml:id="_Q4uwMyF"><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>As such, slums fulfil the bare minimum requirement of providing a roof over the head but struggle

burden.</s><s xml:id="_aBD2Rrp">With most community members being daily-wage earners, a day of illness means loss of critical income.</s><s xml:id="_csWrRtG">The M East Ward, with a population of over 800,000 (2011 census) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, has been identified as one of the most deprived areas of Mumbai according to most health indicators, and approximately 85% of its

invisible.</s></p><p xml:id="_8sK2pPs"><s xml:id="_EdARxzM">A multidisciplinary collaboration between a local non-governmental organisation (NGO), an academic institution, and a health technology provider was established to develop a programme for community-based management of child health in slums and evaluate its impact through an evidence-based framework for health economic assessment.</s><s xml:id="_qxNxf6z">This programme focused on leveraging an existing workforce, community health workers (CHWs), whose activities were augmented through an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered mobile health platform to strengthen triage and referral for children under 6 years of age, residing in M East Ward.</s><s xml:id="_ZDJyDvf">The programme was designed to both increase early access to healthcare in the community and reduce dependence on hospitals as the provider of last resort-a healthcare delivery model which is critical for the sustainability of health systems through the COVID-19 pandemic and beyond.</s></p><p xml:id="_W2Mpt3g"><s xml:id="_D9XjM77">Social Return on Investment (SROI) is an outcome-based framework that helps organisations measure and account

(long-term effects of the change process per year) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_473DZCs">It has been demonstrated that the SROI framework can be used across healthcare
