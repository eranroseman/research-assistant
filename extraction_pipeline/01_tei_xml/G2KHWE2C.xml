<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_cFYBZfq">Methods:</head><p xml:id="_bVGSjur"><s xml:id="_un9G3FE">We conducted 10 focus groups with 87 participants in 2012 and 2013 among African American and Latino Kaiser Permanente members in the mid-Atlantic, Georgia, and Southern California regions.</s><s xml:id="_76c6scD">Members were eligible to participate if they were not registered for portal access.</s><s xml:id="_6tdYhMJ">Focus groups were conducted within each racial/ethnic group, and each included individuals who were older, had a chronic disease, or were parents (as these are the three biggest users of the portal at Kaiser Permanente overall).</s><s xml:id="_B7E7Mhj">We videotaped each focus group and transcribed the discussion for analysis.</s><s xml:id="_9Y2qh9e">We used general inductive coding to develop themes for major barriers to portal use, overall and separately by racial/ethnic group.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_sfk5dG8">Methods</head><p xml:id="_QMYewSZ"><s xml:id="_uGbunyH">We conducted this qualitative study at Kaiser Permanente, which has offered a version of the patient portal in various regions of the United States since the mid-2000s.</s><s xml:id="_egXVtfB">Collectively, this health care system serves 10 million patients, with well over half (5.5 million) already using the online patient portal website.</s><s xml:id="_HKNnCpC">Specifically, we recruited Kaiser Permanente members from the Mid-Atlantic, Georgia, and Southern California regions for this study to ensure geographic and racial/ethnic diversity in the patients sampled (explained more in depth below).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_DjCjgp9">Recruitment and Focus Group Processes</head><p xml:id="_eP6x6HM"><s xml:id="_RfpQJvE">We conducted 10 focus groups with Kaiser Permanente patients who were not registered for the online patient portal.</s><s xml:id="_2mMTvdy">The portal (also known as "kp.org") allows patients access to several features:</s></p><p xml:id="_sUBWjFe"><s xml:id="_daMSKN2">(1) viewing medical history including visit summaries, immunizations, and allergies, (2) viewing laboratory results, (3) refilling medications, (4) making appointments, and ( <ref type="formula">5</ref>) sending a secure message to a health care provider.</s><s xml:id="_ea7E9k8">All of these features were available on both a Web browser and a mobile app at the time of the study.</s><s xml:id="_P2AKjWp">The portal served as an alternative means to access these services, as they were often also available through in-person, mail, or phone platforms.</s></p><p xml:id="_ZvdTkDp"><s xml:id="_9bFwnNb">We limited our sample to individuals who were patients of Kaiser Permanente for at least 2 years and had visited a Kaiser Permanente facility in the past year, were English-speaking, were at least somewhat familiar with the patient portal, and used the Internet at least once a week (no other assessment of participants' digital/computer literacy was collected).</s><s xml:id="_Mv93gXV">These recruitment criteria ensured that the sample was a stable group of Kaiser Permanente members who were capable of accessing the portal on their own.</s><s xml:id="_YY3qs6Y">In particular, we understood that language barriers might be a particular barrier for Latino patients but believed that we could recruit only English speakers in this study since the portal was available only in English.</s><s xml:id="_Y6yZzYS">The focus groups were also targeted to key groups that had health care coordination needs and therefore might be most inclined to use the portal for specific tasks.</s></p><p xml:id="_JV6GRVP"><s xml:id="_EfcwUDk">In October 2012, we conducted six of the focus groups specifically with African American patients, holding two focus groups each in three Kaiser Permanente regions nationwide (Mid-Atlantic, Georgia, and Southern California).</s><s xml:id="_jMrqmqM">This included two focus groups with older adults, two focus groups with patients with chronic illness, and two focus groups with parents of young children (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_gJPW3gT">Focus groups were also additionally stratified by income level (based on categories that reflected the income distributions of Kaiser Permanente patients) and age when possible to increase variation in the participants across the groups.</s><s xml:id="_a4HtBEQ">Finally, within each focus group we ensured a mix of gender, employment status, education, and marital status during recruitment.</s><s xml:id="_RvxVQZk">In December 2013, we used the same process to conduct four additional focus groups with Latino patients, all conducted in Southern California (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_1">2</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_5P8mzCf">This included two focus groups with parents and two focus groups with patients with chronic illness.</s><s xml:id="_wbCVeDH">The focus groups were led by 2 experienced moderators who were racially/ethnically concordant with the study sample.</s><s xml:id="_RGXx2d8">All focus groups were held in independent market research facilities and lasted approximately 2 hours.</s><s xml:id="_fpNu5K3">Each group consisted of 8-10 participants (with the exception of one focus group with only 5 participants), and participants received a US $100 incentive for participation.</s><s xml:id="_pSseeE4">All sessions were videotaped and the conversations were later transcribed for analysis.</s><s xml:id="_VjCxKQK">The study was approved by the Kaiser Permanente Southern California Institutional Review Board.</s></p><p xml:id="_Tz44HnM"><s xml:id="_rtdJD8u">The discussions focused on (1) current health status and relationship with health care providers, (2) current Internet/technology use, (3) knowledge of Kaiser Permanente and the patient portal, (4) review of the health care services and health content available online, and (5) barriers and facilitators to adoption of the patient portal.</s><s xml:id="_ZRW3tpb">The full discussion guide is included in Multimedia Appendix 1.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_ZPqDHGM">Technological Proficiency</head><p xml:id="_83fzUSG"><s xml:id="_APnWmmV">Although all participants were current Internet users based on the inclusion criteria of the study, the focus group discussions among participants uncovered a mix of technological skills.</s><s xml:id="_2s6s2DN">The patients who were younger tended to be the most Internet-savvy, but even a substantial proportion of the older participants/chronic illness patients could perform sophisticated tasks online, including researching medical treatments and conducting banking transactions: "I've had health questions that I've gotten online to find out cures, and alternative medicine, and things like that" (African American female, focus group 5 with older adults) and "If you're on your smartphone it's so much easier, with one click you have everything you need" (Latina female, focus group B with parents).</s><s xml:id="_dAWrvsW">However, older adults and those with chronic illness (who were also older on average) tended to make most of the comments related to limited computer proficiency: "And I tell myself, I see some seniors out there and they're texting and they're going online and I say if they can do that, I can do it and it isn't that difficult.</s><s xml:id="_8fZqnts">So like it's a challenge for me" (African American female, focus group 5 with older adults).</s></p></div>

Four of the themes were directly linked to the need for feeling supported and/or connected, either from health care providers or from the health care system: all of which are explored in depth below.</s></p></div>
