type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, even though few research has shown no improvement or even a decline in physical and/or mental health (MH), specifically

xml:id="_7Mnq6R2">Risk factors for psychosocial distress and lower levels of QOL include fewer personal resources and maladaptive coping strategies, poorly controlled physical symptoms, lack of social

cancer care.</s><s xml:id="_d4bZECp">Whether this might also be the case for psychosocial care has not been widely investigated so far.</s><s xml:id="_Qrzs2eG">A study in breast cancer patients aged from 55 to 97 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> found that older women do highly value the information about breast cancer care provided by their breast cancer physician.</s><s xml:id="_Gfb7STd">However, while younger women did also receive more written information from other sources such as primary care physicians, family, and friends, specifically, women aged 57 years or older were found to get less written information from other sources.</s><s xml:id="_TSTqYSQ">Furthermore, women who rated their ability to communicate with their physicians less highly were found to have lower levels of emotional health, suggesting that, in particular, patients with substantial need for support are less likely to actively seek help.</s><s xml:id="_dTHDcma">However, although this study focused on oncological care information, it can be assumed that information about psychosocial care and support might also be less given to older women.</s></p><p xml:id="_v6Qw3Nh"><s xml:id="_wRETnRD">Knowledge about psychosocial support offers is an important requirement for their use.</s><s xml:id="_NVZvw5d">Eakin and Strycker <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> led a study in 2001 on the knowledge about and participation in psychosocial support offers among patients with breast, colon, and prostate cancer.</s><s xml:id="_eQ9BhQS">The findings indicated that only a percentage of patients were informed of existing support offers, and that knowledge of these offers was not consequently accompanied by participation in them.</s><s xml:id="_T7eTUVD">The authors were able to show that, in addition to a higher degree of education, a referral by the physician played an important role for the utilization of psychosocial support offers.</s></p><p xml:id="_A3wtgNC"><s xml:id="_vgqZNZk">While many psychosocial and QOL studies have been conducted with breast cancer patients, few studies have concentrated specifically on the association between psychological comorbidity and the awareness and utilization of psychosocial support offers in long-term survivors.</s><s xml:id="_wUd47hZ">Hodgkinson et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> found a high percentage (86%) of reported unmet needs in breast cancer survivors and a significantly higher percentage in those patients with high levels of anxiety or depression.</s><s xml:id="_28F2mJg">However, research including older women has been relatively rare so far.</s></p><p xml:id="_3AGB9ZH"><s xml:id="_P4yhMPt">The purpose of this cross-sectional cancer registry-based study is to provide information about the prevalence of anxiety, depression, and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), as well as about health-related QOL in long-term breast cancer survivors.</s><s xml:id="_DeAUssj">Group comparisons with populationbased normative values for anxiety, depression, and QOL have been undertaken.</s><s xml:id="_3Brx3jC">We furthermore investigate perceived knowledge,
