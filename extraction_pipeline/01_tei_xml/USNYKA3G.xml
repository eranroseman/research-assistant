non-human decision aids <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ZcAG8Qx">More recently, in a series of studies, patients were less willing to schedule an appointment to be diagnosed by a robot, and they were willing to pay significantly more money for a human provider, with a reported perception that AI providers are less able to account for patients' unique characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_xPGqsyv"><s xml:id="_p7fsF9f">Yet acceptance of AI may depend on specific features of the system and how the choice is framed, and there may be differences among groups of patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_4jHycE4">Outside of healthcare, consumers have been shown to more often trust AI systems for objective tasks, while subjective tasks are viewed as more appropriate for humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_FcNJKDN">Some qualitative research suggests that lower levels of patient education are associated with lower trust in computerization <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fqM2Hwe">Other small studies suggest that AI may be acceptable if human physicians ultimately remain in control <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_FHrDKaE">And, although patients may prefer human physicians, some work suggests that they may better adhere to advice coming from algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_SmYutFj"><s xml:id="_Wc2XMQx">More generally,

<ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_xjYVjGh"><s xml:id="_s3Cf4Au">To the extent that patients retain the right of informed consent with regard to their own healthcare, much will depend on patient attitudes towards AI.</s><s xml:id="_6dmqSHT">To that end, we used qualitative and quantitative methods to study diverse patient populations' views about AI in medicine.</s></p><p xml:id="_ZPZwMtu"><s xml:id="_3RjAhwF">To our knowledge, this is the first large-scale population-based survey experiment, with random assignment to realistic clinical vignettes systematically manipulated to analyze a range of factors that could influence AI uptake with patients.</s><s xml:id="_Er5c56M">Moreover, our study is enriched to allow sufficient sample size to compare AI uptake across five different racial/ethnic groups, including those who have historically shown lower levels of trust in the healthcare system.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_JHbfGTF">Methods</head><p xml:id="_UTCjgPu"><s xml:id="_Uk8n2x6">We conducted two study phases, one qualitative and one quantitative.</s><s xml:id="_Mwu4KwS">In the qualitative phase (February to December 2020), we conducted structured interviews with 24 patients recruited for racial and ethnic diversity to understand their reactions to current and future AI technologies.</s><s xml:id="_5h8R97y">In the quantitative phase (January and February 2021), we used an internet-based survey experiment oversampling Black, Hispanic, Asian, and Native American populations.</s><s xml:id="_8pCwXGh">Both phases placed respondents as mock patients into clinical vignettes to explore whether they would prefer to have an AI system versus a doctor for diagnosis and treatment and under what circumstances.</s></p><p xml:id="_uAuBVWd"><s xml:id="_YABC4sS">We chose this mixed-methods design for a few reasons.</s><s xml:id="_HevhN4y">First, because this is the first study of its kind, we wanted to ensure that the vignettes driving our quantitative survey were realistic and intuitive; the qualitative pre-study helped us to gauge participant reaction.</s><s xml:id="_CPGVWxN">Second, largescale quantitative surveys often raise a number of questions about why people respond the way they do.</s><s xml:id="_84xvSy3">The mixed-method design allows us to accomplish something that neither approach -purely quantitative nor purely qualitative-would achieve on its own.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_tjaXjuu">Development and oversight of the survey</head><p xml:id="_CdXuXSD"><s xml:id="_SSu3JR5">To develop clinical vignettes, we consulted physicians specializing in cardiology, pulmonology, hematology, and sleep medicine to develop vignettes, which were reviewed by physician coauthor (MJS), for authenticity.</s><s xml:id="_eHkTNnx">This study was determined to be exempt by the Human Subjects Protection Program (Institutional Review Board) at the University of Arizona, and all subjects consented.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_KN8pdXK">Qualitative pre-study</head><p xml:id="_rtSWppd"><s xml:id="_hbCQwhn">Our qualitative study pre-tested the vignettes and generated hypotheses.</s><s xml:id="_h8JFCd6">For 30-60 minute qualitative interviews in Spanish or English, we recruited 24 individuals from clinics in Tucson, Arizona, including 10 White, 8 Hispanic, 3 Black, 2 Native American, and 1 Asian patients.</s><s xml:id="_t6GC9RG">In total, 16 were females and 8 were males.</s><s xml:id="_ZxKZYtu">Ages ranged from 19 to 92 years, with most over 50, as would be expected given our recruitment from a cardiac clinic.</s><s xml:id="_7uR5NgE">Educational achievement was relatively high, with 7 of the subjects having a graduate degree, and 5 having a bachelor's degree.</s></p><p xml:id="_tNbkKJK"><s xml:id="_mU33uN2">The nature of these interviews was semi-structured.</s><s xml:id="_UZ5d9GU">All participants were given the same script describing the topic, the research design, and the sample vignettes.</s><s xml:id="_gpjQksz">The prompts were deliberately open-ended to allow participants to share reactions and feedback to make sure the vignettes were understood.</s><s xml:id="_pqe6TPu">We recorded all of our interviews and had them transcribed to better inform the design of the quantitative survey.</s></p><p xml:id="_xFAP84a"><s xml:id="_yvGKx9T">After getting informed consent, each interview began with an open-ended question asking the participant to think back to a difficult medical decision, and in particular "who or what influenced your decision?"</s><s xml:id="_c3AWCpZ">This prompted a wide array of responses.</s><s xml:id="_7hMKEFZ">The most common influence on participants' decision-making was their primary care physician, though several also noted family and friends influencing their decision.</s><s xml:id="_WtjSTyx">We asked another open-ended question: "generally how do you feel about doctors relying on computer systems to make treatment decisions for you?"</s><s xml:id="_tdZKyKy">This prompted a broad array of responses, with some participants expressing fear or anxiety (and occasionally humor) about the increasing use of machines in everyday life.</s><s xml:id="_2Z3jNFK">We often probed to distinguish routine use of electronic health records (EHRs) systems, which were quite familiar to respondents, versus computerized diagnostic tools, which were less familiar.</s></p><p xml:id="_YyfAbHv"><s xml:id="_u2cZWDn">The core of our interviews were the vignettes which asked participants to imagine themselves in particular medical scenarios.</s><s xml:id="_yJHSAkT">We started by asking participants to imagine their primary care physician recommending a change to their diet and exercise, based on a family history of leukemia and advice from "the MedX computer system with data from millions of other patients."</s><s xml:id="_UvmjV2m">This provoked a mild reaction, with most participants noting they were already being told to mind their diet and exercise habits.</s><s xml:id="_cu3aPWm">Then we raised the stakes.</s><s xml:id="_5TfjyGB">Participants were told to suppose they start to feel tired and achy, and their primary care physician wants a second opinion from either an oncologist or a new AI-driven lab that "is more accurate than the oncologist."</s><s xml:id="_xvZPen8">The participants were asked whether they'd choose one or the other, or pay $1000 to visit both.</s><s xml:id="_nDqWW98">Tellingly, the majority of patients said they'd prefer to see only the oncologist, despite being told the oncologist was less accurate than the AI lab.</s></p><p xml:id="_4Pfajte"><s xml:id="_7EY9XjP">We presented another vignette involving sleep apnea, where participants were asked whether they'd rather visit a traditional sleep clinic requiring an overnight stay away from home and interpretation by a human physician versus an at-home device that relies on selfplaced sensors and AI diagnostic interpretation.</s><s xml:id="_UqdRSbP">We saw a broad range of views in response to this vignette, with several participants having strong and perhaps idiosyncratic reactions based on their personal experiences dealing with sleep apnea and visiting sleep clinics.</s></p><p xml:id="_FKyxh5T"><s xml:id="_A5fyxDH">Overall, while some patients expressed confidence that AI systems could achieve greater accuracy in diagnosis and treatment compared to a physician, several patients called on their own experiences with technology to suggest that an AI system could be fallible.</s><s xml:id="_aDdkqgR">Other patients, especially those who were non-White, expressed lack of trust with the healthcare system more generally and recounted anecdotes where they felt unheard or mistreated.</s><s xml:id="_8Ce8RTW">Patients nearly uniformly said they would rely heavily on their physicians to guide their choice of whether an AI system would be used for their diagnosis or treatment, but most nonetheless emphasized that they would generally want to know of such use, suggesting that it is material for their informed consent.</s><s xml:id="_3Gv7g8n">Several patients indicated that they had greater confidence in their human physicians than an AI system to personalize treatment decisions to the patient's own situation.</s><s

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_AejrjTf">Findings and implications</head><p xml:id="_Z2BVWmz"><s xml:id="_9XDUv6f">Consistent with other studies, we found substantial resistance to the use of AI, what some have called "algorithm aversion" <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> or "robophobia" <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_eBYhPSb">Our study contributes to this literature by showing the robustness of this resistance to AI in a diverse population of patients and across a range of other manipulated features of and applications of an AI system.</s></p><p xml:id="_xgf9Ga6"><s xml:id="_SWSSwB9">We find this aversion to AI diagnosis across two levels of disease severity, within specific racial and ethnic groups, and even where the AI was proven to be more accurate and the PCP nudged the patient towards AI, though these efforts were significantly helpful.</s><s xml:id="_ZGUjXay">Some of our hypothesized attempts to mitigate this resistance were ineffectual.</s></p><p xml:id="_AgCS5pU"><s xml:id="_4ZeXQBm">Most surprising, having the PCP emphasize that he or she would explain and incorporate the AI system's advice into the ultimate treatment decision did not increase uptake of AI.</s><s xml:id="_AmtC6sX">We expected greater resistance to AI where the ultimately treatment decision is simply outsourced to this machine.</s><s xml:id="_WKNuhXv">In contrast, we expected that patients would be more accepting of medical AI in the half of the vignettes where AI was presented as merely an input to their trusted human physician's ultimate decision.</s></p><p xml:id="_EdAS7Rc"><s xml:id="_PYuFJur">In a world where AI is (or will have the potential to be) actually more accurate than human specialists, our findings suggest that patients may suffer additional mortality and morbidity, and the healthcare system may suffer inefficiencies, due to patient resistance.</s><s xml:id="_wdbMcMg">The passage of time and expanded use of AI in a range of settings familiar to laypersons (such as self-driving cars) may help patients become more familiar with and supportive of AI in healthcare.</s><s xml:id="_9wvqYhV">Indeed, we found that generalized trust in AI companies is nearly as important for AI uptake as the disclosure that this particular AI is proven more accurate that human specialists.</s><s xml:id="_CUtvwUm">On the other hand, some sort of future scandal or crisis or politicization associated with AI may actually harm overall trust in such systems.</s></p><p xml:id="_5Xxsezj"><s xml:id="_ekfhfbm">For simplicity, respondents were asked to assume insurance coverage and out-of-pocket costs would be the same for either clinic.</s><s xml:id="_aGDjsF2">Insurers or healthcare systems may someday use these economic dimensions to direct or undermine patient choice of provider, as a form of value-based reimbursement.</s><s xml:id="_rNw85Mq">Additionally, physicians or healthcare systems may deploy AI without giving the patient a choice or asking permission, especially where AI has become the standard of care.</s><s xml:id="_VQbqwu4">While such economic, professional, and managerial gatekeeping are common in a range of settings, they raise distinct ethical and legal concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref>, recognizing that patient autonomy and patient welfare may sometimes come into tension.</s><s xml:id="_MsbUqAT">In addition to our focus on patient perspectives, additional research is required on drivers of physician uptake of AI.</s></p><p xml:id="_XyypPZJ"><s xml:id="_53D24gG">Our findings will be useful for the development of theory-based and evidence-driven recommendations for how physicians and patients might integrate AI into the informed consent process and into real world use and delivery of care.</s><s xml:id="_g6PBbte">Patient resistance to AI diagnosis may impinge uptake in ways that undermine treatment goals, but human physicians can support adoption, where the technology is designed with the patient experience in mind and supported by evidence of accuracy.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc><div><p xml:id="_wAGbB3F"><s xml:id="_JqBTZ72">Fig 2 and discussed in the text, except where otherwise noted.</s><s xml:id="_c3fFb7M">Wald tests of model fit find significant improvement moving from Model 1 to Model 2 [χ 2 (16, N = 2199) = 87.15;</s><s xml:id="_bagzAD2">p &lt; .001]</s><s xml:id="_DDRJFNq">as well as moving from Model 2 to Model 3 [χ 2 (3, N = 2198) = 106.75;</s><s xml:id="_gWGUC5w">p &lt; .001].</s><s xml:id="_2tyykz7">We then analyze the final model in racial subsets in Table</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
