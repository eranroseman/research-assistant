required to achieve optimum control.</s><s xml:id="_gSmMM4T">Given the large impact that individual behaviors have on diabetes control, such as diet, energy expenditure, blood glucose monitoring, medication adherence, and self-adjustment of insulin doses, the standard of diabetes care includes self-management education and support.</s><s xml:id="_vnc2sbe">For those with poor control, education

self-management support beyond the clinic is through ecological momentary interventions <ref type="bibr">(EMI)</ref>, which are delivered during a person's daily life providing "real-world" support in

xml:id="_nknhvkD">This indicates that this type of technology is not limited by demographic characteristics and the text message content was relevant to a wide range of people with poorly controlled type 1 and type 2 diabetes.</s></p><p xml:id="_t7KXArw"><s xml:id="_5A8QmPs">Most participants were satisfied with the number and frequency of the messages they received, which may be due to

improvements in HbA1c with combined mobile and Internet-based interventions compared to studies utilizing mobile intervention alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SUsRh8x">Our findings are in contrast to this and highlight that lack of Internet access can reduce participant access to features of the interventions.</s><s xml:id="_5D5X6AW">Other methods for providing feedback should be investigated, such as sending graphs via multimedia messaging service (MMS).</s><s xml:id="_5fk4BuG">Although it was free to take part in the pilot study, the barrier of cost of replying to text messages (NZD $0.20) was identified as preventing a number of participants from responding with their blood glucose results and, therefore, feedback was not available to them.</s><s xml:id="_GFsAYge">To ensure that SMS4BG is able to be fully utilized by all, removing the cost of reply messaging may be needed if rolled out within a health care setting.</s></p><p xml:id="_ZRB42Se"><s xml:id="_2UxChRw">Strengths of the SMS4BG program included that it was theoretically informed, system initiated (ongoing intervention not dependent on participant behaviors), personally tailored, and provided participant choice.</s><s xml:id="_w87RVVR">Many previous diabetes text messaging programs have had limited reach or were designed specifically for one diabetes type, age group, or single diabetes management behavior.</s><s xml:id="_FjyPsXr">SMS4BG was designed for adults of all ages with both poorly controlled type 1 and type 2 diabetes and provided support for self-management and encouragement in people's everyday lives rather than focusing on specific diabetes-related tasks.</s><s xml:id="_fGhpb3k">In addition, SMS4BG utilized simple technology and, therefore, had less potential for technical issues that have been a limitation in previous mHealth studies.</s></p><p xml:id="_unZdHZU"><s xml:id="_4GZQm4j">Another strength of the current study was the inclusion of an indigenous version.</s><s xml:id="_jmUgGuX">With a higher prevalence of diabetes seen in Māori compared to NZ Europeans <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, diabetes interventions need to be both relevant and culturally appropriate to this group.</s><s xml:id="_sheHBXg">There were two programs that Māori could choose from and although only 4 participants chose to register for the Māori version, no Māori participants withdrew from the program.</s><s xml:id="_RwBgrU9">This acknowledgement of identity may have assisted with retention of the Māori participants.</s><s xml:id="_D6gZy38">In addition, the inclusion of motivational messages linking diabetes management to family (whānau) aligns with the importance of whānau to the well-being of Māori <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7Sura8k">Although not significant, the higher ratings of usefulness of SMS4BG by Māori participants compared with New Zealand Europeans warrants further investigation.</s><s xml:id="_jUhcTgX">In addition, future development of the program could incorporate other cultural versions, including one for Pacific peoples.</s></p><p xml:id="_FCMhy5v"><s xml:id="_rjtdzxs">This study had several limitations, including the absence of a control group and a small sample size.</s><s xml:id="_YtNv9z9">Although positive change in glycemic control was seen without a control group or adequate sample size, this difference must be interpreted with caution.</s><s xml:id="_8wadhW8">The lack of complete follow-up HbA1c results limits the generalizability of the improved glycemic control results.</s><s xml:id="_GjXbuKq">The target population (poorly controlled) were likely not attending medical appointments as regularly as guidelines state and, therefore, the lack of clinical results could be expected.</s><s xml:id="_kM3ZJMk">Future studies could include text messages around the importance of HbA1c tests and reminders to go for tests as a way of potentially overcoming this issue.</s><s xml:id="_zJ7t2eZ">The pilot study was of short duration and as diabetes is a condition requiring long-term management, longer interventions may be more appropriate.</s><s xml:id="_JC78MB7">Another limitation was the lack of follow-up to assess whether any effects of SMS4BG were maintained beyond the program itself.</s><s xml:id="_SXcDUth">A larger and longer-term randomized controlled trial will need to be carried out to establish the efficacy of SMS4BG on self-management behaviors, self-efficacy and clinical outcomes, and its sustainability and cost-effectiveness.</s></p><p xml:id="_EVyC8v7"><s xml:id="_cQkV967">The current study adds to the evidence for the use of mHealth in delivering personally tailored diabetes self-management support and, particularly, the use of text messaging as a medium of delivery.</s><s xml:id="_gm48Pgk">The positive pilot study results indicate that this type of broad reaching EMI could be successful in engaging adults with poorly controlled type 1 or type 2 diabetes and assisting with improved diabetes self-management.</s><s xml:id="_VTKb3Hk">Further refinement of SMS4BG is needed based on the pilot study feedback, followed by a larger randomized control trial to determine its efficacy.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"
