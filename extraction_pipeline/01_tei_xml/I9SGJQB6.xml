due to their high global prevalence and their association with increased risk of premature mortality and risk of chronic diseases. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref></s><s xml:id="_dHXnnSe">To reduce risk, it is recommended that adults should aim to engage in 150 min of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week, 2 consume at least five servings of fruit and vegetables per day and limit the intake of sugar and energy dense foods. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s xml:id="_TpaSN6c">n recent years, one emerging area of research has been the application of mobile health

self-monitoring, personal support and feedback). <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s xml:id="_hjbMwMd">Self-monitoring itself is considered one of the key essential behavioural weight loss intervention strategies, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> coupled with feedback which has been found to increase self-monitoring adherence. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s

access health care at any time and place, having a convenience element to it. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s xml:id="_6fkH4Gu">A study that compared a smartphone intervention with a web-based intervention found that participants lost 3.3 kg more in the smartphone intervention compared with the web-based stationary intervention and that adherence was significantly greater in the smartphone group when compared with the webbased group. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s xml:id="_9ywH9Yd">ccording to the Working Collaborative Group on mHealth, developing effective mHealth interventions that have reach requires being aware of the mHealth consumer. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s xml:id="_3ApuygG">The overall common consumer experience and preferences with mHealth for weight loss is unknown as past reviews have not been conducted.</s><s xml:id="_mC8XrJG">Previously, there have been meta-analyses demonstrating the effectiveness of mobile interventions for weight loss. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s xml:id="_WSENQGd">There have also been reviews that have identified key features of mHealth interventions for weight loss that were found in successful interventions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s xml:id="_jjgck55">They found that the key features in mHealth interventions that were successful included selfmonitoring, feedback, social support, and personal tailoring.</s><s xml:id="_fPz4G5p">However, despite these reviews, to date, there has not been a review that has examined direct consumer experiences with mobile devices for weight loss from the consumer standpoint.</s></p><p xml:id="_rYRwz9B"><s xml:id="_kft3rpG">Qualitative research may provide additional insight as it provides deeper and richer perspectives on individual experiences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s xml:id="_GrD2qRR">Additionally, qualitative research offers complementary or supplementary information alongside quantitative findings and is ideal for exploring new topics where little is known about a given experience. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s xml:id="_jahEsaX">ccording to Noyes et al., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> qualitative research may enrich contextual information relating to a trial such as

experiences and related trends.</s><s xml:id="_73ZNRES">It is important to understand what app features are preferred by consumers as well as what app features may act as barriers.</s><s xml:id="_69Epz6Z">Other research questions of interest are whether there are special features that most consumers prefer in text message or SMS interventions.</s><s xml:id="_pPUyjMM">These questions are directly informative for future app and mobile device developers as well as for future trials.</s><s xml:id="_zpBPUDd">By understanding user perspectives and preferences as well as perceived benefits and barriers, interventions may be better tailored to meet user needs.</s><s xml:id="_UrtmMcn">This may potentially assist with increasing accessibility, effectiveness, and reach of these interventions.</s><s xml:id="_aMqzADz">Understanding user feedback may also provide insight into future exploratory pre-trial research.</s><s xml:id="_meBU9g8">Thus the primary aim of this review is to better understand consumer experiences with mHealth for weight loss through a synthesis of common themes.</s><s xml:id="_xwUAB7m">Secondary aims are to provide recommendations for future mHealth
