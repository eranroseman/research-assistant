Tavares, 2007; see <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Lee et al., 2015</ref> for a meta-analytic review).</s></p><p xml:id="_K9bZx2C"><s xml:id="_fzGRrC9">Second, the current study covers new ground by shedding light on the relationship between group exercise participants' perceived comfort in their exercise environment and their exercise behaviors (a relationship that has received minimal attention to date).</s><s xml:id="_ftqprkj">The perception of comfort is particularly relevant in group exercise settings, because these settings have several features that can make people feel uncomfortable (e.g., high levels of crowdedness and unpleasant smells and noises).</s><s xml:id="_BDyEkEF">Our results indicate that individuals' perceptions of comfort in their exercise environment has a weak positive association with the frequency with which they attend exercise classes, and a stronger positive association with the effort they put into exercising during classes.</s><s xml:id="_vzUCYZV">Crucially, our results further suggest that perceptions of comfort are not set in stone but may be influenced by instructors' leadership, such that instructors are capable of contributing to the comfort that group members experience by fostering a sense of commonality and togetherness among members <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Alnabulsi &amp;
