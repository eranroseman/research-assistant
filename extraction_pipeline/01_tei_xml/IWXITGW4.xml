dietary pattern exerting a multitude of health benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hHUfzNa">Characterised by high consumption of olive oil, vegetables, fruits, legumes, nuts and unrefined cereals, low consumption of red meat, meat products and sweets, and moderate consumption of dairy products, fish and alcohol <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, the MedDiet has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that have been proposed to reduce the risk of various non-communicable diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_YKatSDt">An umbrella review of metaanalyses of observational and randomised controlled trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, as well as meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, found that the MedDiet beneficially affects several metabolic risk factors and is associated with reduced risk of cardiovascular diseases, type 2 diabetes and overall mortality and cancer incidence.</s><s xml:id="_6jtATvy">Due to these benefits, there is a recognised need to promote this 'model for healthy eating' among populations in both Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NW9saqe">It is therefore essential to identify opportunities to promote the MedDiet for public health benefits that would allow wider population reach.</s></p><p xml:id="_H8gEEQw"><s xml:id="_pRSBCY9">Smartphones and mobile health (mHealth) interventions can access large numbers of individuals at no, or low, cost, and therefore pose an opportunity for implementing programmes of self-managed care <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> and promoting behaviours associated with healthy lifestyles <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Ph7Fuyd">A recent systematic review and meta-analysis of 41 studies, including 27 randomised controlled trials, reported that app-based interventions result in beneficial changes in nutrition behaviours and nutrition-related health outcomes, including obesity indices, blood pressure, and concentrations of blood lipids <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_D48rVKG">The current numbers of smartphone users exceed six billion worldwide, and are projected to exceed 7.5 billion by 2026 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, whereas in December 2021, the number of mobile apps under the 'health and fitness' category available to download from the two major providers were 92,882 in Android's Google Play <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and 171,635 in Apple's App Store <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WhB8p8A">This abundance of health apps makes it increasingly difficult to identify those with the greatest potential to yield positive health benefits to consumers.</s><s xml:id="_s8QRe8Y">Indeed, information in commercially available dietary, physical activity and weight management apps is often not evidence-based, and many do not contain theoretical principles that could enhance effectiveness, or are of questionable quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_CZyZMnv">The method utilised to assess the quality of an app is also essential, as it has been argued that consumer ratings, which represent one of the primary methods of quantifying the quality of commercial health apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, can be misleading and do not necessarily reflect scientific evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rVtna3x">Instead, validated multi-dimensional measures of quality, which extend beyond user ratings and reviews and focus on functionality, engagement, aesthetics and information quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref>, and transparency in reporting, such as providing a list of reviewed apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, could allow consumers to make informed choices to fully benefit from mHealth apps.</s><s xml:id="_YuKNbxR">In addition, mHealth apps that contain established behaviour change techniques (BCTs), which are based on theories of behaviour change and aim to provide practical principles to change determinants of behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, could facilitate behaviour change <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_MzvrWE9">Yet, BCTs are not widely incorporated in commercially available apps for diet, physical activity or weight management <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ERXDsPw">In particular, five BCTs (self-monitoring, intention formation, specific goal-setting, review of behavioural goals and feedback on performance) have been linked to effective dietary behaviour change interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and could be incorporated in dietary mHealth apps to maximise the potential for beneficial effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_V7Qnf99"><s xml:id="_7rfNyQx">To our knowledge, no study to date has evaluated commercially available smartphone apps that provide information on, and potentially promote, the MedDiet, with regard to their quality and incorporation of BCTs.</s><s xml:id="_X9MtT6G">Using a multi-dimensional measure of quality assessment (engagement, functionality, aesthetics and information quality) <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> and an established 26-item taxonomy of BCTs <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, the aim of this study was to conduct a content analysis of mobile apps for the MedDiet (referred to as 'MedDiet apps' from here on) available in the Apple App Store and Google Play, and answer the following research questions: <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> What is the quality of MedDiet apps?</s><s xml:id="_V4zzpYY">(2) Do MedDiet apps incorporate BCTs, and if so, which BCTs do they include?</s><s xml:id="_V4Cx8xE">(3) What is the relationship between the different domains of app quality and the BCTs incorporated in these apps?</s><s xml:id="_enUNMEC">As this was an exploratory analysis, with the aim of informing future mHealth intervention development or app development practice, no specific hypotheses were formulated.</s></p></div>

xml:id="_MQmtDrm">The current study reported an even lower number of BCTs in the MedDiet apps analysed; this ranged from 0 to 6, with a mean of 2.3 BCTs per app.</s><s xml:id="_Re953aN">An earlier study assessing whether the content of 58 dietary apps, identified from the Apple App Store Health and Fitness category, was guided by theories of behaviour change also found that most apps were not informed by theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xFaBxrx">It should be noted that comparisons of the presence of BCTs with previous studies is hindered by the use of different app selection criteria, different targeting behaviours and different platforms used to identify apps.</s><s xml:id="_9V72kqS">Nevertheless, these findings highlight the scarcity of BCTs in commercially available health-related apps.</s><s xml:id="_KBsvJ55">This agrees with findings from a systematic review of studies evaluating apps focusing on one or more health conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, and the systematic review by Villinger et al. of 41 studies examining the effect of app-based interventions on nutrition behaviours and nutrition-related health outcomes, which found that out of a possible 93 BCTs, the average number of BCTs addressed across these studies was 6.9 (range: 2-11) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ZZ4SYhr">As the current study showed that the number of BCTs is positively correlated with app quality, this further supports the need for MedDiet app developers to not only 'provide instruction' (the most prevalent identified BCT in the current study) but also incorporate appropriate combinations of BCTs in MedDiet apps to improve app quality and help users towards following the MedDiet.</s></p><p xml:id="_ddHYnE8"><s xml:id="_fjfbFGW">It is noteworthy that of the five BCTs that have been linked to greater effectiveness of dietary and physical activity interventions ('prompt intention formation', 'prompt selfmonitoring', 'provide feedback on performance', 'prompt review of behavioural goals', and 'prompt specific goal setting') <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, only intention formation and self-monitoring were identified in the MedDiet apps analysed, albeit only in 16% and 5% of the apps, respectively.</s><s xml:id="_xUCmyj4">Earlier work has suggested that goal setting, monitoring behaviour and provision of feedback on behaviour are important components of dietary behaviour change apps targeting weight management, as these BCTs help app users to improve their diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>, and that apps that incorporate BCTs to enhance motivation and self-efficacy, as well as goal-setting tools, might be useful for dietary behaviour change <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_CN5KSRM">A tailored approach to goal-setting, reviewing goal progress, and receiving expert feedback were also deemed important to help users of web-based applications to follow a MedDiet <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gnrYaGz">Furthermore, the review of app-based interventions for dietary behaviours by Villingeret al. highlighted that 'goals/planning' and 'feedback/monitoring' were two of the most prevalent BCT clusters utilised in interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gpKBDfB">Nevertheless, this review analysed studies which utilised a total of 30 smartphone apps, 15 of which were pre-existing commercial apps, and it might be that apps that had been developed for research purposes had a high prevalence of these BCTs.</s><s xml:id="_54zmvt7">These findings suggest that commercially available MedDiet apps would be unlikely to promote behaviour change towards adherence to the MedDiet, which is supported the moderate score that these apps received for app-specific quality.</s><s xml:id="_7grdNBh">This might be due to the high proportion (40%) of apps that exclusively contained recipe ideas or meal plans, offering no further features, such as tracking adherence to the MedDiet, monitoring progress, or setting goals to achieve adherence to this dietary pattern.</s><s xml:id="_SWpXzEK">However, more research is needed to determine the optimal number of BCTs and establish the effectiveness of these apps towards behaviour change.</s><s xml:id="_aUKyhsP">In addition, future research should examine whether these five BCTs are also associated with the greatest effects in mHealth diet and physical activity interventions.</s></p><p xml:id="_rKXWKet"><s xml:id="_k3Ud9ba">Engaging social support has also been deemed an important feature of web-based interventions that would help individuals to adhere to the MedDiet <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_64sFQrb">Social support was found to be one of the most prevalent BCT clusters in a review of the effectiveness of app interventions on dietary behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9FUqkVZ">An earlier analysis of physical activity and nutrition apps found that approximately 55% of the apps analysed incorporated the BCTs 'plan social support' and 'provide opportunities for social comparison' <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Ytq463B">Similarly, a review of dietary, physical activity and sedentary behaviour apps for children and adolescents found that 40% of the apps analysed included 'opportunities for social comparison' <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HeWhPyZ">However, the prevalence of BCTs in both these studies was presented for the combination of dietary and physical activity apps, which hinders our ability to establish the extent to which these BCTs are common in dietary apps.</s><s xml:id="_ENMfukb">It might be that these BCTs are more prevalent in physical activity apps, particularly if these apps can be linked to external devices (such as wearable trackers) that provide opportunities for social comparisons of performance of the behaviour, and, via this route, opportunities for social support.</s></p><p xml:id="_6caFAwb"><s xml:id="_mhbtPWw">The low number of paid apps in the current analysis did not allow for a meaningful comparison of quality or presence of BCTs according to whether an app required payment to download or not.</s><s xml:id="_Yfy2gJ2">Apps that required payment were assessed as having higher quality in an earlier study focusing on mobile apps for the Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_uabfWp5">With regard to the presence of BCTs, evidence from earlier studies is inconsistent.</s><s xml:id="_QaJTmU4">For example, a review of commercial weight loss apps found that apps requiring payment were no more likely, compared to free apps, to include behavioural strategies for weight loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, while a review of physical activity apps also found no difference in the number of BCTs between paid and free apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_PTAmaqg">In contrast, a review of physical activity and dietary apps from New Zealand platforms identified slightly more BCTs in paid, compared to free, apps (9.7 vs. 6.6)</s><s xml:id="_Ft5wfkv"><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Tq897Nv">Similar to the review of Middelweerd et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, no differences in the number of BCTs were observed across platforms.</s><s xml:id="_jgcHgTP">More research is needed to examine the role of payment requirements, as well as the platform an app is downloaded from, in app quality and implications for behaviour change.</s></p></div>
