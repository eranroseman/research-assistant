however, the volume and completeness of empirical evidence supporting different theories vary.</s><s xml:id="_3BZ7p5N">The practical values of developing and testing theories are (1) the efficient and effective advancement of science and technology in general, (2) furthering our understanding of human behavior and (3) informing the development and evaluation of interventions to change behavior.</s><s xml:id="_ABsUBsA">A good theory clearly articulates relationships between constructs and generates hypotheses that are testable and refutable.</s><s xml:id="_bpeYzbX">Pragmatically, a good theory can serve as a roadmap to keep basic and applied researchers from repeating the mistakes of others before them.</s><s xml:id="_CyU62Km">However, when applying theories to new health behavior interventions it is also critical to develop a rich understanding of the intervention context <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">(Peters et al., 2015)</ref>, including characteristics of the individuals, groups, organizations, communities, their settings and the modes of intervention delivery (e.g., digital vs. ''in real life'';
