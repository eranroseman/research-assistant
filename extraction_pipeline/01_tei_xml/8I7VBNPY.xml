That specific stuff.</s><s xml:id="_frNqXyJ">Although most of the families we interviewed were married, six included divorced parents.</s><s xml:id="_cjfvkt2">Divorced parents we interviewed struggled to handoff information, which was especially salient in JIA families attempting to help manage the arthritis consistently.</s><s xml:id="_Xx9XdjA">Divorced parents also did not want data about themselves shared with the former spouse: JIA8 (father): … families that are split like ours.</s><s xml:id="_RqMHWWF">Is her mom and me going to be on the same one [data visualization]?</s><s xml:id="_SKuHppt">I [don't want] to get a comment, "I see you didn't go to bed until 3 AM last night, where were you?"</s></p><p xml:id="_QYdv4Gm"><s xml:id="_4dE5xsW">Prior work on location sharing and tracking in families has found low usage due to family member hesitation to share location continuously <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[72]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gDbKDNT">Accounting for privacy when designing for families is crucial, and a lack of privacy support will lead to non-adoption of family-centered informatics tools.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_4PQG3MD">Selecting and Preparation:</head><p xml:id="_2rMUE4q"><s xml:id="_k96Jq6E">In these stages, a person decides how they will track, including selecting what tools to use.</s><s xml:id="_b56Jasd">Families face all of the same barriers as individuals, such as struggling to identify tools that will collect the data supporting insights they seek <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">40]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_usfrsAH">Families also face additional barriers.</s><s xml:id="_9t9phZ4">In the case of young children, families need to determine if both adults and children can use the same tool.</s><s xml:id="_fuYH233">If not, they may need to determine if there is a similar tool designed for young children.</s><s xml:id="_RbCXSMV">Families collaborating with medical providers need tools that can track the information requested by providers and support appropriate sharing with those providers.</s><s xml:id="_pQ58ESA">There are also additional barriers and burdens in purchasing and maintaining multiple tracking devices, especially if a child version is more expensive due to a focus on child safety.</s><s xml:id="_wFkK6mc">These complex requirements for selection are currently poorly supported.</s></p><p xml:id="_q6uQHY4"><s xml:id="_936Qe7g">Collection: Families collect, capture, or record desired data using their selected artifacts.</s><s xml:id="_duGXCGD">There will be generally be multiple family members tracking, either manually or using tools that automatically collect data.</s><s xml:id="_XjBTK5M">Prior work in individual tracking identifies collection barriers that include a lack of time, lack of motivation, not remembering to regularly collect, and difficulties with subjective estimation <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tKWRHef">These barriers also apply in the family setting and may occur at greater scale considering the different cognitive abilities and knowledge of every family member.</s></p><p xml:id="_ry3D5aq"><s xml:id="_m38nncH">Balancing collection of data from a family perspective will need to consider how shifts in motivation will change over time.</s><s xml:id="_aqwXznH">For example, when a child with JIA is experiencing a flare, the entire family is focused on helping the child overcome that flare.</s><s xml:id="_UT8PscT">Just as the competing commitments and health goals of other family members can be de-prioritized in this situation, tracking may also be de-prioritized.</s><s xml:id="_Bnpz5kK">Tracking tools for families may benefit from improved approaches to automating tracking in times and contexts when tracking will be a lower priority.</s></p><p xml:id="_KKRXpfx"><s xml:id="_epkKmUC">In previous work, leveraging shared experiences within a family can lower the barriers to tracking diet <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">66]</ref> and physical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[64]</ref> as well as reflecting on health goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mUY5hVW">Designing for families can lower barriers to tracking by leveraging shared experiences and having family members track on behalf of each other.</s><s xml:id="_qjmtAR7">With respect to sleep, family members can track the perceived mood of other family members, environmental factors (e.g., noise), and daily events (e.g., stress) that could be affecting their own sleep as well as the sleep of other family members.</s></p><p xml:id="_mykqk3U"><s xml:id="_gCChH54">We have also seen that family informatics presents additional challenges surrounding self-tracking vs. second-hand tracking (e.g., a parent tracking on behalf of child).</s><s xml:id="_kRczmec">Current designs generally do not support a single person simultaneously self-tracking and second-hand tracking (e.g., a parent tracking their own sleep as well as the sleep of their children).</s><s xml:id="_PZ9ku3S">The lack of multi-directional tracking makes it difficult to support health goals at a family level.</s><s xml:id="_HqGzwgM">The matter of who does the tracking also surfaces several additional challenges and opportunities.</s><s xml:id="_CcVYaRJ">Tools that limit tracking to a primary caregiver both: (1) force the primary caregiver to bear the entire responsibility of tracking, and (2) present barriers to secondary caregivers utilizing tracked information (e.g., in collaborations with health providers).</s><s xml:id="_74draTB">As children mature, they will also want to take primary responsibility for self-tracking.</s><s xml:id="_qcJsRs2">These challenges in coordinating and transitioning tracking are not well supported in current tools.</s></p><p xml:id="_vUHdrNp"><s xml:id="_FdwAd9Y">Integration: Integration entails preparing and transforming data for analysis and reflection.</s><s xml:id="_9h5yUCe">Our interviews found that visualization techniques that are effective with data streams of an individual can quickly become overwhelming when multiplied by the complexity of a family.</s><s xml:id="_akF7Are">Additional challenges can also result from different approaches to tracking by different members of a family.</s><s xml:id="_DH2q6rs">For example, a secondary caregiver might collect data at a courser granularity or less frequently compared to the primary caregiver.</s><s xml:id="_mvYcEHa">Therefore, family health informatics systems will have to address the challenge of aligning or otherwise reconciling data from different sources.</s></p><p xml:id="_2VKGVkh"><s xml:id="_gN7TPVf">Reflection: Reflection needs to be supported at the individual and family level.</s><s xml:id="_n7nmz3q">Toward this, designers need to consider when and how members of a family access data.</s><s xml:id="_exMtnBc">This includes taking into account the type of family member that is reflecting when presenting insights and visualizations of collected data.</s><s xml:id="_rZ6J8Q5">In the case of children, the design of reflection needs to consider the devices they use and their cognitive ability to self-reflect.</s></p><p xml:id="_7vbqHCW"><s xml:id="_9kPdrXF">Supporting reflection at the level of the family surfaces another set of challenges.</s><s xml:id="_Kg8fqub">Our interviews revealed families wanted guidelines and comparisons appropriate for the nature of their family (e.g., accounting for age and chronic conditions).</s><s xml:id="_5nTSUzT">Families also want systems to help account for the different needs and goals of each family member, and to help in identifying positive and negative ripple effects among family members.</s><s xml:id="_7twXjBJ">Addressing such needs requires integrating data across family members.</s><s xml:id="_BF9Vk7K">But families are complex and faced with many competing commitments, so designs need to be mindful of potential tensions and negative implications of tracking.</s></p><p xml:id="_Du7dwqY"><s xml:id="_RaRPZMP">Action: Action can occur after collection, integration, and reflection <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref>, or it can be intertwined with these stages of tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_h8j7qGN">In addition to the challenges that individuals face in identifying what action to take and succeeding in that action, families face additional challenges presented by coordination and collaboration among family members.</s><s xml:id="_MVVZVuc">For example, if improving the sleep of a family member (e.g., an adult with sleep apnea) means that a child also needs to go to sleep earlier, then the family needs to reassess evening routines of both parent and child.</s><s xml:id="_EUSfvAa">Our interviews also found families were better able to maintain healthy practices if all family members were engaged.</s><s xml:id="_dXMzr83">Appropriate action in a family informatics perspective therefore requires examining potential actions for every family member that account for sustainability and appropriateness.</s></p></div>
