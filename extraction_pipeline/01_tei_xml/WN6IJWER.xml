however, our subjects were willing to sign a waiver and agreed to do this as they did not consider the transmission of individual BP readings as a privacy threat even though text messaging is not secure.</s><s xml:id="_XppgcXk">However, we demonstrated an improvement in BP completion rate with just text reminders-an approach that is HIPAAcompliant, inexpensive, and extremely easy for clinics to implement and use on a widespread basis.</s><s xml:id="_3Hm4CMf">Third, this is a single-center study, and our results may not be generalizable to other settings.</s><s xml:id="_cjsdF9r">For example, our results may not be generalizable to patient populations with highly complex drug regimens or a greater number of comorbidities.</s><s xml:id="_88zwqZq">Finally, our bi-directional text messaging approach does not currently upload data directly into the patient's EMR.</s><s xml:id="_3ZXDCDm">However, patients and providers can view the information via password-protected website.</s><s xml:id="_ZHW5SmX">Alternatively, we could send the data via fax so that these data can be included in the patient's EMR.</s><s xml:id="_zrRnwk5">In any event, this approach is much less labor-intensive than calling patients over the phone.</s></p></div>
