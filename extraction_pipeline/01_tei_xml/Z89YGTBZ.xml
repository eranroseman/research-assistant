their own health and well-being, the environment they live in and work, and track and share health and wellness related parameters through wearable sensors, mobile health apps and even home-based passive sensing solutions.</s><s xml:id="_vCyWvhr">Precision medicine, namely "prevention and treatment strategies that take individual variability into account <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>" has been an emerging paradigm shift in biomedical research that calls for collecting and analyzing large data collected on the unique individual's behavior, lifestyle, genetics and environmental context.</s><s xml:id="_s9Yxgz3">Such data include large scale biologic databases, and the use of proteomics, metabolomics, and genomics to better understand individual patients and populations but also the use of emerging technologies such as passive sensing and wearables to capture physiological, behavioral and environmental data for individuals and communities.</s><s xml:id="_HajwWW2">This calls for advance computational tools to mine and analyze such large data sets.</s></p><p xml:id="_Wqs3Jud"><s xml:id="_rZTsGYh">Behavioral sensing, that includes passive monitoring and wearable technologies, aims to objectively, remotely and continuously measure aspects of patient physiology, behavior and symptoms.</s><s xml:id="_BwVCcM8">Consumer technologies such as wearables and other sensors provide the ability to capture behavior and activities of daily living, replace the need for human observers, eliminate reliance on self-report shifting from episodic to continuous monitoring and furthermore facilitate assessment of daily living in the real world and not a laboratory setting.</s><s xml:id="_9kQ7uBR">These tools also offer the ability to an individual to gather data about their health and well-being outside of clinical settings and be in charge as to if and how their data are shared with others.</s><s xml:id="_z3rKQEJ">The recognition of the role of technology in allowing patients to be actively involved in their own health care delivery and disease prevention has led to the growth of the sub-discipline of biomedical informatics, called personal health informatics (PHI).</s><s xml:id="_VkZARzv">PHI is emerging as an evolution of consumer health informatics.</s><s xml:id="_uxFje4P">Gibbons et al defined consumer health informatics as "any electronic tool, technology, or electronic application that is designed to interact directly with consumers, with or without the presence of a health care professional that provides or uses individualized (personal) information and provides the consumer with individualized assistance, to help the patient better manage their health or health care" <ref type="bibr"

individuals and their families/ communities with the goal to facilitate decision making, access to information, education, managing health, prevent disease, and improve communication whereby the individual patient or consumer is the end user whose needs and preferences inform the design and implementation of the system.</s></p><p xml:id="_8XJFRNp"><s xml:id="_ydmGG8R">The growth of various digital tools in health has led to continuous growth of patient generated health data (PGHD).</s><s xml:id="_jhVr68W">The Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC) in the US defines PGHD as "health-related data including health history, symptoms, biometric data, treatment history, lifestyle choices, and other information-created, recorded, gathered or inferred by or from patients or their designees" <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zY7swUU">This definition highlights the unique role of patients as the responsible entity for the capture and oversight of the collected data and introduces a paradigm shift from the more paternalistic model of medicine whereby the patient is the passive recipient of services to one where the patient is actively involved and at the center of information gathering.</s><s xml:id="_vjB27xF">Tools that capture PGHD have the potential to "amplify" the patient voice and increase patient safety <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_WqkervY"><s xml:id="_ycT6DYp">There is a broad range of platforms that can facilitate the capture of PGHD including paper-based tools such as diaries or forms to wearable or even implantable devices.</s><s xml:id="_stPxDWR">Electronic tools may offer not only the ability to capture and store data but also provide alerts for individual data points, or even embed more sophisticated informatics approaches such as predictive analytics, natural language processing or machine learning, to identify patterns and trends and ultimately facilitate a proactive approach to symptom management and health.</s><s xml:id="_yRzBXVF">Data can be communicated and shared with various stakeholders including family members and clinicians in various ways, including visual summaries, online dashboards or even integration of PGHD into the patient's electronic health record.</s></p></div>

collected, stored and potentially shared in the future x Helping in the curation of personal health data x Overseeing the integration of patient generated health data, when appropriate, to support clinical decision making and determining whether or how such data may be relevant to processes of care x the interpretation of data recognizing that patients and family members may have varying degrees not only of literacy and health literacy but also data literacy (the ability to interpret data points and processes of data collection and storage) and graph literacy (the ability to meaningfully extract knowledge from various graphs and visualizations).</s></p><p xml:id="_rB5Mmva"><s xml:id="_EHTaAfF">PHI tools are often designed without active involvement of the end user target group in the design phases, and as a result, they fail to become accessible and meaningful to many end users.</s><s xml:id="_6dSVTBA">Furthermore, many of these tools may require infrastructure thatnis not readily available.</s><s xml:id="_myxW4CD">Indeed, many commercially available PHI tools may be inaccessible to patients who lack required infrastructure such as broadband Internet.</s><s xml:id="_XM3pSef">In the US specifically, according to the American Community Survey (ACS), 18.1 million Americans (15% of all households) in 2018 did not subscribe to any form of "broadband" Internet service (which the Census Bureau defines as anything faster than dial-up access) <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[28]</ref> and it is hard to estimate how many of the remaining households have continuous, fast and reliable access.</s><s xml:id="_ccZKJwP">Of those households with a broadband subscription, 14 million only have a cellular data plan, and 12.3 million only have a wireline subscription.</s><s xml:id="_KWDEfYh">Broadband gaps exist throughout the country.</s><s xml:id="_jzssX5S">While adoption rate is lower in rural areas compared to urban ones, the majority of digitally disconnected households lives in urban areas.</s><s xml:id="_Tq7nKZG">Additionally, personal health informatics systems may be inaccessible to patients who experience functional or cognitive limitations, visual or hearing impairments, lack experience using technology, have limited English proficiency or lack a personal support network to help them access these systems.</s></p><p xml:id="_FCUw7UZ"><s xml:id="_83anNWg">There are existing solutions to some of these challenges that have been emerging.</s><s xml:id="_hafyMC5">New videoconferencing solutions, for example, introduce features such as closedcaptioning, screen readers, web templates that meet accessibility standards for users with functional, visual or hearing limitations and peripheral monitoring devices with accessible design that can be used by these patients.</s><s xml:id="_xgchJj6">Medically qualified interpreters can participate in telehealth encounters and on-demand video interpreting services can be integrated into the scheduling and delivery of telehealth services.</s><s xml:id="_gRfB78z">Finally, personal health informatics tools can adapt to limited connectivity (e.g., by offering services that use cellular networks or text messaging services to reach patients when appropriate).</s><s xml:id="_5zgQQ3B">Partnerships are being built to implement long-term solutions to connectivity in rural communities.</s></p><p xml:id="_scWNStN"><s xml:id="_pqtupdg">Inclusivity needs to be a mandate for personal health informatics systems.</s><s xml:id="_bQM8Ec2">To this end, five strategies can be pursued to create a more inclusive and accessible PHI ecosystem:</s></p><p xml:id="_UTw7RNN"><s xml:id="_skfEJje">1) Given the significant reliance of health care, education and tele-work on digital platforms it is important to consider what Zuckermam <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[29]</ref> calls a "digital public infrastructure" that will recognize the Internet and online platforms as public utilities accessible to all (and regulated as such).</s><s xml:id="_yjcKFUQ">Coordinated efforts at the federal, state and local levels need to aim for universal accessibility of broadband Internet and necessary hardware.</s></p><p xml:id="_awXcgaR"><s xml:id="_qhCn2W9">2) The inclusivity mandate needs to be reflected in product design for new PHI hardware and software and in reimbursement requirements.</s><s xml:id="_5NYYznj">3) Health systems and industry partners must build partnerships with patient advocacy groups to ensure their engagement and representation in the design, implementation and evaluation of PHI systems.</s><s xml:id="_GmmWwUx">4) The medical and nursing curricula need to provide future health care providers with tools to advocate for accessibility of digital platforms for patients and families and strategies to improve the patient experience in a digital world.</s><s xml:id="_twNz3ZJ">5) This is a unique opportunity to rethink the role of patient navigators as those not only assisting with the navigation of the medical system and coordination of services and scheduling, but also assisting with the navigation of the digital health landscape for patients and families with varying degrees of digital literacy.</s><s xml:id="_mtJy3Ms">This could be in partnership with the "personal health data scientist" function described earlier.</s></p></div>
