anxiety, depression, and loss of sleep.</s><s xml:id="_AZeC2wa">Because individuals with a severe fear of coronavirus are generally more concerned about the negative consequences of the pandemic and are preoccupied with their well-being, they should have a greater base motivation to take actions to protect themselves from the disease.</s><s xml:id="_7QgJMTx">This, predictably, will make them less attentive to the differences in the framing of a social distancing message compared to people with lower levels of fear of coronavirus.</s><s xml:id="_qqmTFFa">Consequently, people with lower (vs.</s><s xml:id="_V8cUk3b">higher) coronavirus fear will be more attentive to subtle changes in the message framing and find it more persuasive when the message is framed around benefits for the

xml:id="_jsp3Qjw"><s xml:id="_87Wdbuc">The degree of adherence to preventive measures may also depend on individuals' perceived sense of control.</s><s xml:id="_msDy67m">According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">Rotter (1966)</ref>, people differ in the perceived level of control that they have over situations and experiences that affect their lives.</s><s xml:id="_wyb8QUB">Some people believe to have a higher sense of control over what happens around them.</s><s xml:id="_54Fz6B6">This chronic sense of control is indicated as "locus of control" and is measured with a unidimensional scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Chaxel, 2016)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tEw67Rf">People who are at the higher (vs.</s><s xml:id="_yAPhP5p">lower) end of this scale are likely to believe that they can (vs.</s><s xml:id="_wDCqcY6">cannot) control the outcomes of events that take place in their surroundings <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Burroughs and Glen Mick, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Chaxel, 2016)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Z32ZmVE">Motivated by this, we predict that the locus of control will influence how individuals evaluate a social distancing message.</s><s xml:id="_EMDZNfb">We expect that people with higher levels of locus of control will believe that they can protect themselves from COVID-19 by taking necessary precautions and will be less influenced by a social distancing message.</s><s xml:id="_rrfaqCM">However, people with lower levels of locus of control will be more influenced by external warnings and hence find social distancing messages framed around prosocial (vs.</s><s xml:id="_rEaXpsc">selfinterested) appeals more persuasive compared to those with higher levels of locus of control.</s><s xml:id="_EJUejZ5">Therefore, we hypothesize that: H1c: Prosocial (vs.</s><s xml:id="_Qgpxa8Y">self-interested) appeals will increase how persuasive individuals find the message to engage in social distancing more among individuals with lower

xml:id="_yRZH3Mv">With lots of people suffering from social, economic, physical, and mental problems, community support has become especially important in coping with the adverse effects of the pandemic.</s><s xml:id="_rxaQRjD">In times of social distancing, people can help those in need through several means such as by sharing one's resources or donating money.</s><s xml:id="_chXepjp">Although identifying the factors that influence citizens' helping inclinations during the pandemic is crucial, it is an underresearched topic.</s><s xml:id="_HvEeBKC">Most relevant to our work, prior research has explored whether prosocial and self-interested motives drive helping behavior in diverse domains such as charitable donation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Brunel and Nelson, 2000;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">Schlosser and Levy, 2016)</ref>, proenvironmental behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Griskevicius et al., 2010)</ref>, organ donation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">Pessemier et al., 1977)</ref>, and volunteerism (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Mowen and Sujan, 2005)</ref>, as well as in for-profit organizations contexts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Ryoo et al., 2020)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_t58EH6N">This research stream provides supporting evidence for both views that people may help others for personal benefits or for the good of society at large.</s><s xml:id="_adqGnTR">We predict that if a social distancing message emphasizes everyone's well-being in society, as opposed to an individual's own well-being, it will increase people's concern for each other and their willingness to engage in helping behavior.</s><s xml:id="_Xgwx8Kh">Supporting this argument, research on selfconstruals reveals that priming the self as a socially embedded entity connected to others (i.e., interdependent self-construal) rather than as an autonomous entity distinct from others (i.e., independent self-construal) can motivate prosocial behavior.</s><s xml:id="_fm4DMdj">For example, activating interdependent self-construal promotes valuing collectivistic goals and perceiving higher obligations toward others in one's social network <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(Gardner et al., 1999)</ref> and motivates collaboration with others in sharing environmental resources <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Arnocky et al., 2007)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Xp74q8b">While we do not prime selfconstruals in this research, these findings support our view that highlighting concern for one's community at large, rather than the individual self, may motivate individuals more to help others during the pandemic.</s><s xml:id="_kFB2gD6">Summing up, we hypothesize that: H2a: Prosocial (vs.</s><s xml:id="_yghxRbC">self-interested) appeals in a social distancing message will motivate individuals more to help others.</s></p><p xml:id="_TbukSnh"><s xml:id="_sKNSgjm">People become fearful when they experience danger or threat in life <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(LaTour and Rotfeld, 1997)</ref>, and this emotion intensifies in-group support as a coping mechanism <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Fritsche et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_RFrbqmF">Based on this, we think that the level of fear of coronavirus may affect individuals' willingness to help each other during the pandemic.</s><s xml:id="_eV6uXZq">Individuals with higher levels of coronavirus fear tend to pay more attention to the frightening aspects of the disease and take it more seriously as they see it as a threat to their lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Ahorsu et al., 2020)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NzAFC5H">Accordingly, they are more effortful in combatting the disease compared to people with lower levels of fear <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Harper et al., 2020)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_eV5TrAE">We predict that the higher salience of and concern about the pandemic will enhance the need for solidarity among people with higher fear and make them more considerate and empathic toward other individuals' needs.</s><s xml:id="_9YG7Ytr">In other words, they will be more willing to help others regardless of being exposed to an external message.</s><s xml:id="_gjuP6NU">However, those with lower fear and concern about the disease will be more influenced by an external message in their motivations to help others.</s><s xml:id="_jKwE74P">Therefore, we predict that prosocial (vs.</s><s xml:id="_zCbnAPS">self-interested) messages will be more persuasive in motivating willingness to
