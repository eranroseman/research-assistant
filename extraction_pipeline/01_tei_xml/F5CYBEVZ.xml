PICU patients.</s></p><p xml:id="_qyW2WBf"><s xml:id="_kdGKe5h">The distress impacting parents of PICU patients is substantial and enduring.</s><s xml:id="_vBXHPPv">In a review by Nelson and Gold, up

experience and their likelihood of long-term sequelae.</s><s xml:id="_4kS4unZ">Mental health resources are finite, and providers often rely on severity of illness to allocate these resources. <ref

xml:id="_mQspfBZ">Less conspicuous distress may be masked by the high medical and psychosocial acuity in the PICU.</s><s xml:id="_VzruTCN">Further, parents are heavily taxed while attending to their critically ill child and may not have the bandwidth to participate in interviews or other research procedures.</s><s xml:id="_Fc6Utsq">Perhaps for this reason, few studies exist which ask parents to complete surveys during their child's PICU stay, and we did not encounter any studies which asked parents to complete surveys on a repeated measures basis while their child was in the PICU.</s><s xml:id="_gPpxJQJ">Even in the acute care setting, recruiting parents for research while one's child is hospitalized presents a challenge for researchers. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16</ref></s><s xml:id="_4uvVwmG">In a study of parents' post-traumatic stress symptom trajectories performed in Australia, out of 311 eligible families who were approached, parents from 122 families completed at least 3 of the 4 surveys (39.2%), and only 1 of these time points was during the child's inpatient stay. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17</ref></s><s xml:id="_GjAPyTn">Surveys were presented in paper-either in person or by mail-and participants included parents of patients in acute care and in the PICU.</s><s xml:id="_GHhHrPr">It stands to reason that recruitment and retention of participants could be more challenging in a higher acuity setting such as the PICU and especially difficult when multiple surveys are performed at multiple time points across a PICU stay.</s></p><p xml:id="_Se2eERj"><s xml:id="_FFJuauS">Text messaging is becoming a convenient and accepted way to communicate with patients and families during and after healthcare encounters. <ref type="bibr"

convenience to parents <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref> and its potential to help parents feel more supported

chaotic experience. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref></s><s xml:id="_D67xGKX">Moreover, the burdens are likely not equally distributed across a population.</s><s xml:id="_8YP7Cu8">Families from minoritized populations and/or of low incomes are disproportionately burdened and therefore often consent for research at lower rates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">32</ref></s><s xml:id="_kyfM29y">For these reasons, it is important to determine the feasibility and acceptability of this data collection method specifically within the PICU environment.</s></p><p xml:id="_NdDYTRw"><s xml:id="_VRMAcSd">At present, there are no tools to assess parents' subjective experiences and perceptions in, or near, real time.</s><s xml:id="_CJf5tdV">As stated, such a tool
