(2) patients who do not respond to low-intensity treatment may develop negative attitudes toward treatment or be deterred from undergoing further treatment; <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref> engaging in high-intensity treatment after a minimal intervention may be unnecessarily burdensome; and (4) those with greater clinical needs may have to wait longer to receive a more effective level of care and, in the interim, experience an exacerbation of symptoms and additional impairment.</s></p><p xml:id="_MAkfNXq"><s xml:id="_HdCG5AF">As an alternative, a stratified model considers patient characteristics, preferences, and baseline mental health symptoms to identify and deliver the most clinically effective yet least burdensome and least costly initial intervention from a range of care modalities of different intensities <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_PRn6xAP">Stratifying care with personalized recommendations is thought to be more patient-centered and is responsive to key drawbacks of the progressive stepped care approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DYyRUVa">In some stratified systems, more specifically blended care models, patients can access multiple modalities simultaneously; that is, they can use their recommended treatment modality as well as additional modalities of lower intensity than their recommended starting point (eg, digital tools plus provider sessions, as opposed to digital-only or provider-only session).</s><s xml:id="_6CyUnqQ">While advantageous from a delivery perspective and found to be effective <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>, stratified, blended models can be more difficult to evaluate because of the complexity and variety of care pathways offered to patients and the variability of "blends" that patients may use at different points in time.</s></p></div>
