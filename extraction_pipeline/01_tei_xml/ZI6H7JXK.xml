steps that describe how an intervention is expected to produce certain outputs and outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_AvFMZe7">These steps often include what inputs will be used, which activities will be conducted, what outputs will be produced, and, finally, what outcomes are expected to be achieved through this process, i.e, what "change" is expected to happen <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_32GepdK">According to the Aspen Institute <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, Theory of Change (ToC) can be understood as a tool to facilitate the development of solutions to complex social problems.</s><s xml:id="_Xfyxp5x">A ToC is generally presented in graphic form, as a diagram, showing the connections between interventions and outcomes (causal pathways) while explicitly stating assumptions and related evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_bWYnf48">This diagram usually represents a working model containing preconditions, expected results, rationales, assumptions, and indicators.</s></p><p xml:id="_aPDaZYA"><s xml:id="_MJBm8pe">The concept of ToC was preceded, during the 50s and 60s, by an approach called Program Theory, which proposed a way of understanding and planning interventions with focus on the roles of context, input, processes, and products for intervention design <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Qcxf9HW">Over time, increasingly more attention was given to explaining how an intervention was expected to work in terms of its underlying causal links <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_BVztPMC">In 1995, The Roundtable on Comprehensive Community Development, supported by the Aspen Institute <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, advocated for the importance of making it clear for stakeholders the assumptions of how change is to be achieved by a program, popularizing the term Theory of Change, described as "a theory of how and why an initiative works" <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_JufVgQE"><s xml:id="_h6VCzbQ">The concept of ToC is related to, and often overlaps with, several other tools and frameworks, such as Logical Model, Program Theory, Action Theory or Logical Framework.</s><s xml:id="_7hcPhC4">A Logical Model, for instance, is defined as a graphical representation of a program theory, showing the relevant causal connections up to the results <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_pp9E2xX">A Program Theory is an explicit theory of how an intervention is expected to achieve its goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HQh8kst">An Action Theory, on the other hand, describes the pathways for developing an intervention.</s><s xml:id="_wkfXQXN">Finally, a Logical Framework, or Logframe, is a method for planning and evaluation, usually specifying inputs, activities, outputs, outcomes, and impacts in a matrix, and possibly also including indicators and assumptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xCVKK8q">Logframes are considered less flexible than ToC diagrams, and more limited in representing multiple, interacting, and nonlinear causal pathways.</s><s xml:id="_hhUZsB6">Importantly, ToCs should make assumptions and contextual factors explicit to explain the causal steps, i.e. why and how an intervention is expected to lead to the anticipated changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Z7Q52rp">Furthermore, a core feature that distinguishes ToC from other similar approaches is the emphasis on it being a living process, constantly updated based on lessons learned <ref type="bibr">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_p7kHNwj"><s xml:id="_cFA8pNC">These steps often include what inputs will be used, what activities will be conducted,

xml:id="_WjRNDGA"><s xml:id="_MmNHPQm">"ToC is 'a theory of how and why an initiative works' which can be empirically tested by measuring indicators for every expected step on the hypothesized causal pathway to impact.</s><s xml:id="_baTt6G8">It is developed in collaboration with stakeholders and modified throughout the intervention development and evaluation process through an 'ongoing process of reflection to explore change and how it happens'.</s><s xml:id="_Tdegs5R">It is visually represented in a ToC map which is a graphic representation of the causal pathways through which an intervention
