<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="_uYvHSWg"><p xml:id="_8b7v2ZT"><s xml:id="_Z5U8bdE">based on the adult OCD literature and highlights the importance of examining these symptoms within a pediatric OCD sample.</s></p><p xml:id="_QuYcYVS"><s xml:id="_pBCVq6w">Childhood obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) is a chronic psychiatric condition affecting approximately 1-2% of children and adolescents <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7t5sXv4">It has been linked to impairment across multiple domains of life, negatively impacting academic, social, and family functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rdr8TE7">Despite these deleterious consequences, individuals with OCD unfortunately experience numerous barriers to seeking and receiving care, resulting in delayed diagnoses and treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hGhunbn">Moreover, even after receiving front-line treatments for pediatric OCD <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, only about half of youths experience full remission of symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_kFkHJB2">Consequently, research on specific factors that may negatively impact treatment response and contribute to more severe symptom presentations is imperative.</s><s xml:id="_QbqEHZJ">Given the tremendous heterogeneity in OCD symptom presentations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, conducting nuanced examinations of specific symptom subtypes to test questions about which factors may influence disorder severity and treatment response can help elucidate such factors; these investigations may allow for personalized intervention approaches that help to alleviate disorder-related burden.</s></p><p xml:id="_7fPv9qp"><s xml:id="_Zbj2Puy">Numerous investigations with OCD-affected adults have examined the phenomenology and clinical profiles of various symptom dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, including contamination, harm, immoral, or symmetry/"just right" symptoms.</s><s xml:id="_zcXRku7">Of particular interest in adult studies, religious symptoms have been explored given the distressing nature of the content, implications for morality, and interactions with the patient's own religion and cultural upbringing.</s><s xml:id="_YgHqquH">However, this literature is conflicted in regards to whether religious symptoms are associated with more severe clinical profiles.</s><s xml:id="_kbVquhC">In some studies, adult patients with religious obsessions are rated by clinicians as having poorer insight into their symptoms, as well as cognitive distortions such as magical thinking, overinflated sense of responsibility, perfectionism, importance of thoughts, and thought-action fusion related to morality <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_UwgSAvA">Additionally, such adults presented with longer durations of illness and higher symptom severity when compared to OCD-affected adults who did not experience religious symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mHtFyq4">In contrast, other studies did not find differences in OCD symptom severity <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>, although religious symptoms have been associated with having more obsessions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_v967ysW">More work needs to be done in this area, particularly in relation to whether religious symptoms are associated with differential clinical presentations in children and adolescents with OCD.</s></p><p xml:id="_T6ZKC7m"><s xml:id="_RUttkHR">Investigations in adult OCD have also focused on the potential impact of religious symptoms on treatment-seeking behaviors and treatment response.</s><s xml:id="_PVp54UP">One study found that OCD-affected adults with religious symptoms were more likely to seek pastoral counseling, but less likely to seek pharmacological treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, highlighting differences in the types of treatment services obtained (although there was no difference in rates of seeking CBT).</s><s xml:id="_k8RCQ3T">Additionally, individuals with religious OCD symptoms reported longer delays in receiving an accurate diagnosis and seeking professional help for their illness <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9aAJ5CV">Given the barriers that already face youth with psychiatric difficulties <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>, discussing religious symptoms, which may feel especially embarrassing or taboo, is presumed to be even more difficult <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_UVKebEx">In regards to treatment response, the adult OCD literature has been mixed.</s><s xml:id="_3W5Fhf6">A recent review highlighted worse CBT-related outcomes for individuals presenting with more severe symptoms from the sexual/aggressive/religious subtype <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rdZ5HtX">Some studies have also indicated that religious symptoms demonstrate stability over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, with poorer long-term outcomes observed for adult patients receiving pharmacological and/or behavior therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EQnxgvC">However, other studies failed to find any differences in treatment response <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DGKhyW5">Similar findings have also been mirrored in the limited child OCD literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_JapT8zy"><s xml:id="_NyqwKKS">Taken together, there are considerable data suggesting that individuals with OCD characterized by religious symptoms may have a unique clinical profile, including a poorer response to treatment.</s><s xml:id="_vStrvDf">However, even though OCD frequently begins in childhood <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, there remains a gap in extending this work to this age group.</s><s xml:id="_f2BCZYS">This gap is important to address, given the phenomenological differences between adults and youth in the clustering of OCD symptom sub-types <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, developmental factors that may impact the malleability of religious symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, and differences in the treatment approaches to pediatric OCD <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_F47ma7A">Indeed, data regarding the relationship of religious OCD symptoms in youth with such critical clinical factors as family psychopathology and environment, as well as psychiatric comorbidities, are strikingly absent from the existing literature base.</s></p><p xml:id="_dSu9wY6"><s xml:id="_nDeJUGQ">This study seeks to fill the gaps in the pediatric OCD literature by examining whether the presence of religious symptoms is associated with greater overall OCD severity and higher rates of other OCD symptom clusters.</s><s xml:id="_cNvFhmz">Youth with religious OCD symptoms were expected to have higher symptom severity and to present with more aggressive, sexual, somatic, and checking symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> than their OCD-affected counterparts without religious symptoms.</s><s xml:id="_Fh6wbBj">We also examined the clinical pro-files of youth presenting with and without religious OCD symptoms on characteristics related to OCD (insight, disorder-related impairment), psychiatric comorbidity (internalizing and externalizing disorders), as well as the family (accommodation, family environment) and the parent (parental psychopathology).</s><s xml:id="_XZ24342">We hypothesized that presence of religious OCD symptoms would be linked to higher OCDrelated impairment, poorer insight, higher comorbidity <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>, lower family accommodation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>, more controlled family interactions, and higher parental psychopathology.</s><s xml:id="_ckf4WnZ">Predictions regarding the style of family interactions were drawn from related research into the effects of parenting strategies on mental pollution in OCD <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>, and expectations about parental psychopathology were similarly referenced from broader literature in OCD <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>; neither of these hypotheses, however, have been tested specifically for religious OCD symptoms.</s><s xml:id="_NmSYsRh">Finally, we aimed to explore treatment response to CBT in youth with and without religious OCD symptoms.</s><s xml:id="_7yahsau">Although the limited child literature has not demonstrated differences in CBT response, some studies with adults suggest that the presence of religious symptoms is associated with poorer response <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s></p></div>
