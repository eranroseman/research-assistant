in discussions, using these platforms to exchange knowledge, ask for help, discuss problems, and share stories <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_38XgnWF">Synchronous platforms,

xml:id="_UTzApRZ">A systematic review indicated that internet support groups (ISGs) are most often used for emotional and informational support (more often experiential knowledge than "second-hand" professional knowledge), which creates a sense of social companionship <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_GYKgyhy">This review found that 10 of 16 single-intervention or cross-sectional trials showed a positive effect of ISGs on depression symptoms, although study quality was rated as low, and the studies covered a range of mental and physical health conditions <ref

social isolation <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_kqwKHeZ">However, there was limited empirical evidence to validate these descriptive findings.</s><s xml:id="_j26zw69">In a systematic review of online peer support for adolescents and young adults, Ali and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> found mixed results, with only 2 of the 6 studies included in the review showing evidence of a positive effect.</s><s xml:id="_bjbNyJb">These 2 studies demonstrated reductions in anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> and higher abstinence from smoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> after using online peer support.</s><s xml:id="_CA3tzu9">A further review of digital peer support for mental health found early evidence of feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness among all studies, though it reported that the studies were lacking in measurements of fidelity, limiting understanding of underlying mechanisms <ref

type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KRprSDE">Furthermore, it has been suggested that online forums can function as platforms for peer education-being "experiential experts," peers can provide others with health-related information, such as potential interventions or treatments or how to behave or cope in the situation they are facing, and a greater understanding of how others experience the same illness.</s><s xml:id="_TkPKCjH">This is often information that individuals don't have access to offline <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_d5MzyKP"><s xml:id="_rdgKUQg">However, users have also identified disadvantages, including the potential for others' experiences to cause personal distress, restrictive rules and moderation, and unhelpful interactions with others <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9TA6YJN">A survey study exploring adverse events in the use of online peer support found social exclusion and emotional contagion to be other potential risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_XZwZKP4">Research has also raised the need for guidelines to safeguard vulnerable people, both as users and as moderators of online mental health peer support groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s

xml:id="_4nNtyh2">Change models provide an understanding of how processes within an intervention are associated with outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_nFT5Dq9">The model suggests the primary mechanism is building trusting relationships based on peer workers sharing lived experiences and understanding service users' experiences.</s><s xml:id="_s2mCDsR">Two parallel mechanisms flow from this: (1) peer workers role-modeling recovery and social functioning and (2) bridging the gap to professional services and the community.</s><s xml:id="_mN6rZtZ">The model suggests these mechanisms lead to changes in outcomes such as hope, empowerment, social functioning, self-care, engagement with services, and strength of social networks.</s><s xml:id="_qfWUtxf">Chinman and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> suggested these mechanisms show face validity, but no studies have explored their explanatory power.</s><s xml:id="_9dNzPR4">Moreover, no research has investigated whether these mechanisms can be applied to online peer support environments.</s></p><p xml:id="_5MNES7K"><s xml:id="_N79UUCJ">It is as yet unclear whether models like these transfer to online peer support, and there is a gap in research in this area <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zWpQUUu">However, some researchers have set out new models describing what benefits people seek from online networks in particular, and how these benefits may be achieved.</s><s xml:id="_YnFksT6">Naslund and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref> proposed a theoretical model for online peer support, incorporating 3 main opportunities provided by such networks.</s><s xml:id="_MAjCXxy">The first, challenging stigma, relates to individuals connecting with similar others and feeling more comfortable expressing themselves due to the anonymity afforded by online peer support networks.</s><s xml:id="_9Wkae9h">The second, increasing consumer activation, suggests online settings enable individuals to learn what to expect from a condition, how to cope with it, and how to approach important health care decisions.</s><s xml:id="_VjhKAft">The final opportunity suggests that online networks facilitate access to other (online and offline) interventions.</s><s xml:id="_38gZrgp">No studies have so far empirically tested whether this model is supported by users of Facebook groups for peer-to-peer support.</s></p><p xml:id="_tafvukp"><s xml:id="_uvvZrCa">Aside from these models, various theories from across the discipline of psychology have been suggested to underlie peer support, including social learning theory, social comparison theory, and helper therapy <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5TMQ6D7">Social learning theory, in the context of peer support, suggests that peers with a history of or current mental illness act as role models for peers with similar mental illness <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[63]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Pej7qgY">Interacting with a peer perceived to be successfully coping with their illness is suggested to be more likely to result in positive behavior change.</s><s xml:id="_mqWngrZ"><ref type="bibr">Barton and Henderson [64]</ref> suggested observing another peer demonstrating desired behaviors with visible consequences motivates others to replicate this behavior.</s></p><p xml:id="_VrkUXy8"><s xml:id="_6uzKTvv">Social comparison theory suggests that people seek out others they perceive as having things in common with, such as a similar mental illness, to establish a sense of normalcy and identity <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EGBgWnT">Interacting with peers who have successfully managed their illness may lead to aspirations of positive behavior change <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_32TK64X">Upward comparisons, to those perceived to be successfully managing their illness, can provide hope and promote self-improvement.</s><s xml:id="_qhNENTe">Downward comparisons, to those believed to be worse off, put into perspective how bad things could be and are proposed to be self-enhancing.</s></p><p xml:id="_pf2eBGt"><s xml:id="_6Dm8RBM">Helper therapy proposes that individuals can benefit themselves through helping others <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[67]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_dFqyuEW">Suggested benefits to the helper include enhanced self-image, development of their abilities, and the status of the helper role influencing the way

psychoeducational program, Proudfoot and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b73">[74]</ref> found evidence for social comparison theory, which promotes hope, motivation, and faith in treatments, and helper therapy, which helps provide others awareness of how to manage their illness and promotes feelings of competence and a sense of connectedness to the mental health system.</s><s xml:id="_kfpcEyE">However, this study investigated peer support alongside another intervention, and research has yet to explore the mechanisms underpinning behavior and attitude changes in peer support when it is delivered alone in online peer support settings.</s></p><p xml:id="_v53W2nu"><s xml:id="_hA3mFyY">When considering how these models and theories may be applied to online peer support, it will also be important to consider the extent to which users engage with and contribute to online groups.</s><s xml:id="_deqUmFr">A common measure is frequency of posts, which has been suggested to broadly fit the 90-9-1 principle, stating that a majority of content will be posted by a small proportion of users (1%), while the vast majority of users (90%) choose to observe rather than participate actively <ref type="bibr" target="#b74">[75]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_CFhu5qx">However, this is a restricted, unidimensional measure, and reviews of multidisciplinary participatory styles have suggested there are up to 41 different styles of engagement found across various online health communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_pgjywr5">Further
