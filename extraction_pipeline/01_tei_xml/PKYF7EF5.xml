<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_ns78jAJ">Adapting Recruitment</head><p xml:id="_7u5SnZA"><s xml:id="_ZfV6q6g">Study activities were initially planned to coincide with activities and schedules at a local school, where we had conducted a codesign study to develop the app. 7</s><s xml:id="_sVsgUmK">We intended to recruit by sharing flyers with parents and conducting in-person workshops to provide them with information about the smartwatch intervention.</s></p><p xml:id="_MgfA3Sh"><s xml:id="_KJ443XE">When the collaborating school shifted to remote education, a partner from the school joined the research team and helped us connect with potential families through phone calls.</s><s xml:id="_ngVQ2us">Ten families were then recruited for the initial 6-week phase, which we changed from a "wash-out" phase to an intervention phase, as described in the next section.</s><s xml:id="_5caUGgt">At the time of this writing, five families are enrolled, and we expanded to recruit through a community clinic.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_KvFBWTc">Adapting Procedures</head><p xml:id="_RtPgh9y"><s xml:id="_xqwkTPc">The original study design involved preassessment evaluations, including two in-person assessments to evaluate ADHD symptoms and collect saliva to measure the children's cortisol levels, as an indicator of stress.</s><s xml:id="_MYdzPf5">These initial intake meetings were to be followed by a group session to distribute Apple Watches and install CoolCraig on one parent's phone or, if they preferred, a loaned phone.</s><s xml:id="_QEvZdbV">Finally, we intended to conduct monthly in-person interviews with the children and focus groups with the parents to obtain feedback on the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_XBR3TJs">At the end of the study, we planned to collect the devices and conduct the postassessment evaluation.</s></p><p xml:id="_3npXNT7"><s xml:id="_v5cWhuH">Due to pandemic restrictions, the pre-and postassessments were conducted using telehealth procedures, and we dropped cortisol measurement.</s><s xml:id="_WPm3HdH">To reduce complexity during the first phase, the researchers set up the devices before delivery and paired each watch with a phone distributed to each family.</s><s xml:id="_G4jFS42">Families could not install CoolCraig on their own phone.</s><s xml:id="_bgZCx4D">Instead of using this first phase purely as a wash-out phase, we rapidly developed and deployed a simple intervention, focusing on using technology to support organizational skills, which could help support distance learning.</s><s xml:id="_QRsV7qb">We presented the school's schedule for each child on their devices so that they would receive notifications at home for online classes and school activities, essentially creating an unplanned intervention on the fly to support homeschooling or distance learning.</s></p><p xml:id="_sp4DK84"><s xml:id="_FYBknMD">Similar to the ModEat study, one researcher acted as a proxy to deliver the devices to participants' homes (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> bottom), avoiding in-person contact and address disclosure to the rest of the research team.</s><s xml:id="_Bxf2MmU">During deployment, one child lost their watch and another broke their watch's screen, causing additional logistical and exposure challenges for device pickup, repair, and redelivery.</s></p><p xml:id="_XHDRecz"><s xml:id="_SAJTJap">To help with device setup and use, we sent participants a printed and digital manual with step-by-step instructions for CoolCraig's features.</s><s xml:id="_nCMcVqV">We also scheduled a short virtual session with each family to demonstrate the app and answer questions.</s></p><p xml:id="_avZ5CMX"><s xml:id="_28krcK7">Upon conducting the first interviews after a few weeks of deployment, we realized that sessions needed to be short and flexible.</s><s xml:id="_8EjM8dz">Barriers to extended sessions included the children's limited attention span, busy family schedules, saturation with virtual meetings, and additional household stress that came with the pandemic.</s><s xml:id="_tYPSqe2">To balance study goals with participant's life challenges, we opted instead for shorter sessions that would satisfy their time restricted schedules, often outside our own working hours.</s><s xml:id="_jgAYvan">We also ran sessions more frequently than with our previous studies.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_EdTqZRN">REFLECTING ON CHALLENGES</head><p xml:id="_HAyF9fB"><s xml:id="_bGqd5zy">Conducting research in-the-wild bears some risk of uncertainty and requires adapting to changing contexts, limiting the control and repeatability otherwise provided by lab experiments.</s><s xml:id="_HZE8pvu">However, the pandemic highlighted core areas of difficulty that can sometimes be hidden in traditional deployment studies and opened new possibilities for remote and socially distanced studies in the future.</s></p><p xml:id="_wXBdcfq"><s xml:id="_jXFxddA">Although our two studies had distinct goals, target populations, and custom apps, both faced shared challenges.</s><s xml:id="_QgS22yF">We reflect on considerations from both deployment studies surrounding engagement, collecting data, managing burden on researchers and participants, and managing infrastructure.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_9mPEmGY">Participant Enrollment and Engagement</head><p xml:id="_vZHjYwC"><s xml:id="_9AfA8bn">Participants who persevered through the challenges in our remote projects tended to be motivated by improving the well being and health of the targeted population.</s><s xml:id="_enFmStt">For ModEat, this materialized as interest in making food journaling easier for healthier eating, while for CoolCraig, the desire was to help all families with children with ADHD.</s><s xml:id="_kGhrS8y">Other complementary motivations included wanting to try new technologies, curiosity, a desire to be involved with research, and monetary compensation.</s></p><p xml:id="_hjC5GKA"><s xml:id="_NpjEcSM">While none of these motivations are particularly unique to our studies nor to participation during a pandemic, what we found interesting was the challenge of balancing these motivations-which may be considered somewhat trivial-in the face of a massive crisis in the form of fears around health, moving work and school to home, and the challenges of "lockdown" more broadly.</s><s xml:id="_8Nx6bx9">Tradeoffs between participants' own activities and those asked for the study, which once seemed reasonable in light of their somewhat altruistic goals and limited compensation, suddenly became much harder to bear.</s><s xml:id="_ugumUUV">As people became increasingly emotionally and physically impacted by the pandemic, motivation decreased, and availability for using deployed apps or talking with us about them became more limited, thereby increasing recruitment and retention challenges.</s></p><p xml:id="_EsSXSN4"><s xml:id="_qzAxxbG">Expanding from local recruitment to reach people in distant locations can potentially help find those who have the time and inclination to participate in a research study.</s><s xml:id="_avyCSWS">However, in both of our studies, the practicalities of moving from in-person meetings and lending devices to remote participation and requirements for device ownership created substantial challenges and highlighted limitations of trials without a substantial local workforce and technical aptitude.</s></p><p xml:id="_UbZppm7"><s xml:id="_ZhRrA3g">In hindsight, we see value in future studies broadening recruitment plans for both local and remote participants.</s><s xml:id="_NxxUZBV">In both cases, use of study devices as study compensation can reduce the logistical challenges of returning, sterilizing, and reusing equipment.</s><s xml:id="_KF8k5bY">Increases to study costs for buying such devices would be offset by existing participant compensation and losses due to participants who damaged or did not return study equipment.</s><s xml:id="_YjRrb8N">In addition, outsourcing device delivery by sending them directly from a commercial seller and removing the need for retrieval can decrease logistic efforts.</s></p><p xml:id="_rhrXxzN"><s xml:id="_JUSscKy">Despite potential benefits, this strategy might not be feasible for more complex technology setups or unique, custom-made devices.</s><s xml:id="_Etf8nbV">However, as more pervasive computing research projects use off-the-shelf technology with software that can be deployed remotely, these types of approaches should be considered to broaden the study pool.</s><s xml:id="_RN2QcKY">For example, we are currently recruiting families for longitudinal participation in our continued work with CoolCraig, which can be a difficult commitment.</s><s xml:id="_dzCFxQu">We have opened recruitment outside our geographic area, and we will continue this practice even after we can engage in-person locally.</s><s xml:id="_Afx8EZD">We are considering providing the watch and phone as compensation for longitudinal participation, rather than cash payments.</s><s xml:id="_AUEA4uC">Additionally, by the end of many longitudinal research studies, the equipment might not be in appropriate condition for reuse by the research team.</s><s xml:id="_tNRj2zx">Distribution to participants enables them to keep using tools they found useful, reduces the waste associated with unused old equipment locked in cabinets, opens the opportunity for additional follow-up assessment, and makes for a more sustainable approach to research.</s></p><p xml:id="_6PKg559"><s xml:id="_cpB5gPj">Delivering devices to participants' homes have additional implications regarding their privacy and anonymity.</s><s xml:id="_mErXnp6">While participants in both our studies were generally comfortable sharing their home addresses, others might not be as open to sharing such personal information.</s><s xml:id="_ujHMS8q">To protect privacy while delivering devices, only one researcher could access the participant's home address, which was treated as sensitive information.</s><s xml:id="_x4Dr3QH">Nonetheless, participants would also benefit from additional options, including allowing them to pick up devices themselves at mail centers

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_XYWwkDq">Data Collection</head><p xml:id="_mzf5Yra"><s xml:id="_Z5kKu65">The research described in our case studies employed mixed-method approaches to collecting and analyzing system usage logs alongside qualitative interviews.</s><s xml:id="_H4NcHYw">In adapting study activities to the pandemic, we quickly realized the benefits and challenges of remote interview sessions in acquiring relevant data for our research goals.</s><s xml:id="_7c24hB2">Though it did not require travelling and allowed for more flexible scheduling, participants were sometimes less committed or engaged in remote sessions, resulting in some late cancelations.</s><s xml:id="_2dDfjhy">Finally, with less control over the environment, remote interviews were easily interrupted.</s></p><p xml:id="_3BBkruR"><s xml:id="_rUw3rZr">These challenges were exacerbated in the Cool-Craig study, during which participants occasionally cut sessions short due to various in-home circumstances.</s><s xml:id="_BnmCPQ5">For instance, children would often wish to leave the Zoom meeting to go play outside or play online with friends.</s><s xml:id="_4ySbwjx">Children can be difficult to engage in interviews in the best of circumstances, but those who have been trapped in online school for hours, with or without ADHD, are unlikely to want to sit still and talk on-screen for yet another hour as part of a research study.</s><s xml:id="_4Q5Tzpe">Adults from both studies occasionally rescheduled meetings last minute due to back-toback appointments that were running late, or misjudged the time they would be available.</s></p><p xml:id="_7sFhueQ"><s xml:id="_K5YGUNH">We adapted interview procedures over time in ways that may be useful for remote field deployments more generally.</s><s xml:id="_nPhcDZT">In particular, we found that without the commitment and burden of traveling to meet the research team, participants were often more open to multiple sessions.</s><s xml:id="_fUdA8UB">Using multiple shorter remote meetings balanced out the need to collect as much data as in a single longer in-person session, while allowing participants to squeeze research participation into small pockets of time in their lives.</s><s xml:id="_5hmmqPC">Frequent sessions also enabled us to analyze what participants shared in prior sessions and subsequently ask clarifying questions.</s><s xml:id="_x6kAe3z">These sessions focused on smaller components of the overall research goals, such as configuration and overview of researchermade apps, or specific components of the deployed interventions.</s><s xml:id="_8Wurpbj">Planning for granular meetings can also better support occasional session interruption or cancelation, since it is expected that there will be other opportunities to schedule meetings.</s></p><p xml:id="_vG8Y9Qq"><s xml:id="_3nEBj5t">Despite the flexibility gained with more remote sessions, there were still losses of some particular benefits of meeting in-person.</s><s xml:id="_yPHZXm9">Observing and reacting to nonverbal cues were significantly lessened in videoconferencing, particularly when participants preferred to not turn on their cameras.</s><s xml:id="_EWSaGZZ">Having less control over participant's environments had especially strong implications for interviews with children who are easily distracted by nearby toys or other items in the room.</s><s xml:id="_quK62PT">Although having parents nearby helped the research team keep the children engaged, their proximity may have also influenced what children said, the details they were willing to provide, and their general responses to interview activities.</s><s xml:id="_969pbTk">If interviews were inperson, we could have prepared the environment to be less distracting and address concerns around the confidentiality of the interviews.</s></p><p xml:id="_gsemgFx"><s xml:id="_KT9XsgC">Despite these and other constraints, deployment studies during the pandemic, as during any time, benefit from being situated in real-life experiences.</s><s xml:id="_EzTQHt7">People struggled during COVID-19 with home schooling, weight management, and other challenges that our interventions were designed to support.</s><s xml:id="_hkQnwek">The additional struggles of pandemic life highlighted the need for and potential benefits of our approaches.</s><s xml:id="_QnDWDP5">The constraints that participants experienced impacted technology use and influenced the study results in ways that were not originally planned and might raise questions about generalizability.</s><s xml:id="_XXY6DDU">Nonetheless, deployments during the pandemic are also a strength, offering relevant contributions for technology design following shifting circumstances that can often be disruptive to normal routines, during crises, and concerning the broader discourse around public health and supportive technologies.</s><s xml:id="_T3rjUVv">We incorporated interview questions about the pandemic's influence on our study's goals to enable us to explore the limitations and benefits of technology interventions in face of new social dynamics.</s></p></div>

tradeoffs between their life circumstances and any additional responsibilities research participation might demand.</s></p><p xml:id="_gazF6uF"><s xml:id="_zAAsPxM">Therefore, it can be beneficial in extenuating circumstances, such as the pandemic, to increase monetary compensation or directly facilitate participants' nonstudy related activities, such as providing childcare and/ or food catering during interviews.</s><s xml:id="_CDtUN6b">However, these strategies must be considered within the limits of ethical research, remaining sensitive to the potential coercive nature of excessive compensation, particularly during times of stress and high need like a pandemic.</s></p><p xml:id="_SnhuvBk"><s xml:id="_ZHGw6V4">Additionally, shorter and periodic sessions can lessen challenges with otherwise prolonged virtual meetings but imply frequent engagement with the study, require more effort to manage, and involve more participant attention over time.</s><s xml:id="_KdfWSEb">To navigate this tension, quantity, length, and frequency of meetings should be considerate of each participant's particular situation and desires.</s><s xml:id="_DrjT9s4">Such balance has a higher chance of providing better quality and relevant data, given that participants will be more engaged and available.</s><s xml:id="_MjgrmRn">Alternatively, deployment studies can take advantage of indirect data collection, such as relying more on system usage logs or perhaps remote observation with in-home cameras or other sensors.</s><s xml:id="_Zw4SKJs">This approach, however, introduces privacy risks and requires ethical measures, such as designated areas in the home with clear indicators for when and where they are being recorded, precautionary measures for privacy of minors and unconsented members of the household, and providing agency to the participant to turn the camera ON or OFF and/or delete parts of the recordings any time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s xml:id="_fw5T6QZ">ilding Up Infrastructure Broadening participation, including recruiting people in distant locations, might increase representation in deployment studies and provide more data toward research goals.</s><s xml:id="_tygUz8H">However, this approach can also impose challenges to delivering and managing technology infrastructure.</s></p><p xml:id="_uMM4tZz"><s xml:id="_qBVfwsp">It is tempting to seek participants who already have a solid infrastructure of devices and connectivity in place, allowing for lessening or redirecting project budget.</s><s xml:id="_Af3W5mR">But this approach would likely exclude participants who would otherwise benefit from the technology and whose perspectives, needs, and constraints should influence its design.</s><s xml:id="_CGGmA33">Research ethics require that we sample participants from a wide variety of backgrounds who may not have access to such resources or the technical knowledge to use them.</s><s xml:id="_XsP3MMT">Thus, researchers must determine a minimum viable infrastructure necessary to participate in the deployment study.</s></p><p xml:id="_88FwqRj"><s xml:id="_ZCS5Rpr">Before beginning recruitment, there is a need to consider the tradeoffs among competing considerations for the budget of the study, what the project can provide to participants, and what we might expect a target population to already own.</s><s xml:id="_AumD3XJ">These same considerations must come into play during analysis, with claims limited to the population actually recruited and the experiences they have had.</s><s xml:id="_tg4a574">For instance, although access to the internet and phones has significantly increased, more novel and/or expensive devices are not as commonly owned.</s><s xml:id="_gwGqrSM">Access to internet can also still be a barrier for those with low socioeconomic status or in rural areas with poorer connectivity.</s><s xml:id="_UBsMFQy">As such, researchers can consider not only the loaning of devices, but also preconfigured hotspots or other solutions that would allow for device use as well as remote interview sessions.</s></p><p xml:id="_ATK6vXE"><s xml:id="_3MKVv8U">We acknowledge that these financially straining decisions may not be feasible within the budget limits of all research teams.</s><s xml:id="_rNpMjgm">Offering the devices as substitutes to monetary compensation is one possible strategy when using less expensive devices.</s><s xml:id="_sy9PPMM">Loaning devices to distant participants involve logistical costs and increased effort (e.g., sanitizing, mail dispatch, and retrieval).</s><s xml:id="_5C4XhXT">The tradeoffs include decreasing participant diversity by recruiting participants who already own devices.</s><s xml:id="_yKwY2tp">This also presents an opportunity for researchers to work with industry partners who can ship relevant products as donations or to return to the funding body to request specific and increased budgets for deployment studies, more so when conducting research in the face of new social dynamics during crises.</s></p></div>
