xml:id="_mfuUhmV">Perhaps unsurprisingly, political interventions aimed at preventing healthcare workforce emigration and better integrate immigrant health professionals continue to show poor results <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_AAqSfZD"><s xml:id="_PnttfhF">Furthermore, the prevailing theoretical understanding of this issue builds on a binary vision between personal and external reasons.</s><s xml:id="_rWfAdnB">Personal reasons (i.e.</s><s xml:id="_Ham9BTp">those intrinsically related to the individual) are regarded as being of an arbitrary nature to politics, while the external ones (i.e.</s><s xml:id="_MqMwU6z">those related to services, the legal system, and the political and economic environment) as if they are decisive for individual preferences.</s></p><p xml:id="_wB8M7m3"><s xml:id="_RU2WEqu">In this paper, we adopt a different perspective.</s><s xml:id="_DvjFWhY">Building on the core sociological premise, the personal-external dichotomy that has prevailed in the debate is artificial and less able to understand how individual choices operate.</s><s xml:id="_CBQDmnk">This can be explained first because the preferences of individuals are always linked to their surrounding contexts.</s><s xml:id="_uzJErX4">Second, because these surrounding contexts on their own do not perfectly explain individual preferences (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Correia (2016)</ref>  <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> for a synthesis).</s><s xml:id="_NaAg5eD">The way health professionals decide to emigrate is by setting and managing individual preferences in relation to surrounding contexts, be they related to personal life or work contexts and experiences.</s><s xml:id="_rqfjCue">In this perspective, personal and external factors stand out interrelated in the sense that organizational, legal, political and economic circumstances simultaneously shape and are shaped by individual interpretation and assessment.</s></p><p xml:id="_BMdM4SU"><s xml:id="_4Tc4tkm">The external factors that are likely to influence the professionals' decision to migrate can be grouped as follows: the architecture of health systems, the features of health services and professional belonging.</s></p><p xml:id="_yB4UQuc"><s xml:id="_b6NgRmP">The influence of health systems regards aspects such as whether professional careers exist and in which terms (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_mMrC2a3">job security, exposure to market competition, and external assessment and accountability), as well as the characteristics of the labour market, which includes wages and working conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_FMVaSTV">Given that public, for-profit and not-for-profit private actors play different roles in the governance of the health system <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, notably in workforce training and employment, their influence on the institutional features of health systems highlights country-based differences in professional roles, the division of work <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and institutional practice and collaboration cultures <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HeVJerG">Country-based differences in HRH policies were particularly visible in the European region during the 2008 economic and financial crisis <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> which naturally influenced the health care professionals' perspectives concerning their careers.</s></p><p xml:id="_pPyWSM6"><s xml:id="_Za2GUPD">Health services reflect service-level differences due to the nature of the care delivered (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_Eyn6Kbr">patient turnover, technological involvement), and the communities' epidemiological patterns and social-economic characteristics (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_MMFYfz8">burden and causes of diseases).</s><s xml:id="_syZjhNj">At stake are different institutional features of health services that limit intra and inter-profession relationships (also known as 'organizational cultures' or 'work environment') <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_V9k6CMK"><s xml:id="_c3cDqfs">Professional belonging speaks to profession-based impacts on the performance of work due to different compositions by age, gender, qualifications and income.</s><s xml:id="_JXD2FTF">The standpoint is that belonging to a certain profession is likely to influence the professionals' expectations and experiences with work-life balance, labour conditions, autonomy and accountability.</s><s xml:id="_AMR7ZJb">Although the studies on HRH migration often include different professional groups and generally report inconclusive results, reflections on these findings remain somewhat limited <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p></div>

to professional groups.</s><s xml:id="_42naXAx">One common trend is the importance of the available household income.</s><s xml:id="_j4zacxR">According to <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Glinos and

driven by better living conditions, meaning that income is the main drive for migration.</s><s xml:id="_vXhnr5S">The fact that our results show the same trend for all professional groups, including the better educated ones, and in a high-income country suggests that the relevance of family income is not specific to the southnorth migration and needs to be better understood in consolidated health systems.</s><s xml:id="_zZVsueR">One should not forget that the surveyed professionals work in the NHS and under relatively stable labour conditions.</s><s xml:id="_ekPJTHv">This result was already

that low and high educated health workers share a mismatch between their personal expectations and the labour conditions.</s><s xml:id="_eR2f9dN">In this sense, could this mismatch be a symptom that

drivers specific to professional groups, the evidence shows that differences exist between nurses and GPs.</s><s xml:id="_spKpQus">The main difference is the education factor.</s><s xml:id="_aJZ9jBa">Nurses with higher levels of education are more likely to emigrate, but this factor is not relevant for GPs.</s><s xml:id="_PNkTzMt">This result has been found before for hospital nurses, as nurses with a specialty degree were more likely to report intention to emigrate than others with standard qualification <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_NRuJwra"><s xml:id="_UAhp4kG">Working conditions and environment are factors that contribute to professional satisfaction, which has been found to influence the decision to emigrate in

with this trend.</s><s xml:id="_7GNa582">Both GPs and nurses have pointed out that their professional dissatisfaction was also encouraging them to emigrate.</s><s xml:id="_U77jhy8">Physicians and nurses may be sensitive to human interaction and may be trained to take care of others.</s><s xml:id="_hVAh4B2">So they may feel particularly dissatisfied with the working conditions and suffer from burnout due to the inability to respond well to patients' needs.</s><s xml:id="_yQzaErf">On the other hand, professional dissatisfaction among technicians and administrative staff is not such a clear driver for emigration, perhaps because these professionals do not feel such heavy pressure for taking care of others and so they are not so motivated by working conditions.</s></p><p xml:id="_Jy8TVzS"><s xml:id="_2ygemUb">We found that women are less likely to report the intention to emigrate in all professional categories except technicians, which is in accordance with other

xml:id="_2RZCxSv">In short, the added-value of this study is two-fold.</s><s xml:id="_j4G7nCt">First, it brings empirical evidence, supported by a large sample, on the 'push factors' in different health professions, which proves the need to adopt a nuanced understanding of the reasons underpinning professionals' intention to emigrate that brings to closer attention the role of professional belonging.</s><s xml:id="_jm3HBEs">Second, it proves the relevance of the theoretical assumptions underpinning the analytical model, as the 'push factors' cannot be assumed as if they are of an arbitrary nature in the professionals' intention to stay or leave.</s><s xml:id="_FPUj5ZA">Those contributions can help policy makers to design policies aimed at retaining professionals in a country that uses its own resources to create human capital for healthcare.</s></p><p xml:id="_gUn5Xam"><s xml:id="_J99HEJc">We tested this model in one health system and setting (primary health care) to better understand the role of professional belonging in the intention to emigrate.</s><s xml:id="_Acc4yV5">The application of this model in other settings and in other countries could contribute to expand of our knowledge on this topic.</s><s xml:id="_Qs9ZnU3">To develop the model in these directions, it is important not to forget the need to avoid institutional and political biases related to specific economic, political, social and epidemiological circumstances <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_25duPnq">Also important when testing the model in other countries is the inclusion of the Erasmus Program as another possible emigration driver.</s><s xml:id="_kKjePrw">Even though in Portugal it is little used by other than students and academic staff, its relevance in the decision to emigrate needs to be tested.</s><s xml:id="_k93jHs6">One limitation of the study emerges from the confidentiality of the participants' social-economic characterization.</s><s xml:id="_jmfqy7P">The list of characteristics does not include their nationality, which may be a relevant driver for migration, in particular, in Europe.</s><s xml:id="_pQhDFuf">Another limitation regards the possibly bias of respondents' decision to not complete the questionnaires.</s><s xml:id="_JCNHQCd">However, with a 46.4 % response rate, representing a sample size of 9,097 professionals, it provides a consistent picture of the primary healthcare professionals in mainland Portugal.</s><s xml:id="_vHrpqXF">Finally, since data obtained from the questionnaire were crosssectional, no direct or explicit causality can be inferred between independent variables and the intention to emigrate.</s><s xml:id="_2yZX2NC">In order to test causality, the questionnaire would need to be applied
