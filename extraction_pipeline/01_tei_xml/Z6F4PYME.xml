mobile phones can help people modify health behaviors. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref></s><s xml:id="_bZdj38P">2]<ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> Evidence is particularly strong for smoking cessation, where a recent Cochrane Review indicated that text-messaging smoking cessation programs increased long-term quit rates by 67% (relative risk = 1.67, 95% CI [1.46, 1.90]). <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s xml:id="_uUpsuW9">n line with this accumulating empirical evidence, mobile treatments for smoking cessation are being added as recommended treatments to clinical practice guidelines for smoking cessation. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s xml:id="_bhcrJQc">Globally, text-messaging programs for smoking cessation have emerged as an important tool in tobacco control efforts. <ref type="bibr">6</ref></s><s xml:id="_CJ2qUJX">Text-messaging programs for smoking cessation have been found to be cost-effective <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">7</ref> and scalable at a national level.</s><s xml:id="_47Ch6Q6">Indeed, current initiatives by the World Health Organization (WHO) such as "Be He@lthy, Be Mobile" are aimed at disseminating text-messaging programs globally.</s><s xml:id="_zhkGQX8">To date, the WHO has helped establish national text-messaging programs for smoking cessation in several countries, including Costa Rica, Tunisia and India. <ref type="bibr">6</ref></s><s xml:id="_Kv6qwff">ese early successes and strides towards dissemination notwithstanding, a knowledge gap exists regarding the mechanism by which text-messaging programs for smoking cessation confer their benefit.</s><s xml:id="_DBqKdk9">Such knowledge is critically important for two reasons.</s><s xml:id="_sQpSWQp">First, knowing how text-messaging smoking cessation programs work will help guide efforts to optimize existing programs.</s><s xml:id="_jkY3xuy">Second, given current efforts to promote the global dissemination of such programs, an understanding of the mechanisms of action would aid in selecting appropriate target countries for implementation.</s><s xml:id="_u3gpwsK">For example, if the primary mechanism by which these programs are found to work is through the promotion of the use of extra-programmatic services, then countries with weak infrastructures for tobacco treatment services would not be places where such programs would be expected to succeed.</s></p><p xml:id="_HakRB3N"><s xml:id="_qU3x8YN">To date, research on text-messaging programs for smoking cessation has primarily focused on assessing their efficacy.</s><s xml:id="_jmnWs8Y">In terms of mechanisms, research has been limited to descriptive accounts of the potentially underlying mechanisms of change.</s><s xml:id="_GUQMNAT">Based on these descriptions, we know that the majority of text-messaging programs for smoking cessation that have been studied have consisted of a series of automated and interactive text messages timed around a person's chosen quit date that guide the person through the process of smoking cessation.</s><s xml:id="_CPGScMw">Messages generally provide advice and tips about quitting smoking, as well as referrals to smoking cessation services outside of the text messaging program.</s><s xml:id="_ZCHMX7t">While messages are aimed at guiding the user through the quitting process, it is unclear what mechanism is responsible for the observed effects. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">8</ref></s><s xml:id="_gr6zdb3">ntent analyses of the effective program Txt2Stop 2 have shown that the vast majority of text messages focus on psychosocial processes, that is, constructs that capture the interplay between psychological and social factors (e.g., the confidence to abstain from smoking in a social situation, the experience of feeling social support for one's quit attempt).</s><s xml:id="_gEG9p6K">Specifically, results indicated that 97% of the 899 Txt2Stop text-messages sought to promote selfregulation (i.e., by promoting behavioral substitution or self-reward, etc.) and/or to enhance motivation (24%). <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">9</ref></s><s xml:id="_RuWUEwp">By contrast, only 2% of Text2Stop text-messages directly promoted the use of extra-programmatic, evidence-based treatments for smoking cessation such as nicotine replacement therapy (NRT), getting help from a clinician, or calling a quitline.</s><s xml:id="_vSR7Uwz">This content balance in Txt2Stop suggests that this program was largely designed to focus on psychosocial mechanisms of behavior change, in line with theoretical models of smoking cessation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">11</ref> and health behavior change. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">12</ref></s><s xml:id="_kX4sw9R">Nonetheless, as such programs are disseminated globally, it becomes important to examine the actual mechanisms by which text-messaging programs for smoking cessation confer benefit.</s></p><p xml:id="_CjjsUU8"><s xml:id="_DPnk7Fk">To fill this gap, this study examines the ways in which an effective text-messaging program for smoking cessation, Text2Quit, was able to help participants quit smoking. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> Specifically, we sought to determine the degree to which the observed benefit of the program was accounted for by changes in psychosocial variables that resulted from the program's quit smoking messaging or by the program's referral to extra-programmatic smoking cessation treatments and services.</s><s xml:id="_E8zgPrj">Specifically, our aim was to use a multiple mediation approach to determine the relative contribution of a priori theorized mechanisms of change in explaining the conferred benefit of Text2Quit on smoking cessation.</s></p></div>
