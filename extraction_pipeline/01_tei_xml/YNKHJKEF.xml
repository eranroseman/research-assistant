Martin, 1993)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_Ze3fRNC"><s xml:id="_XRqU4er">Attention therefore turned to identifying variables that might moderate framing effects and one factor to emerge was the perceived riskiness or function of the health behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Rothman &amp; Salovey, 1997)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_GyjwEG6">Rothman and Salovey proposed that people will be more responsive to a loss-framed message when the outcome of the decision to engage in a health behaviour involves some degree of uncertainty or risk, whereas they will be more responsive to a gain-framed message when the outcome is relatively certain or safe.</s><s xml:id="_FvWKvpC">This explanation was inspired by the framing postulate of Prospect Theory: People generally prefer risky options when losses are emphasized but prefer non-risky or safe options when gains are emphasized <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Tversky &amp; Kahneman, 1981)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_J8jRY5V">Consistent with this perspective Rothman and Salovey also argued that loss-framed appeals would be more effective in promoting illness detection behaviours (i.e., some risk of an unpleasant outcome), whereas gain-framed appeals would be more effective in promoting prevention behaviours (i.e., little risk of an unpleasant outcome).</s></p><p xml:id="_BceXKHe"><s xml:id="_jshw5kE">The distinction between prevention and detection behaviors has proven to be a relatively useful heuristic for understanding the impact of message framing, and the pattern of findings across studies is fairly consistent <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Rothman, Bartels, Wlaschin, &amp; Salovey, 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rothman &amp; Updegraff, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Rothman, Wlaschin, Bartels, Latimer, &amp; Salovey, 2008)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_Qb9vDR5"><s xml:id="_dg6ZAkv">However, recent meta-analyses of the framing literature have demonstrated that, although the persuasive advantages of loss-or gain-frames in detection or prevention contexts may be statistically significant, the effect sizes are very small and heterogeneous (O' <ref type="bibr">Keefe &amp; Jensen, 2006</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2007</ref><ref type="bibr">, 2009</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">, 2010)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_AKPAgDn"><s xml:id="_4ERh2vD">However, as noted by <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Myers (2010)</ref> and Latimer, Salovey, and <ref type="bibr">Rothman (2007)</ref>, these meta-analyses may underestimate the utility of gain-and loss-framed appeals because they did not sufficiently account for the heterogeneity found between studies.</s><s xml:id="_4qY6BBG">A number of factors might be important moderators.</s><s xml:id="_5Mh4tG2">For example, a recent meta-analysis by Gallagher and <ref type="bibr">Updegraff (in press</ref>) has shown that effect sizes are larger when measures of behaviour rather than attitudes or intentions have been used to assess the persuasive impact of framed messages.</s><s xml:id="_e3cRwMP">How the individual thinks and feels about the behaviour may also be important, and it has been argued that the effectiveness of framed appeals depends upon the fit between how a message is framed and the person or situation <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Rothman et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rothman &amp; Updegraff, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Rothman et al., 2008)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_U6MdEzR"><s xml:id="_fBkYBYn">A browse of the literature and reference to some recent narrative reviews highlights the fact that there is already a sizeable body of research that has investigated the role of a range of recipient characteristics in moderating framing effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Myers, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">Rothman et al., 2006;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rothman &amp; Updegraff, 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">Rothman et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xw2hZkF">Dispositional factors that have been investigated include, amongst others: individual differences in consideration of future consequences, issue involvement, need for cognition, approach-avoidance motivation, and regulatory focus.</s><s xml:id="_ZKkNBps">However, none of these narrative reviews have presented a comprehensive analysis and synthesis of these effects.</s><s xml:id="_X4Rvr2T">A more precise refinement of when and for whom gain-and loss-framed appeals will be most effective is therefore needed.</s><s xml:id="_2AW5GUq">The aim of this paper is to address this gap in the literature by reporting the findings of a systematic review of framing research that has tested the moderating effects of individual differences in recipients' dispositions and prior beliefs.</s><s xml:id="_7awjjpS">This systematic review therefore represents an approach to give an account of message framing effects from the perspective of the message recipient.</s></p></div>
