reinforced that teens are sensitive to certain language.</s><s xml:id="_JC6uhgy">For example, messages that used a more authoritarian tone (eg, ''You should'' or ''You need to'') were universally panned by youth, who stated messages should never contain these phrases and noted that ''kids don't like being told what to do.''</s><s xml:id="_bDs5FJJ">Comprehensible, accurate, and concise messages designed with participant input to support healthy lifestyle choices has been recommended as a single strategy to help shift dietary patterns to support optimal health outcomes. <ref type="bibr"

target="#b21">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">24</ref></s><s xml:id="_XVFA6j8">One method is to directly engage youth in iterative discussions about message design and delivery and involve

construction of messages designed to promote healthy lifestyle behaviors through a mobile device using a youth-participatory approach.</s><s xml:id="_S63D8bk">In a study focused on weight loss (rather than healthy lifestyle promotion), Woolford and colleagues explored obese adolescent participants' perspectives related to weight management messages, and they found enthusiasm for SMS as a strategy to support weight loss efforts among these participants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">22</ref></s><s xml:id="_yc48EFQ">Importantly, focus group findings from their study were similar to those of this study in that teen participants desired brief, positive, encouraging messages that had a ''natural'' tone and made specific reference to the teen demographic. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">22</ref></s><s xml:id="_4bCWusE">Also similar, Woolford's targeted tips (ie, SMS, which provided advice normed and pretested with youth) were particularly well received by teens, who

critical importance of formative research in the development and design of SMS messages targeted to youth populations.</s></p><p xml:id="_eXPUvay"><s xml:id="_vQC2fSV">Although overall, the informal, SMS-based approach appealed to youth, it remains unclear whether the messages, once received, will result in changes in diet and physical activity knowledge, attitudes, or behaviors.</s><s

identifying an appropriate delivery modality.</s><s xml:id="_fduMVA3">The next step will be to conduct an efficacy study to test the impact of different message ''doses'' and delivery methods on key health behaviors among adolescents.</s><s xml:id="_awywRkN">It is important to note that more broadly in the field of ''mhealth'' (ie, projects using mobile technologies for purposes of health), most

xml:id="_snD74QU"><s xml:id="_uXH8Krj">In addition to testing the effect of messages on health-related outcomes, several logistical challenges require careful consideration when this messaging intervention is implemented on a larger scale.</s><s xml:id="_m2ZzcBH">In this study, messages were manually pushed to participants using a free, Web-based software application or automatically sent using a preprogrammed, phonebased software application, and the participants carried a study-provided mobile device that included unlimited text messaging.</s><s xml:id="_pTcUCJq">A larger participant population would require a software program capable of automatically sending dozens or even hundreds of text messages simultaneously, while still retaining the interactivity that participants found desirable.</s><s xml:id="_VGa4MDC">An efficacy trial would also need to address the balance between the practical need to automate message delivery while still retaining the necessary level of engagement and interaction with participants.</s></p><p xml:id="_YB5NaHp"><s xml:id="_7NGxyxV">Further, rather than using studyprovided phones, participants must be willing and able to use their own mobile devices to receive study messages (ie, they must have no or few limitations on text messaging allowances).</s><s xml:id="_UfZngvs">Youth using their own mobile phones may be less tolerant toward receiving messages compared to youth who are supplied with a study phone.</s><s xml:id="_dkSueCU">Although there are data supporting widespread cell phone use and mobile device access among youth, a clearer picture of access across all demographic groups is not yet available.</s><s xml:id="_jKUJWGD">Indeed, in this study, initial data revealed that only 85% of youth had cell phones, and only 10% of those youth had smart phones.</s></p><p xml:id="_rV6w9xB"><s xml:id="_Jae6WzV">Although youth enrolled in the pilot study were provided with study mobile phones, reports of message sharing were not substantiated other than by self-report.</s><s xml:id="_5Nme5ZQ">Future studies should attempt to capture message sharing more reliably as both a quantitative measure (eg, number of times
