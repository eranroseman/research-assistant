<ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_R35DZ44">MOST establishes a process for continuous optimization of behavior change interventions by iteratively evaluating the efficacy of intervention components.</s><s xml:id="_mdtNhSt">There are many optimization designs that fit into the MOST process.</s><s xml:id="_xdFtU4N">For example, the factorial/ fractional factorial design provides a resource-efficient way of examining main effects of each intervention component within an intervention and the interaction effects among components <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_dGgtVCV">The sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) is a methodology that can test the decision rules within an adaptive intervention, when, for instance, there are non-responders to an initial intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EhwvkwP">A third class of experimental designs, which combines the logic of n-of-1 trials and factorial designs, is Bmicro-randomized^trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_pN8eHek">The micro-randomized trial is a sequential factorial design for modeling effectiveness of treatment components over time.</s><s xml:id="_t688fky">It can be used to test proximal main effects of components over time, time-varying moderation <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, and with variations in study design based on strategies from system identification, the development of idiographic computational models <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_23zz5Q2">These optimization methods provide concrete strategies to test behavioral intervention components and, particularly via the microrandomized study, support studying behavior change of individuals in context.</s></p><p xml:id="_fXj5U2d"><s xml:id="_V6j8jnk">Another interesting suggestion is to take advantage of the Bdisruptive innovation^process when developing evidence-based practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_bWMhxKt">The disruptive innovation process emphasizes the focus on providing simpler and less expensive alternatives to current practices that meet the essential need for the majority of users in order to make them more easily accessible, scalable, and replicable <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Xk85aET">For behavior change interventions, suggestions from this include better synthesizing and sharing of modules of complex interventions that work across interventions, utilization of a wider range of delivery options (e.g., digital health technologies), the use of marketing and branding to promote and disseminate evidence-based practices, and the adoption of a continuous optimization model of evaluation.</s><s xml:id="_kHHDMwp">These recommendations were offered in contrast to dissemination of complex interventions that implicitly segment evidence-based practices rather than facilitate knowledge accumulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zna5BKw">Indeed, Chorpita et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> have argued that the fundamental challenge in behavior change science may be an overemphasis on knowledge proliferation (i.e., the development of new treatments) at the cost of knowledge management (e.g., developing new ways to design, organize, and share existing resources) and thus suggest focusing more on algorithms to curate knowledge.</s></p><p xml:id="_w4Y4J56"><s xml:id="_fWfxdVf">From this work, we draw three insights: (1) development of evidence-based strategies for behavior change is iterative and involves Bongoing optimization^that carefully studies the Bfit^between individuals, context, and interventions for producing a desired outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>;</s></p><p xml:id="_3QnMDgy"><s xml:id="_HpKTJEc">(2) while complex interventions might be desired in practice, modules of complex interventions are plausibly more valuable for science; and (3) algorithms for supporting decisions about matching interventions and modules with specific individuals in context is a second valuable target product and could be useful for curation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_DutznAS">Agile software development</head><p xml:id="_sbMueZa"><s xml:id="_eznQ8Pz">These insights have interesting parallels to software development, particularly open-source software <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and Bagile,^which is a class of software development that emphasizes rapid iterative development in context <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tVcxg6N">For example, extreme programming (XP), which is one agile method <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, emphasizes well-specified modules that are shared early-and-often with relevant stakeholders when building complex multicomponent systems.</s><s xml:id="_JRpr3HN">Within software development, the basic structure of modules is that they have specific inputs, a process that utilizes these inputs to transform them in some way and then this process creates specific outputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_chn699F">For example, a group may be interested in developing a smartphone app to promote physical activity and, as part of this, may be interested in using steps data from a wearable sensor such as the Fitbit.</s><s xml:id="_vAqfamf">Based on this, one software module for this is a tool that allows data to be transferred between Fitbit and the researcher's app that only shares information that the participant wants to share and protects the rest of the information such as personally identifiable information.</s><s xml:id="_rqNrzgA">A module that supports part of this datasharing task while maintaining privacy is called BOAuth.^In</s><s xml:id="_AScyRdX">OAuth, the inputs include information from the individuals (e.g., personal information such as name, email, etc.) and permission from the individual to allow information to be shared to another entity (e.g., when logging into a website, it may ask for a Facebook login, which has your personal identifying information).</s><s xml:id="_ZBbtk8b">The OAuth process takes this information, generates a unique personal identification number for this individual, and then defines data that are sharable (e.g., steps data) versus not sharable between the systems (e.g., names, emails).</s><s xml:id="_SK2qTvU">The output of this process is a bridge for sharing only the information that a participant has agreed to share (i.e., a unique identifying number and way to link them to two separate software systems).</s><s xml:id="_DnKawKY">It is essential to note that while modules are often built initially for a specific use case, an advantage of software module structure is that the module is built to be self-contained and thus repurposable for any use case with the requisite inputs (e.g., personal identification information, permission) and desires the requisite output (e.g., a secure bridge to share data across systems).</s></p><p xml:id="_vaNegYm"><s xml:id="_7UH3q7h">To create these modules, XP uses software Bsprintst o create a Bminimal viable product^(MVP) that is released to target users <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7sraTSW">MVPs are the simplified modules that are designed to test assumptions about the module with relevant stakeholders <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NveXe7C">Returning to the OAuth example, an MVP style test of this could simply be akin to the sorts of de-identification strategies used in research (e.g., separating personally identifiable information into a separate database from the rest of the data).</s><s xml:id="_JQvupyT">This can then be used to test if privacy and sharing with other entities can be achieved prior to developing the software.</s><s xml:id="_6eg2Pr3">This testing of assumptions via MVP modules is achieved via Bsprints,^which involve a rapid cycle of identifying an assumption, building an MVP module to test the assumption, and then releasing the module to relevant stakeholders to test the assumption <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EKZQcNW">After each module achieves some meaningful criterion of success (e.g., privacy is maintained while still enabling sharing of data across systems to a satisfactory level for all stakeholders), the next module can then be targeted.</s><s xml:id="_EUEppDj">While planning occurs, particularly specification of the likely required modules that will be needed for the eventual full system <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, the process emphasizes flexibility and agility to accommodate changing requirements depending on feedback received after each sprint.</s></p><p xml:id="_wrU3dGN"><s xml:id="_naduePP">Software development provides insights on three strategies to incorporate into health behavior change science: (1) define the smallest, meaningful, self-contained, repurposable, and (ideally) interoperable modules of an intervention (e.g., a module of a dietary intervention might be a fruit and vegetable tracker) that are structured in an input, process, output format;</s></p><p xml:id="_vS9wzqC"><s xml:id="_gZWD4wc">(2) build a concrete version of the module to make visible the implicit assumptions about how the desired outcome (e.g., higher vegetable intake) will be achieved by the module to enable discussion between stakeholders (note, preferably a functioning

(2) as an BA/B^style test that is often used in the tech industry; and (3) as used in the Btrials of principles^ <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_myPYqCF">RCTs of complex interventions are the most logical method for establishing that a specific complex intervention will work for a specific target population.</s><s xml:id="_hfqqWeW">An investment in an RCT of a complex intervention is warranted whenever there is a large enough population that will use a standardized protocol over an extended period of time without updating the protocol.</s><s xml:id="_Azztzqd">For example, if a health maintenance organization plans to have two million individuals use a complex intervention, conducting an RCT with a representative sample is appropriate.</s></p><p xml:id="_JzcSDKm"><s xml:id="_rhGz8eN">The second use is A/B testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_c2SBsrS">In the digital technology industry, there is a common practice of comparing different versions (often two, hence A/B) of a given system.</s><s xml:id="_CFnkWrZ">The two versions represent different hypotheses on how the system might function and are often only subtly different.</s><s xml:id="_vjTQ4eR">For example, Bond et al. conducted a 61 million person A/B-style experiment on Facebook to explore how message framing might influence voting behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_V8qeQnX">There were three conditions: the information condition, which provided information about voting; the social condition, which included everything in the information condition and images of friends that voted; and a control group that did not receive any information.</s><s xml:id="_KXTTcNk">As this example illustrates, the A/B test uses the logic of an RCT but is focused on small differences.</s><s xml:id="_2NRbJHj">As such, it is more akin to the optimization methods discussed earlier.</s><s xml:id="_fsEfjha">The third use case for RCTs is the trials of principles, which emphasizes that in behavioral intervention technologies, it is common for a software to change over time but the general principle (e.g., using goal setting as a technique) does not.</s><s xml:id="_YZVnDFV">Within a Btrials of principlesR CT <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>, the focus is on ensuring the test is on those principles (i.e., the module constructs to use our labels in this paper), while allowing non-tested parts of the system not deemed principles to be updated over time.</s><s xml:id="_kfumYcN">In a trial of principles, heterogeneity between conditions is minimized with careful comparator selection and the method does not ignore technology changes.</s><s xml:id="_x6ES7yT">As such, it fits well with agile science within the evaluate phase.</s></p><p xml:id="_4ATFGyR"><s xml:id="_R3ky8g6">While the agile science process likely makes the most sense within digital health interventions, can it be applied to other intervention mediums?</s><s xml:id="_CsvgZnK">We believe it is quite plausible that the same process can work for other intervention modalities (e.g., face-to-face, group) and other types of complex problems (e.g., precision medications, public policy initiatives).</s><s xml:id="_z2ZzSZp">As with any scientific process, the essential requirement is replication with sound definitions, robust versioning control, and a process of rapidly sharing and curating that information.</s><s xml:id="_njjW43g">This is easier with software but can be difficult with other modalities.</s><s xml:id="_yfqVM8e">That said, striving toward better-specified operations and constructs, replication, and more efficient curation is possible with non-technology interventions.</s><s xml:id="_earR466">Behavioral science has many examples of carefully replicated experimental manipulations (e.g., careful specification of cognitive dissonance <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_HFZ2rVg">The major limitations are intervention specification to support replication, which is ideal for all sciences and effective curation as already pointed out by others <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s></p></div>

generate phase.</s><s xml:id="_q5jFNSH">The generate phase produces the contender operations and constructs and provides insights about real-world feasibility that then can be tested in the evaluate phase.</s><s xml:id="_Y8rZGHj">Previous work suggests early studies often test feasibility of methods (e.g., recruitment, randomization, retention, and assessment), not hypotheses <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_sHdy4GS">Other recommendations suggest a clear distinction between testing feasibility of the operations versus research methods <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_327xx8Q">Future work should be conducted to assess how the early-phase process could be adjusted to better enable the generation of multiple contender operations, initial filtering of these operations related to issues of feasibility, and careful, but plausibly separate, testing of the research methods themselves for a later trial, when that is appropriate.</s></p><p xml:id="_kTmKKkw"><s xml:id="_M5PBEYt">Further work is needed on devising resourceefficient experimental designs and statistical analyses for the generate phase, particularly to support decision making on if rigorous evaluation is warranted.</s><s xml:id="_RAGwfVn">For example, sequential n-of-1 trials could serve as a more efficient feasibility testing method by allowing for intervention adjustments after each series of trials <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">[55]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_CtFMyxp">From a human-participants perspective, microrandomization trials are very efficient and thus could also be used after more classic n-of-1 trials have provided enough confidence to warrant investment in the design of one <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_s7an4A9">In terms of statistics, a Bayesian approach might be more appropriate than Fisherian statistics <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref> as the Fisher approach is not appropriate with limited data <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Ue7zA3M">As demonstrated elsewhere, careful use of priors within studies of novel systems can be used to help mitigate problems with magnitude effect errors and thus could be a more appropriate statistical method for the generate phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_ZKz2BbG"><s xml:id="_RTXdUVm">With regard to idea generation and vetting, there are important cognitive biases that likely come into play that need to be better acknowledged in the generate phase.</s><s xml:id="_u2Q3NGE">For example, Dow and colleagues showed the possibility of developing better results through iteration <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref> and a subsequent study examined the differences between parallel and iterative development versus serial and iterative development <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_sYQRRj6">Results found that individuals randomized to work on multiple ideas at once (i.e., parallel group) had greater openness to incorporating feedback and also produced better end products compared to the single iterative concept group.</s><s xml:id="_WYGGeWG">Individuals in the single concept group were less open to feedback and instead often Bstayed the course.^This</s><s xml:id="_cH5sPXZ">stay the course observation is similar to the sunk cost bias <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, which is a well-known cognitive bias that suggests an individual will pursue a less desirable option even if a more desirable option becomes available because of the resources already invested.</s><s xml:id="_Nvp5FsP">The substantial fiscal and intellectual cost of the current research enterprise may make scientists prone to the sunk cost bias thus stymying changing course when it might be warranted.</s><s xml:id="_dmHXx9A">More rapid and parallel development could support both better defining of a construct and minimize the impact of the sunk cost bias, thus further reinforcing the value of earlyand-often sharing and developing multiple operations.</s></p><p xml:id="_WcMaGta"><s xml:id="_U4uzxg8">Finally, it is essential to continue exploring how the research enterprise might enable or stymy the creation and early-and-often sharing of products from science, particularly operations <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">60]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_bNChJSH">As suggested by Ioannidis, it is quite plausible that the current reward system for academics, particularly the currency (i.e., publications and grants), may be resulting in the unintended consequence of incentivizing the creation of only minimally useful products for real-world use.</s><s xml:id="_D9hq9GV">Further exploration on the impact of the design of the research enterprise is warranted that not only explores how to minimize bias (e.g., the sunk cost bias) but also articulates how the incentive structures of science can be better aligned to useful products for real-world use.</s><s xml:id="_fVmbcMx">For example, early-and-often sharing is not well incentivized in the current research enterprise, particularly the products from the generate phase.</s><s xml:id="_pKY5EVr">That said, it could very likely improve the scientific community's ability to create efficient accumulation of knowledge about behavior change.</s><s xml:id="_2KcRfRz">Future work should study incentives for academics that reinforce early-and-often sharing.</s><s xml:id="_7kGUK8J">In addition,
