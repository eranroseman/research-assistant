health disparities.</s><s xml:id="_XWjvbB8">In addition to examining types of diseases (e.g., cancer or cardiovascular disease), this approach includes added lenses involving sociodemographic domains

address the needs of socially disadvantaged groups.</s><s xml:id="_V3d3xDz">The Affordability Ladder Program (ALPS) tool proposed by Dahlgren and Whitehead provides a method to analyze options in health services from a public, demand-side perspective. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">35</ref></s><s xml:id="_dFedJDM">ALPS uses a step-by-step framework that begins with an identified health care need and then progresses toward a variety of `treatment paths' (i.e., no care, informal care, access to professional care, quality of professional care) while simultaneously considering the health and social consequences, burden of payment, and policy environment that correspond to each step.</s><s xml:id="_c5CqhHx">This approach, which allows study of health systems from an equity lens, offers opportunities to measure and evaluate how various populations experience myriad aspects of health care.</s></p><p xml:id="_DzWeGwT"><s xml:id="_sGK7eUb">The social determinants approach also involves defining "health disparities" in a way that engages people to become advocates for change.</s><s xml:id="_bnv74cT">Thus far, the public health community has used multiple definitions, underscoring the term's complexity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref> </s><s xml:id="_KZw3QNn">s the first group to offer an "official" definition for this term, the

among specific population groups in the United States." <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37</ref></s><s xml:id="_8kYrbvY">Another frequently used definition explains a health disparity as "the quantity that separates a group from a specified reference point on a particular measure of health." <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref></s><s xml:id="_T3FZTu5">Though accurate, these definitions employ dispassionate and technical language.</s><s xml:id="_Svmrnp4">Using instead the term "inequality" or the even more illustrative "inequity" moves us closer to the normative concept that differences in health are unjust, unnecessary, and unacceptable. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39</ref> </s><s xml:id="_n35mpzN">this regard, Braveman and Gruskin have

accountability to promote health equity.</s><s xml:id="_u5AG95F">As an example, the WHO CSDH's report uses the language of `inequities' as opposed to `inequalities' throughout the document. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref></s><s xml:id="_rkE38jt">Such framing efforts may better mobilize those involved in research, practice, and policy to join the public and the media in bridging the

the evidence of health inequities into practice requires focusing on research that bridges the gap between discovery and delivery.</s><s xml:id="_YFDPeDF">In the past, it was usually assumed that research results would somehow "trickle down" (i.e., "passive diffusion") without much attention paid to the exact mechanisms or the intended target audience (i.e., "research dissemination").</s><s xml:id="_SgDfVF5">In studying this conundrum, Glasgow, Emmons and others conclude that public health studies have, to date, focused largely on efficacy research-i.e., trials conducted in limited settings with strictly defined, homogenous samples and resource-intense, specialized intervention protocols, often with limited real-world application. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref><ref

tested in real-world settings with a broader audience.</s><s xml:id="_TUgRyAG">The disconnect between efficacy and effectiveness research needs special attention since challenges to adoption, implementation, and sustainability of interventions on a population level, particularly in resource-limited settings, raises issues about real-world limitations that can drive health inequities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42</ref></s><s xml:id="_9pxMKVW">The assumption is that when interventions are scaled up, it is likely that the benefits may accrue unequally across different SEP groups thus exacerbating disparities.</s></p><p xml:id="_5n34nnE"><s xml:id="_EvGEmTE">Moving from efficacy to effectiveness can build sustainability at the community level.</s><s xml:id="_Npb287v">To this end, Glasgow and others have recommended regular employment of the Reach, Effectiveness, Adoption, Implementation, and Maintenance (RE-AIM) model, illustrated in Table <ref type="table">1</ref>, to focus and evaluate public health research efforts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">45</ref> </s><s xml:id="_BrD2YjD">ffectiveness comes through brief, carefully constructed, and feasible interventions that public health workers can implement in multiple real-world settings.</s><s xml:id="_W9892P4">These efforts refocus on "research that is contextual, practical, and robust" and move public health toward sustained intervention effects at both the individual-and community-levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">44</ref> Translating results to influence public health practice and policy requires explicit attention to the real world challenges of implementation and "scaling up".</s><s xml:id="_4VYwRQ4">Kim and Gilks, for example, have emphasized scaling up as a key element to countering the AIDS epidemic worldwide (particularly within resource-poor settings), calling on researchers, practitioners, and policymakers to move beyond pilot projects, establish specific and time-limited targets, and accelerate momentum for expanding treatment access and adherence support. <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46</ref></s><s xml:id="_ZbTeuXy">The practice of implementation can, in turn, generate new research questions relevant to the realworld problems of health disparities.</s></p><p xml:id="_R8W2Wcj"><s xml:id="_ZvUdJKG">Novel methodologies and approaches must drive innovative research design and dissemination to benefit communities.</s><s xml:id="_CQRdmJy">One model deserving further attention involves community-based participatory
