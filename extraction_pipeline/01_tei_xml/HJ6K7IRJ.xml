posits that an autonomy-supportive health care environment, individual inclination toward autonomy, and internal and external life goals affect the satisfaction of the three basic psychological needs, contributing to the maintenance of physical and mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_snJKHJj">Among these, while individual inclination toward autonomy and internal
