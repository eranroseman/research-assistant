one or two are not enough.</s></p><p xml:id="_AZpDzGH"><s xml:id="_QqBZxuC">Functionally, we expect to observe optimal development and well-being under facilitating conditions that support need satisfaction, and to observe degradation or ill-being under conditions that thwart basic need satisfaction.</s><s xml:id="_eWCBRp4">Just as one can conclude that plants need water by noting that they flourish when they are hydrated but that impoverished growth and, ultimately, a breakdown of integrity results when they are systematically deprived of water, SDT maintains that a psychological need can be identified by observing that positive psychological consequences results from conditions that allow its satisfaction and negative consequences accrue in situations that thwart it.</s><s xml:id="_k4W58DZ">Accordingly, if motives or goals were not linked di-rectly to basic needs, their fulfillment versus thwarting would not be expected to result invariantly in the enhancement versus diminishment of growth and well-being.</s></p><p xml:id="_8H3a3Ze"><s xml:id="_5SvtcY3">Our definition is congruent with Hullian thought in that both approaches specify a set of innate or essential nutriments and with Murray's personologic approach in that his and ours focus at the psychological level, but our approach is quite different from those previous traditions because it is embedded in an organismic-dialectical metatheory.</s><s xml:id="_xAmnckV">Accordingly, as we will show, the concept is used to address different issues and to provide different types of interpretations.</s></p><p xml:id="_RecNdSa"><s xml:id="_6tqTctF">The organismic dialectic.</s><s xml:id="_CaMCEK5">The starting point for SDT is the postulate that humans are active, growth-oriented organisms who are naturally inclined toward integration of their psychic elements into a unified sense of self and integration of themselves into larger social structures.</s><s xml:id="_BK8BRpN">In other words, SDT suggests that it is part of the adaptive design of the human organism to engage interesting activities, to exercise capacities, to pursue connectedness in social groups, and to integrate intrapsychic and interpersonal experiences into a relative unity.</s></p><p xml:id="_tkmsQAa"><s xml:id="_MFByuey">Our organismic-dialectical perspective further proposes that these natural organismic activities and the integrative propensities that coordinate them require fundamental nutriments-namely, ambient supports for experiencing competence, relatedness, and autonomy.</s><s xml:id="_pTBhFME">As such, the natural processes such as intrinsic motivation, integration of extrinsic regulations, and movement toward well-being are theorized to operate optimally only to the extent that the nutriments are immediately present, or, alternatively, to the extent that the individual has sufficient inner resources to find or construct the necessary nourishment.</s><s xml:id="_T7nXqfr">To the degree that these organismic processes are hindered by nonfavorable conditions-specifically when one's context is excessively controlling, overchallenging, or rejecting-they will, to that degree, be supplanted by alternative, often defensive or self-protective processes, which no doubt also have functional utility under nonsupportive circumstances.</s><s xml:id="_xZrDPYS">Such processes would include, for example, the capacity to compartmentalize rather than integrate psychological structures, the tendency to withdraw concern for others and focus on oneself, or, in more extreme cases, to engage in psychological withdrawal or antisocial activity as compensatory motives for unfulfilled needs.</s></p><p xml:id="_xpHyYxx"><s xml:id="_fYavcgr">Accordingly, innate psychological needs for competence, relatedness, and autonomy concern the deep structure of the human psyche, for they refer to innate and life-span tendencies toward achieving effectiveness, connectedness, and coherence.</s><s xml:id="_XtM4bBe">The presence versus absence of environmental conditions that allow satisfaction of these basic needs-in people's immediate situations and in their developmental histories-is thus a key predictor of whether or not people will display vitality and mental health.</s><s xml:id="_VRTv5qT">As we argue later, the existence of these basic psychological needs and their phenomenological salience appear to yield considerable adaptive advantage at the level of individual and group selection <ref type="bibr" target="#b171">(Ryan, Kuhl, &amp;

Ryan, 1980)</ref>, for it is success at optimally challenging tasks that allows people to feel a true sense of competence.</s></p><p xml:id="_NfddYXU"><s xml:id="_MFuDxzk">Another area of correspondence between the two theories is the importance both place on phenomenology.</s><s xml:id="_JkdvsRw">As <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Csikszentmihalyi (1990)</ref> pointed out, although many theories focus on distal causes of motivation, his own focus is on the proximal causes of motivation, so his emphasis is on the inherent satisfaction or enjoyment that accompanies efficacious action.</s><s xml:id="_JCSrYQx">The view that being competent at challenging activities yields enjoyment is, of course, quite different from that of the theories in which competent engagement with challenging activities is valued only because of its instrumentality for incentives or other desired outcomes.</s></p><p xml:id="_BhhjFBJ"><s xml:id="_v3afqMK">Accordingly, Csikszentmihalyi's idea of a phenomenal experience being a sufficient reason for action is quite consistent with SDT, and specifically with our focus on the functional significance of events as a determinant of motivation <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Deci &amp; Ryan, 1985b)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_DYX89he"><s xml:id="_zMVnJga">Despite these and other points of convergence, there are several interesting points of divergence.</s><s xml:id="_Nbwx2Uj">Perhaps the most important is that flow theory does not have a formal concept of autonomy, instead basing intrinsic motivation only in optimal challenge (which, as a concept, is relevant primarily to competence rather than autonomy).</s><s xml:id="_A8NfRGd">SDT, on the other hand, has always maintained that even optimal challenges will not engender intrinsic motivation or flow unless people experience themselves as autonomous in carrying them out-that is, unless the behaviors have an I-PLOC.</s><s xml:id="_NrwfeGG">Although Csikszentmihalyi has at times referred to the idea of autonomy, it has not been represented as a formal element in the theory.</s></p><p xml:id="_7Usz8zk"><s xml:id="_dKukQM5">Another difference concerns the relevance of the needs concept itself.</s><s xml:id="_vGAB6gp">As we understand it, flow theory does not endorse the idea of a need for competence (or, obviously, a need for autonomy), instead viewing the concept of needs as a distal explanation that is not needed.</s><s xml:id="_8DJ7fme">As emphasized throughout this article, however, the concept of needs is a central unifying basis for SDT's explanations and interpretations, and we argue that it serves effectively to specify the contexts in which optimal challenges will and will not lead to flow and to the vitality that accompanies it.</s><s xml:id="_hdHcAGE">It is for this reason, we believe, that flow theory, although it provides an account of intrinsic motivation, has not been invoked in the literatures concerning, for example, the potential undermining effects of rewards or controlling environments on intrinsic motivation.</s><s xml:id="_re5V3j6">An exclusive focus on optimal challenge cannot address the dimension of perceived locus of causality.</s></p><p xml:id="_EyqSR4z"><s xml:id="_BURkZyB">Additional points of divergence fall primarily in the category of phenomena and processes that are contained in SDT but are not well addressed by flow theory.</s><s xml:id="_ujYsbEp">For example, flow theory does not deal with more versus less volitional forms of extrinsic motivation that result from the degree to which external regulations have been internalized and integrated with the self.</s></p><p xml:id="_7TuHZNP"><s xml:id="_86Hz7BN">This is particularly at issue when flow theory gets extended to the problem of cultural change and variation (see, e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Inghilleri, 1999)</ref>, which in our view is a problem that necessitates a consideration of the need for relatedness and the concept of internalization, as well as the concepts of challenge and flow.</s><s xml:id="_pXcG2F7">To their credit <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">Csikszentmihalyi and Massimini (1985)</ref> were among the earliest theorists to use a psychological viewpoint in attempting to account for cultural transmission and the survival of memes, and our critique of that work <ref type="bibr">(Ryan &amp; Deci, 1985)</ref> was not so much pointing to errors of commission as it was suggesting that flow does not, by itself, provide a satisfactory account of how cultures pass on nonintrinsically motivated practices and values.</s><s xml:id="_UHvUvSW">The dynamics of integration, as manifest in internalization of extrinsic motivation, must be considered to deal effectively with this problem <ref type="bibr" target="#b161">(Ryan, 1995)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_tkT6qjh"><s xml:id="_UepecSg">In sum, although the theoretical convergence is considerable, we believe that a consideration of the needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness would allow a fuller account of flow and would provide a basis for addressing phenomena such as internalization and volition that have been only in the peripheral vision of flow theory.</s></p></div>

Patrick, 1996)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_nFB67he">Much of this work has been done in the attachment framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Ainsworth et al., 1978;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b187">Shaver, Hazan, &amp; Bradshaw, 1988)</ref>, although there have been many other approaches as well (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Blais et al., 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b158">Rusbult &amp; van Lange, 1996)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EwppVtY">The attachment framework in particular posits that the relationships between infants and their primary caregivers has become the prototypes for subsequent relationships with others and that secure attachments with caregivers are crucial for establishing healthy relationships in later life and for experiencing health and well-being more generally.</s><s xml:id="_aqxdcRb">Although most attachment researchers do not typically discuss people's having an innate need for relatedness, the early formulations <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Bowlby, 1958)</ref> did assume a fundamental need for close connections with others, and the recent formulations have the idea of a need for relatedness as an implicit aspect.</s><s xml:id="_KVaDTUJ">Further, the findings that proximity seeking appears to be universal and to lead to ill-being when thwarted are wholly consistent with the idea of a need for relatedness.</s></p><p xml:id="_N4Xq7qJ"><s xml:id="_JZwRddc">As noted, in SDT, which assumes innate needs, the central individual difference concept is not need strength but rather is causality orientations that are assumed to be developmental outcomes resulting from an interaction between individuals' needs and the social context that supports versus thwarts them.</s><s xml:id="_CvMT3Eu">In a parallel fashion, in attachment theory, the central individual difference concept is not the strength of people's need to be attached (everyone is assumed to have this propensity) but rather is attachment styles that are theorized to result from an interaction between children's attempts to be related and the nature of the social context (i.e., caregivers) that supports versus thwarts those attempts.</s></p><p xml:id="_5DsJyYa"><s xml:id="_XCn6KEY">Thus, the self-determination and attachment approaches use individual differences in regulatory or interactive styles to predict behavior, affect, and well-being, and because these styles are outcomes of the developmental interaction between people's innate needs and the degree to which the social environment allows their satisfaction, different styles in each approach can be viewed as a central predictor of the individuals' well-being.</s><s xml:id="_MddYvJ6">Within self-determination theory, a strong autonomy orientation has been found to be strongly associated with psychological health, and within attachment theory, a secure attachment style has similarly been associated with strong psychological health.</s></p><p xml:id="_yUq6Sjw"><s xml:id="_qzZBwpe">There is, however, one important issue around which attachment theory and SDT differ, and that concerns the proximal causes of insecurity versus security-that is, of one's sense of relatedness-in social interactions.</s><s xml:id="_W3Qs6zz">Attachment theory has traditionally emphasized that people's attachment styles (working models) are developed in interactions with primary caregivers and show a high degree of stability over time and generality across partners.</s><s xml:id="_UgGYDCb">SDT's approach, however, gives more emphasis to the immediate social context.</s><s xml:id="_CnDXkHy">Although we believe that security versus insecurity in a particular relationship is influenced by early or distal models, we also consider proximal supports for basic psychological needs in any relationship to play a crucial role in predicting feelings of attachment in that relationship.</s><s xml:id="_4H8Fepb">Thus, we argue, people show significant within-person variations in attachment security across relationships, and this variation is a direct function of the partners' responsiveness to and support of the person's basic psychological needs.</s></p><p xml:id="_bP3nDq4"><s xml:id="_wH2vumt">In support of this view, La Guardia, Ryan, Couchman, and <ref type="bibr">Deci (2000)</ref> recently used a hierarchical linear modelling approach to examine betweenand within-person variations in attachment style.</s><s xml:id="_gtq5PN9">Remarkably, when looking across multiple attachment figures, considerably less than one-half the variation in attachment scores was attributable to the typically studied between-person differences in security of attachment.</s><s xml:id="_teMhwdc">People showed substantial variability in their attachment styles to mothers, fathers, romantic partners, and best friends, for example, and this within-person variability in security was shown to be a function of the degree to which the various social partners were responsive to the individuals' needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness.</s><s xml:id="_vncS5rf">Thus, even given individual differences due to early caregiver effects, people fluctuate in attachment styles as they move among more or less nurturant social partners.</s></p></div>

(b) facilitate the internalization and integration of extrinsic motivation resulting in more autonomous motivational or regulatory orientations; and (c) promote or strengthen aspirations or life goals that ongoingly provide satisfaction of the basic needs.</s><s xml:id="_kyJsw5p">In turn, intrinsic motivation, autonomous regulation of extrinsic motivation, and intrinsic aspirations were associated with positive affective experiences; high-quality performance, particularly on heuristic activities; maintained change of healthy behaving; and better mental health.</s><s xml:id="_fpY7yEU">The findings appeared with respect to persons (i.e., individual difference) and contexts (i.e., differences in the quality of the social environment).</s><s xml:id="_NTP3DCW">Conversely, research showed that the frustration of basic needs was associated with less intrinsic motivation, more controlled regulation and amotivation, and stronger extrinsic aspirations, which in turn lead to diminished experience, performance, and wellness.</s></p><p xml:id="_YvE2V2u"><s xml:id="_ggwdtQq">Specification of the basic psychological needs for competence, relatedness, and autonomy has thus allowed us not only to explain specific phenomena but has provided a framework for integrating these findings and for deriving additional diverse hypotheses.</s><s xml:id="_9MCRPq9">This framework, which is built upon the dialectical relation between people, as innately active organisms, and the social environment in which they attempt to satisfy their basic needs, suggests that the degree of basic psychological need satisfaction influences development, performance, and well-being.</s><s xml:id="_X8ucAfc">In short, needs specify the conditions under which people can most fully realize their human potentials.</s></p></div>
