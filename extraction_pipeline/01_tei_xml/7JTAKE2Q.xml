growth as wearables and medical devices converge to monitor personal health in realtime, including cardiovascular health measures <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_CJ4sZ28">Consumers can now access a personalised medical data report through these devices, which could prove useful in preventing and treating diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8qbBtJJ">The rise of smartwatches has empowered numerous patients to actively engage in self-care and advocate for the health of others.</s><s xml:id="_n9MZSHP">With the increasing prevalence of these individuals, known as 'e-patients' , it is imperative for medical institutions to adequately educate their students on effectively collaborating with and providing healthcare services to them.</s><s xml:id="_TKcBPzZ">Failing to do so could potentially jeopardise patients' lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_jfpCbb6">Similar to the access to online tools that smartwatches provide for medical schools and students, access to e-patients is also increasing.</s><s xml:id="_SR7VXn5">Mobile decision support tools, for example, use simple graphics to communicate calculator results (such as the Framingham Risk Score) in a way that is relevant to both the learner and the patient <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_jUPRwPN"><s xml:id="_Ut27FVv">The Framingham Risk Score is an algorithm designed to assess the probability of developing cardiovascular disease over a period of 10 years <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zWN9g8U">Initially focused on coronary heart disease, it was expanded in 2008 to encompass cerebrovascular events, peripheral artery disease, and heart failure.</s><s xml:id="_zQrpYXA">Considering variables such as age, sex, blood pressure levels, cholesterol levels, smoking status, and diabetes status, this risk score applies specifically to individuals aged between 30-79 without any previous history of CVD <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tUQSEHw">There are many apps explicitly aimed at patients, including simple medical calculators, e.g.</s><s xml:id="_NpXcrgW">BMI calculators, risk calculators, medication reminders, pharmacy finders and even diagnostic tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_htxkqTH">As many patients are unable to communicate their condition to their companions or medical staff, these smart tools will help caregivers be more alert and apply more appropriate comfort measures.</s><s xml:id="_gFbMG4R">The notion of comfort measures has gained significant attention in both nursing and medical literature, reflecting a systematic approach that entails proactive engagement as well as thoughtful restraint <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wYFXZ6Y">These measures can range from the simplest to more intricate interventions, all serving to provide supportive care.</s><s xml:id="_raY4G3V">Importantly, they are applicable across various healthcare settings and warrant careful consideration within the clinical management of patients burdened with multiple chronic comorbidities <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_qMefJVP"><s xml:id="_x5S3pJX">The FDA has approved clinical smartwatches for detecting medically significant events and recording and processing data <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wF8GH2d">There are no approved directly addressed smartwatches in the European Union (EU).</s><s xml:id="_byq95GP">However, to comply with EU regulations, smartwatch manufacturers must navigate through various frameworks such as the Radio Equipment Directive 2014/53/ EU and Medical Device Regulation 2017/745.</s><s xml:id="_7PcBtvE">These regulations emphasize safety standards and touch upon essential aspects like electromagnetic compatibility and efficient radio spectrum utilization <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_E59pne2"><s xml:id="_2USKaKY">Smartwatches often come with advanced features like a heart rate monitor.</s><s xml:id="_5zmWEUs">These high-tech devices utilize a technique called photoplethysmography to accurately measure the user's heart rate.</s><s xml:id="_fwzBuJJ">By utilizing light beams and specialized sensors on the smartwatch, changes in blood volume flowing through the wrist can be precisely quantified.</s><s xml:id="_hVxmDCb">This process generates a PPG waveform that provides valuable data for determining an individual's heart rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EkRkuxD">One instance where this technology proves beneficial is when an epilepsy patient wears a smartwatch equipped with an artificial intelligence (AI) algorithm capable of identifying high-risk seizures and initiating human assistance promptly <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ecYfNzp">This particular smartwatch provides physiological data to monitor vital signs and issues alerts that help save lives, as attending a seizure is associated with a lower rate of severe injury and death <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_sHMZfQd">Other wearable devices run algorithms that detect conditions such as atrial fibrillation or medically necessary conditions where early intervention can positively impact the quality of life.</s><s xml:id="_nAyfAa9">Researchers have shown that wearable biomarkers are more accurate at predicting blood and urine measurements than two vital signs in the clinic.</s><s xml:id="_M6scTwN">They can provide clinicians with predictions from thousands of measurements in a fraction of the time it takes to measure a single vital sign <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3RWyqQZ">It is important to note that these smartwatches are based on algorithmic interpretations of clinical outcomes, and their predictive power ultimately depends on the support and strength of their algorithms <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_k4hnr94">In this review, we discuss the applications of these wearable devices to patient health and HealthWorks' educational initiatives.</s><s xml:id="_5q4V5NS">This article seeks to answer several questions, including whether smartwatches can be trusted for clinical measurements and what might facilitate the development of trust in these devices.</s></p></div>
