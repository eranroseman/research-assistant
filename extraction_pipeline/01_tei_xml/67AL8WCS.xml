pregnant women, depending on the population and criteria used <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_cNWpkCk">Although glucose tolerance usually returns to normal post-partum, the long-term risk of developing diabetes is around 50%, and women who have GDM are 6-10 times more likely to do so than women who did not have GDM in pregnancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_cP6VZvn"><s xml:id="_DZkn7Ye">It has been demonstrated in the Diabetes Prevention Program, that with intensive lifestyle intervention focusing on diet, physical activity and weight, diabetes can be prevented among people with impaired glucose, including women who have had GDM in the past <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_6AMcwfP">There have also been trials involving women immediately after GDM pregnancy.</s><s xml:id="_gYz4QrW">These have generally applied DPP style lifestyle modification programs with life coaches, dietitians and exercise trainers <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Kfx7ZDX">Such intensive structured lifestyle post-partum interventions however are not practical for many women at this busy time of their lives, and widespread implementation is challenging for health systems.</s></p><p xml:id="_pkHHtr3"><s xml:id="_WCUqa4A">Earlier studies utilising technology to encourage increased physical activity after GDM have used pedometers and web-based support as part of their program <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_BFKjRAG">There is now much interest in applying newer technologies such as programmed text messaging and activity monitors in health care, either to facilitate management of specific conditions, or to encourage healthier lifestyles.</s><s xml:id="_aXFDWMg">These digital technologies offer the opportunity to deliver healthy lifestyle interventions at the population level and are an alternative to intensive face-to-face programs.</s><s xml:id="_RQmxvpt">They are potentially very suitable for the younger population of women with GDM who are generally familiar with this technology.</s></p><p xml:id="_d7WsnZY"><s xml:id="_EHPBGVc">Text

xml:id="_8JWSDyH">Recently there has been rapid advancement and uptake of wearable technologies.</s><s xml:id="_7VPEeBa">At the most basic level, these offer a convenient method of quantifying physical activity in terms of steps taken, but they also offer feedback and motivation and therefore could be an enabler of increased physical activity.</s><s xml:id="_7cGWGAc">A systematic review of 17 studies applying wearable activity monitor interventions, including pedometers, found that when these are offered as passive interventions, where the user did not also receive any other support, they were not effective in promoting behaviour change <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_spMDknc">It is when wearable activity monitors were paired with behavioural change techniques (such as counseling, goal setting, motivational phone calls, text messaging or incentives), that studies have demonstrated improvements in physical activity or weight management <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_JDSKDd8"><s xml:id="_tN2snyq">We have recently investigated the combined use of text messaging and smart phone linked wearable technology, as part of a program to reduce diabetes risk after GDM <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_dddyst5">Smart Mums with Smart Phones was a pilot randomised controlled trial which recruited 60 women with GDM with the aim of promoting healthy diet, physical activity and weight management in the 9 months post-partum.</s><s xml:id="_pu7n2Ys">Intervention subjects received an activity monitor and lifestyle text messages, beginning shortly after delivery, and continuing for 8-9 months post-partum.</s><s xml:id="_pnUN2gD">Every week, the subjects received 4 text messages providing motivation, reminders, information and feedback, to encourage a healthier lifestyle.</s><s xml:id="_XMpBYzP">One of these messages gave the subject a weekly step target, calculated from data recorded on their activity monitor, using an adaptive step algorithm.</s><s xml:id="_aVzcax9">As the control subjects were not given activity monitors, the physical activity outcome was assessed by a questionnaire and one week blinded wearing of a pedometer.</s><s xml:id="_jujg4YJ">There was a trend towards a greater weekly pedometer step count the intervention subjects, and increased weekly activity time but this was not significant.</s><s xml:id="_zn6GXCW">It therefore remains unclear if text messaging has an effect on physical activity in this population.</s></p><p xml:id="_UCTmppD"><s xml:id="_rMCCem6">To inform the further design of the Smart Mums program, we undertook a sub-study to examine whether the receipt of a text message, and more specifically a text message related to physical activity, results in an immediate response with increased physical activity, as determined by data from the activity monitor.</s><s xml:id="_BGx8AfN">This information builds knowledge about the efficacy of text messages as a tool to prompt adoption of PA in this population, by examining the magnitude of changes in PA behaviour following receipt of the messages, and whether this is

testing the effectiveness of a program promoting healthy lifestyle after GDM, through text messaging supplemented with activity monitors.</s><s xml:id="_EjaTqxU">We have made the novel observation that customised and personalised text messages which provide motivation, feedback, information and reminders, have an immediate effect on step count.</s></p><p xml:id="_X3QtgeE"><s xml:id="_c22fKgN">Several recent studies have examined the effect of text messaging on daily step count in conjunction with real time data from activity monitors.</s><s xml:id="_WMgqUX6">One study, conducted among patients in an ambulatory cardiology centre, found that 3 daily text messages encouraging attainment of a step target and supporting cardiovascular knowledge increased daily step count by 2500 over a period of 2 weeks, compared to patients who did not receive text messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_MhUZPCh">A study using a similar protocol, among patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension, found that the intervention increased step count by about 1400 steps a day, over 12 weeks compared to subjects who did not receive text messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DrGQFZX">A study conducted among university students, linked phone pedometer data with motivational and feedback messages.</s><s xml:id="_guK4anV">This study found that the messages increased daily step count by 729 steps, with the motivational messages being more effective, but the effect diminished over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wqPj3xS">However there are also studies which have failed to show an increase in physical activity with a program of pedometer linked text messaging <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_zASm3Fg"><s xml:id="_m3KvxDt">The above studies have focused on daily step counts, there are no previous studies which have examined the immediate effect of a physical activity or healthy lifestyle text message on step count.</s><s xml:id="_CPxWZTA">There is therefore a gap in the understanding of the temporal effect of text messages, in terms of a direct relationship, and the magnitude and durability of behaviour change that these elicit.</s><s xml:id="_bJXp5yJ">In our Smart Mums with Smart Phones pilot study, we utilised activity monitor data to set weekly step targets conveyed by text messaging, and also sent 3 other text messages encouraging healthy lifestyle, including physical activity.</s><s xml:id="_2xjUUY5">In this randomised controlled trial, we did not see a significant difference in daily step count in the final week of the study, as measured by blinded pedometer, or in physical activity as measured by questionnaire among intervention subjects, compared to control subjects.</s><s xml:id="_zSK4J9h">As the control subjects did not wear activity monitors, we are unable to assess the effectiveness of the text messages on activity monitor recorded steps as part of the randomised controlled trial.</s><s xml:id="_mV8c5BN">However, as we have demonstrated for an individual, the text messages elicited an immediate physical activity response.</s><s xml:id="_nPUVvx9">This suggests that an activity monitor based text messaging program may be effective in increasing physical activity amongst women who have recently had GDM.</s></p><p xml:id="_wWBFU9R"><s xml:id="_kvV3cj2">In our study, the effect of increasing step count was not limited to the physical activity related messages.</s><s xml:id="_nAgbSn7">This suggests that the message content is less important than the effect of the text as a cue or reminder.</s><s xml:id="_dmvmhEU">It is possible that activity monitor related feedback messages (or some other aspect of the intervention) supraliminally primed the subject to respond to other text messages from the program with increased physical activity, serving as a situated conceptualisation <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mVWMDFf">Once this situated  conceptualisation has been activated, the text messages, whether related to physical activity or not, were motivational cues to start walking <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3zx85VQ">This is analogous to situational prompts which have previously been demonstrated to increase stair use <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EjXtPRC">In this regard, having positive healthy lifestyle messages, as utilised in our study, have been shown to be much more effective than negative cues <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_CUTdYmT"><s xml:id="_4dYKA7W">One study has demonstrated that personalised text messages encouraging physical activity increased the duration and rate of walking over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zzpVk98">However another has shown that the effect of text messaging on step count was attenuated over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fZwyShY">In our study, the immediate effect of the messages on step count was sustained over the 36-38 weeks of the intervention program.</s><s xml:id="_xUXYDfx">In fact, the effect of the messages on step count was less in the first 60 days of the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_mAY4jHK">One potential reason for this is that this is the period immediate postpartum, where the demands on the mother may have been the greatest and most stressful, with physical activity being of a lower priority.</s></p><p xml:id="_5JYxRtj"><s xml:id="_g3u27qQ">There are some limitations to our substudy.</s><s xml:id="_pudsxWX">There were many days where there was incomplete or absent activity monitor data.</s><s xml:id="_Hwg6jjR">It is possible that women who are responsive to the text messages were more likely to utilise their activity monitors regularly.</s><s xml:id="_uHWwqJZ">It is also possible that the receipt of a text message may prompt the woman to wear her activity monitor, so that more steps are then recorded after the message.</s><s xml:id="_VBGzkHy">If this is the case, it is still a beneficial effect.</s><s xml:id="_a66fRHW">We do not have the means to determine if the text messages were actually read.</s><s xml:id="_zfUFhYt">However in our poststudy survey 23/25 subjects who responded found the texts useful <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, suggesting that at least a sizeable proportion of the messages were read.</s><s xml:id="_HecQUSQ">The physical activity messages were sent on fixed days, and we cannot exclude the possibility that these might be days that the women would have been more active independent of the messages, though this seems unlikely.</s><s xml:id="_P6KkXkd">We had also compared the day of messaging against weekends, and the effect was present irrespective of the comparator day.</s><s xml:id="_ZZxpMD2">We are currently conducting a similar study with a planned recruitment of 180 women <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_QFUCc3Z">The larger sample size will facilitate validation of the findings of the current study.</s></p><p xml:id="_CajV8yM"><s xml:id="_raagdUG">In summary, we have found that positive text messages promoting physical activity and healthy diet, and which provide supportive messages for the mother, elicit an immediate increase in physical activity over the ensuing 4 h.</s><s xml:id="_3zRFe84">The effect was not limited to messages related to physical activity, and was sustained over a period of 6 months.</s><s xml:id="_bNhSHUg">The combined use of text messages and activity monitors may be an effective mechanism to increase physical activity in a post-gestational diabetes healthy lifestyle program.</s><s xml:id="_sWWAhVS">There are no similar data for other at risk populations, but we are optimistic that text messages would have similar immediate effects on other groups, particularly if there are not the demands of new motherhood, and this warrants exploration.</s></p></div><figure
