investigated technology's roles in supporting parents or ADHD children (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>), but more rarely involving both as users for cooperative care in the same system <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_Vvt7uHg"><s xml:id="_T2TpaCp">Positive reinforcement strategies are cornerstones of many

behaviors in others (e.g., parent's co-regulation), they can promote extrinsic motivation to do tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SzYCqFU">In particular, people often use "token economies" as positive reinforcement strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref> to motivate children through rewards for achieved goals, such as to organize bedtime routines <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref> or incentivize physical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_PqQvYQc">However, challenges remain in supporting co-regulation beyond specifc routines taking place in settings in which children and adults are co-located, allowing for quick and relatively straightforward verifcation of goal completion.</s><s xml:id="_cq7He3v">Interactive technologies provide an opportunity for positive reinforcement to support ADHD children and their parents in collaboration around co-regulation as they navigate lived experiences in multiple routines and contexts.</s></p><p xml:id="_jYCDmJd"><s xml:id="_WtfA2Na">In this work, we examine the utility of smartwatches as a delivery platform for behavior support with

type="bibr" target="#b96">97]</ref>, a variety of mobile technology interventions show promise to promote cognition, social-emotional skills, behavior management, organizational skills, etc. (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">94]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_TXyEMHh">Smartwatches

caregivers, Cibrian et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> identifed that smartwatches can potentially mediate positive reinforcement strategies to support gradual autonomous and independent engagement for ADHD children.</s><s xml:id="_9DKjdPb">Such an approach can be scafolded to support co-regulation with a caregiver and gradually decrease the caregiver's involvement.</s><s xml:id="_rNzfFhN">Although this prior work suggests that smartwatch-based strategies could help families co-regulate, we have limited understanding of how families might practically experience or perceive these technologies in their everyday lives.</s><s xml:id="_7ZdDx8T">Gaining such understanding can provide important insights into the utility of the overall smartwatch mediated strategy and how it should be designed.</s></p><p xml:id="_3BDhZsB"><s xml:id="_pK3HnRG">To understand how families perceive and use smartwatch mediated co-regulation in everyday life, we built and deployed CoolTaco (Cool Technology Assisting Co-regulation), a novel application on the phone and smartwatch, in the wild.</s><s xml:id="_eE76xqy">Ten households with ADHD children aged 8-15 (10 ADHD children, 17 caregivers) used the system for 3 weeks to over 6 months (average 3 months).</s><s xml:id="_6rZsqGu">CoolTaco implements a basic task and reward strategy to support positive reinforcement for children's behavioral skills <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">47]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Ubx7RH3">With CoolTaco, parents and children create activities, children report activity completion, accumulate points, and redeem points for rewards.</s><s xml:id="_gXDjNAz">Our qualitative analysis of family's interviews and system logs indicate that CoolTaco helped structure routines and motivate some children towards goals while the smartwatch served as an always-available reminder for the child and a proxy for parent's collaboration even when not co-located.</s><s xml:id="_CpFwsND">However, the multi-device nature of CoolTaco interfered with some family dynamics, such as supporting children in regulating their behaviors with limited parental involvement.</s><s xml:id="_pHJwSm2">In examining family's use of CoolTaco, we highlight tensions in family informatics systems between encouraging parental involvement and developing children's independence.</s><s xml:id="_4ayJB5j">The key contributions of our deployment study are the following:</s></p><p xml:id="_nhgE7eG"><s xml:id="_5NqRsYE">• An understanding of smartwatch mediated collaboration strategies parents and children used to plan and stimulate children's regulation beyond when being together.</s><s xml:id="_JNHF82Z">Smartwatches were generally seen to be helpful for children to take on aspects of co-regulation work by executing tasks more independently with less parental presence.</s><s xml:id="_VqPExJc">• An empirical understanding of challenges, tensions, and labor that arise when families use a smartwatch mediated positive reinforcement system, such as the high technical and social dependency on parents' attitudes and actions, and eforts to refect lived experiences to in-system data.</s><s xml:id="_eAkrMBD">• Opportunities to support family co-regulation alongside children's autonomy.</s><s xml:id="_fUX4avw">In particular, we discuss the need for coregulation technology to support moments of joint refection in addition to asynchronous co-regulation, as well as the need to promote children's own self-regulation.</s></p></div>

self-regulation throughout childhood, adolescence, and into early adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_azGvKDB">However, ADHD children can develop self-regulation at diferent rates or ways than their typically developing peers <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_suWG37a">Regulatory skills are associated with children's development of social competence, mental health, and academic learning outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_4Ryymhn">Self-regulation development varies individually due to several factors, such as diferences in temperament, beliefs, cognition, disabilities, self-control, expectations, and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WNMAEXY">Self-regulation also builds on the dynamic interplay of environment, personal factors, and behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_jQBunJS">An important aspect of self-regulation is being adaptive to the demands of the environment, but it also largely depends on self-efcacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_GNfYnQn">ADHD children can experience difculties in planning and achieving goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b88">89]</ref>, sometimes related to arousal levels that can inhibit adapting to situational needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8zGZfX9">Self-monitoring helps children to assess progress towards goals and regulating behaviors to reach them <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rM6xxjk">Developing self-regulation skills can have lasting

type="bibr" target="#b105">106,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">110]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_65RAsjM">Within ADHD, assistive technologies have leveraged some of these design strategies to support children's regulation and skill development.</s><s xml:id="_k6vXTUG">For example, systems such as TangiPlan <ref type="bibr" target="#b106">[107]</ref> have proposed the use of tangible objects representing tasks to help ADHD children plan and organize morning routines.</s><s xml:id="_P9g6MnB">Similarly, gamifcation techniques like storytelling and playfulness of self-regulation practices have been used to help children regulate stress and practice organizational skills, such as in Chillfsh <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[93]</ref> and Plan-it <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_TbjHwH2">Research has also sought to support ADHD children's learning in school settings, such as using wearables to encourage refocus when inattention is sensed <ref type="bibr" target="#b94">[95]</ref>, or cooperative positive behaviors through an ambient display of student's behavioral performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NeTaqUy">Other design strategies have been surfaced by recent literature reviews on assistive technologies for self-regulation, including involvement of emerging technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and their utility in digital health interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_pGqSeCU">Overall, evidence suggests that technology can ofer some support for ADHD children's regulation but there is still need for systems to consider children's care ecosystems, such as the involvement of multiple stakeholders like parents and educators, given
