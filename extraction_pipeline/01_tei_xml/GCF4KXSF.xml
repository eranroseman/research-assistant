"wearables", generally refers to any miniaturized electronic device that can be easily donned on and off the body, or incorporated into clothing or other body-worn accessories <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_A7679Rb">While wearables have established utility in the fitness, gaming and entertainment industries, their role in the healthcare environment remains less clear <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_DhuSWG6">To date most commercially available wearables are limited in scope, tracking one or two health-related variables, and have yet to produce accurate measurement of many markers of health status that they attempt to assess such as heart rate variability, nutrition, and mood <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_scZMN7g">To the extent that wearables overcome these limitations, they hold much promise towards expanding the clinical repertoire of patient-specific measures, and they are considered an important tool for the future of precision health.</s></p><p xml:id="_mNn3b3q"><s xml:id="_7vssPRr">Physical activity information is perhaps the most common measurement provided by current wearable devices, thus it serves as a useful example to review the opportunities and difficulties facing digital health development using wearables.</s><s xml:id="_aNtHKq3">Physical activity is a well-established marker of current health status and future health risks, it is a useful estimate of real-life functional performance <ref

ubiquity of physical activity monitors, it is surprising their effective incorporation into clinical care remains a challenge, especially in face of the multiple known health benefits of physical activity and the many healthcare scenarios where physical activity information has a clinical use <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_umEUXtz">Key challenges preventing inclusion of physical activity monitoring in routine clinical care include the need for data standardization between the many different commercially available devices and sensor locations, and integration of this data into the electronic health record and clinical workflow.</s></p><p xml:id="_zSxAd45"><s xml:id="_K9KQuyn">Previous research suggests that digital health programs incorporating health behavior models and personalized coaching are the most successful <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref>

target="#b20">21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_EMBzu7P">Deficits in knowledge have also given rise to concerns that wearables could pose health risks by paradoxically

monitors provide useful instructions directly to patients, while updating the EHR with new data and promoting more rapid and efficient communication between clinicians and patients when needed.</s><s xml:id="_SWkfMRU">Within the Ochsner system, home blood pressure monitoring and health behavior data from additional optional wearable connected devices (including physical activity monitor and scale), was utilized in conjunction with health coaching and medication adjustments to track patient health status.</s><s xml:id="_2SRjnYa">A mobile application interface served as a feedback loop sending important information to the treating physician, who is then able to seek additional contact if a patient is not meeting expected goals, or simply continue to monitor if all is going well.</s><s xml:id="_38g7fvV">Within Kaiser, all patients enrolled in the program are actively managed by their care team, who uses the integrated data in EHR to drive clinical treatment decisions, performed in tandem with diet and physical activity education and coaching, and preventive care.</s><s xml:id="_HSXPFsQ">This newly tested approach with wearable connected home monitors contrasted from usual care where patients follow-up with care providers in clinic at designated appointments.</s><s xml:id="_CuKFsw7">The lag time in usual care was overcome by the connected digital monitors allowing real-time two-way communication between patient and care team.</s><s xml:id="_bCejUPf">The new platform also differed from usual care by providing participants with direct technical support to personally address technical issues.</s><s xml:id="_bF8aNCa">It also incorporated a health support team to tackle healthfocused problems such as lifestyle management, medication compliance, nutrition, and health education.</s><s xml:id="_GAq3nj9">These teams added a personalized component to each program that specifically addressed important patient-level health needs.</s></p><p

prospective assessment of the Ochsner digital hypertension management program revealed that 71% of patients treated with the digital health program achieved target blood pressure control, compared to 31% under usual care <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_VvDb9X2">Kaiser Permanente's digital glucose monitoring program reduced time for contacting patients in the program via telephone visits by 50%, and therefore effectively doubled clinicians' capacity to manage patients with diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_QQES37T">Both digital programs had similar features that allowed them to empirically outperform usual care.</s><s xml:id="_PpKkhpT">In this paper, we highlight the workgroup's findings regarding the common key features between
