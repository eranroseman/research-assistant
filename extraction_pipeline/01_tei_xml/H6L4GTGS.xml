systems.</s></p><p xml:id="_4QdPrZ4"><s xml:id="_UpEyAgc">The predominance of single-centre trials, with a median of 359 patients, suggests smaller, controlled environments are often chosen for AI health-care trials; however, little demographic reporting, particularly on race and ethnicity, raises concerns about the representativeness of these studies.</s><s xml:id="_4BhV2bT">The infrequency of citation of the CONSORT-AI reporting guidelines further underscores the need for greater transparency in trial methods.</s><s xml:id="_CygCkxX">This transparency would enhance under standing of the

management, patient behaviour and symptoms, and clinical decision making, but this early success should be tempered by the likelihood of publication bias.</s><s xml:id="_m9CcK8B">The true success of
