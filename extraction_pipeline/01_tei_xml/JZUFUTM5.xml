<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_pZHcvWt">Introduction</head><p xml:id="_Sgms9fF"><s xml:id="_rSkBYqh">With over 165,000 mobile health (mHealth) apps on the Apple App Store and Google Play Store catalogues and 3 billion downloads in 2015 alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, mHealth apps represent a mature, robust marketplace for a new generation of patients who seek patient-empowered care and mHealth publishers who aim to facilitate this practice.</s><s xml:id="_8VQ9QxQ">mHealth apps are currently being developed for many different clinical conditions including diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, heart failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, and cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and have the potential to disrupt existing health care delivery pathways.</s></p><p xml:id="_BAHxvwc"><s xml:id="_A9rzgVZ">In recent years, numerous calls have been made to address the challenges inherent in mHealth app evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wBKjEep">Key barriers were identified by researchers at the National Institutes of Health mHealth Evidence Workshop, notably the difficulty of matching the rapid pace of mHealth innovation with existing research designs <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7eK39xC">Explicit attention was drawn to the randomized controlled trial (RCT), which has long been considered the primary research study design capable of eliciting causal relationships between health interventions and consequent outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HfahMyH">However, RCTs are notoriously long-the average duration of 5.5 years from enrollment to publication clearly risks app obsolescence occurring before study completion <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_avy4ggn">With high-cost trial implementation and a rigid protocol that precludes mid-trial changes to the intervention in order to maintain internal validity, RCTs are perceived as an incompatible, impractical evaluation methodology for most mHealth apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zZDG9eG">There is also an inherent quality of software that does not lend itself to the rigidity of the RCT-software is meant to change, evolve, progress, and learn over time, all at a rapid pace.</s><s xml:id="_RcVEGaX">Rigid trial protocols undermine this principle attribute, since controlled trials were designed for interventions that take years, even decades to develop, that is, medical devices and drugs.</s><s xml:id="_V4djCXY">In concluding the mHealth Evidence Workshop, researchers identified the need to develop novel research designs that can keep up with the lean, iterative, and rapid-paced mHealth apps they seek to evaluate.</s></p><p xml:id="_UcRqjEW"><s xml:id="_KDkajpn">The Chicago-based Center for Behavioral Intervention Technologies has endeavored to design methodological frameworks that can appropriately support mHealth evaluation.</s><s xml:id="_2kTCWFE">Mohr and colleagues proposed the Continuous Evaluation of Evolving Behavioral Intervention Technologies (CEEBIT) framework as an alternative to the gold-standard RCT <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_aezQaJr">The CEEBIT methodology is statistically powered to continuously evaluate app efficacy throughout trial duration and accounts for changing app versions through a sophisticated elimination process.</s><s xml:id="_z2fMBB5">The CEEBIT also thoughtfully addresses many other RCT-specific considerations, from randomization to inclusion/exclusion criteria to statistical analysis.</s><s xml:id="_bY57V8h">Additional alternatives to the RCT have also been presented, including interrupted time-series, stepped-wedge, regression discontinuity, and N-of-1 trial designs that may limit interval validity but are more responsive and relevant for evaluating mHealth interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ktYYS4H">Novel factorial trial designs have been proposed for mHealth research and are increasingly being used to test multiple app features and determine the optimal combinations and adaptations to build an effective app.</s><s xml:id="_EXAbRt7">These include the multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, the sequential multiple assignment randomized trial (SMART) <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and the microrandomized trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_samrh4a">Suggestions have also been made on how to increase the efficiency of traditional RCTs themselves, including using within-group designs, fully automating study enrollment, random assignment, intervention delivery and outcomes assessment, and shortening follow-up through modeling long-term outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ZHGFGkT">Further, best practice evaluation methods in the field of human-computer interaction, notably usability testing and heuristic evaluation, have been widely adopted in mHealth research and are well suited to assess the efficacy of user-driven, digitally operationalized behavioral mechanisms required to elicit stable changes in health outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_AkXuhtP">These alternatives allow us to reconsider the RCT for a more flexible and iterative evaluation approach that will mimic the attributes of software-based behavioral interventions and their agile app development process, where it is acceptable and preferable to learn from a poor trial outcome sooner in order to redesign the intervention more quickly and subsequently show success sooner.</s></p><p xml:id="_7rHUHTZ"><s xml:id="_AG3Tw9W">In parallel to the development of novel research designs like the CEEBIT, new industry initiatives have also introduced novel platforms to deploy mHealth evaluations.</s><s xml:id="_Sp4Xg8K">In 2015, Apple announced the release of ResearchKit, a software framework designed for health research to allow iPhone users to participate in research studies more easily <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_puJsGcD">ResearchKit allows for the digital collection of informed consent, a process that has historically hindered the accrual of patients into trials and the scalability of clinical research.</s><s xml:id="_akfGQPB">It also enables access to real-time data collected from the iPhone's accelerometer, gyroscope, microphone, and global positioning system (GPS), along with health data from external wearables (eg, FitBit, Apple Watch) to gain real-time insight into a participant's health behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EcuysRT">Evidence of ResearchKit's impact can already be seen in several Apple-promoted research trials deployed for a range of conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8reeYrm">It is not difficult to imagine ResearchKit being adapted for use as a tool to evaluate mHealth app efficacy-an app claiming to help patients self-manage their diabetes could be launched using the ResearchKit framework and evidenced for efficacy through sensor data and in-app surveys.</s></p><p xml:id="_45Thad4"><s xml:id="_3rFJKYp">Given the development of alternative evaluation methodologies and the launch of novel technologies to automate mHealth research, we sought to determine if these initiatives were being implemented in current clinical trials.</s><s xml:id="_mH3sMph">Through this review, research designs and methods for current mHealth clinical

of apps for managing obesity did not adhere to a two-group pretest-posttest control group comparison design as defined by the Campbell and Stanley framework, and only a third of mental health apps used this classic RCT design, the majority of trials for other prevalent conditions did favor this specific study design to evaluate health outcomes and elicit proof of app efficacy.</s><s

evaluating.</s><s xml:id="_xEp9pMC">Some unexpected findings emerged from our review, one being the near-complete lack of variation in study implementation sites-97% of trials were conducted onsite in academic centers and hospitals, with only two trials employing online recruitment and data collection.</s><s xml:id="_Rw6SM2G">Regarding trial duration, mHealth trials had a total data collection period of 20 months on average.</s><s xml:id="_HXKd3cq">We were able to identify four predictor variables that accounted for 32.6% of the variance in trial duration: data collection frequency, masking, sample size, and study sponsorship.</s></p><p xml:id="_xzVGkUh"><s xml:id="_s3dpKGs">Our analysis of the relationship between the number of data collection points in an mHealth trial and the duration of the trial revealed that trials with four or more data collection points would have a significantly longer data collection period compared to trials with two data collection points.</s><s xml:id="_AUVRAus">While this finding suggests that mHealth trials might benefit from a study implementation process that includes automated data collection through the intervention app to allow for frequent data collection without prolonging study duration, our review results are inconclusive in supporting this recommendation given the lack of a clear relationship between study length and data collection frequency.</s><s xml:id="_QYsDVjR">In analyzing the raw review data, there is no significant difference in study duration between one, three, and four or more data collection points, and

optimistic in our advocacy of automated study implementation, from recruitment to data collection, for all mHealth trials.</s><s xml:id="_Xgwct4V">While many trials had open masking, nearly a third
