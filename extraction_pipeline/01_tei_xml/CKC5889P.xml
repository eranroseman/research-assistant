<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_MMNrJna">Background</head><p xml:id="_9zxdctH"><s xml:id="_wAqX4Gt">Currently, health care is provided by multiple providers across various disciplines and through different organizations.</s><s xml:id="_5w6VgT2">With patients receiving care from multiple people, it is crucial to have a system that can integrate providers and information horizontally and vertically across the health care system.</s><s xml:id="_G2dT5Da">The concept of integrated care is to deliver coordinated care that brings together services from across health and community-based social systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WZeC7AC">This type of care also aims to close the gap between health and social care <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> as it is seen as a way to bridge the gap among acute care, primary care, and community and social services <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wxfUmqe">Evidence shows that integration, coordination, and person-focused care are core features by which primary care achieves better population health outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_RSGCkgm">To effectively integrate care, providers must ensure the continuity of sharing information about patients while allowing patients to remain at the center of their own care <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fJR62YC">Therefore, this type of care relies on infrastructure to support the bridging of these traditionally siloed services and the centering of the patient in any intervention.</s></p><p xml:id="_HjkeEUd"><s xml:id="_NhvbrJk">Information and communication technology (ICT) is an important enabler that supports the delivery of integrated and coordinated primary care <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Br7zECp">ICT includes any health information technology that aids in the collection of health information and its processing, storage, and exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fgxhH9c">There is evidence that ICT can support integrated care systems by fostering greater care efficiency and enhancing information exchange <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_SYNGynG"><s xml:id="_WE4J5zQ">With the growing population of older adults in Canada and globally, the need to provide care that wraps around patients is even more important.</s><s xml:id="_JWuvnRt">In shifting to more integrated care, the changes that organizations make will need to be supported using all available resources.</s><s xml:id="_sPDJn7s">ICT can connect users across organizations and disciplines to share information.</s><s xml:id="_hfXJzhd">Appropriate communication to enhance these connections is critical for successful integrated care systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_TANdE5r">However, there are knowledge gaps in the literature describing the processes of introducing ICT into existing health and social care settings and in understanding how ICT changes work and information flows.</s><s xml:id="_r3ahQkV">Given the challenges that the introduction of anything new can present when incorporated into existing systems, careful planning and evaluation of these infrastructures are necessary.</s></p><p xml:id="_QXAQDhf"><s xml:id="_3EWCbcA">Health TAPESTRY (Teams Advancing Patient Experience: Strengthening Quality) offers an opportunity to describe the development and evolution of ICT as part of a pragmatic complex intervention rooted in primary care.</s><s xml:id="_th2JB5Q">The program creates connections among trained community volunteers, interprofessional primary health care teams, novel technology, and community engagement and connections through improved system navigation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_yBzqVqk">The aim is to help older adults stay healthier for longer in the places where they live.</s><s xml:id="_bpG3Cj8">A total of 2 evaluations have been completed through a randomized controlled trial.</s><s xml:id="_GAXb9NN">The study showed that patients who received Health TAPESTRY walked more (mean difference 1.13, 95% CI 0.31-1.95),</s><s xml:id="_h6QMYYz">had fewer hospitalizations (incidence rate ratio 0.37, 95% CI 0.18-0.77),</s><s xml:id="_gw3nbEX">and saw their primary care team more (mean difference 1.52, 95% CI 0.84-2.19)</s><s xml:id="_YXVhNRB"><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_F9bemRD"><s xml:id="_dKDaAKe">The key ICT within Health TAPESTRY is the Health TAPESTRY app (TAP-App), a web-based application that has 3 interfaces (briefly described below).</s><s xml:id="_Jgs3wCV">In Health TAPESTRY, trained volunteers conduct visits in older adults' homes to discuss the clients' health and life goals, while identifying their health and health-related social needs using validated tools or surveys adapted by the research team.</s><s xml:id="_mNBhGvu">These surveys were administered by volunteers, facilitated by and recorded in the TAP-App on tablets through the volunteer interface.</s><s xml:id="_FzC95XW">During the visits, the volunteers had the opportunity to answer client questions and provide relevant information on community programs and services that may be of interest to the client.</s><s xml:id="_nB7SS6B">After visits, volunteers write social context information on the TAP-App about their own perspectives of the client.</s><s xml:id="_RQn8N48">Volunteers were also invited to write narratives on the TAP-App, which were stories of their own experiences with the potential to be used for research or program development purposes, as needed.</s><s xml:id="_u765k8m">A volunteer coordinator at each site handled the management and scheduling of volunteer and client visits through the TAP-App (ie, the volunteer coordinator interface).</s></p><p xml:id="_CtSrmQf"><s xml:id="_c84QAtp">The TAP-App creates an automated PDF TAP-Report that is shared with the huddle team at the patient's primary care site through a huddle interface.</s><s xml:id="_hjTj9tt">The huddle is a subgroup of people within the primary care team who meet weekly to discuss with clients in the program.</s><s xml:id="_3XjwZVQ">The huddle is composed of at least 3 providers from different disciplines (eg, physician assistant, occupational therapist, nurse, and physician).</s><s xml:id="_9Djpknu">The huddle members view TAP-Reports from their own interprofessional lens and work together to create individualized plans of care for clients based on the information collected.</s><s xml:id="_wpP3VXx">The huddle teams are then able to document a summary of their review and plan of action on each TAP-Report through the huddle interface.</s><s xml:id="_YBBfhdU">They also have the option to send volunteers back to clients through the huddle action checklist, which contains a list of options for engaging volunteers in the plan of action, including discussing changes in clients' health needs, planning the achievement of goals, or connecting clients to community-based health and social services.</s><s xml:id="_b4uZdg8">These recommendations are communicated to volunteers via volunteer coordinators who receive this information on the TAP-App.</s><s xml:id="_kRgNCr5">After volunteers follow-up with clients, they communicate any new information back to the huddles through the Follow-Up Report, another automated PDF report created by the TAP-App.</s><s xml:id="_SMYRs6d">A detailed description of Health TAPESTRY is in the published protocol <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[12]</ref>.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_DRRbCnS">Methods</head></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_UQMJxrT">Design</head><p xml:id="_KcVEnfG"><s xml:id="_36SKfQc">The case under study is the TAP-App itself, and the units of analysis are the perspectives of end users and stakeholders <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gk4VDzX">We used the Stake understanding of case studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15]</ref>, including a focus on qualitative results, involvement of researchers' impressions as key sources of data, detail provided to assist in naturalistic generalization, and lack of a specific start or end time of data collection and analysis.</s><s xml:id="_mPbaaDB">Although our case was partly bounded by the start and end dates of the randomized controlled trial that was conducted (described elsewhere), the TAP-App went beyond these temporal boundaries; hence, we describe development and vision both before and after.</s><s xml:id="_ttTy6Qz">The settings that bound our case were numerous and are described in the Setting section below.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_AfSgFde">Data Collection</head><p xml:id="_DrFejGh"><s xml:id="_Wn36JMa">The data in this study came from the direct perspectives of key members of the research and implementation team, who are also represented as authors in this paper.</s><s xml:id="_nTumTap">The lessons learned in this paper constitute the key themes from the team's perspectives in implementing the TAP-App in Health TAPESTRY.</s><s xml:id="_Q5bd4Wg">Specific data sources to understand how the TAP-App was implemented in its 2 phases were a written retrospective reflection from the program manager, an interview with the technology lead (facilitated by SD and JG), and key questions administered via email to the software developer.</s></p><p xml:id="_EBb75cX"><s xml:id="_9kArFCJ">Although the lessons learned in this paper came directly from the program team, their understanding of the implementation of the TAP-App was informed by the feedback that the team received from many other stakeholders and end users (including Health TAPESTRY clients, community volunteers, volunteer coordinators, primary care providers, and administrative or other primary care team members).</s><s xml:id="_vtMPmuD">This feedback came to the team via email, volunteer lunch and learns, volunteer narratives submitted via the TAP-App, and during verbal debriefs with volunteer coordinators.</s><s xml:id="_CMS2qFy">Furthermore, we gathered viewpoints and feedback from other research team members who developed and implemented the TAP-App at each of the 2 main stages.</s><s xml:id="_p9qe8H8">SD and JG collected this information and combined it with the direct observations of the research team to add detail and clarity to understanding the lessons learned in this work.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_U3nT9dk">Data Analysis</head><p xml:id="_SpJ57GY"><s xml:id="_Snhgrsd">Although there was no traditional qualitative data set for this study's data because of the structure of data collection, the project team members (ie, the authors and key informants) discussed lessons learned throughout and after project implementation.</s><s xml:id="_5f8NGdY">LL and SD developed the initial Lessons Learned section in this paper based on the key themes that continued to arise in these project conversations and their own perspectives as implementers.</s><s xml:id="_cCtpnPT">JG and SD then edited the lessons learned after collecting more information from key informants (ie, the interview with the project lead and key questions to the developer).</s><s xml:id="_KGmYSwt">Throughout this process, member-checking was continued, that is, feeding back the written lessons learned to the key informants, to ensure that the written representation fit their understanding of the process.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_35qDDum">Methods to Improve Rigor</head><p xml:id="_s9szYy6"><s xml:id="_hgXpvku">We used several methods to enhance rigor in this case study.</s><s xml:id="_qMBYyDU">We worked to enhance credibility and confirmability through triangulation of various data sources (ie, respondents), data collection methods, and individual interpreters of the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_PbXcbuR">We further enhanced credibility by prolonged engagement of respondents while ICT was used in a multi-year program <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mReZ35A">Finally, although this case study focused deeply on a specific ICT, we used a thick description that may aid in understanding the potential for transferability or naturalistic generalization of the results to other settings and ICTs <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_Z38g7Kq">Setting</head><p xml:id="_zzbMeGS"><s xml:id="_kSbn5mm">The TAP-App was developed, hosted, and driven by an academic university department, McMaster University's Department of Family Medicine.</s><s xml:id="_8ZRmvXW">The department includes subgroups-2 of which are devoted to information technology and research-and were the 2 areas of the department that managed the TAP-App.</s><s xml:id="_8Z5W2db">During the implementation of Health TAPESTRY-Ontario (2018-2020), which is the period of focus of this study, the TAP-App was used in 6 family health teams (FHTs) across the province of Ontario, Canada to support older adult clients.</s><s xml:id="_jeXpCJz">FHTs are primary health care teams that bring traditional family physician-led practices together with an array of interprofessional providers such as nurses, social workers, dietitians, pharmacists, and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HJwKtXQ">Interprofessional providers in an FHT may be colocated or located at different sites.</s><s xml:id="_9VVSQZF">The FHTs, as well as the communities they serve, vary in size, with populations ranging from 2710 to 536,917 as of the 2016 Census <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_b5p7hyF">In addition to its use by FHTs, as described above, the TAP-App was used by trained community volunteers working in clients' homes and by the organizations and individuals that supported both these volunteers and the communication exchange among elements.</s><s xml:id="_MTq4AKw">A national humanitarian charitable organization supported 4 of the 6 sites with 4 volunteer coordinators.</s><s xml:id="_KHzCZ9c">A coalition of multiple agencies focused on community health supported the final 2 sites with 1 volunteer coordinator.</s></p></div>
