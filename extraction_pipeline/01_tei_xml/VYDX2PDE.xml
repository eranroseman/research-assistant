goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5xgXK95">The diphtheria-tetanus-pertussis global immunization coverage dropped from 86% in 2019 to 81% in 2021, with 25 million children not receiving primary vaccination <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_et9x3Q9">The global coverage of the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine among girls also fell from 20% in 2019 to 15% in 2021 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_nHHvUdY">This phenomenon is caused by several reasons, including vaccine hesitancy around the population <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref>, lack of access to vaccines in some low-and middle-income countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref>, and the COVID-19 pandemic <ref type="bibr"

xml:id="_sUfet4Y">A study in the United States reported the economic burden of vaccine-preventable diseases to be US $9 billion in 2015, of which the cost of unvaccinated individuals was US $7.1 billion (accounting for approximately 80% of the disease burden) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Q7rNFSm">Interventions to improve vaccination coverage and uptake rates are therefore highly warranted <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_avKx6fB"><s xml:id="_XzxPsM4">Digital health begins with the application of information and communications

and enhancing the delivery and management of health care for individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_uDJGpkR">Digital health interventions (DHIs) have been used in various strategies for the improvement of vaccination uptake.</s><s xml:id="_fDWZGrf">For instance, reminder and recall are delivered by autodialer message, telephone, SMS text messaging, email, and mobile app <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_AUeWjza">Education for community or special groups is also provided in the platform of web-based communication, video, and

type="bibr" target="#b12">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">16]</ref>, there is still a lack of review on the cost-effectiveness of DHIs for vaccination uptake.</s><s xml:id="_ppgpTUM">The implementation of new DHIs incurs substantial costs, including costs for setup, maintenance, and management, to support the widespread application in the public <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8uEcJfN">Health economic evaluation provides a comprehensive framework to compare the changes in clinical and economic outcomes associated with the application of the digital health technology.</s><s xml:id="_PJVTqPu">The health economic evidence provides information to the health care providers and policy makers in the informed decision-making process on resource allocation of DHIs.</s><s xml:id="_geYQ4Jn">The objective of this study is to conduct a systematic review on cost-effectiveness analyses of DHIs for improving the uptake of vaccination
