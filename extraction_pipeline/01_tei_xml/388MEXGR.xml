increased the sophistication of mobile health (mHealth) interventions.</s><s xml:id="_HFwSChG">It is now possible to use data about individuals' physiological states (e.g., stress), behavior (e.g., physical activity), and context (e.g., location) to deliver highly tailored interventions for a range of health behaviors, from substance use <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> to stress management <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_dejDHP8">Such just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> aim to provide support for health behavior change at times when users most need the support and are most receptive to it <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_eGGPqRr">Yet, while JITAIs hold promise for supporting health behavior change, their design involves several challenges.</s><s xml:id="_HqTKRzY">JITAIs often include push interventions, which are usually delivered as notifications on a mobile phone or a wearable (e.g., a smart watch) at times (decision points) when the  Predrag Klasnja klasnja.p@ghc.org</s><s xml:id="_R2qcksV">system has determined that a particular intervention component, such as a medication reminder or a tip for coping with alcohol cravings, could be helpful and the user would be receptive to it.</s><s xml:id="_NY4BVAZ">Whether to deliver a notification and, if so, what type of notification to deliver are determined by JITAI decision rules-if-then rules or algorithms that are typically constructed based on behavioral theory and prior data.</s></p><p xml:id="_cC3bbvq"><s xml:id="_J6JqHbm">While JITAI designers aim to provide interventions that are effective and are delivered at most helpful times for each intervention component, the available empirical evidence and clinical judgment are often not sufficient to determine in advance how exactly each component should work and when it should be delivered.</s><s xml:id="_F5VP8B2">But this creates a risk.</s><s xml:id="_Fm35qQQ">If the push interventions included in a JITAI are not sufficiently helpful or are provided too frequently, they can lead to user frustration and disengagement.</s><s xml:id="_FjS3UKW">Users might also become habituated to the interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, leading to the loss of effectiveness even for intervention components that were initially effective.</s><s xml:id="_YKrWfx7">And if the users become sufficiently aggravated by interventions that are being delivered too frequently or at inopportune times, they might abandon the JITAI altogether.</s></p><p xml:id="_HN3qvQW"><s xml:id="_Qszqu3e">Optimizing <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> JITAIs to maximize effectiveness while minimizing user burden and risk of abandonment is thus paramount.</s><s xml:id="_29ztJMq">Ideally, JITAIs should only include intervention components that are efficacious, and these components should be delivered when they are most likely to have an impact on target health behaviors and with frequency that minimizes user burden and risk of habituation.</s><s xml:id="_z4ubQWG">JITAI construction can, thus, be greatly facilitated by optimization studies that can evaluate the efficacy of individual intervention components to determine whether they are worth including in a JITAI and to refine the decision rules for their delivery.</s></p><p xml:id="_eZJeaWP"><s xml:id="_7Q8cmPr">Micro-randomized trials (MRTs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref> are a new experimental design developed to optimize JITAI construction.</s><s xml:id="_4dnPuvb">In an MRT, push intervention components that are being investigated are randomized for each participant each time the system may deliver those components.</s><s xml:id="_KXXmG2R">For example, in an MRT of a JITAI that includes medication reminders for a daily hypertensive medication, reminders would be randomized for each participant on each day of the study.</s><s xml:id="_nbP69fS">A different component-a mindfulness reminder-would be randomized at each of its own decision points-say, three times a day.</s></p><p xml:id="_CZRPKS8"><s xml:id="_F6PzgUN">Data from an MRT enable modeling of the causal effects of each intervention component that was micro-randomized.</s><s xml:id="_CqvHSUG">MRT analyses are designed to assess the causal effect of each randomized component on its proximal outcome: the short-term, measurable behavioral or psychosocial effect through which that component is hypothesized to mediate desired distal health outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_9JvZzd2">In our medication-reminder example, the proximal outcome would be whether the person took the hypertensive medication.</s><s xml:id="_vrKq3GZ">Assessment of proximal outcomes enables researchers to determine both whether each component is working as intended and, in MRTs in which distal health outcomes are also assessed, whether the proximal and distal outcomes are related as hypothesized <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SF5xBwp">Finally, as MRTs both randomize intervention provision and assess proximal outcomes repeatedly, MRT data can enable researchers to model how intervention effects change over time (e.g., reminders may be effective initially but their effectiveness diminishes over time).</s><s xml:id="_GNTwV4s">In addition, in secondary analyses, researchers can also examine how those effects are moderated by the context in which interventions are provided.</s><s xml:id="_y3YnPRv">For example, medication reminders may be effective when the person is at home, but not when the person is out and about.</s><s xml:id="_HY96EAG">From the perspective of JITAI construction, such analyses of how intervention effects are moderated by time and context can be particularly important for optimizing rules for intervention delivery <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_djWKWYk"><s xml:id="_4CnXz2c">In this study, we present results from a 6-week MRT conducted to optimize HeartSteps, a novel JITAI we developed to help individuals increase their physical activity by engaging in regular bouts of activity throughout the day, primarily by walking.</s><s xml:id="_7QTsqb6">Walking is a moderate-intensity activity that is safe, accessible, and can be performed almost anywhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_sWUFPC2">At the same time, walking is shaped by a number of contextual factors, such as weather, built environment, and available transportation options <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_aTpkqpB">To encourage regular walking, HeartSteps leverages information about users' context (location, weather, time of day, and day of the week) to send contextually tailored suggestions for how users can be active in their current situation.</s><s xml:id="_a68NPWz">In addition, HeartSteps supports physical activity by helping users plan when, where, and how they will be active on the following day.</s></p><p xml:id="_EFPRW2X"><s xml:id="_pAfdBJD">To optimize HeartSteps, we conducted an MRT to assess the efficacy of HeartSteps' contextually tailored activity suggestions to determine whether this component should be included in the subsequent version of the intervention package.</s><s xml:id="_TNDwszA">Specifically, we were interested in evaluating whether providing an activity suggestion tailored to the user's current context, versus not providing a suggestion, increased physical activity shortly after suggestions are delivered and, if so, whether this effect changed over time.</s></p></div>
