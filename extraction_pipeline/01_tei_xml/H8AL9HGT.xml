<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="_2aDMBNa"><p xml:id="_GGHV5TB"><s xml:id="_nfc5YpJ">high income countries there is rising concern around unmet mental health needs, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_TUWTWgM">While effective treatments for mental health disorders exist, including a variety of evidence-based therapies as well as medications-access to care is limited.</s><s xml:id="_hrDDqBP">For example, in a 2020 report the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration in the United States noted that to offer full access to evidence based mental health care in the United States would require training 4,486,865 new mental health professionals <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_GAKxzx8">The stark reality of the simple impossibility of meeting rising needs with the current workforce or mental healthcare system, even in high income countries, has thus catalyzed interest in mobile mental health interventions.</s></p><p xml:id="_Qcy4mNy"><s xml:id="_zWCtUfT">While the global pandemic and COVID-19 have accelerated interest and uptake of mobile health interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref>, the field has been active since smartphones became accessible to consumers.</s><s xml:id="_ysnKDd7">As early as 2012, smartphone apps were being studied for use in DBT treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref> and the New York times reported "therapy apps. .</s><s xml:id="_jA3ttYm">.may soon make psychological help accessible anytime, anywhere <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>."</s><s xml:id="_42qtc5P">Interventions capitalizing on pre-smartphone mobile phone technology (e.g., text message-based interventions) have been studied even longer <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_YGYytT6">For the purposes of this review, we define mobile phone-based interventions as behavioral interventions delivered remotely through mobile phones.</s><s xml:id="_YW5zHYH">This can include a wide variety of approaches such as smartphone apps, text message-based interventions, apps integrated with wearable sensors such as Fitbits, as well as interventions that combine a mobile phone component with additional support (e.g., mobile phone-based intervention added to augment a clinician-delivered intervention).</s><s xml:id="_A8YwfQs">We do not consider interventions delivered through websites that could theoretically be access through smartphone but not specifically designed for mobile phones as mobile phone-based interventions.</s><s xml:id="_TG5yZvb">Likewise, interventions delivered by clinicians via videoconferencing or telephone (i.e., teletherapy) were not considered mobile phone-based interventions.</s></p><p xml:id="_VfDaqaB"><s xml:id="_tcurenp">Mobile phone-based interventions may be particularly helpful for increasing access, as these devices are owned by the vast majority of the population and typically kept within arm's reach <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_86NWtEQ">Today thousands of mental health apps are available for immediate download <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_vXYRr8f">The landscape has expanded to such an extent that professional societies have created evaluation frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref> and healthcare regulators around the world are exploring new ways to categorize and regulate this burgeoning space <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_TDknxgw">Large healthcare systems like Kaiser Permanente that had already integrated mobile health apps into care before COVID-19 doubled the number of app referrals in the first months of the pandemic (40,000 in May 2020 <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>), representing the continued expansion of mobile mental health interventions.</s></p><p xml:id="_cn2Yv5y"><s xml:id="_QKBG27a">As interest and uptake of mobile phone-based intervention and mobile mental health interventions generally has increased, so has research on their efficacy.</s><s xml:id="_66wvS6d">From fewer than five studies per year in 2011 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref> to now hundreds per year-there exist thousands of research studies on mobile health interventions.</s><s xml:id="_wBCrNwT">While the first generation of these studies focused on feasibility and acceptability, the accumulating evidence clearly indicates that people suffering from all mental health conditions, including even schizophrenia (which may be associated with severe disability that in theory could interfere with feasibility and acceptability), are interested in and willing to use technology as part of their care <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_jd6BT58">The newer generation of investigation now focuses on engagement, efficacy (i.e., performance in ideal conditions), and effectiveness (i.e., performance in naturalistic contexts) in ultimately seeking to answer questions around real world use of these interventions towards improving outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_CZ4tAQe">Yet surprisingly, this research has not yielded clear answers with recent 2021 systematic reviews of app interventions reporting outcomes ranging from "inconsistent results" <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref> to "proven effectiveness" <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_8X8jJNJ"><s xml:id="_mGY8rMM">Inconsistencies in the literature on mobile health interventions are also reflected in metaanalyses.</s><s xml:id="_fYgj9Pe">Examining different portions of the literature have resulted in some meta-analysis of mobile health apps to conclude that self-help apps "cannot be recommended" <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref> while others that these apps may "serve as a cost-effective, easily accessible, and low intensity interventions" <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SPpaBUm">Meta-reviews (i.e., systematic reviews of meta-analyses) can be particularly helpful in instances like this <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_juwxCMn">Meta-reviews studies can clarify points of convergence and divergence within the meta-analytic literature and can more reliably guide providers and health care policy makers than a single meta-analysis.</s><s xml:id="_NbhWXJZ">Meta-reviews can also clarify potential methodological shortcomings of both the meta-analytic and primary study literature to guide future work <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_2CjSF2V"><s xml:id="_dzeC4UQ">To our knowledge, Lecomte et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref> conducted the only meta-review investigating the effects of mobile phone-based interventions on mental health.</s><s xml:id="_eSSPdvy">They reviewed seven meta-analyses focused on mental health apps, concluding that apps for anxiety and depression hold clinical promise.</s><s xml:id="_UtGyVB3">While a valuable first assessment of this growing meta-analytic literature, the study has several important limitations which limit the strength of conclusions that can be drawn.</s><s xml:id="_6BxtQwr">One important limitation was the inclusion of both randomized and non-randomized studies, the latter of which cannot be used to draw causal inferences.</s><s xml:id="_ZgUeEP4">In addition, Lecomte et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref> included effect size estimates that were based on the combination of active and inactive controls.</s><s xml:id="_aPeW2t8">Given robust evidence that the strength of the control condition impacts estimates of relative efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[26]</ref>, such effect sizes provide ambiguous information regarding intervention effects.</s><s xml:id="_nChVnxE">In addition, this review did not include text message-based interventions, which for some conditions (e.g., smoking) have a well-established evidence base <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wgEquwE">Lastly, Lecomte et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[25]</ref> did not identify a single effect size most likely to represent a particular outcome (e.g., effects on depression versus inactive controls).</s><s xml:id="_9uAP2Md">Lacking such a summary effect size may make findings less actionable for clinicians and other health care decision makers.</s></p><p xml:id="_cNXUFpZ"><s xml:id="_rfrMmcR">The varied conclusions of meta-analyses are understandable in the context of numerous use cases as well as schemas to classify mobile phone-based health interventions.</s><s xml:id="_kBChCjz">Interventions focusing on prevention may target those without a diagnosed mental illness and offer different effects than those targeting acute or chronic illness management <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[28]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[29]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NdbDjPy">Interventions for depression may utilize a plethora of psychological techniques that each offer unique benefits to different clusters of patients.</s><s xml:id="_rJBz6BB">Studies reporting on the preliminary efficacy of mobile phonebased interventions may not require an active control group while those examining effectiveness (i.e., impact in the real world) may.</s><s xml:id="_PrWZXgv">Further complicating matters, clinical endpoints across studies are obfuscated by a panoply of self-reported outcomes and varied assessment schedules.</s><s xml:id="_2cENJ4k">Thus, each element in the participants, interventions, comparisons, outcomes [PICO] framework presents a potentially complex choice for any review or meta-analyses.</s></p><p xml:id="_vKfg8v5"><s xml:id="_mf27KWG">A further challenge in understanding the effect of mobile phone-based interventions is inconsistent reporting of methodology and outcomes in the literature itself.</s><s xml:id="_FPxcj7c">Results are rarely reported in terms of engagement, control group coding is inconsistent, testing of moderators infrequently completed, and publication bias not consistently assessed.</s><s xml:id="_QKB6qYD">These concerns are not strictly academic and in 2021 a pharmaceutical industry backed study of an app for schizophrenia reported negative results that the company ascribed to engagement and control group issues <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_4GmJr4G">Thus, just as mobile health interventions for mental health have reached a peak of public interest with COVD-19, are entering into clinical care settings, and emerging as the focus of high stakes and high-cost clinical research studies-the strength of their evidence remains, and preferred meta-analytical methods, unclear.</s></p><p xml:id="_ym3M23M"><s xml:id="_aQTqF5m">With this framing, in the current study we conduct a meta-review of meta-analyses of mobile phone-based intervention tested in randomized controlled trials.</s><s xml:id="_yTYqWBB">We aim to clarify the strength of evidence across PICO categories (i.e., different pairings of types of participants, interventions, comparisons, and outcomes) and identify important study design considerations for future primary research and meta-analysis.</s><s xml:id="_Yys43FF">Given the many ways this literature could be examined (i.e., crossing of PICO) and an interest in clarifying points of convergence and divergence across existing meta-analyses, we utilize extant meta-analytic summaries to offer guidance to the public, clinicians, and researchers around mobile phone-based interventions.</s><s xml:id="_FMJN2hQ">To do so, we followed an umbrella review methodology and identified representative effect sizes for specific PICO pairings that was based on the largest sample.</s><s xml:id="_mVmFsqj">Effect sizes were evaluated based on the certainty of the evidence using previously employed metrics <ref
