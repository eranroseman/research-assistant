<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="3." xml:id="_JV5zfQu">What does make apps assessment more challenging?</head><p xml:id="_gzpDErY"><s xml:id="_cZmZbZD">Drummond et al. described six reasons that mark a difference between drugs and medical devices when assessment is at stake <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_pRSepRT">These equally apply, and are often emphasized, in the case of mHealth apps indicating the need for a distinction between the assessment process of medical devices at large and that to be implemented for apps.</s></p><p xml:id="_u5zwKuy"><s xml:id="_EbCtu9w">First, just as it happens for some medical devices, evidence generation through randomized controlled studies (RCTs) is extremely challenging for mHealth apps.</s><s xml:id="_cMc67k4">The incremental nature of technological development of MDs makes RCTs, in some cases, unsuitable to demonstrate efficacy, and therefore alternative or additional types of studies have been suggested (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_4mxQ3cw">realworld evidence) <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_MxmGmRA">Experimental studies are even more widely inapt for mHealth apps, that can evolve very rapidly, incorporate continuous measurement of the intervention effects, and need to be constantly readjusted just to keep up with their intended use <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7yHsaQq">The adaptive nature of apps can go as far as to the possibility of tailoring the intervention components to individual end-users' characteristics and personalizing them in real time <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_sXQfg2Q">This perpetual beta state of mobile software is not only an inherent feature but also a requirement to adapt to the changing contextual circumstances which may at any time reverse the effectiveness of the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_3XHNhBe">Moreover, apps typically deliver complex interventions in terms of components, outcomes, and causal pathways <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_YvRXVKR">For instance, apps containing gamification elements were found to include a median of 14 different behavior change techniques (BCTs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[22]</ref>, which interact among them and may evolve as a result of technology or scientific advancement.</s><s xml:id="_MvWtSna">Each intervention may go as far as changing the behaviors of other family members other than the initial target only, and the impact on outcomes may be influenced by several different mediators and moderators.</s><s xml:id="_B2pFW3k">As such, the typical positivistic assumptions underpinning RCT study designs, based on a supposed causal relationship between the intervention and the outcomes of interest, are challenged in the context of app evaluations <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[23]</ref> by the host of mechanisms of change attainable through mHealth apps inherently linked to the social environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_njxMjbs">New features that are more suitable for digital technologies and possibly provide a better understanding of withinsubject differences have been proposed, including model-based designs of adaptive research, the use of factorial designs to assess the effectiveness of single intervention components, optimization strategies borrowed from engineering or other dataintensive domains, and the use of predictive modeling <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">25]</ref>, up to additional solutions to increase the efficiency of traditional RCTs <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[26]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_GHZdj6W">Nonetheless, the overwhelming majority of the few peer-reviewed studies are still adopting the RCT as the preferred design for the evaluation of mHealth apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[27]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_yBcTaYV"><s xml:id="_qGk85QV">Second, as for some medical devices and as noted in the previous paragraph, mHealth apps' efficacy depends not only on the product itself but also on how it is used.</s><s xml:id="_CjNk5CQ">While for medical devices (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_aTDGcE9">implantable medical devices) these user characteristics mainly refer to the health-care professionals' learning curve in administering them, in the case of apps the interventions are often directly managed by patients themselves.</s><s xml:id="_AgVUPmG">From an 'embodied technology' in the case of drugs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[17]</ref>, we have now moved toward a fully 'interactive technology,' where not only different individuals may develop different forms of interplay with the app, but the relationship between technology usage, engagement and outcomes is often non-linear <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_yBrb4fq">This entails that effective engagement can only be defined individually and that the same level of utilization (in terms of access metrics) may generate different outcomes according to individual characteristics, target groups, and interventions.</s><s xml:id="_T7DZz5Z">Whilst it is beyond dispute that the individual level of engagement with the app can produce decisive effects on outcomes, this makes the evidence generation process even more complex.</s><s xml:id="_Nk2wuRn">On top of generating the right level of engagement individually, the challenge with apps is to sustain it longitudinally.</s><s xml:id="_749eqqj">Retention is to mHealth apps as adherence is</s></p></div>

ii) it is particularly challenging to achieve a detailed specification of any mHealth app intervention and its components <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[18]</ref>, given the continuous evolution and the possibility to tailor several components to individual needs and preferences.</s><s xml:id="_RHkRKgv">As such, even apps designed for the same target population with comparable functionalities and mechanisms of action may generate differential outcomes due to apparently insignificant differences in design processes, observed usability, professional acceptability, and integration with humanled components.</s></p><p xml:id="_jA6uAMu"><s xml:id="_jqph3zZ">Compared to medical devices at large, apps may also have diagnostic potential by gauging signs and symptoms directly from lay people (i.e.</s><s xml:id="_w2AA732">patients and their caregivers).</s><s xml:id="_q8XrZks">In terms of app evaluation, this produces an additional need to assess and certify these inputs' reliability and the methods applied to collect them, which may generate valuable insights but also significant challenges by leveraging on the growing amount of available data <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[37]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fchXvr4">Further evaluation implications are symmetrical to what was previously emphasized for medical devices: the need to account for the value resulting from the treatment that follows diagnosis, and to appreciate apps' indivisibility across multiple potential applications.</s></p><p xml:id="_nqG5pf5"><s xml:id="_fktTSrw">Finally, prices for medical devices are more likely to fluctuate over time compared to those for drugs.</s><s xml:id="_A4HcFFX">In the case of apps, since advanced jurisdictions are starting to pilot prescription mechanisms just now <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[38]</ref>, there are no consolidated procurement mechanisms, yet.</s><s xml:id="_DdhRhJw">Unit prices for subscription to individual apps should be negligible (think of commercially available apps' fees as a benchmark), but to date, vendors have instead marketed their apps as an add-on service attached to a drug or a medical device.</s><s xml:id="_PYNkkTs">Of course, there are differences expected for standalone digital therapeutics but, if the paradigm of apps as an enhancement of currently available therapies will persist, the merging of apps with their originating technology will continue to generate extra challenges from a clinical and economic evaluation standpoint, making it difficult to predict the future trend in terms of pricing.</s><s xml:id="_xCq6zdj">Furthermore, price setting is challenging for mHealth apps also for reasons associated with costs.</s><s xml:id="_qPeV4gc">First, like most digital interventions, apps can rapidly change scale at minimal incremental cost compared to traditional technologies.</s><s xml:id="_ncCRVrf">Second, the cost structure of apps is different from the ones of commonly fixed products in the pharma and device industries: while research costs may be significantly lower compared to drugs and devices, the initial outflows for development, design and their multifold iterative steps are not negligible and must be accurately captured.</s><s xml:id="_7V78cxP">Third, specific costs associated with app interventions include the promotional costs to push the intervention uptake to secure that 'effective engagement' is reached and to sustain it longitudinally <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_yW4PV2M">However, cost-effectiveness analyses of mHealth apps have rarely been performed and the related evidence is still scant <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[39]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_dhtK8NC">Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> synthesizes the six analyzed domains and the associated challenges that distinguish the assessment of mHealth apps.</s></p></div>

or too many (e.g. if blurred boundaries persist between what must and must not be regulated) will flood the market with unchecked effectiveness on patients' health and quality of life, and poor retention rates darkening the future of this high-potential industry.</s></p><p xml:id="_b899XCr"><s xml:id="_YupDmcB">In regards to the evaluation for HTA purposes, the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence in the UK has recently adopted a more comprehensive approach and defined effectiveness and economic impact standards for all Digital Health Technologies (DHTs), by stratifying them into evidence tiers based on their main clinical function and corresponding risk levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[45]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_bjKVfUx">This and other experiences can be streamlined by the European network of HTA agencies (EUnetHTA), especially in view of the new EU HTA regulation that will likely come into force this year.</s></p><p xml:id="_3Ez6sEn"><s xml:id="_4Xz5ysB">In this scenario, decision makers and regulators should also be supported by non-governmental actors, that could foster emerging industry standards and rigorously review the numerous rating scales and frameworks that are the subject of a vivid scientific debate <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[46]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_68AX8zc"><s xml:id="_haB3t8r">The future of mHealth apps will also depend on how, besides the regulatory and HTA bodies, health-care providers and professionals will respond to procurement and organizational implications of their utilization.</s><s xml:id="_DK5QgMa">Once market authorization has been granted and efficacy has been checked, mHealth apps would need to be incorporated into routine practice to deliver their full potential and this can happen only under certain conditions.</s><s xml:id="_p3UU7uy">First, new models of organizing the production and delivery of health-care services must be developed.</s><s xml:id="_Gb2WfyS">mHealth has the potential to bridge the silos and connect different settings of care, substantially contributing to an integrated, cross-cutting care approach.</s><s xml:id="_m8Mcb82">Second, conventional procurement activities must develop into value-based, innovative practices aimed at assessing the added value of mHealth apps, especially when it is entangled in another technology.</s><s xml:id="_ABNrH8n">From the above, it follows that the conventional fee-for-service reimbursement schemes poorly capture the value of mHealth and other payment structures that offer greater flexibility need to be developed.</s></p><p xml:id="_vHmPxh4"><s xml:id="_ytpV3jA">With more smartphones (8.3 billion subscriptions in 2019) than people on the planet (7.7 billion in 2019) <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[47]</ref>, mHealth will definitely represent the main driver of the digital health revolution over the next years.</s><s xml:id="_hZtXnQx">What is less certain is the time needed for health-care systems to adapt to a new combination of analog and mobile services: this will mainly depend upon the degree of flexibility provided by health-care organizations and health-care professionals.</s><s xml:id="_3UCWxsr">No matter how we reach this new equilibrium, it is fundamental that none is left behind by the digital revolution as it happened with analog systems for several youth and adult chronic patients during the COVID-19 pandemic <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[50]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fp9bPBe">If mHealth could eliminate geographical distances, it can, at the same time, marginalize deprived social classes if left unregulated <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[51]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_shfR8cX"><s xml:id="_vv3n6Mj">A lot is at stake in the case of mHealth apps.</s><s xml:id="_TnHWcbS">Decision makers and regulatory bodies should extend their review beyond apps intended for medical use only.</s><s xml:id="_JFExem4">Adequate evaluation processes that take into account the inherent specificities of this class of health-care technologies will enhance the likelihood that the full potential of mHealth apps can be realized in the foreseeable future.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p xml:id="_sGveUJG"><s xml:id="_q4QQwp7">Challenges in the assessment of mHealth apps.</s></p></div></figDesc><table><row><cell>Domain</cell><cell>Associated challenges</cell></row><row><cell>I.
