coverage, which included Medicaid for individuals with incomes up to 100% of the federal poverty limit.</s><s xml:id="_8BRx3Eh">Because it was a state-by-state decision, some vulnerable populations were excluded, especially in states that had tight requirements for Medicaid eligibility.</s><s xml:id="_8dvdfPb">As of January 1, 2014, 29 states that adopted the ACA expansion extended Medicaid eligibility to individuals with incomes up to 138% of the FPL. 2 Additionally, ACA created state and federal health insurance exchanges for individuals with incomes between 138% and 400% FPL, providing premium tax credits and cost-sharing reductions to make private health insurance more affordable for those not eligible for Medicaid but cannot afford the full cost of regular health insurance.</s><s xml:id="_xrdmFcF">The ACA expansion is particularly crucial for addressing the financial challenges faced by low-to medium-income households.</s><s xml:id="_fdEjMeK">Housing

shown in column (6) of Table2.Column (5) lists the estimated treatment effect without household level controls X ist .The estimates in panel A of Table2show that the treatment effect of Medicaid
