2) the content or timing of behavioural support is adapted or tailored according to input (data) collected by the system since the support was initiated, also referred to as 'dynamic tailoring' <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> (e.g. an app which includes the use of location sensors such as a Global Positioning System [GPS] and senses that the user is near a green space where they can be active and their digital diary shows they are not busy); and 3) behavioural support is triggered by the system and not directly by users themselves (e.g. an unsolicited mobile app notification is sent in specific situations, for instance when the in-built accelerometer has sensed a prolonged period of sitting, as opposed to users opening the app).</s><s xml:id="_5NgmGwq">JITAIs differ from 'just-in-time' interventions and tailored support because 'just-in-time' interventions include features 1 and 2 but not 3; or features 1 and 3 but not 2. Likewise, tailored support interventions include features 2 and 3, but not 1.</s></p><p xml:id="_j62QPqm"><s xml:id="_EcTPrDZ">JITAIs have targeted, among others, eating disorders, mental illness, obesity and weight management, physical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and smoking cessation <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and are receiving increasing attention in the mHealth literature.</s><s xml:id="_rAYDY3J">JITAIs for physical activity are promising as they offer a different type of support to most existing interventions by their potential to intervene in response to changing contexts.</s><s xml:id="_zhdE63m">Physical activity is strongly influenced by context such as the built environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, which could be exploited by JITAIs.</s><s xml:id="_RvPNUf3">There is a need to synthesise what is known about JITAIs for physical activity to inform whether policy makers and healthcare providers should promote JITAIs for use in health and social care settings, and to identify evidence gaps to be addressed by research.</s><s xml:id="_Wwgt7kN">We identified two papers about the conceptualisation of JITAIs.</s><s xml:id="_mWNYyrq">Nahum-Shani et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> report two examples of JITAIs aimed at promoting physical activity or reducing sedentary behaviour, and Muller et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> identified three JITAIs aimed at increasing physical activity or reducing sedentary behaviour in older adults.</s><s xml:id="_s2zMRxf">However, neither conducted a systematic search for JITAIs and synthesised the evidence about the JITAIs around their effectiveness, feasibility or acceptability.</s><s xml:id="_gzwHbbJ">A recent systematic review focused on just-in-time feedback in diet and physical activity interventions, rather than JITAIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_TmKNCyC">We are not aware of any systematic reviews of JITAIs which specifically target physical activity.</s></p><p xml:id="_krsgsNn"><s xml:id="_xyGWmPc">The primary question for our systematic review was: (1) What are the features, feasibility, acceptability and effectiveness of JITAIs to promote physical activity?</s><s xml:id="_RMFSHGR">Secondary questions were: (2) Which delivery platforms have been used?; (3) Which groups or populations have been targeted?;</s><s xml:id="_qCcYXW5">(4) What are the active ingredients (behaviour change techniques) and theory base of JITAIs?;</s></p><p xml:id="_QnxJ6hR"><s xml:id="_2zGRtSz">(5) What is the uptake and reach of JITAIs, including any impact on health inequalities?; <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(6)</ref> What is the level of initial and sustained engagement with JITAIs, and how have people used them?; (7) Which research designs have been used to develop and evaluate JITAIs, and (8) Has any health economic evaluation or modelling been conducted?</s></p></div>
