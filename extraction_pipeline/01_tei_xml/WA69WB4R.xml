<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_ZbakryK">Discussion</head><p xml:id="_heSKxsX"><s xml:id="_ByKau9h">Simple and effective quality improvement interventions that can be rapidly scaled up within weak health systems in Africa remain urgently needed.</s><s xml:id="_YmrNpkk">We have shown that simple text-message reminders result in large, sustained improvements in paediatric malaria case-management <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and that this innovative intervention was well accepted by health workers <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tAGNjjN">However equally important for policy makers is the feasibility of implementing the intervention as part of routine practice and the associated financial costs to the government implementing the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_W6qjjQC">Our costeffectiveness analysis shows that under trial conditions, which are substantially higher that would be needed if implemented as routine practice, the cost per additional child correctly managed was only 0.5 USD.</s><s xml:id="_SME2AWe">Moreover, we estimated that scale-up to the national level by the Ministry of Health would require a budget of about 98,000 USD and with a cost of only 0.03 USD per additional child correctly managed.</s><s xml:id="_3RRzjtP">Sensitivity analysis at the national level suggests that the intervention would remain highly cost-effective (0.16 USD per additional child correctly managed) even if the program only improved malaria case-management by 5 percentage points.</s></p><p xml:id="_7yQcBhe"><s xml:id="_zaXGRwG">Very little evidence exists on the cost-effectiveness of interventions for improving adherence to malaria guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_D4z9Rr2">We are aware of only one study with similar outcomes where effects of educational strategy on retailers' adherence to antimalarial dispensing standards were tested in Kenya <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_FYjeFvh">The results of this study have shown 13 percentage points improvement in provider's adherence, with the cost per additional child correctly treated of 4.00 USD in the project area or 0.84 USD if intervention would be routinely implemented and expanded to the district level.</s><s xml:id="_XmzJ4s2">Our analysis of routine implementation in the study district (Scenario 2) suggested a cost of only 0.36 USD per additional child correctly managed.</s></p><p xml:id="_En9pQat"><s xml:id="_QtXrS7g">Importantly, an overall intervention cost on the national scale of 98,000 USD would represent only 1% of the 10 million USD awarded by The Global Fund to the Kenyan Ministry of Health to strengthen malaria case-management between 2011 and 2015 and therefore represents a reasonable and affordable expenditure.</s><s xml:id="_TeARsSw">Availability of funding, the feasibility, effectiveness, and low cost of the intervention suggest that Kenya could consider national scaleup in the near future.</s><s xml:id="_jkqT7dh">In addition, the intervention can be viewed as a complement to, rather than a replacement of, existing programmes to strengthen malaria case-management.</s></p><p xml:id="_wDgAfGX"><s xml:id="_yxZzU3M">Alongside the future scale-up, several questions with respect to text-messaging need to be addressed by further research.</s><s xml:id="_nBwtgSh">First, what is a reasonable frequency and duration of a text-message reminder intervention?</s><s xml:id="_taUqHVT">Despite our findings that the intervention was not burdensome and was indeed well accepted by health workers, sending 2 messages daily for 5 days a week over 26 weeks to each health worker leaves limited space for other similar, nonmalaria quality improvement interventions.</s><s xml:id="_vaHPUcJ">Second, what is the effectiveness of the intervention around new ''test and treat'' malaria case-management policy as opposed to the presumptive policy tested under the trial conditions?</s><s xml:id="_85kdDTQ">Theoretical constructs suggest that reminders are mainly effective at the action and maintenance stages of behavior change, while they are less likely to be effective in changing practices that have not yet been accepted as clinical norms such as adherence to test negative results <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_RpyDNat">Third, would this intervention be equally effective in patients 5 years and older as it has been shown for young children?</s><s xml:id="_WdKcjef">Older children and adults are the category of patients where nonadherence to guidelines has been frequently reported <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>, and with a decline of malaria transmission the correct management is becoming equally important.</s><s xml:id="_USWUf7H">Fourth, despite encouraging findings that the intervention effects were sustained 6 months following termination of the intervention, longer term studies are required to confirm whether one-time delivery of the intervention presents an optimum mode of delivery or perhaps periodic delivery (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_t8VuRck">every 2-3 years) would be required to maintain long-term effectiveness.</s></p><p xml:id="_bJfCPZ7"><s xml:id="_X7fcdrH">Finally and perhaps most importantly, can we develop an effective text-message intervention addressing integrated management of the most common outpatient diseases?</s><s xml:id="_HFqgJhX">Such intervention may improve management of non-malaria conditions but would also facilitate adherence to malaria guidelines, e.g.</s><s xml:id="_d8Yabm5">health workers are more likely to adhere to test negative results if they are reminded of appropriate management of other conditions.</s></p></div>
