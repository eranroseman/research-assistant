<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_tMf7vKp">Discussion</head><p xml:id="_bVd9VkM"><s xml:id="_ByJYD2V">Overall, while patients and clinicians found COVID Watch to be comforting and beneficial, improvements to the design and implementation of the program will be important for the program's future and have implications for the design of future remote patient monitoring programs.</s><s xml:id="_QxWbAD9">COVID Watch often provided a sense of comfort and reassurance to both patients and clinicians.</s><s xml:id="_bAhdqdf">This is a shared sentiment across prior qualitative evaluations of remote patient monitoring programs developed for COVID-19 <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7p9Ur2u">For COVID Watch specifically, the increased access to care due to its free cost and Spanishlanguage availability were vital.</s><s xml:id="_UMQvTyH">Despite their enthusiasm, patients and clinicians desired a better user experience, at times sharing common suggestions for the program.</s></p><p xml:id="_nE6YUMF"><s xml:id="_ANNXFqE">Patients wanted more clarity about when and how they were enrolled in the program.</s><s xml:id="_22Beq9M">The confusion over enrollment may have contributed to lower engagement in the program and may have lowered perceptions of its utility.</s><s xml:id="_XQaqUc8">Both patients and clinicians desired a guide for patients, indicating when care would likely be escalated or when staying at home would be safe.</s><s xml:id="_wsrBMbc">Another suggestion from both patients and clinicians was a desire for quantitative data that would provide a threshold for when to escalate care.</s><s xml:id="_NQxgwg8">In addition, similar to other remote patient monitoring programs for COVID-19, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> patients and clinicians thought it would be beneficial to monitor symptoms other than breathing.</s><s xml:id="_XYneCe3">Patients and clinicians also desired the program to build in flexibility, expressing concerns about the universal use of automated text messages for patients.</s><s xml:id="_uPn7Vp4">For example, the program may have had limited uptake among patients who had reticence about using technology to communicate their health needs, limited English or Spanish literacy, or preferred additional languages.</s><s xml:id="_hurXuVS">These subgroups are among those who are historically at increased risk for limited access to care and experienced worse COVID-19 outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_H6t9qAQ"><s xml:id="_BMKXnjd">Our findings have generated three key insights for future remote patient monitoring programs to manage COVID-19 or other clinical conditions.</s><s xml:id="_nrRC3FA">First, remote patient monitoring programs should not be static, onetime builds or implementations.</s><s xml:id="_fTY68MP">While these programs may have automation or use digitized algorithms, they are human facing programs that should evolve as technology advances, patient and clinician expectations of technology evolve, and standards for managing targeted disease conditions change.</s><s xml:id="_64kEvr8">Developing systems for monitoring program performance and patient engagement and seeking patient and clinician feedback to continuously refine these programs are as important as achieving intended health outcomes.</s></p><p xml:id="_FQuZRRh"><s xml:id="_dUpmbFA">Second, health systems must acknowledge the human resources needed to support remote patient monitoring programs, even if automation is embedded in the program.</s><s xml:id="_RMSEM8U">While automation can improve efficiency for some patients, successful programs will need to marry technology with options for human interaction.</s><s xml:id="_MnAVByc">Tech-first approaches may not always be welcomed.</s><s xml:id="_W7RtVk4">Some patients in our study indicated the desire to connect with a human clinician, wanting to avoid the automated text message system more generally.</s><s xml:id="_SHUPdsK">Yet, at the same time, automation allowed for a team of 3-4 nurses to simultaneously manage efficiently and effectively over one thousand patients during the staffing shortages of the pandemic, <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> a challenge projected to remain over the coming years <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_nkbdBne">Using default pathways (e.g., text messages) that are automated, complemented by alternative pathways (e.g., interactive voice recordings or human-to-human phone calls) that are customized to the user's needs, may be one solution for greater engagement while not overburdening current clinicians.</s></p><p xml:id="_spdvZEF"><s xml:id="_pcH8GPX">Finally, future programs must be designed with equity as a primary principle, recognizing patients who have the most limited access to care may need additional design considerations.</s><s xml:id="_Q2CyZNP">For example, programs should be offered in multiple languages.</s><s xml:id="_4gzk5JR">In our study both patients and clinicians expressed concerns that vulnerable populations may have been excluded because more direct human-tohuman connections (e.g., telephone calls) were not made available.</s><s xml:id="_Mr8krYd">Developing programs that correctly balance patients' desires for human-to-human connections, promoting inclusivity, with the efficiency gains of automated processes will be important for future remote patient monitoring programs.</s></p><p xml:id="_PHM7cjU"><s xml:id="_8FZr7sy">This study has limitations.</s><s xml:id="_6ZZVJCP">Our analysis took place in one large academic institution.</s><s xml:id="_X4mzBGh">However, the institution includes six hospitals and over 500 outpatient practices across a wide geographic area, allowing us to sample participants from multiple hospitals, encompassing urban and suburban settings across the large catchment area.</s><s xml:id="_fFgeJKk">These interviews took place relatively early in the pandemic -within the first year -and therefore reflect the stress that both patients and clinicians felt when faced with an unprecedented crisis.</s><s xml:id="_AKqpdYA">Finally, patients' and clinicians' experiences with COVID Watch and COVID-19 evolved during the study period such as the implementation of automated and opt-out enrollment in the fall of 2020.</s><s xml:id="_S3gc9rD">In addition, surges of infection, the increased availability of vaccination, and effective treatments might have influenced our participants' responses.</s></p><p xml:id="_sRjcTVC"><s xml:id="_NmKMQeP">Remote patient monitoring programs are increasingly available and are being tested for a variety of clinical conditions including hypertension management, in-home administration of chemotherapy, and transitions between hospital and home.</s><s xml:id="_2AZZJVE">In addition, success of these programs hinges on user-centered design to enhance experiences for both patients and clinicians <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> as well as intentional design for marginalized groups who have not historically been considered as early adopters of new technology-based care programs <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_UgG2snr">Understanding how a diverse group of patients engage with and experience remote patient monitoring programs, and how clinicians integrate them into daily workflow and clinical decision-making will be informative for future remote patient monitoring programs.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_2"><head>Table 2</head><label>2</label><figDesc><div><p xml:id="_8nd5HeN"><s
