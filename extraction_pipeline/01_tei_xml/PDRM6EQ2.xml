<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_excAPE8">Background</head><p xml:id="_Enp5zVp"><s xml:id="_KhYEhvS">With a growing interest in chatbots based on various digital platforms such as websites, social channels, and mobile apps, a wide range of gratifications have been suggested as motivators of chatbot use.</s><s xml:id="_BxSPvp2">In general, productivity is considered to be a key factor in driving chatbot use, which means that the ease, speed, and convenience of using chatbots can help their users, who seek instant gratification via quick and consistent feedback and dialogue to obtain information or assistance in a timely and efficient manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_jkCbA3s">Particularly, medical chatbots as a virtual doctor or educator have been built to reduce the burden of health care costs, improve the accessibility of medical knowledge, and empower patients with their medical decision-making process <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_sYUMdmF">When it comes to developing medical chatbots using artificial intelligence (AI), a number of previous studies have focused on not only accurate prediction, diagnosis, or personalized management and treatment of diseases based on their symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, but also conversational agent role in social and emotional support and mental health interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_z8p2Rz4">However, the major challenge perceived by more than 70% of the medical physicians in one study is the inability of health care chatbots to address the full extent of a patient's needs and understand or display the emotional state of humans <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_sHdtTF6">Furthermore, common concerns on inaccurate and inflexible information that chatbots provided have been raised <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_sNaX4PA">Despite these continuous attempts to provide patients with better user experience (UX) on informational and emotional support, both costs and benefits are still associated with the use of medical chatbots.</s></p><p xml:id="_jrFES2n"><s xml:id="_jeBKsyE">In addition to productivity, entertainment, and social or relational benefits, there are other main motivations to use chatbots, which are considered to be more humanlike than other interactive systems designed to support enjoyable social interactions <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9qgbEDa">As patients with lower health literacy are more likely to use and trust informal health information sources, such as television, social media, friends, blogs, celebrity webpages, and pharmaceutical companies, than formal ones such as doctors and health professionals <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, medical chatbots are required to provide their users with evidence-based health information as answers to questions from them.</s><s xml:id="_ZCEhmSt">Given that the majority of pregnant women tend to use multiple information sources for their antenatal and postnatal care <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>, obtaining conflicting information can increase anxiety levels or add uncertainty on whether or not to use a medication <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_nrVVXqU">In fact, the attention of prenatal women seeking informal information or multiple information from multiple sources can be readily directed to social and emotional support from other experienced mothers and friends who have been in a similar situation, but they can experience stigma and receive inappropriate support due to their lack of related knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_95RfpZm">As more and more online communities have formed with huge numbers of female members who have undergone many different situations during pregnancy and childbirth, maintaining social interaction with their peers can encourage perinatal women to satisfy their curiosity and interests in specific information and content, which is thus perceived as an immediate and enjoyable daily activity.</s><s xml:id="_h6MMAYB">In turn, it means that medical chatbots with the characteristics of these peers, as well as a valid, accurate, and credible medical knowledge database, can be more likely to capture perinatal women's attention when encountering medical problems.</s></p><p xml:id="_wE3Ma8X"><s xml:id="_8qUATQ4">To encourage people to adopt and use medical chatbots, both content quality and expertise of the chatbots should be first considered in the development process.</s><s xml:id="_4hxqCqm">From the perspective of utilitarian and hedonic value, content quality has strongly positive effects on perceived usefulness and enjoyment, both of which influence users' usage intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8pQ4HqV">Perceived expertise of the medical chatbots can increase the users' trust in the chatbots, which in turn affects their continuance intention to use the service agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NqJZBt8">In addition to the effort to improve a chatbot's content quality and expertise, it is also important to iteratively evaluate its usability and UX, both in the development process and after the completion of its development.</s><s xml:id="_9ENjJ9B">According to Lund, who developed the Usefulness, Satisfaction, and Ease of Use (USE) Questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, ease of use and usefulness influence each other and drive satisfaction strongly related to predicted and actual usage; ease of use can be separated into two factors, ease of use (EOU) and ease of learning (EOL), if the systems to be assessed are internal systems that its users are required to use.</s><s xml:id="_HgRHErE">However, it is less likely that the two factors will be highly correlated for this chatbot based on a mobile instant messenger (MIM), as it is a flexible system used in different contexts and for different needs of individuals.</s><s xml:id="_3ZkQcaf">Furthermore, a wide range of satisfaction dimensions (ie, productivity, entertainment, social or relational benefit, etc) can serve as motivators of chatbot use <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, and therefore, there is a need to identify these motivations or any other barriers associated with the users' intention to seek and share health information on the medical chatbot via MIM.</s></p><p xml:id="_KrzfDSy"><s xml:id="_s9ExmHd">From the findings of a previous study based on a net valence model <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, perceived benefits were positively related to the intention to seek and share health information in social media in both Chinese and Italian samples, but only the Chinese sample showed a negative relationship between perceived risk and the intention to share health information.</s><s xml:id="_GCNdYSa">Until recently, little was known about the relationship between the variables in MIM-based medical chatbot use in a Korean sample.</s><s xml:id="_KJPbxzq">Considering that a MIM app such as KakaoTalk, which is the most popular in South Korea, is more private than other social media platforms such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitter, it is expected that the negative relationship between the variables will not be observed in this study sample.</s><s xml:id="_UGaYxzF">However, it is challenging to explore the motivators and barriers to chatbot use in everyday life, not in experimental contexts, and its associations with different intention behaviors by applying a single quantitative or qualitative method, particularly in contextual usability testing (UT) without the intervention of a facilitator.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_gp2ptSs">Objectives</head><p xml:id="_zwqSmDg"><s xml:id="_WeW8s2f">Taken together, the primary purpose of this study is to develop a user-centered question-and-answer (Q&amp;A) knowledge database-based chatbot for perinatal women's and their partners' obstetric and mental health care by applying a text-mining technique.</s><s xml:id="_2gKRZWU">The secondary purpose is to evaluate it by conducting contextual UT, thereby measuring the perception of usability and UX and their associations with motivators and barriers to chatbot use and different intention behaviors and obtaining theoretical and practical implications to supplement the weaknesses of this chatbot.</s><s xml:id="_5V2XmBe">Based on relevant literature, we hypothesize that this chatbot will produce both utilitarian and hedonic value during the 7-day contextual UT period.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_yjUPdKc">Methods</head></div>

service, thus increasing reliability.</s><s xml:id="_hjB4vn6">In order to create a domain-specific or context-based chatbot to provide optimal, up-to-date answers immediately, the high-quality chatbot knowledge was extracted from social networking services such as Twitter <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, online discussion forums as web communities <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>, and messengers <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Wg4zsTs">Similar to our approach, Jeong and Seo <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> proposed a keyword matching-based answer retrieval technique based on the collection of Q&amp;A sets from Twitter by utilizing the tweet-and-reply and the tweet-and-mention pairs and the refinement of the newly collected pairs by adding them to the existing Q&amp;A knowledge database.</s><s xml:id="_FSJegus">As these related works focused on developing the Q&amp;A chatbots' answer retrieval technique to provide more accurate and flexible answers to their users, the response appropriateness of each chatbot based on quantitative data such as self-report questionnaire <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> or recall and precision measurement <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> was evaluated.</s><s xml:id="_tqtsYn3">While these proposed knowledge databases and answer retrieval techniques for Q&amp;A chatbots were appropriate to be applied to general health care or lifecare services whose target users and content coverage were not specified, there have also been a variety of informative chatbots designed for the specific purposes of supporting pregnant women and mothers or families with young children in emergency situations <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and providing low-cost accessible fertility and preconception health education for perinatal women <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> or

and social or relational benefits have been regarded as other main motivations for chatbot use <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, the chatbot can make the process of seeking medical help enjoyable and improve the relationships between couples who need social support from their partners or care for their mental state when undergoing a stressful situation.</s><s xml:id="_CCZZy8J">Particularly in this study, the recommendation of evidence-based digital therapeutics, fetal education, and useful tips applicable in their daily life, as well as the establishment of a specialized medical knowledge database which fits the personal interests of women and their partners, was of great importance in developing a medical chatbot to promote their physical and mental health in the perinatal period.</s><s xml:id="_Z8AXnuu">In the development of the first version of Dr. Joy, we focused more on enhancing and assessing the utilitarian and hedonic quality of the KakaoTalk-based Q&amp;A chatbot as follows: (1) by building and expanding its own Q&amp;A knowledge database with questions that were collected from peer pregnant women's and mothers' posts in an online community for prenatal, postnatal, and maternal care via the text-mining technique and were answered by medical specialists in the field of infertility, obstetrics and gynecology, and psychiatry; (2) by suggesting 3 optional Q&amp;A pairs in response to the question queries of women and their partners in the perinatal period via kakao's similarity inference engine for assessing semantic similarity between the new query and the existing Q&amp;A sets;</s></p><p xml:id="_wwfTPbg"><s xml:id="_hVFagEb">(3) by providing them with dialogue-based procedural recommendations and helping easily apply the knowledge to either themselves or their partners; and (4) by defining the chatbot's identity as a medical doctor and maintaining a differentiated tone, manner, and UI when responding directly to the query and when dealing with social support-and mental health-related issues.</s><s xml:id="_8crcXp2">Unlike the developed chatbots and their approaches in the aforementioned studies, this study took into account three user motivations (ie, productivity, entertainment, and social or relational benefits) and two UX values (ie, utilitarian and hedonic values) at the same level in the process of developing and assessing this medical chatbot, respectively.</s></p><p xml:id="_hQvxb4t"><s xml:id="_fhDgtEs">The main finding of this study was that both utilitarian and hedonic value could be produced by this newly developed Q&amp;A knowledge database-based chatbot for perinatal women's and their partners' obstetric and mental health care during the 7-day contextual UT period.</s><s xml:id="_aWT9DNB">According to the results of the USE questionnaire, it was found that Dr. Joy was very easy to learn and quick to apply, while achieving a high level of usefulness, EOU, satisfaction, and total usability was not guaranteed by its high learnability.</s><s xml:id="_E9Yd4dw">However, given the strong associations among these 3 usability subfactors and total usability scores, it can be expected that an increase in the level of one or more usability subfactors will ensure good usability.</s><s xml:id="_4PwsFkC">The weak association between EOL and other subfactors also reflects that this KakaoTalk-based chatbot is a flexible system used in different contexts and for different needs of individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_yMVbp45">As perceived usefulness, as well as perceived enjoyment, can be strongly affected by content quality as one of influential determinants of usage intention <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, Dr. Joy could provide its users with more intriguing content in its multiple Q&amp;A responses based on the Q&amp;A knowledge database to motivate them to acquire credible knowledge, even if the response outcomes might be a little out of line with what they expected.</s><s xml:id="_KST6PbV">As reflected in the responses to the open-ended question about the strengths of Dr. Joy, participants highlighted not only the hedonic value as represented by fun, pleasure, and enjoyment, but also the utilitarian value as represented by usefulness, speed and ease to use, and convenience.</s><s xml:id="_ztSCquS">In terms of its weaknesses, participants who asked questions beyond the coverage of our Q&amp;A knowledge database pointed out that Dr. Joy with medical expertise had to suggest the right set of answers that successfully aligned with user intent, thereby enhancing its users' trust in and their continued usage intention for the chatbot <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_q9r7kZC">In this respect, the improvement in the quality of its Q&amp;A set contents is of utmost importance.</s></p><p xml:id="_BbGf6Kb"><s xml:id="_m56YphU">Another finding was that the negative association between the perceived benefits and risks of using Dr. Joy was not significantly strong enough to influence behavioral intention in a negative direction.</s><s xml:id="_3CTbdDX">Furthermore, Dr. Joy led its users to perceive a low level of risks that discussing health-related information on this medical chatbot via KakaoTalk would confront them with unwanted problems or that the expected benefits of doing so would not materialize.</s><s xml:id="_Pb54Nww">With a low possibility of trade-off between benefit and risk, the different intentions to seek and share health information on Dr. Joy were significantly associated only with the perceived benefits, not with the perceived risks.</s><s xml:id="_6xQg9Td">The more its users think Dr. Joy can benefit them, the more likely they are to seek and share information from it.</s><s xml:id="_db2cz8U">Compared to women, who scored SEE and SHA at similar level, the men had more intention to seek health information on medical chatbot via KakaoTalk than the women.</s><s xml:id="_9cfca7g">This might be because the male partners have comparatively less opportunity to access information sources than perinatal women, who have tended to seek medical help from multiple informal and formal sources <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_kkJ5ar4">As pregnant women's partners, our male participants, whose main source of pregnancy or delivery information was books such as encyclopedias of pregnancy and birth or essays written by medical doctors, were less likely to show the tendency to double-check information from other sources by sharing Dr. Joy's relatively more credible information verified by health professionals.</s><s xml:id="_VFhYBYR">In line with the findings of our previous study <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, it can be explained that female participants, who reported relying more on multiple word-of-mouth sources of information and less on health professionals, were highly likely to share many concerns that they were reluctant to discuss with their doctors in the outpatient clinic, particularly with this KakaoTalk chatbot with a humanlike medical doctor persona.</s></p><p xml:id="_tandgh9"><s xml:id="_59Sh4ms">In addition to these theoretical implications, the qualitative data suggested empirical implications for developing the next version of Dr. Joy.</s><s xml:id="_MgxY7ma">The main Q&amp;A feature of this version of the informative medical chatbot was based on the response selection for a single-turn conversation, thereby intending to elicit no specific conversational responses to the given Q&amp;A sets from the users.</s><s xml:id="_XxdDV8u">Nevertheless, 6 (40%) out of 15 participants showed a positive, polite attitude toward the chatbot's answers, as if the participants had asked private questions with more personal information and responded to their doctors to show that they would follow their answers in reality (Thank you; Yes!; I got it; OK, I see it; Sure, I will; I need to keep it properly).</s><s xml:id="_nQvMdsD">Surprisingly, none of the participants left any negative feedback or rude, abusive utterances (eg, curses or insults) to the Q&amp;A sets that might not meet their real intent in asking questions.</s><s xml:id="_vYvXvfj">This might be because the participants could not completely rule out the possibility that all their utterances would be monitored by the facilitator or researchers for the purpose of the data analysis.</s><s xml:id="_nwu4t64">Despite the concern of the Hawthorne effect, these behaviors might also reflect that some users perceived Dr. Joy to be a social agent to maintain a doctor-patient-like relationship with the chatbot.</s><s xml:id="_mTYW8xY">As the greatest advantage of this mobile chatbot is that chatbot designers and developers can readily collect the users' dialog inputs that were not added to the dialog blocks in advance, it can be expected to update the users' utterance data for machine learning purposes and the chatbot's dialog outputs and conversational UI, as well as the content values that reside in the knowledge base on a regular cycle.</s><s xml:id="_zvKutKZ">Particularly in terms of regular updates of the contents of Q&amp;A sets, nonmedical but pregnancy-related subjects (eg, pronatalist policies for increasing fertility and birth rate) extracted from active users' dialog input logs should be included to increase user retention and engagement and to decrease anxiety levels by clarifying the uncertainty of conflicting information from multiple sources, based on previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_Hp2Jdu6"><s xml:id="_3t4w8YZ">Last but not least, this study found that the male partners had needs for emotional support and information in

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_MTpmUcQ">Limitations and Future Direction</head><p xml:id="_QcBTW9P"><s xml:id="_uujrPGm">As this study introduced an early-stage outcome of a government-funded research and development (R&amp;D) project whose milestone was to investigate at least 10 perinatal women's uptake of this initial version of Dr. Joy, the sample size of the study (N=15) was too small and its sex ratio was too unbalanced to generalize the findings to a larger population and guarantee the effectiveness of the medical Q&amp;A chatbot, in spite of both male and female participants' positive perceptions of the chatbot.</s><s xml:id="_gFdJVCF">Even though it is well-known that this sample size is enough to find out the practical implications for improving the UX of this chatbot based on its end users' real voice and log data <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>, this study has further limitations as follows:</s></p><p xml:id="_6Gc4u5c"><s xml:id="_HpCTtBa">First, the user utterance data from the small sample might be insufficient to accumulate Q&amp;A data sets of a wide variety of pregnant women's and their partners' questions and concerns differently expressed with their own terms and in their own problematic situations, because Dr. Joy was designed to cover a wide range of pregnancy-and delivery-related information that was classified into 6 subjects.</s><s xml:id="_JmT5p5m">After the update of the Q&amp;A sets via this usability study, the aim of this R&amp;D project is to increase the number of active chatbot users by at least 100, collect more utterance data, and keep the Q&amp;A knowledge base up to date.</s><s xml:id="_b7ZXmRt">Comparison between the perception of Dr. Joy before it was initially released and that after being updated will be drawn to examine its robust uptake and the favorable perception of its utilitarian and hedonic value.</s></p><p xml:id="_kDwUJbc"><s xml:id="_9gcWbFs">Second, Dr. Joy is geared toward encouraging perinatal women relying on multiple informal information sources to obtain evidence-based information for decision support.</s><s xml:id="_f2hpn8V">For this reason, we only recruited a small number of targeted participants by adopting two different convenience sampling methods to refrain from recruiting only the patients who established a good rapport with the medical doctors involved in the development of Dr. Joy, or those whose main information source was solely their doctors.</s><s xml:id="_6UTcrdT">However, a relatively small sample is potentially biased given the nonprobability sampling method where the sample can be taken from the units of the population that are easily accessible, thus failing to accurately reflect the responses of a large population.</s><s xml:id="_aquRJKX">To deal with this potential bias of the study sample, the right probability sampling methods such as simple random sampling or clustering sampling will be used with a large sample size in future studies.</s></p><p xml:id="_fRAYKVJ"><s xml:id="_zEAEPm3">Finally, considering that a full-term pregnancy lasts 38 weeks or longer, a 7-day study period is insufficient to assess whether Dr. Joy can improve the participants' knowledge, answer their questions effectively, or be useful for certain tasks, even if the participants provided positive usability and UX ratings in this study.</s><s xml:id="_nYeN37S">To answer these research questions, which remain open for future studies, a perinatal and mental health-related variable should be directly adopted in the short-term study period, or a more longitudinal evaluation should be performed.</s><s xml:id="_RpXEVAw">Taken together, future studies will benefit from addressing these limitations.</s></p></div>
