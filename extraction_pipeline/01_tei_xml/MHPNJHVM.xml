Medical Device Regulation and assesses the specific risks arising from the gamified nature of these apps.</s><s xml:id="_Re3xFh7">Of the identified apps, 32 (46.4%) were considered non-medical devices; seven (10.1%) were already cleared/approved by the regulatory authorities, and 31 (44.9%)</s><s xml:id="_sr2vumc">apps were assessed as likely non-compliant or potentially non-compliant with

type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref> and was extended by Sailer et al. in 2017, who defined gamification as the "[…] process of making activities in non-game contexts more gamelike by using game design elements 4 ."</s><s xml:id="_SEkpEyw">SGs, however, are inspired by entertainment games in appearance and technology and often need specific hardware (e.g., powerful computers, VR headsets, or gaming controllers) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_CsJBv4E">In contrast, gamified apps utilize game elements like points, badges, high scores, leaderboards, and storytelling 4 and generally have cheaper development and fewer hardware constraints than serious games.</s><s xml:id="_NJQrwp2">The differences in and application of these approaches are described in Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_d9aZWDc"><s xml:id="_pxBme4k">The number of gamified apps on the market is growing <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> , with many examples among fitness, business, and education apps
