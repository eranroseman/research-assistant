to determine whether a change in anti-hypertensives is warranted.</s><s xml:id="_umHcGyC">Despite their beliefs in the strong evidence behind SMBP, there was underutilization of SMBP due to logistical barriers and lack of resources and trained personnel to help with SMBP.</s><s xml:id="_b8sNqPs">They also identified ways to systematically address these barriers to increase adoption of SMBP.</s><s

strategies to implement SMBP.</s><s xml:id="_YYkkmkX">Out of clinic BP, both ambulatory BP and SMBP, are recommended in hypertension guidelines.</s><s xml:id="_nAauBSC">We focused on SMBP instead of ambulatory BP monitoring as ambulatory BP monitoring is often not well tolerated by patients, more resource intensive, available in specialized clinics only and not easily scalable <ref type="bibr"

in other studies.</s></p><p xml:id="_WthkcJv"><s xml:id="_7MH95kf">Our study identified multiple barriers at different levels with the current systems and policies that prohibit successful implementation of SMBP.</s><s xml:id="_TPUQx8G">Under motivation we found that increased workload without additional support staff to train patients on SMBP and follow SMBP readings in an already busy clinic, lack of well-defined protocols for SMBP, lack of detail in the guidelines for SMBP, and cost of BP cuffs were common barriers.</s><s xml:id="_ww589RW">New CPT codes 99473 and 99474 introduced in year 2020 might help with physician incentives but are not likely to solve these barriers.</s><s xml:id="_X95vuJm">Physicians experienced a high degree of stress and perceived burden in managing

xml:id="_HWMHYtv">Lack of interdisciplinary teamwork, including training and support of other staff to fulfill the role expectations that physicians believe is necessary was a major barrier.</s><s xml:id="_Y7rEUWE">Further, physicians helped highlight barriers at an organizational level.</s><s xml:id="_9cjSn2t">Even though the health system is ideally suited for SMBP, with an excellent electronic medical record system, high patient portal use, physicians who believe in SMBP, largely insured patients, and ongoing institutional initiatives to improve BP control, very few physicians routinely use SMBP (Table <ref type="table">1</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_EUY5zyn">Incentives by insurers [50] have prioritized improving hypertension management by health systems and health systems have incorporated tools to facilitate reporting of SMBP.</s><s xml:id="_h3cVvhc">However, our study suggests that financial incentives, while helpful, may only be part of the solution.</s><s xml:id="_nvYtSd4">Few physicians in our study used the tools provided by the health system, suggesting the need for better strategies to monitor SMBP.</s><s xml:id="_2fdMNse">Our interviews indicated that health system approaches (such as use of a patient portal for entering SMBP) may not be ideal solutions and present additional barriers, particularly for older adults.</s><s

xml:id="_tr6cnaN">Prior studies indicate that nurses or pharmacists can manage SMBP, but our study indicated that they might need additional training to fulfil these roles.</s><s xml:id="_yNA4Gzj">Patients seen in clinics often have more complex medical issues than participants in clinical trials (where patients with multimorbidity are often excluded), and management of SMBP in the real world may need more training and expertise.</s></p><p xml:id="_ZKWGMAQ"><s xml:id="_75Rbf5Y">Compared to previous studies using surveys and questionnaires, our interviews also helped us obtain more information on major facilitators for SMBP.</s><s xml:id="_YrhPz3g">Under motivation we found that physicians strongly believed in positive outcomes associated with SMBP over current methods to manage BP, and desired to incorporate SMBP in their practice.</s><s xml:id="_VeashZD">Physician engagement in SMBP is important as adherence to SMBP by patients is significantly higher if their physicians recommend it <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">58]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_we8MrNY">Under opportunities, we confirmed that successful implementation of SMBP will require a team approach, efficient data systems, performance assessments, and standardized protocols along with well thought out strategies; all of which are not easy without the support of the organization <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[59]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[60]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[61]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_crXqwsd">Under capabilities we identified the areas where additional health care professionals can be trained to develop a multi-disciplinary team to implement SMBP.</s><s xml:id="_56Kztdz">Our study indicates that environmental restructuring and enablement, through adding trained support to care team, physician teams can educate patients on cuff size, the correct method for SMBP, and lifestyle modifications to ultimately improve patient engagement and empowerment <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_myg3wNh"><s xml:id="_yBEybP2">With stakeholders such as patients, physicians, health systems, and insurers interested in adopting SMBP, practical scalable strategies are needed.</s><s xml:id="_jzxhQz8">A systematic implementation sciencebased approach can integrate evidence-based SMBP in the real world.</s><s xml:id="_DtsECa2">With the strong evidence backing SMBP, more efforts need to be placed in testing pragmatic effectiveness and implementation studies incorporating education and clear protocols for interpretation and management of SMBP <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[62]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_kJvBfkU"><s xml:id="_cr6wgDg">A limitation of this study is inclusion of PCPs from a single health system.</s><s xml:id="_53uk2cF">However, this also helped with detailed interviews and meaningful discussions that can lead to actionable steps towards developing an implementation strategy.</s><s xml:id="_VZ2u7mu">Moreover, the respondents were a mix of both academic and community physicians from the largest health system in the area.</s><s xml:id="_6ymNmUn">Most of our respondents (88%) were women, limiting generalizability.</s><s xml:id="_8zmsKZP">Our interviews were voluntary and non-incentivized, which could have limited participation.</s><s

practical strategies to implement SMBP.</s><s xml:id="_JR9ZaKA">We did not specifically ask about BP device loaner programs or the new CPT codes 99473 and 99474 introduced in year 2020 to help SMBP.</s><s xml:id="_69mVeCQ">However, none of the physicians mentioned the codes, which might indicate that use of the codes may not be widespread yet.</s></p><p xml:id="_9GnjJTS"><s xml:id="_FDCKzK3">In conclusion, understanding physician perspective and reasons for their inability to implement SMBP (despite their belief in SMBP) is essential to develop and successfully implement strategies for SMBP.</s><s xml:id="_G5EsbGC">PCPs feel that SMBP is a useful tool to manage hypertension that is underutilized due to lack of workflow, support, patient education and engagement, team training, protocols, and financing of BP cuffs.</s><s xml:id="_WCrnhx7">These barriers can be addressed by using efficient, user-friendly technology to obtain SMBP readings and developing a collaborative team specifically trained for SMBP.</s><s xml:id="_vkhdZA7">Some of the cost savings in healthcare utilization with improved BP control can be directed towards purchase of BP cuffs by
