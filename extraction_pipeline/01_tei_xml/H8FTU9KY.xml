by the participating NGOs as active in their community-were invited to attend the CYC meetings.</s><s xml:id="_JVbpEJ3">Five attended regularly but were not active participants, due to the cultural deference to age.</s><s xml:id="_Q5KZXGT">In order to empower the youth, a Palestinian Youth Coalition (PYC) was established in Burj El Barajneh camp.</s><s xml:id="_k4cTV96">This coalition included all the youth (18) and selected two to represent them at CYC meetings.</s></p><p xml:id="_8CfhrYC"><s xml:id="_F3QNshq">The CYC committee established internal rules and regulations regarding membership, attendance, voting and decision making that were thoroughly discussed and agreed upon in June 2006.</s><s xml:id="_vPpY6cY">When needed, subcommittees were established to enhance the efficiency of work on specific tasks.</s><s xml:id="_bwfUUxb">The agenda for each meeting was developed by the academic team and additions were made by CYC members when needed.</s><s

reflections as well as any decision taken.</s><s xml:id="_Pp65jTZ">The running notes, and minutes, provided a rich history of the ideas, debates and decisions at every stage of the planning, implementation and evaluation of the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_TEstWgT">Issues were discussed thoroughly in the meetings and often spilled over to following meetings.</s><s xml:id="_U9NP48t">Whenever possible, decisions were arrived at through consensus.</s><s xml:id="_EWqUBqf">When divergent viewpoints were strong, a vote was taken, where majority rule applied.</s><s xml:id="_MVkPM9X">In the early stages of the coalition, each organization had one vote irrespective of the number of organizational representatives.</s><s xml:id="_kC3K6Xp">This meant that the university had one vote only as well.</s><s xml:id="_ywZfX9S">As trust built, the decision was made to allow each individual to have a vote.</s><s xml:id="_T7bSJ58">Generally, consensus was achieved after thorough dialogue on a particular issue.</s></p><p xml:id="_rUXsUsN"><s xml:id="_dd3a8jH">One of the first decisions taken by the CYC was to explore the survey results in greater depth.</s><s xml:id="_EJzAv6V">For this purpose, focus group discussions were conducted with youth aged 13-19 years of both genders to: (1) get youth feedback on the results;</s></p><p xml:id="_WmWeyc2"><s

prioritized issue, and presented them to an audience of the CYC and other adults from the community.</s><s xml:id="_djwe8VT">These skits highlighted the importance of parents and teachers in the lives of youth.</s></p><p xml:id="_qvZUy4P"><s xml:id="_USc44yw">The exploratory phase also included conducting focus groups with mothers and teachers of youth aged 13-19 years with the objective of getting their perspective on youth health and social issues.</s><s xml:id="_2G5bJFP">Parents emphasized that youth have no guarantees: they live in difficult socio-economic circumstances, are not well engaged by the school system, and have no work opportunities.</s><s xml:id="_ZgNYzsb">Their daily life pressures inside and outside the house affect their mental health.</s><s xml:id="_JrNU7NC">Teachers discussed their difficult situation: they are underpaid, have to work double shifts, and they themselves come from the stressful environment that the children come from.</s><s xml:id="_m674zMG">They stated that the relationship between teachers and students is not ideal.</s><s xml:id="_zDZGZeb">Although the teachers are exposed to many training workshops, these are often irrelevant and
