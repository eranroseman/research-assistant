Venkatesh et al. 2003).</s><s xml:id="_7F42VPN">UTAUT has distilled the critical factors and contingencies related to the prediction of behavioral intention to use a technology and technology use primarily in organizational contexts.</s><s xml:id="_UwmtwjZ">In longitudinal field studies of employee technology acceptance, UTAUT explained about 70 percent of the variance in behavioral intention to use a technology and about 50 percent of the variance in technology use.</s><s xml:id="_s2WJ9fb">Since its original publication, UTAUT has served as a base- line model and has been applied to the study of a variety of technologies in both organizational and non-organizational settings.</s><s xml:id="_qbfzrF7">There have been many applications and replications of the entire model or part of the model in organizational settings that have contributed to fortifying its generalizability (e.g., Neufeld et al. 2007).</s><s xml:id="_pmFeEss">There are three broad types of UTAUT extensions/integrations.</s><s xml:id="_XDESNUg">The first type of extension/ integration examined UTAUT in new contexts, such as new technologies (e.g., collaborative technology, health informa- tion systems; Chang et al. 2007), new user populations (e.g., healthcare professionals, consumers; Yi et al. <ref type="bibr">2006</ref>) and new cultural settings (e.g., China, India; Gupta et al. 2008).</s><s xml:id="_YUb2CZS">The second type is the addition of new constructs in order to expand the scope of the endogenous theoretical mechanisms outlined in UTAUT (e.g., Chan et al. 2008; Sun et al. 2009).</s></p><p xml:id="_Cja5FXz"><s xml:id="_uw4sXWz">Finally, the third type is the inclusion of exogenous predictors of the UTAUT variables (e.g., Neufeld et al. 2007; Yi et al.   2006).</s><s xml:id="_CmGCR2f">These extensive replications, applications, and exten- sions/integrations of UTAUT have been valuable in expanding our understanding of technology adoption and extending the theoretical boundaries of the theory.</s><s xml:id="_q4nhH2b">However, our review of this body of work revealed that most studies using UTAUT employed only a subset of the constructs, particularly by dropping the moderators (see Al-Gahtani et al.  2007; Armida 2008).</s><s xml:id="_mDQb6Xw">Thus, while the various studies con- tribute to understanding the utility of UTAUT in different contexts, there is still the need for a systematic investigation and theorizing of the salient factors that would apply to a consumer technology use context.</s></p><p xml:id="_4qn8PjV"><s xml:id="_2jEGZNw">Building on the past extensions to UTAUT, the objective of our work is to pay particular attention to the consumer use context and develop UTAUT2.</s><s xml:id="_DJVzQrx">Compared to general theories, in more recent years, theories that focus on a specific context and identify relevant predictors and mechanisms are considered to be vital in providing a rich understanding of a focal phenomenon and to meaningfully extend theories.</s><s xml:id="_FTQGVwc">Specifically, both Johns (2006) and Alvesson and Kärreman (2007)   note that new contexts can result in several types of important changes in theories, such as rendering originally theorized relationships to be nonsignificant, changing the direction of relationships, altering the magnitude of relationships and creating new relationships.</s><s xml:id="_ad5KZM6">Each change can reveal the breakdown of theories that results in the creation of new knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Alvesson and Kärreman 2007</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_JJAfcym">In the case of UTAUT, which was originally developed to explain employee technology acceptance and use, itwill be critical to examine how itcan be extended to other contexts, such as the context of consumer technologies, which is a multibillion dollar industry given the number of technology devices, applications, and services targeted at consumers (Stofega and Llamas 2009).</s></p><p xml:id="_VeGS5sy"><s xml:id="_M5qEygE">158 MIS Quarterly Vol.</s><s xml:id="_aNR34wH">36 No. 1/March 2012</s></p><p xml:id="_t2R6KJN"><s xml:id="_PQteGZr">Against this backdrop, the study of the boundary conditions and extensions to UTAUT in a consumer context represents an opportunity to make an important theoretical contribution.</s></p><p xml:id="_DMdvCDM"><s xml:id="_ZnhkVe6">Specifically, in the context of technology adoption, detractors and proponents of models, such as the technology acceptance model (ТАМ), have noted the need to expand the space of theoretical mechanisms (see Bagozzi 2007; Benbasat and  Barki 2007; Venkatesh et al. 2007).</s></p><p xml:id="_YEbxXwy"><s xml:id="_AEM5jJH">This paper presents UTAUT2 by identifying key additional constructs and relationships to be integrated into UTAUT, thus tailoring itto a consumer use context.</s><s xml:id="_p4sUKMK">In keeping with the general ideas outlined by Alvesson and Kärreman (2007)  and by Johns (2006) about how to extend a theory by lever- aging a new context, and the ideas presented in the Journal of the AIS special issue on ТАМ (e.g., Bagozzi 2007; Venkatesh  et al. 2007), we accomplish this goal by <ref type="bibr">(1)</ref> identifying three key constructs from prior research on both general adoption and use of technologies, and consumer adoption and use of technologies, (2) altering some of the existing relationships in the original conceptualization of UTAUT, and (3) introducing new relationships.</s><s xml:id="_gd4FeHB">First, both consumer behavior and IS research have theorized and found various constructs related to hedonic motivation (e.g., enjoyment) are important in consumer product and/or technology use (e.g., Brown and  Venkatesh 2005; Holbrook and Hirschman 1982; Nysveen et  al. 2005; van der Heijden 2004).</s><s xml:id="_GdzCG36">Integrating hedonic motiva- tion will complement UTAUT's strongest predictor that emphasizes utility.</s><s xml:id="_bYdhxP3">Second, in consumer contexts, unlike workplace contexts, users are responsible for the costs and such costs, besides being important, can dominate consumer adoption decisions (see Brown and Venkatesh 2005; Chan et  al. 2008; Coulter and Coulter 2007; Dodds et al. 1991).</s></p><p xml:id="_z72G4P2"><s xml:id="_EaerbB7">Adding a construct related to price/ cost will complement UTAUT's existing resource considerations that focus only on time and effort.</s><s xml:id="_cVWh9Ck">Finally, recent work has challenged the role of behavioral intention as the key predictor of technology use and introduced a new theoretical construct (i.e., habit) as another critical predictor of technology use (e.g., Davis and  Venkatesh 2004; Kim and Malhotra 2005; Kim et al. 2005;   Limayem et al. 2007).</s><s xml:id="_cqyQyXr">Integrating habit into UTAUT will complement the theory's focus on intentionality as the overarching mechanism and key driver of behavior.</s><s xml:id="_mhamBsx">In fact, habit as a key alternative mechanism has been lauded as a valuable next step in the JAIS special issue on ТАМ.</s><s xml:id="_3kGCXUV">The collection of these works examining the role of habit, albeit operationalized differently in each of the papers, concludes that habit has a direct effect on technology use and/or habit weakens or limits the strength of the relationship between behavioral intention and technology use.</s><s xml:id="_JDK4Wc3">Such an integration of multiple streams of work to shed light on phenomena of interest is important from a scientific standpoint (Gioia and   This content downloaded from 128.255.62.40 on Thu, 14 Aug 2025 22:03:03 UTC All use subject to <ref type="url" target="https://about.jstor.org/terms">https://about.jstor.org/terms</ref></s></p><p xml:id="_gyyHEqU"><s xml:id="_A6vKwxx">Petri 1990;

determine technology use.</s><s xml:id="_VsyfNU9">Also, individual difference vari- ables, namely age, gender, and experience (note that we drop voluntariness, which is part of the original UTAUT),2
