<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_FjMbGdN">Background</head><p xml:id="_8KfuaTF"><s xml:id="_FUXcASy">Worldwide, patients can access an ever-growing number of mobile health (mHealth) apps.</s><s xml:id="_wFjdKEd">Six years ago, there were 325,000 mHealth apps available, which were created by 84,000 different developers <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_bfweeg6">Regardless of the high number of mHealth apps, there is no fundamental quality control by app stores as distribution channels.</s><s xml:id="_4nR7gKy">Thus, unsafe mHealth apps are a potential threat for patient health <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_knVqtrF"><s xml:id="_8Rsk8yJ">An indicator for safe mHealth apps is the approval as a medical device.</s><s xml:id="_sZye64z">This is achieved by the European conformity or Food and Drug Administration certification in Europe and the United States, respectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_jqYMVA6">Although medical device certification focuses particularly on safety and medical-technical performance with respect to the intended purpose specified by the manufacturer, there are also other areas where problems can arise.</s></p><p xml:id="_d8n427a"><s xml:id="_PAhRMUK">A more extensive certification program is the "Fast-Track Process for Digital Health Applications (DiGA)" established in Germany.</s><s xml:id="_gNnqSJt">In this process, in addition to the European conformity certification as proof of "safety" and "suitability," other requirements, such as "data protection," "information security," "interoperability," and "user-friendliness" are reviewed <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ZYpTAg2">Despite the relatively broad testing approach in the fast-track process, it has not been conclusively clarified whether it is sufficient to face all potential problems in the context of mHealth apps.</s><s xml:id="_XpuXpez">This is partly due to the novelty of the field of care.</s></p><p xml:id="_7FZtaWt"><s xml:id="_4Qv4zMK">In addition to governmental guidelines, there is also a variety of approaches in science to evaluate the quality of mHealth apps.</s><s xml:id="_qAnh93A">Well-known assessment scales include the Mobile App Rating Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, the User Version of the Mobile Application Rating Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, Enlight <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and the System Usability Scale <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Urz3Pwk">On an aggregated level, a review by Nouri et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, which was published in 2018, analyzed such rating tools.</s><s xml:id="_MTyxpSq">The review identified "design," "information/content," "usability," "functionality," "ethical issues," "security and privacy," and "user-perceived value" as relevant quality dimensions <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Bjzex44">However, similar to the presented governmental certification processes, it is also questionable whether these quality assessment procedures and identified quality dimensions in the scientific field are sufficient to address potential problems in the context of mHealth.</s></p><p xml:id="_MTes2gA"><s xml:id="_ZFwh2yf">Knowing the existing problems and barriers related to mHealth apps and their use is a fundamental requirement to guarantee the comprehensive quality assurance of mHealth apps.</s><s xml:id="_SY9NN58">However, only few studies have aimed to identify weaknesses and problems of mHealth apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_E47AGA4">A scoping review on this topic revealed 10 problem categories: "validity," "usability," "technology," "use and adherence," "data privacy and security," "patient-physician relationship," "knowledge and skills," "individuality," "implementation," and "costs" <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_Mn2TFu9"><s xml:id="_gpUv3YS">However, it remains uncertain whether these categories are relevant from the perspective of users or patients.</s><s xml:id="_83Tmudz">A systematic review of qualitative studies identified 25 studies focusing on barriers of and facilitators to the use of lifestyle apps.</s><s xml:id="_9HRZzRq">However, the authors emphasized that the included studies have considered only healthy individuals, and thus, the obtained results are not transferable to patients with diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_yVavAy9">In another qualitative study from Australia, patients were recruited in a general practice setting and interviewed about barriers and enablers to the use of mHealth apps.</s><s xml:id="_SeUHzFh">Nevertheless, the authors emphasized that the sample size was skewed toward relatively healthy patients, and future studies should target patients with long-term medical conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_x5Bfa2H">Objectives</head><p xml:id="_HkCf8ey"><s xml:id="_Zkb5rfu">As there is insufficient evidence base regarding the problems and barriers in the context of mHealth apps, qualitative research methods could provide an explorative insight in this research field.</s><s xml:id="_csAJW2k">Perspectives of both mHealth app users as well as nonusers should be taken into account.</s><s xml:id="_CzGKWh6">This is necessary to reveal existing problems with the use of mHealth apps as well as concerns and barriers preventing patients from using these apps.</s><s xml:id="_u2JMhGN">Therefore, this study surveyed both app using and nonusing patients in focus groups and individual interviews to identify patient-relevant problems and barriers related to the use of mHealth apps.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_kcReXES">Methods</head><p xml:id="_AEGnTqh"><s xml:id="_P9p5CuW">We followed the standards of the study by O'Brien et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> and subsequently checked the manuscript by applying the 32-item COREQ (Consolidated Criteria for Reporting Qualitative Research) checklist <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> to ensure transparency in all aspects of our qualitative research.</s></p></div>
