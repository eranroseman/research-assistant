type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_MB5CFuH">Within the epidemiological literature, distinct pathophysiological markers of oxidative stress, nitric

target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SGJy73C">However, while these medications are efficacious in regards to the management of cardiometabolic disease, their cost-effectiveness remains ambiguous <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, and significant negative side-effects remain common <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_4zdj6wS">Globally, it has been documented that 84% of adults over the age of 57 are prescribed at least one medication per day <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_dnZZqGF">As such, it is clear that further natural and cost-effective remedies are required for cardiometabolic disease management and prevention <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_vCX6D9J"><s xml:id="_yaJAmsp">Dietary practices are recognized as the most effective natural approach for the treatment of cardiometabolic disease such that most national/international medical organizations advocate improved nutrition for the prevention and management of this condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_knUPywN">There is therefore a clear rationale for the implementation of dietary over pharmaceutical interventions, and indeed, Chiva-Blanch et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> proposed that such approaches are likely to be more cost-effective and safer for the treatment and prevention of metabolic diseases.</s><s xml:id="_Nn58RQw">Diets rich in fruits and vegetables have been shown to attenuate the risk from cardiometabolic disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> although maintaining such approaches over a sustained duration has been shown to be difficult to accomplish <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_TTq6F6A">Therefore, dietary supplements represent a potentially more appealing treatment and prevention modality.</s></p><p xml:id="_sayBk6S"><s xml:id="_cqyZSyq">Anthocyanins are abundant in dark-colored fruit and vegetable groups <ref

xml:id="_UDVTc2B">Montmorency tart cherries, blueberries, strawberries, cranberries, and blackcurrants <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> in particular have been shown to possess high levels of anthocyanins <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> although the majority of peer-reviewed literature has focused on tart cherries.</s><s xml:id="_2hSuVa8">Supplementation of anthocyanin-rich tart

insulin sensitivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Mwpq576">Therefore, an increased capacity to oxidize fat at rest and during moderate physical activity, initiated via anthocyanin-rich supplementation, may be advantageous for yielding improvements in body composition and insulin control, which is pertinent to cardiometabolic health.</s><s xml:id="_qD7tw6D">Importantly, the aforementioned anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, and substrate trafficking effects mediated through supplementation of anthocyanin-rich fruits appear to conveniently target the underlying chronic low-grade inflammation, pro-oxidant, and lipid-attenuating status that is central to cardiometabolic disease pathophysiology <ref type="bibr"

represents the first investigation to explore the effects of these supplementary interventions in a three-arm parallel placebo-controlled trial.</s><s xml:id="_98T6dHh">The primary aim was to determine whether systolic blood pressure was improved as a function of these supplements, whereas the secondary aim(s) were to explore the effects of supplementation on other risk factors for cardiometabolic disease.</s></p><p xml:id="_6mmC3Kp"><s xml:id="_AE7DTpv">In relation to the primary outcome, the current investigation does not support our hypothesis in that there were significant reductions in systolic blood pressure in either the cherry of blueberry supplementation groups compared to placebo (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_6">6</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_4E4UAUA">This result is in line with those of Lynn et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, Desai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, and Kimble et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, who showed that tart cherry supplementation had no effect on systolic blood pressure in healthy patients, while the current investigation also confirms a similar lack of efficacy for supplemental blueberry ingestion.</s><s xml:id="_cVEN89T">It could therefore be speculated that in healthy individuals, arterial stiffness, which governs systolic blood pressure, is less responsive to short-term increases in anthocyanin intake via both tart cherry and blueberry supplementation.</s><s xml:id="_3XyGgrw">However, in healthy patients, Chai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> and Kent et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> observed significantly lower systolic blood pressure in the first 3 h after ingestion, as did Desai et al. <ref

al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> showed that plasma anthocyanin metabolites peak in the first two hours following ingestion with rapid clearance and return to basal within 4 h.</s><s xml:id="_BMgzykH">This coincides with the aforementioned previously observed statistical reductions in postprandial blood pressure and suggests that the current and previous analyses adopting longitudinal rather than acute study designs may have missed the peak effects of tart cherry and blueberry supplementation.</s><s xml:id="_fkKuthg">Importantly, as no statistically significant differences in blood pressure were observed, the current investigation lends further support to the concept that anthocyanin-rich supplementation mediates a transient rather than sustained attenuation of systolic blood pressure.</s><s xml:id="_byPxj9t">Although physiologically important, the associated long-term clinical benefits of an acute reduction in blood pressure from both prophylactic and

pressure mediated through anthocyanin-rich supplementation.</s></p><p xml:id="_s3NjwND"><s xml:id="_7VaGdVe">Although no statistically significant differences in the primary outcome were evident, linear mixed-model and chi-square analyses support our hypothesis in that both total and LDL cholesterol were significantly improved in the blueberry arm compared to placebo (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>), and a larger number of participants experienced reductions in triglycerides in the cherry and blueberry groups.</s><s xml:id="_Mq8thJF">As no changes in HDL cholesterol were evident, it is clear that reductions in total cholesterol were mediated as a function of the corresponding attenuation in LDL values.</s><s xml:id="_tJPjmfu">Previous trials have shown that consuming

target="#b30">[31]</ref> although this is the first investigation to show similar effects in healthy participants ingesting blueberry supplementation.</s><s xml:id="_eT9bMBc">It is proposed that the reductions in cholesterol mediated via the blueberry trial arm are a reflection of the statistically greater anthocyanin concentrations in this supplement (Table <ref type="table"

effects in healthy participants and efficacy also in those ingesting blueberry supplementation.</s><s xml:id="_Ut2spvy">Owing to the greater anthocyanin content in the blueberry supplement, it is proposed that the reductions in LDL cholesterol in this condition were mediated via the inhibition of plasma cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP).</s><s xml:id="_TGn65Nr">Several studies have indicated that CETP inhibition is a crucial mechanism for the attenuation of LDL cholesterol <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b71">72]</ref>, and both human and

compared to placebo.</s><s xml:id="_qkjpyeR">Previous analyses have linked cardiometabolic disease to reduced levels of psychological wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">[65]</ref>, so taking into account the aforementioned improvements noted in the blueberry trial arm, this observation makes intuitive sense.</s><s xml:id="_Kw2CwZb">The mechanism responsible for the improvements in psychological wellbeing is not currently known and requires further consideration given the global incidence of depression and other psychological disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_p8sp46K">There are several conceivable mechanisms that may explain our findings, including increased cerebral blood flow where cognitive and emotional control is located <ref type="bibr" target="#b76">[77]</ref> and reduced monoamine oxidase activity causing increasing levels circulating monoamines, some of which are neurotransmitters associated with mood regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b77">[78]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Um2AM6g">Regardless, the observations from the current trial lend further support to the concept that blueberry supplementation may be important in the management of psychological disorders.</s></p><p xml:id="_SvJU8Vd"><s xml:id="_FFxDfYT">However, it is important to also acknowledge that despite the potentially exciting improvements in blood lipid and psychological wellbeing profiles in the blueberry trial arm, this supplement was associated with increased resting glucose values in relation to both the placebo and cherry trial arms (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">5</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_akgJpjW">It is apparent that this observation was caused by the increased sugar content (Table <ref type="table"

previously outlined reductions in blood lipids concurs with those of Chai et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> with tart cherries.</s><s xml:id="_cWcfRpj">This observation is biologically interesting, as typically, increased blood glucose is met with corresponding increases in LDL cholesterol <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_55pvPT5">It is not within the scope of the biological measurements examined in this trial to accurately determine the mechanisms responsible for this finding.</s><s xml:id="_XhSRZVY">However, it can be speculated that the unique nature of the anthocyanin-rich blueberry supplementation may be responsible.</s><s xml:id="_pw4G8mE">Firstly, through the aforementioned CETP inhibition pathway as although potentially responsible for the attenuation of LDL cholesterol, animal models have shown strong correlations between CETP expression and bile acid signaling that may result in increased glucose disposal <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[80]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KhvSuQ7">In addition, new information has shown that the influence of anthocyanins themselves on glucose and lipid metabolism in humans may be affected by their distinct chemical composition <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_28rxh2h">Blueberries are characterized by a greater number of hydroxyl groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> and belong to the malvidin variety of anthocyanins <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ypSHYMu">The malvidin group is associated with greater antioxidant capacity, which may explain their greater potential for improvements in dyslipidemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref> although there is insufficient evidence concerning the effects of different anthocyanin compositions on blood glucose regulation.</s><s xml:id="_d8edqVZ">As such, it is important for further investigation to be conducted into the biological influence of anthocyanin chemical composition.</s><s xml:id="_PTqedCn">Nonetheless, it is important to note that the mean fasting blood glucose values remained within normal ranges <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref>, and the long-term effects of elevated blood glucose levels remain unknown in healthy individuals.</s><s xml:id="_C7v88XH">However, in patients with cardiometabolic conditions or diabetes mellitus characterized by poor glucose control, the findings from the current investigation do not currently support habitual utilization of this supplement despite the improvements in blood lipids.</s><s xml:id="_eRBt2AK">Therefore, it is important for future analyses to examine the longer-term effects of blueberry supplementation and to explore continuous blood glucose control as well as insulin and hemoglobin A1c indices in both healthy and pathological populations.</s></p><p xml:id="_VZXZagv"><s xml:id="_uam8TP4">Overall, the current investigation exhibited a very effective level of blinding efficacy, a low number of adverse incidences, a high retention rate, very good compliance levels, as well as improvements in blood lipids and psychological wellbeing, predominantly in the blueberry trial arm.</s><s xml:id="_9avUCJa">However, owing to the statistically greater mean daily sugar and associated kilocalorie intake (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_3">3</ref>) in comparison to the cherry and placebo groups, in agreement with Kimble et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, those seeking to utilize blueberry juice as a dietary supplement should utilize caution and seek to modify their daily dietary intake to account for the increase in daily Kcal.</s><s xml:id="_fsJDxKf">Furthermore, recent analyses have shown that some fruit phenolics constrain the formation of advanced glycation end products (AGE) <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[86]</ref> and thus mediate cellular and tissue impairment by damaging protein function and clearance <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[87]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8f9TPaF">Therefore, to better understand its potential biological effects, further exploration of the effects of blueberry juice should seek to examine the

and sugar contents were reported according to the manufacturer's guidelines, which, for anthocyanins in particular, have been shown to exhibit variability from sample to sample owing to differences in growing conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xTdVgZk">While the current investigation observed positive effects of blueberry supplementation on cardiometabolic and psychological wellbeing indices, the mechanistic bases for these improvements was not elucidated.</s><s xml:id="_tRvMFkw">Therefore, future investigations should seek to explore and perhaps better utilize and exploit the mechanistic pathways of blueberry supplementation in order to improve health-related outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_Sz83mcn">Furthermore, as participants were randomized into their

anthocyanin-rich fruits on cardiometabolic health indices.</s><s xml:id="_EGQxxD3">Finally, as many of the experimental variables are positively influenced by exercise, that physical activity was not
