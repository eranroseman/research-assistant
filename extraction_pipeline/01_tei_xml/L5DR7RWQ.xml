receive monthly e-mail messages (20%) or were uncertain (22%) if they did so, whereas these messages were sent.</s><s xml:id="_z9ehX3B">Throughout subsequent periods, participants in the intervention condition did not visit the website more often compared with participants in the control condition.</s><s xml:id="_pk2PfBm">The use of self-monitors as well as the use of asking questions was limited.</s><s xml:id="_bxy9BwZ">Because of the low use of several intervention components, there was a lack of contrast with the control condition, with both groups having a health check and general information on the website.</s><s xml:id="_q5eDJz2">Although there is an increasing popularity of Internet delivered programmes, the use of such programmes is often low <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Meuk4xE">Nowadays, there are more and more possibilities for interaction between providers and participants using Internet-and cell-phone-based interventions (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_7eqnb2h"><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_z82YwKh">A higher level of interaction might help to increase programme adherence.</s><s xml:id="_NjEXGNs">In a systematic review, the authors concluded that populations at-risk benefit most from behaviour change programmes in the workplace setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_72H6nrA">In our study, a high percentage of participants already met the lifestyle recommendations at baseline.</s><s xml:id="_9E2h9w2">For the PA guideline, this is likely due to over-reporting on the IPAQ.</s><s xml:id="_W5NUAjJ">Over-reporting is a general concern in the measurement of self-reported PA <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[42]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8PPkn3z">With the majority already meeting the national guidelines, particularly for moderate to vigorous PA, there is only small room for improvement in the participating study population.</s><s xml:id="_ZNCz3BW">However, when focussing on those participants not complying with the healthy lifestyle guidelines, there was only a modest positive intervention effect for fruit intake after 1 year.</s></p><p xml:id="_BVPrkyE"><s xml:id="_kAJw7tU">Shain and Kramer <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[43]</ref> have argued that health promotion programmes will only be effective in enhancing the health status of the workforce when the interventions attend to both individual and environmental influences.</s><s xml:id="_UXKe6SJ">This is in accordance with the findings in a recent systematic review showing greater improvements in workplace interventions with an environmental component <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_XswWC2N">In our study, the intervention took place in the workplace setting, but the setting did not comprise a major role in the intervention programme, lacking environmental components.</s><s xml:id="_APakDNm">With the ability to make use of natural social networks as well as shared environments, there are opportunities to include more organizational aspects in behavioural interventions in the workplace setting.</s></p><p xml:id="_btzWpsT"><s xml:id="_4pR55M2">Since the intervention did not show any effects, no cost-effectiveness analysis was conducted.</s><s xml:id="_Mu96zxF">The economic analysis showed that the costs of the intervention programme were modest and comparable to the direct health care costs.</s><s xml:id="_r7DDvXP">However, the economic evaluation is driven by the indirect costs due to productivity loss (96%), which were much higher than the direct costs (4%).</s><s xml:id="_aezaTpQ">A limitation in the economic evaluation was the measurement of indirect costs, with a categorical variable for sickness absence.</s><s xml:id="_jR4pZrn">Furthermore, possible compensation mechanisms were not taken into account, leading to an overestimation of indirect costs.</s></p></div>
