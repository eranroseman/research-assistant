competition, such as leaderboard, prize, and step/sleep goal achievement.</s><s xml:id="_KxP78K5">Moreover, the strategy of how to pair opponents can also be optimized to increase the effect size.</s><s xml:id="_jP4hacj">We consider the aforementioned content as the direction of future study.</s><s xml:id="_TVfZ6z7">One possible explanation for the waning causal effect of competition was that interns might be motivated when the study began and get tired later so they were less responsive to the competition assignment.</s><s xml:id="_HcV4PzM">The phenomenon of waning treatment effect is common in the field of mHealth intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32</ref> and further studies are needed to investigate how to extend the mHealth intervention effect.</s><s xml:id="_GR4wRMM">For example, a break could be given to the interns after an episode of a competition assignment to decrease their fatigue, and then intervention can be reintroduced to them after some rest time to regain the benefits from the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_96XWQFF">Adding novel competition-related elements such as levels, scoreboard, and prizes could be another option.</s></p><p xml:id="_q89bPD8"><s xml:id="_Zz4pWqc">One possible explanation for the negative impact of intrainstitutional competition on the causal effect of competition on step count was that perhaps interns felt less competitive within their institution relative to extra-institutional members because they see their fellow institution members as colleagues.</s><s xml:id="_z7dReZc">The negative moderation of intra-institutional competition suggested avoiding intra-institutional competition assignment in the future application to

unplanned negative effects and boost the efficacy of the intervention.</s></p><p xml:id="_yTeZn8C"><s xml:id="_H7fw5dE">Our study has multiple strengths.</s><s xml:id="_VPAg4WB">First, compared with standard single-time-point randomized controlled trial design, which can only inform moderation of causal effect by baseline variables (e.g., age, gender), micro-randomized trial enabled us to assess both causal effects of intervention components and time-varying moderation (e.g., week-in-study) of these effects.</s><s xml:id="_44W9bPp">Second, a relatively large sample size (1779 participants in 191 teams) and long study period (12 weeks) allowed us to detect the causal effect of intervention, as well as effect moderators of interest.</s><s xml:id="_mZmnZNG">In fact, the data in our study has been collected for 26 weeks.</s><s xml:id="_sDkSGnz">However, we noticed that the percentage of missing data increased notably as the study went on, therefore, we chose to perform analysis on the first 12 weeks of the data.</s><s xml:id="_pckTvkC">Third, the unique study population, medical interns with inherent hierarchical structure (by institutions and specialties), allowed us to assess the moderation of social connection and cooperation on the causal effect of gamified competition.</s><s xml:id="_7DJ8XUh">Fourth, the analytical approaches we used in the study, the weighted and centered least squares estimator and multiple imputations, allowed us to assess the causal effect moderation consistently and robustly without requiring strong assumptions.</s></p><p xml:id="_rRMQqgF"><s xml:id="_9Q7GFHy">However, there are several unanswered questions and promising directions that should be addressed in future research.</s><s xml:id="_4g5JFqR">First, it remains unclear why competition did not affect participant's sleep duration in the same way as step count.</s><s xml:id="_9vdkXdT">One of our conjectures is that the highly demanding working schedule during medical internship makes interns have little control over their sleep schedule, leading to insensitivity to competition intervention.</s><s xml:id="_8rFTXkJ">Second, the reason that intra-institutional competition leads to negative moderation of causal effects of competition needs to be addressed in future study.</s><s xml:id="_EKXSXdn">Third, we have found that specialties may moderate the effect of competition.</s><s xml:id="_4ukcVmg">Future studies are warranted to investigate potential factors like specialty that can moderate the competition effect so that we can target individuals who can benefit most from the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_jpHEpKD">Fourth, we have found that the decreased participation rate of daily sleep minutes and self-survey mood score was positively related to losing previous competition, indicating that the engagement and competition performance of team members may be affected if the team lost the competition.</s><s xml:id="_ersMwas">Future research investigating the causal effect of competition result on competition performance and engagement is warranted.</s><s xml:id="_YQa7GTa">Fifth, in addition to competition, we are also interested in evaluating the effectiveness of other seven types of gamification approaches and hope to implement some of these other strategies via our mobile app in the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s></p><p xml:id="_2S9WRNb"><s xml:id="_K4cB23X">Our study does have several limitations.</s><s xml:id="_df9xfx5">The first is the data missingness and imputation.</s><s xml:id="_zBNuRjZ">More than 30% data were missing for daily step count and 50% for daily sleep duration on individual level.</s><s xml:id="_zGa3R2v">Multiple imputation was used to impute the missing entries under the assumption of missing at random, however, the imputed values of a participant borrowed information from participants of other teams due to limited information in each team, which may result in attenuated estimate when assessing the moderation of competing within the same institution on causal effect of competition since the difference among teams can become smaller after imputation.</s><s xml:id="_ybgHtq8">Second, the results of this study may not extrapolate to a more general population because medical interns are different from the general population in terms of age, education level, and stress level.</s><s xml:id="_MvvBHQT">Individuals in the general population may be more responsive to the mHealth intervention than medical interns due to more flexible time.</s><s xml:id="_Ze8TH9V">Therefore, to validate the generalizability of the results in and out of the training physician cohort, these suggested interventions should be further refined and replicated in additional studies and cohorts.</s><s xml:id="_77CxZM5">Third, note that instead of individual-level analysis, cluster-level analysis, where each team was treated as the unit of analysis, was used to avoid ignoring the inherent clustering (team) structure using the team-level summary measures.</s><s xml:id="_puYttrk">The summary measures were calculated by taking the average of individuals' measurements of the same team, which did not account for the heterogeneity among members within the team, resulting in reducing the power of the study.</s><s xml:id="_eUjshy4">Further methodological research on statistical tools allowing analysis at the level of the individual while accounting for the clustering in the data in the field of MRT is needed.</s></p><p xml:id="_f9PHP2r"><s xml:id="_wKeBqjt">In summary, through this smartphone-wearable-based prospective micro-randomized trial on training residents, we were able to identify the positive causal effect of team competition on proximal step count.</s><s xml:id="_JKbfUey">The effect is considerably smaller relative to some prior studies, because we focused on factors associated with stress management (step count, sleep duration) in a population not actively seeking to lose weight or diseased.</s><s xml:id="_kkNtVvm">On the other hand, the team competition had no significant causal effect on sleep duration.</s><s xml:id="_N5DasMh">Besides, we also found that the causal effects of competition were negatively moderated by week-in-study and intra-institutional competition.</s><s xml:id="_zD4aZbU">Exploratory analysis suggested that team competition may improve user's engagement with the study app and the effectiveness of this intervention can be moderated by different specialties.</s><s xml:id="_bg33zJw">These results suggest that gamified competition is worthy of inclusion in the mHealth intervention to improve the well-being of medical interns.</s><s xml:id="_QYWRNBc">Effectiveness of gamified team competition may be further boosted by introducing occasional breaks to mitigate waning effects over time, optimizing opponent assignment, or tailoring by specialty.</s></p></div>
