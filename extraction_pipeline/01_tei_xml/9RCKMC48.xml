<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_CQkw47Y">Implications for Campus Practice</head><p xml:id="_jcs9zeB"><s xml:id="_BTtFVyB">While the m-index will not likely supplant the need for surveys and additional assessment, institutions may want to consider adding dining hall data into their student retention snapshots for several reasons.</s><s xml:id="_RePmrJh">Data are already collected automatically, meaning that there is no additional cost and no need to spend time reminding students and incentivizing participation.</s><s xml:id="_A4e99tN">Information also becomes available as early as the first few days of the semester, much earlier than other available diagnostics.</s><s xml:id="_jcvacvM">Additionally, this measure relies on observed student behavior-swiping into the dining hallrather than students' self-reported perceptions.</s></p><p xml:id="_j3YeWyT"><s xml:id="_A5qvW8R">To be clear, however, increasing a student's m-index should not be the goal in and of itself.</s><s xml:id="_HQzWXfD">Rather, the m-index should be viewed as a signal to assist staff in directing support to students who may be struggling to find their place.</s><s xml:id="_JvXf4nw">As an early signal, it may be especially useful in guiding preemptive interventions like floor dinners or facilitating meal partners.</s><s xml:id="_bCKkSYe">However, the effectiveness of employing this measure likely depends on how well it is integrated into a more holistic understanding of students' experiences.</s></p><p xml:id="_43ZPqrk"><s xml:id="_rEAsRaH">These results evoke questions about data that are already available on our campuses and what stories they might reveal if we were to look at them more closely.</s><s xml:id="_EUsqre7">On most residential campuses, dining swipe data are readily available, and yet we are unaware of other examples where this information has been used beyond basic reporting or logistical planning (although this certainly might exist).</s><s xml:id="_Q3CC26F">How else might these data help us to support student outcomes?</s><s xml:id="_MEEHpu2">Additionally, although the m-index is probably best suited for residential campuses with dining halls, comparable measures may exist on various types of campuses.</s><s xml:id="_KmRm4uh">Perhaps the student recreation center, the campus library, attendance at sporting events, and late-night door swipes might provide useful information.</s></p><p xml:id="_HK8jXvt"><s xml:id="_UNWHp7d">Yet each of these pieces of information on their own can only tell us so much.</s><s xml:id="_fr8xb94">In our experience, data like these are often collected, managed, and stored by discrete departments and in discrete systems.</s><s xml:id="_k9KEVRX">An extra level of effort is necessary to bring these data together or to integrate them into a single index within "early alert" systems.</s><s xml:id="_4cNQYbg">However, this integration is essential to create a more complete understanding of who might be struggling to find their place and how we can best intervene with structured support.</s><s xml:id="_Q5CFtnH">This broader picture may also reveal systemic barriers in our institutional culture and structure, allowing us to reimagine practices for the betterment of all.</s><s xml:id="_rr739Dj">That said, we need to do more thinking about the ethical implications of a "big brother" campus that is watching student behavior so closely.</s></p><p xml:id="_fPHnAgn"><s xml:id="_NuBx8wk">The strength of the relationship between the m-index and retention outcomes, even in the first week of classes, adds weight to evidence that the early weeks in a student's transition to college can be the most crucial in their decision to persist.</s><s xml:id="_bGt6nXE">This finding echoes recent work that illuminates the role of early friendship and roommate/floormate relationships as well as the development of belonging during the first three weeks of classes (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bowman, Jang, Jarratt, &amp; Bono, 2019)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_VpAfBGp">The more institutions can do to identify and intervene early for students who are struggling socially, the better chance to prevent stories like Mia's.</s></p><p xml:id="_EhMcH7Q"><s xml:id="_PCXqyEt">Yet each of these pieces of information on their own can only tell us so much.</s><s xml:id="_fxEJFdR">In our experience, data like these are often collected, managed, and stored by discrete departments and in discrete systems.</s><s xml:id="_rJguBRA">An extra level of effort is necessary to bring these data together or to integrate them into a single index within "early alert" systems.</s><s xml:id="_DWvbaQ5">However, this integration is essential to create a more complete understanding of who might be struggling to find their place and how we can best intervene with structured support.</s></p><p xml:id="_UEMY9U5"><s xml:id="_CmQKjfG">However, additional work is needed to understand how these relationships take shape and the ways in which social relationships may develop differently across various groups of students.</s><s xml:id="_GNGck2n">The m-index is a useful measure to predict retention and graduation for many groups of students, in part because it sheds light into racial disparities.</s><s xml:id="_BmbRJpJ">In particular, the gaps between domestic Students of Color and White students are often smaller among those with high m-indices than those with low m-indices, and future work should continue to explore how these disparities develop.</s></p><p xml:id="_Q3tgpu5"><s xml:id="_fZTeA8h">The negative relationship between the m-index and graduation outcomes for international students engenders more questions.</s><s xml:id="_mSJTsdT">This pattern may be a function of the potentially unique pattern of housing assignments for international students that was prevalent at the time of the study: many firstyear international students were housed in an apartmentstyle residence hall farther away from campus (and from the two campus dining facilities).</s><s xml:id="_vgYr2Q2">Because of the geographic distance and the availability of kitchens in that residence hall, it is quite possible that they built social relationships and community through eating in their own building.</s><s xml:id="_8v2YSwP">It may also be that international students often develop social networks through other means than the campus dining hall.</s></p><p xml:id="_Dsfe3yg"><s xml:id="_uTvRe8j">Whatever the cause, the pattern here urges us away from adopting a "one size fits all" strategy for identification and intervention with students who may be struggling.</s><s xml:id="_GXdFgKE">That said, the use of swipe card data shows substantial promise as an early indicator of student integration and connection.</s><s xml:id="_yvWKeh7">Students' m-indices can be calculated with little cost for colleges and universities, and they provide useful information for retention efforts as early as the first week of classes.</s><s xml:id="_WMMhvR2">When brought into conversation with a more holistic understanding of students' experiences, the m-index has the potential to inform practical early intervention so that Mia, and so many other students, receive timely support to persist.</s><s xml:id="_VNMt4g9">C</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc><div><p xml:id="_MYmfDT7"><s xml:id="_U4Rk349">Common Data, Uncommon Use: Dining Hall Meal Swipes Predict Retention and Graduation Dining Hall Meal Swipes Predict Retention and Graduation Lindsay Jarratt worked in student housing and campus diversity offices for many years before returning to pursue her PhD.</s><s xml:id="_Rfkxkm8">She is currently a graduate student in the Department of Educational Policy and Leadership Studies at the University of Iowa.</s><s xml:id="_FjYHc7v">Her research is interested in dynamics of equity and belonging in educational institutions.</s><s xml:id="_rz9SKh8">Nicholas A.
