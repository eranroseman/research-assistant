INTRODUCTION</head><p xml:id="_pDXcwun"><s xml:id="_v9dT4ZR">Patient engagement is an activity that involves a series of proactive and interactive actions between provider and patient.</s><s xml:id="_cCuG7UR">Active patient engagement is paramount in effective health care, especially in chronic conditions, which are long term, variable, and often degenerative <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tafHpdf">Direct collection of patient-reported outcomes (PROs) is essential for effective patient engagement.</s><s xml:id="_QwYRwVU">Studies have shown that PROs are beneficial over clinician-reported outcomes by facilitating the efficiency and accuracy of patient-provider communication via real-time symptom tracking instead of manual extracting from medical records in a sparse time points of clinical visits <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_4BEr3Pb">Paper-based scales are the most typical data collection instruments of PROs, such as ChronoSheet in bipolar disorder <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> and McGill pain questionnaire in chronic pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NqXG58P">However, one of the challenges of paper-based PRO scales is poor compliance for real-time reporting, leading to incomplete or biased recall of events.</s><s xml:id="_mdM6yA9">Previous comparison studies using electronic and paper PROs demonstrated that subjects overwhelmingly fail to complete paper PROs according to protocol (e.g., retrospectively filling in multiple entries at one time; subject failure to return paper diaries).</s><s xml:id="_AzaqhWf">Reported compliance of paper PROs ranged from 11 -56%, while the compliance of electronic PROs ranged from 83-89% <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_FhQ4QWX"><s xml:id="_DvwxTCG">In addition, from a provider's point of view, processing paper-based document is expensive and laborious with a higher risk of human-errors.</s><s xml:id="_sdXCz42">Thus, modern communication technologies offer promise by enhancing the quality and efficiency of tracking real-time PROs.</s><s xml:id="_HdBmTqz">Among these technologies, mobile phone text messaging is considered a favored alternative <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> due to wide spread use and low cost.</s></p><p xml:id="_KFYGccF"><s xml:id="_zBUXy6J">According to the CTIA-The Wireless Association, as of the end of 2012, the number of mobile phone subscribers reached 326.4 million with 102% penetration (i.e., # of active units divided by the total U.S. population) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, exceeding the percentage of population with computer access.</s><s xml:id="_KU7nJsk">Another study in 2017 also rated text messaging as the top choice for medical alerts and reminders <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5rZ2prD">Among all cell phone activities, text messaging (TM), also known as the short messaging service (SMS), is the most prevalent, both in overall likelihood and frequency <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qVUEGWe">Studies have demonstrated that TM can be an effective PRO collection technology for health interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, clinical management <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>- <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>, and health-related behavior modification <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_cygnFaS">In addition, TM extends the capacity for monitoring outpatient disease complications (e.g., frequency and duration/resolution of painful episodes), potentially reducing hospitalizations.</s></p><p xml:id="_tfFHb8e"><s xml:id="_WybRwpp">Several features make TM one of the ideal technologies for engagement in self-care.</s><s xml:id="_Ffk964T">First, because TM is a basic function in every cell phone, providers do not need to develop independent applications on devices.</s><s xml:id="_B3FtPgS">Second, patients can receive and respond to TMs anytime using readily available 2G (e.g., GSM) network and without depending on 3G/4G or wireless networks.</s><s xml:id="_pgkjjNU">Third, TM is cheaper (e.g., unlimited for $10-$15 USD/month) and unobtrusive compared to telephone interviews.</s><s xml:id="_bZvbEVU">Fourth, in terms of PRO collection, TM is conducive for several short queries in a single day.</s><s xml:id="_YTwtaqt">Finally, in terms of longitudinal data collection, TM provides sustainable usage no matter how many times the back-end system is updated by administrator or the mobile device is changed by a user.</s><s xml:id="_qsp6ws2">In addition, the targeted population for SCD is from mainly lower income groups where the issues were on access to smart phones and internet on the phones.</s><s xml:id="_zjbRTsY">Also there were concerns from parents regarding privacy and safety on the use of smart phones for the young adolescents in school.</s><s xml:id="_9hZcQtW">As a result we chose TM as the design choice for this application after discussion with care providers and focus groups.</s></p><p xml:id="_88W9yh9"><s xml:id="_kqbNmaa">TM systems in healthcare can be classified into two categories based on the type of communication: one-way reminding and two-way reporting.</s><s xml:id="_Nt57dXn">One-way TM systems are mainly designed to send standardized messages for medication dose scheduling and specific preferences.</s><s xml:id="_j2Rb7zR">For example, Strandbygaard et.</s><s xml:id="_mybnFYN">al. used TM reminders to improve asthma treatment and suggested that daily TM reminders could significantly increase adherence to anti-asthmatic medication <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DPUB8ck">Twoway messages are designed for self-report followed by automated feedback.</s><s xml:id="_HtG3xdc">Shapiro et.</s><s xml:id="_rVaBqUC">al. demonstrated the feasibility of two-way TM for monitoring physical activity as well as consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages and screen time in children.</s><s xml:id="_7uGPYZ2">Subject's self-report generated an automated TM positive feedback response to re-enforce good behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_gpX3BVg"><s xml:id="_a3V4BbM">However, several challenges have hindered TM from been widely adopted in tracking PROs.</s><s xml:id="_x2JCAyr">First, a majority of TM reporting systems relied on free-texts read by caregivers, which still causes extra human effort.</s><s xml:id="_NYZVc4b">Second, conventional TM systems often lacked the capability of an automated context-appropriate reply for behavior modification, necessitating providers to manually input responses.</s><s xml:id="_fKyPWrE">As the number of users increase, this process becomes more labor intensive and slower.</s><s xml:id="_H69E2Bz">Third, conventional systems lacked errorproofing with real-time correction; thus, responses were recorded regardless of accuracy.</s><s xml:id="_zRFgPhu">This problem has been especially problematic for younger adolescents or elder populations.</s><s xml:id="_EsYdTTc">Fourth, current TM-based PRO systems are restricted to a fixed reporting schedule for all patients, making it difficult to tailor a schedule according to an individual's daily activity.</s><s xml:id="_Y6kx47r">Fifth, common format used in past system is restricted to simple responses (such as typing Y (Yes) or N (No)), limiting measurement of complex health outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_Hy4S2Uz">Finally, TM reporting system do not have automatic provider notifications based on personalized health condition thresholds.</s></p><p xml:id="_ufd3THU"><s xml:id="_jG336MN">To address the aforementioned challenges, in this study we present a cloud-based two-way text messaging system, nicknamed REMOTES (REporting and MOnitoring TElemedicine System).</s><s xml:id="_kjZ5tEE">REMOTES is built on highly scalable and interactive cloud services.</s><s xml:id="_8FGHFSr">It allows providers to establish personalized reporting schedules.</s><s xml:id="_nrR2dSG">TM prompts and interventions are generated and delivered automatically without the need for manual typing.</s><s xml:id="_6xqdNaR">The TM communication is accomplished by utilizing an easy-to-understand reporting template that is capable of complex health assessments.</s><s xml:id="_QZyjST9">The system can also trigger automatic alarms to providers based on each personalized health condition thresholds.</s><s xml:id="_jgwZKs2">System design and implementation is provided in Section II.</s><s xml:id="_nFsS2qZ">Results from a

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_pSaRcBR">A. USE CASE AND SYSTEM DESIGN</head><p xml:id="_gtrvmzA"><s xml:id="_QWKEbfX">The architecture of REMOTES is developed using opensource and cloud-based services operated by Google, Inc.</s><s xml:id="_Nw4GuTD">A Google App Engine (GAE) platform acts as a central platform incorporating with other cloud services, including Google Voice, Google Drive, and Google Calendar, for different purposes.</s><s xml:id="_CTeUTht">The GAE service has a web-based interface allowing providers to perform online patient management.</s><s xml:id="_XxsJ2td">The cost-effective framework can handle 30 users in $4/week.</s><s xml:id="_teKDw5E">Key use cases and their corresponding cloud services are listed in Table <ref type="table">1</ref> and described in the following of this section.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_xBFGJ8z">1) PATIENT MANAGEMENT</head><p xml:id="_Jmh8QQg"><s xml:id="_PKV6YUh">We use the Google Web Toolkit (GWT) to develop an online patient management tool that can access the central GAE platform.</s><s xml:id="_qS5z6T8">Providers can use this online tool to subscribe new patients and specify personalized health condition thresholds.</s><s xml:id="_WGUeaQu">A threshold is a numerical number that triggers alarms to corresponding providers when a patient reports a score above the threshold.</s><s xml:id="_9kcsDcd">For example, if a pain threshold for a patient is 5, a pain score of 6 triggers critical alarms to the patient's associated providers for just-in-time follow-ups.</s></p><p xml:id="_nzBYGWF"><s xml:id="_4MTPtAN">TABLE 1. Use cases and corresponding cloud services.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_95NvRhm">2) REPORT SCHEDULING</head><p xml:id="_HTD35K7"><s xml:id="_qdhf7bk">In REMOTES, a patient has his/her own reporting schedule, which is set by providers, on Google Calendar.</s><s xml:id="_hnkF6PW">A calendar can consist of a series of one-time or repetitive events.</s><s xml:id="_xKBn4xn">Whenever the event occurs, the system prompts a corresponding message to the associated patient(s).</s><s xml:id="_dEejPj6">Providers perform the scheduling through a common calendar interface to minimize additional learning.</s><s xml:id="_vkUZwzz">In providers can share calendars with patients and their families (with or without the privilege of editing) so that the reporting schedule can fit their daily routines.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_hWnkyWW">3) MESSAGE POOL STORAGE</head><p xml:id="_PuXvWs6"><s xml:id="_xnPXbPW">In order to prevent sending repetitive messages to patients, which makes the reporting become tedious, the messages sent to patients are fetched from an event message pools.</s><s xml:id="_Jjs5K4v">A message pool allows different expressions of a critical concept.</s><s xml:id="_bwQ2vKY">The message pools are stored in spreadsheets hosted on the Google Drive (formally Google Docs) service.</s><s xml:id="_32Uyt8G">Care provider can access the Google Drive service to edit messages when needed.</s><s xml:id="_tDWUdFC">The message pools are sharable so that providers can improve message content together.</s><s xml:id="_CJYfKJe">For example, a physician can share the message pool with a psychiatric to improve messages related to mental health.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_PEJkpfM">4) TEXT MESSAGING COMMUNICATION</head><p xml:id="_gZNqVH5"><s xml:id="_EYKZFd8">The system sends and receives TMs via a unique phone number provided by the Google Voice service.</s><s xml:id="_vt23bN7">Upon receipt of a response from a patient, the Google Voice service relays the message to the GAE platform where the message is processed.</s><s xml:id="_SCmcgfu">If the response is invalid, REMOTES triggers an instructional message, which contains an example in valid format, and requests the patient to repeat the response.</s><s xml:id="_XVARPSh">Otherwise, the system stores the response and, if necessary, sends an intervention and/or the next question.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_dXcSQc4">5) REPORT FORMATTING</head><p xml:id="_VUeneKn"><s xml:id="_f27RpdT">A majority of conventional TM reporting systems communicate via free-text and do not impose message formatting.</s><s xml:id="_sRxmtNY">Manually processing unformatted messages requires effort from medical staff, and may result in human interpretation errors.</s><s xml:id="_GMwHREZ">We introduce a simple response format that can be automatically processed by computers and is capable of a wide coverage of reporting styles.</s><s xml:id="_wRJ37Kq">The formatting instruction is embedded in the messages sent to the patient, alleviating a need to remember response formats.</s><s xml:id="_Eje6T7t">This schema gives providers the flexibility to define templates.</s><s xml:id="_xCzDG7T">All templates are stored on the Google Drive.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_wZ5uxxj">6) HEALTH TIPS</head><p xml:id="_MnNxaN6"><s xml:id="_5NsdDgN">In addition to the self-reporting via two-way text messaging, REMOTES is also capable of sending health tips via one-way messages that do not require patients to respond.</s><s xml:id="_XGwmCFY">Health tips provide educational information that encourages patients to learn about how to maintain their health and prevent possible conditions.</s><s xml:id="_NeVRqdx">Health tip messages are generated by providers and stored in message pools on Google Drive.</s><s xml:id="_KZYtCwN">Providers can help patients schedule when they want to receive health tips on the calendar.</s><s xml:id="_twxNn82">When a health tip event occurs, the REMOTES system randomly selects and sends a message form the pool.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_Ypsg2qV">7) REPORTS STORAGE AND RETRIEVAL</head><p xml:id="_RMMHPjW"><s xml:id="_pHawN2M">In addition to message pools, the Google Drive service stores patient reports.</s><s xml:id="_WWf5Bpz">When a response is received from a patient and is valid, it is stored in a patient-specific spreadsheet.</s><s xml:id="_PJRXECD">Providers can log in to download data in the file formats used by common data analysis software.</s><s xml:id="_hPMwmak">Google Drive service also stores important information regarding patient interaction with the REMOTES system, including (1) number of messages sent to patients, (2) number of messages received, and (3) other reporting statistics (e.g., on-time reporting rate, reporting correctness, and average response time).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_Er2tpt6">8) SECURITY PROTECTION</head><p xml:id="_yMhnjWf"><s xml:id="_7rUFGHK">Security and privacy concerns are significant for cloud computing systems, creating several challenges for use in the healthcare domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Sf999w2">Our system design strategy was to remain HIPPA-compliant and secure personally identifiable information.</s><s xml:id="_usZjbkh">None of the services linked to any medical record systems, and none of stored data on Google Drive could be mapped to a patient medical record.</s><s xml:id="_trCCP6q">A specially created google voice number will be used for each patient and the mapping will be stored in the HIPPAA complaint systems at hospitals.</s><s xml:id="_AZ6HwMk">All generated data reports contained only de-identified and aggregated data.</s><s xml:id="_VxxqRAG">Access to all Google services was controlled by a unique account with a highstrength password that was changed every three months at a minimum and shared only with authorized personnel.</s><s xml:id="_3KseakN">A study contact email address was given to patients to report system errors or unexpected behavior.</s><s xml:id="_by842ed">Even though Google's cloud services provided high level of data protection, our data on the Google Docs was automatically backed up twice a week using secure Internet protocol, encrypted, and then archived in the password-protected server.</s></p></div>
