a lack of evidence for long-term SB reductions.</s><s xml:id="_4Dbh3B2">It was also not possible to analyse interventions targeting workplace sitting at long-term follow-up points as there was insufficient data to conduct a meta-analysis.</s><s xml:id="_t2EU6kQ">This lack of long-term evidence is seen in other reviews exploring interventions to reduce SB <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>; where they also did not or could not evaluate long-term effectiveness.</s><s xml:id="_fUb4jrh">Given the importance of sustained behaviour change for health effects, this lack of data highlights the need for studies to examine the effects of longer term SB interventions and over longer follow-up periods.</s></p><p xml:id="_6nqMgBN"><s xml:id="_XxCbVTW">Greater reductions in SB were found in studies where self-report/proxy measures (53 min/day) of SB were used compared to objective measures (35 min/day).</s><s xml:id="_jd92FrU">This was also seen in a similar meta-analysis on interventions to reduce SB <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zrv6pmH">This may be due to the subjective assessment of SB being limited by the ubiquitous nature of the behaviours, which may be unremarkable, intermittent and incidental and therefore difficult to accurately recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_cTftRGW">Objective measures are also not without limitations.</s><s xml:id="_cU2ennp">It was not possible to compare cut points and wear time algorithms used in studies, it should be noted that these differences may introduce in the scale observed.</s><s xml:id="_cftm5US">The development and refinement of valid and reliable objective measures of SB which can incorporate the type and contextual factors, as well as clear guidelines on wear time and cut points are required <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Fv5mwPA">This is the first review to collate BCTs used in SB change interventions using computer, mobile or wearable technology in adults.</s><s xml:id="_DZuMCsY">The aim was not to provide definitive conclusions regarding the most effective behaviour change intervention components, but code to identify which techniques have been used to reduce SB.</s><s xml:id="_GDbTFma">It is, however, difficult to conceptually separate PA promotion and SB reduction components within an intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_RVBGhaD">In typical applications of BCT taxonomies in other literatures, a single behaviour is defined and targeted by the intervention, and the link to BCTs can be assumed to be explicitly related to changing that single behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8reYCGm">The reality of the design and reporting of many interventions within this review is that they target multiple behaviours and outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_HqazK6H">Thus, making it more difficult to link BCTs to specific behaviours.</s><s xml:id="_2PnS6An">Moreover, there was a lack of clear and consistent reporting of which BCTs were undertaken within each intervention making classification of BCTs difficult <ref type="bibr">[54]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_cGmRU4y">Research is warranted to identify the 'active ingredients' of successful interventions to refine the design of optimal BCT use and produce an evidence base upon which SB interventions can be developed.</s><s xml:id="_KzGag7c">In order to assess the impact of BCTs, the reporting of intervention content must be improved.</s><s xml:id="_3A546my">Researchers should "clearly define and provide a rationale for all BCTs that have been included" with full intervention manuals being provided as supplementary electronic files [55].</s><s xml:id="_YWKAvMd">In complex interventions, clearer delineation of strategies used to change PA and SB, respectively, in intervention reports is required.</s></p><p xml:id="_3qfSQEw"><s xml:id="_JZawxbq">The most frequently coded BCTs to reduce SB across the interventions as a whole were "instruction on how to perform a behaviour" "social support (unspecified)", "prompts and cues" and "adding objects to the environment".</s><s xml:id="_FEJrgec">Whereas, the most frequently coded BCTs for computer, mobile and wearable components of the interventions were "prompts and cues", "self-monitoring of behaviour", "social support (unspecified)" and "goal setting".</s><s xml:id="_YzzuzMR">These differences suggest some BCTs may lend themselves well to certain modes of delivery and that the BCTs identified in the technology components might fruitfully be incorporated into future technology based interventions to reduce SB.</s></p><p xml:id="_dprW3eZ"><s xml:id="_t9CSAYp">When comparing the computer, mobile and wearable components in workplace interventions and overall daily interventions, "prompts and cues" was more frequently coded in workplace interventions and "social support (unspecified)" was more frequently coded in overall daily interventions.</s><s xml:id="_fXwBUF2">This reflects the results in Gardner et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> where it is suggested that workplace SB may be more receptive to planning and routinisation than non-workplace SB, which occurs in less predictable and structured contexts.</s><s xml:id="_jbu7ndd">This highlights the need for interventions to be chosen on the basis of what is most appropriate and feasible in the specific setting <ref type="bibr">[56]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mYNVYkG">The high usage of the BCT 'prompts/cues' identified in this review and that of Direito et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> illustrates that technology may be harnessed to facilitate intervention delivery, however, also to conduct intervention "top-ups" beyond the intervention core duration.</s><s xml:id="_UaHMYBe">This may be a vital component for interventions to prevent relapse.</s></p><p xml:id="_9MArDQH"><s xml:id="_9DFenCu">This study has a number of strengths, including a comprehensive search strategy in multiple databases and the adherence to methodological criteria for high qualitysystematic reviews and meta-analysis.</s><s xml:id="_gPhWzja">In addition, the systematic detailing of BCT coding procedures using the most recent BCT taxonomy (v1), allows future researchers to replicate and review methods used in detail.</s><s xml:id="_cAcVM5n">However, non-English publications were excluded from review and the search was limited to peer reviewed publications.</s><s xml:id="_T6yxzEd">There was considerable heterogeneity of included studies with regard to intervention type, sample size, follow-up duration, type and outcome estimates and no metaregression was performed.</s><s xml:id="_jbK2ASQ">Baseline sitting levels varied across the studies, the scope for change post intervention may be influenced by how much participants sat pre intervention.</s><s xml:id="_CGrdnks">It must also be noted that how central technology was to each intervention varied greatly.</s><s xml:id="_H7ey7JF">13/17 included studies were of high risk of bias, with particular concerns in the areas of detection and attrition bias.</s><s xml:id="_V9qxB58">Six studies were at high risk of attrition bias due to high dropout levels.</s><s xml:id="_QEdEmZU">SB measures used to determine intervention effects in this analysis were measured through subjective measures in seven studies and thus were at high risk for detection bias.</s><s xml:id="_TFkFRPq">These identified methodological flaws present a problem when trying to draw conclusions and evidence presented in the current review should be interpreted with caution.</s><s xml:id="_ZHcttFX">This review also included 'active' comparator groups which may contribute to smaller intervention effects.</s><s xml:id="_7vDmhu7">It was not possible to statistically analyse the individual effectiveness of BCTs or to assess the effectiveness of different combinations of behaviour techniques due to the number of different combinations of BCTs present within studies.</s><s xml:id="_k45ka4m">In order to address this, future study designs could consider using adaptive interventions such as sequential multiple assignment trials (SMART) or multiphase optimization strategy (MOST) designs.</s><s xml:id="_MtqkhMd">Finally, technology development often outpaces academic research [57] and this review includes two studies using the Gruve activity monitor which is no longer commercially available.</s></p><p xml:id="_gUxCEf2"><s xml:id="_7vn5UvP">This systematic review provides a useful overview of the effectiveness of computer, mobile and wearable technology interventions in reducing SB and has exposed important gaps in the current evidence base which warrant further attention.</s><s xml:id="_jKyMYAn">Future research should focus on attrition rates to reduce drop out and improve engagement.</s><s xml:id="_kbDwJEz">Such studies may consider using technology to refresh the intervention, varying the approach or introduce a new intervention as time passes to encourage long-term maintenance of SB reductions.</s><s xml:id="_FQhtJAj">Furthermore, research should aim to improve detection bias by using objective measurement tools of SB e.g.</s><s xml:id="_9xWVJWb">accelerometer/ inclinometer, in order to better detect intervention effects.</s><s xml:id="_wK5gFsZ">The lack of long-term follow-up highlights the need for extended follow-up in future studies to examine potential long-term impacts of SB interventions.</s><s xml:id="_bbMxGfM">We also recommend including outcome measures that will be of interest to workplaces and policy makers to determine efficient use of resources such as the cost-effectiveness of technology supported
