through automation and simplification, they enable humans to do things that would otherwise not be possible, or at least not to the same extent or with the same quality.</s><s xml:id="_J2xMhgw">On the same subject, a machine learning algorithm that is able to make diagnoses faster or better than most doctors could be expected to lead to substantial reductions in the price of that particular service.</s><s xml:id="_2mZYUxA">Provided that we have sufficient empirical evidence, one could then directly compare the prevailing approach (doctor diagnosis) with the new digital approach (algorithm plus or minus doctor diagnosis) and conclude that the new intervention will get the same job done at a much lower cost.</s></p><p xml:id="_k2WUVy8"><s xml:id="_QtxyzMC">But why is such a cost-saving intervention still likely to increase health-care expenditure?</s><s xml:id="_n3mfFys">This apparent paradox can be explained by the common confusion between microeconomic effects of individual healthcare interventions or programmes, and effects on the whole health-care market.</s><s xml:id="_K9uQHuN">Although a microeconomic study might conclude that substituting old with new might lead to net savings, the typical models in such studies assume that health-care utilisation of the service or treatment under investigation remains unchanged and that the two approaches differ only in their costs and health consequences.</s><s xml:id="_7sKpSnC">Thus, an intervention that is of lower price, even without causing a change in health outcomes compared with the alternative, would be expected to result in cost savings.</s></p><p xml:id="_Qjty4Ag"><s xml:id="_BkdW5KJ">However, health-care markets tend to be in disequilibrium when demand continues to exceed supply and use.</s><s xml:id="_VG9SZPd">In such a setting, reducing the price of a particular service will invariably lead to an increase in the quantity demanded.</s><s xml:id="_p4Ybyty">Given that total expenditure equals the quantity demanded multiplied by its price, introduction of low-price technologies might lead to an overall rise in expenditure.</s><s xml:id="_Bm2NvRX">In other words, medical uses of the new treatment are increased through addressing an unmet demand, and this expansion in use leads to a net rise in expenditure.</s></p></div>
