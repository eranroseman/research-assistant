and public health guidelines emphasize six categories of dietary and activityrelated behaviors that can produce a negative energy balance and, thus, lead to weight loss.</s><s xml:id="_XSJGgK9">These include 1) increasing vegetable consumption; 2) increasing fruit consumption; 3) decreasing dietary fat consumption; 4) decreasing portion size; 5) increasing daily activity; and 6) increasing planned exercise.</s><s xml:id="_cuvNkmM">Because our weight loss intervention addressed all of these behavioral domains, our objective was to develop a means for accurately staging participants in each area.</s><s xml:id="_W4dj75Q">We reasoned that separate SOC assessments were required for each area because of the diversity among obese individuals in their readiness to change different weight loss-related behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_XKSG9tN">For example, whereas one obese individual might be actively restricting dietary fat intake but not thinking about starting an exercise program, another obese individual may be making plans to start exercising next week but has not considered adding more vegetables to his or her diet.</s></p><p

loss-related domain with a separate, single-item algorithm.</s><s xml:id="_Jt4PE5x">Data from 284 overweight or obese primary care patients revealed significant stair-step relationships between SOC for five of six domains (increased vegetable consumption was the exception) and two anthropometric measures, BMI and waist girth <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(21)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_j6ParCV">However, the percentage of participants in the action or maintenance stages of change ranged from 35% (physical exercise) to 66% (eating more vegetables), suggesting that the single-item algorithm was insufficiently sensitive to individual behavioral differences and was susceptible to an optimistic response bias.</s></p><p xml:id="_B9KrynX"><s xml:id="_GnPyZQM">To address these issues, we developed an M-SOC for each domain of weight loss-related behaviors with the exception of planned exercise.</s><s xml:id="_tMTBbr7">Whereas there are several smaller changes in typical dietary behavior or in the domain of general physical activity that promote weight loss, a person needs to engage regularly in only one type of planned exercise to lose weight.</s><s xml:id="_FSFpjjx">Thus, planned exercise was staged with an adaptation of the standard algorithm <ref type="bibr">(24 -26)</ref> to include ratings of frequency and duration of exercise, additions designed to increase the reliability of reports.</s><s xml:id="_TvBxq5p">Because it was our intention to target increased fruit and vegetable consumption in our intervention as different expressions of the same dietary goal, we assessed fruit and vegetable consumption with a single algorithm.</s><s xml:id="_3UYDPd2">Item pools of behaviors were generated for each of the four domains based on nutritional and physical activity guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(27)</ref> and empirical demonstrations of relationships between the behavior and weight loss.</s><s xml:id="_pYqRxEv">Examples of behaviors for the domain "decreasing dietary fat consumption" are "trim all the fat off meat" and "not use butter or margarine on bread, rolls, muffins, or bagels."</s><s xml:id="_qj6TMdE">Examples of behaviors for the domain "decreasing portion size" included "stop eating before I feel stuffed" and "say no to second helpings."</s><s xml:id="_UJm7aUW">For the domain "increasing usual daily activity," items included "take the stairs rather than the elevator or escalator" and "do heavy housework such as washing windows or floors."</s><s xml:id="_7U2HUCW">In all cases, items referred to specific behaviors that were common enough to apply to many people seeking to lose weight.</s><s xml:id="_GFnVYFf">A five-statement set of responses was generated for each item ranging from "I do not do this at least half the time now and I have no plans to do this" (precontemplation) to "I do this at least half the time now and have been doing it regularly for more than 6 months" (maintenance).</s><s xml:id="_wU7FrP2">The frequency rating (. .</s><s xml:id="_5r98mWc">.at least half the time. .</s><s xml:id="_X4TJRpd">.) was included based on feedback from previous samples that indicated that even the most committed dieter or exerciser stumbles from time to time and that a categorical requirement of engaging in an eating or activity behavior 100% of the

exercise (p Ͻ 0.0001).</s><s xml:id="_q4kURDb">Regression equations that controlled for BMI and assessment site also yielded significant relationships between SOC for dietary fat and the percent of

format was redesigned to reduce respondent burden.</s><s xml:id="_dMQyGe4">In addition, a global item (e.g., "eat a lower-fat diet" "engage in more daily activities," etc.) was added to each section of the questionnaire to permit comparisons with previous work.</s><s xml:id="_mvn6q8Q">Final item pools for "increasing fruits and vegetables," "decreasing portion size," and "increasing usual
