<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_htr32AA">DISCUSSION</head><p xml:id="_cHHG9bC"><s xml:id="_g3RSCUj">We found that BP and hypertension were not routinely discussed in the clinical notes for patient visits with HBP (140/90 and higher).</s><s xml:id="_GbRKTzG">Across all visits with HBP recorded, only 31% had any associated clinical note with a corresponding discussion of BP or hypertension.</s><s xml:id="_2BjEuhv">Discussions of HBP measurements in notes varied widely based on medical specialty, but even in primary-care-related clinics, HBP measurements were mentioned in only 70% of visits.</s><s xml:id="_NWtN7BR">High BP was less likely to be discussed in notes of visits with patients presenting with acute problems (e.g., pain, injury, infection).</s><s xml:id="_2GHCrbk">In contrast, visits for patients with prior reference to BP or hypertension outside the vital signs portion of the note, or a prior diagnosis of non-hypertension HBP were approximately 10 times more likely to have a reference of BP or hypertension in their clinical note.</s></p><p xml:id="_pNPwZXq"><s xml:id="_NX65CMf">Currently, in the absence of end-organ disease, multiple BP readings are needed for a diagnosis. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">18</ref></s><s xml:id="_A754HtZ">Contributing to the diagnostic inertia commonly associated with hypertension is the practice of attributing high measurements to "white coat" hypertension. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">19</ref></s><s xml:id="_XxrF5nv">Also, clinic measurement of BP may be suboptimal, and providers might discount high values.</s><s xml:id="_eJCVSmQ">To overcome these barriers to hypertension diagnosis, interventions have focused on measuring BP outside of traditional healthcare settings.</s><s xml:id="_9FMBq9w">Examples include health fairs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">20</ref> churches, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">21</ref> and barber shops. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">22</ref></s><s xml:id="_GrUMF2K">Other interventions have focused on increasing home readings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">24</ref></s><s xml:id="_HYGtEsf">However, these interventions require transferring measurements back to healthcare providers and subsequent follow-up with patients.</s><s xml:id="_CXwSYUr">In contrast, the EMR provides a convenient platform for recording and viewing BP values.</s><s xml:id="_TN9ZSHt">Yet, despite the ubiquity of EMRs and the near-universal recording of BP measurements at clinic visits, hypertension diagnosis and treatment remain suboptimal. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">10</ref></s><s xml:id="_PNKXNWD">EMR-based automatic alerts to address hypertension could be implemented, but they have had limited success in previous studies. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[26]</ref></s><s xml:id="_zZgaTn7">]<ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[27]</ref> We hypothesize that a reference to BP outside of the vital signs section of the note is a marker for recognition.</s><s xml:id="_g5vSD7w">Indeed, discussing smoking in the clinical record is associated with future smoking-related conversations between physicians and patients. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">28</ref></s><s xml:id="_RcScnw4">Also, including obesity in a clinical note is associated with initiating obesity-related therapy. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">29</ref></s><s xml:id="_wXb98Bx">While we cannot claim that discussion of HBP will directly lead to the diagnosis of hypertension and better BP control, we found that patients with discussion of HBP in clinical notes were more likely to have additional BP discussions included in the notes of subsequent visits.</s><s xml:id="_A3JkJwq">Furthermore, patients previously diagnosed with "elevated blood pressure, not hypertension" were substantially more likely to have BP referenced in future notes.</s><s xml:id="_VC52TXf">Our results support two reasons for failure to discuss HBP measurements.</s><s xml:id="_trB8PyS">First, healthcare providers are busy and confronted with competing clinical problems. <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">30</ref></s><s xml:id="_r3HdxBD">Indeed, notes were less likely to reference BP measurements if patients presented with an acute problem (e.g., infection or injury).</s><s xml:id="_xGZraAn">Additionally, patients with multiple comorbidities were less likely to have clinical notes referencing BP.</s><s xml:id="_vz58jdM">Having multiple medical problems likely translates into less time for focusing on HBP measurements.</s><s xml:id="_RrRUHtc">Furthermore, notes were less likely to reference BP when patients presented just before lunchtime.</s><s xml:id="_xV4cdGZ">These patients may have less time dedicated to their visit to focus on BP because of prior patient visits running overtime compared to patients with clinic visits earlier in the day.</s></p><p xml:id="_DFkEhzU"><s xml:id="_bdB5an6">A second factor contributing to the lack of discussion of HBP readings in clinical notes may stem from healthcare providers perceiving the diagnosis of hypertension as beyond their specific responsibilities.</s><s xml:id="_DVP6Cec">For example, clinics with a primary focus on hypertension management, such as nephrology and primary care, exhibit significantly higher rates of including BP discussions in notes, in stark contrast to medical specialties less directly associated with hypertension, like psychiatry and dermatology.</s><s xml:id="_2WSzHwY">Interestingly, even though cardiologists and neurologists are expected to possess advanced knowledge about hypertension, our findings indicate that visits associated with these specialties do not significantly differ from those in infectious diseases and gastroenterology concerning the discussion of HBP readings.</s><s xml:id="_MtnscRy">This suggests that factors beyond potential knowledge disparities may contribute to the variability in discussing abnormal BP readings across different medical specialties.</s></p><p xml:id="_ppgAYC2"><s xml:id="_pmfST4e">Our study has several limitations.</s><s xml:id="_c32Jmrn">First, this study was conducted at one institution, and though we believe that the results would be similar in other institutions, the results might not be generalizable.</s><s xml:id="_FAV3Fgg">However, the methods we propose here can be implemented at any institution with an EMR.</s><s xml:id="_G44m8kA">Second, we used "hypertension" and "BP" as a marker for discussions of HBP.</s><s xml:id="_TzPbcgv">These terms may refer to other diseases, but we controlled for cases of portal, pulmonary, or ocular hypertension.</s><s xml:id="_6fVwCAf">Nevertheless, some notes might have been misclassified.</s><s xml:id="_4CXXDms">For example, some discussions could have referred to a family history of hypertension.</s><s xml:id="_YaCfQKE">However, such misclassifications would bias our results toward the null, providing a more optimistic measure of BP or hypertension discussions in clinical notes.</s><s xml:id="_rtkMgUH">Third, BP may have been discussed but not recorded. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">31</ref></s><s xml:id="_z2vs48v">espite our limitations, we found that HBP measurements are often recorded but seldom discussed in clinical notes, especially outside primary-care settings.</s><s xml:id="_jNFxJR8">Our results identify a new opportunity to overcome hypertension-related diagnostic inertia: improving discussions in clinical notes.</s><s xml:id="_XWM5zQw">While efforts to increase the measurement of BP outside clinic settings should be encouraged, our results highlight the importance of recognizing HBP values currently recorded in the EMR across different clinical settings.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .Figure 2
