these are the inputs to the decision-making system.</s><s xml:id="_KuXVwBg">In general, for each patient, we have a history H of their measurements and treatments to date.</s><s xml:id="_T5nJJRZ">We define a policy a = πH as a mapping from the patient's history to the next treatment decision.</s><s xml:id="_dea9ww7">However, working with entire histories can be unweildy; and so reinforcement learning practioners often simplify the problem by defining a simpler set of covariates s to summarize the history.</s><s xml:id="_VUAzdu3">In Section 4, we discuss how the choice of summary statistic can impact the quality of the policy learned.</s></p><p xml:id="_uKaYVhE"><s xml:id="_jfUbCD5">For the action (or treatment) space, we also make some simplifying assumptions.</s><s xml:id="_Q9NeH6H">We discretize each of our treatments (IV fluids and vasopressors) into 5 bins, the first representing no treatment (zero dosage), and the rest representing quartiles of the actions prescribed by physicians.</s><s xml:id="_FtDMyVj">The combination of these two actions results in 25 possible treatment choices that we must choose from for every 4-hour interval.</s><s xml:id="_XnkNy6U">Focusing on IV fluids and vasopressors assumes that those are the only treatments that we have control over; the patient may receive other treatments (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_QXyHyRS">antibiotics) but those are out of our scope.</s></p><p xml:id="_QpaBczP"><s xml:id="_nmfhve2">Finally, we must define a reward function.</s><s xml:id="_J5pjr59">In reinforcement learning, the reward r represents the desirability of the immediate outcomes of the action taken, and the goal of an RL policy is to learn the policy which will maximize for all patients the total reward collected over the entire history, R = T t=0 r t , where r t is the reward received at time t, and T is the total number of time intervals in the patient's history.</s><s xml:id="_xpmYPVE">In our analyses, we assume that our decision-making agent receives a reward of zero up until its last action; at the final time interval of the history the agent receives a positive reward if the patient survives and a negative reward otherwise.</s></p><p xml:id="_5UU2GtV"><s xml:id="_6qy6GCv">Once the state, action, and reward structure of the problem have been formalized, we are ready to start searching for an optimal policy π.</s><s xml:id="_9TYF7na">In reinforcement learning, the quality of a policy is quantified by the expected cumulative rewards, known as the value</s></p><formula xml:id="formula_0">V π = E H∼π [R H ].</formula><p xml:id="_PGtMgXM"><s xml:id="_e5ymZUk">If we could implement our treatment policy, calculating the above would be easy: we would simply try our policy on many patients and then compute the average returns (outcomes).</s><s xml:id="_gFGtSg6">However, in many cases, we cannot directly experiment with patients in this way; we first want to estimate how well a policy might perform given historical data.</s><s xml:id="_NkSucTf">The challenge of computing the value of one policy given another is known as off-policy evaluation and is the subject of this discussion.</s></p><p xml:id="_fRqPckN"><s xml:id="_epJuAE6">3 Why do we need careful evaluation?</s></p><p xml:id="_hCTbpbj"><s xml:id="_s8yP7cU">Before diving into the sublteties associated with off-policy evaluation, we first provide two illustrative examples of why careful evaluation is needed in the first place.</s></p><p xml:id="_9UPbfpr"><s xml:id="_Dy3X7J5">For the first illustration, we describe what happens when we apply a standard reinforce-ment learning algorithm to the sepsis management problem above.</s><s xml:id="_UjaTPW4">We observed a tendency of learned policies to recommend minimal treatment for patients with very high acuity (SOFA score).</s><s xml:id="_uKPYkrj">This recommendation makes little sense from a clinical perspective, but can be understood from the perspetive of the RL algorithm.</s><s xml:id="_xCh62ec">Most patients who have high SOFA score receive aggressive treatment, and because of the severity of their condition, the mortality rate for this subpopulation is also high.</s><s xml:id="_XnKqVvJ">In the absence of data on patients with high acuity that received no treatment, the RL algorithm concludes that trying something rarely or never performed may be better than treatments known to have poor outcomes.</s></p><p xml:id="_vZNdR63"><s xml:id="_7N4kCpw">For our second illustration, we consider what happens when the RL agent is tasked to only consider when to intubate a patient (and not provided agency over other treatments, such as IV fluids or vasopressors).</s><s xml:id="_YgRrSpD">Limiting the number of treatments makes the RL problem more tractable, but we observed that the RL agent recommended intubation noticably more than clinicians.</s><s xml:id="_Re7GRX9">Upon further inspection, it turns out that the overuse of intubation is a result of a lack of treatment options: the RL algorithm learns to recognize patients who need additional care, and, in the absence of other options, takes the only action available to it.</s><s xml:id="_4rSSeuZ">When we trained an RL agent with more treatment choices (mechanical ventillation, IV fluids, and vasopressors), the overuse of mechanical ventillation disappears.</s></p><p xml:id="_gn9ZQFp"><s xml:id="_eKefrQ2">The susceptibility of AI algorithms to learn harmful policies due to artifacts in the data or methodology highlights the importance of evaluation.</s><s xml:id="_nF8bZvg">In the following sections we demonstrate how and when standard evaluation methods may fail to recognize such artifacts, and recommend best practices for evaluation.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="4" xml:id="_gH7MGVc">Challenges with Choosing Representations</head><p xml:id="_cmd4TuT"><s xml:id="_RjWhZPd">The Challenge As we mentioned in our overview of the sepsis management problem, the first step in applying the reinforcement learning framework to a problem is determining how to summarize a patient's history H into some more manageable covariate that we define as the state representation s.</s><s xml:id="_nj6Mc8a">In machine learning, this task is known is choosing a representation, because it involves deciding how to represent a patient's history in a way that retains sufficient information for the task at hand.</s><s xml:id="_j3v6mVG">It is essential that this representation accounts for any variables that might confound estimates of outcomes under the policy <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Robins, 2000]</ref>, that is, we must include any factors that causally affect both observed treatment decisions and the outcome.</s><s xml:id="_ESV3atH">For example, sicker patients receive more aggressive treatments and have higher mortality.</s><s xml:id="_jpQNyJg">If one fails to adjust for the acuity of the patient, one might erroneously conclude that treatment increases risk of mortality, even when the opposite is true.</s></p><p xml:id="_eyRynDF"><s xml:id="_tREHZ6p">Formally, confounding variables represent any information that influenced a decision and had an effect on the outcome of that decision.</s><s xml:id="_7bRjbfu">These variables may include a patients entire medical record, their genetic make-up, as well as socio-economic and environmental factors.</s><s xml:id="_jjQeWcT">Unfortunately, it is impossible to verify that all confounders have been measured based on statistical quantities alone <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[Robins, 2000]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ApZeMcM">Instead, domain knowledge must be applied to justify this claim.</s><s xml:id="_sWsFVzD">Does the clinical researcher, based on their knowledge of the disease, believe that all important factors have been measured?</s><s xml:id="_U55m9RB">We note that identifying confounding factors is a substantial task even for the simpler problem of making a single treatment decision, and this problem is only aggravated in the sequential setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[Chakraborty and Murphy, 2014]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_mzgzJfb"><s xml:id="_DdWHVb7">Moreover, even if all potential confounders have been measured, it is important to ensure that the data structure passed to the RL algorithm retains this information.</s><s xml:id="_FcPMVdW">In particular, as we mentioned before, a patient's history is a large and often unwieldy object, and thus it is standard practice to compress this history into some features known as the state representation.</s><s xml:id="_dhTNHBx">All RL algorithms assume that the features given to them are sufficient summaries of the entire patient history and will fail if the representation is insufficient.</s><s xml:id="_qEbkXgm">However, identifying such a representation is not straightforward.</s><s xml:id="_xTy5ENz">For example, to make a prediction about a patient's response to a specific medication such as a vasopressor in the ICU, is it sufficient to recall the last dose administered?</s><s xml:id="_PwBqVGJ">The cumulative dose given throughout the ICU stay?</s><s xml:id="_mmf5tS3">Each instance it was given?</s><s xml:id="_BAXEH6z">The correct choice of summary will depend on the specific clinical problem at hand.</s></p><p xml:id="_NwwUrBK"><s xml:id="_WHq9mGS">Illustration To illustrate the sensitivity of RL algorithms to these kinds of representation choices, we decided to use a simple clustering
