prescription drug advertising in 2008 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_aKZUVVM">Proponents of such advertising believe that it educates the public about treatment options and encourages consumers to talk to their doctors about their health concerns <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_4BUchcJ">Critics have argued that the true purpose of DTC advertising is to prompt patients to make brand-specific requests for prescription drugs, which leads to unnecessary prescribing and the potential for conflict in the doctor-patient relationship <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_S5DxmcV">Despite the intensity of the debate, and associated efforts to curtail DTC advertising via legislation at the state and federal levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>, little research has examined the specific issue of how the attitudes, beliefs and behaviors of individuals with depression are shaped by DTC antidepressant advertisements.</s><s xml:id="_Uj8pPh6">This is surprising, for antidepressants are among the most prescribed drugs in the United States <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_F9rvdKn">U.S. sales for selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and selective norepinephrinereceptive inhibitors (SSRIs) were $12.5 billion in 2005, and approximately $122 million was devoted to direct-to-consumer (DTC) antidepressant advertising in that year <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_PhpG29Z"><s xml:id="_zS8s2kH">The present study begins to address this gap in the literature using data from a survey of Internet peer-to-peer depression support group members.</s><s xml:id="_yMfttyR">Such groups remain understudied <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> despite the fact that a majority of Americans regularly use the Internet to investigate health matters <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, and nearly 3 in 10 Internet users participate in online support groups organized around issues of health and well being <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_46JhyGs">On Yahoo!</s><s xml:id="_AAG2QwA">Groups alone, there were 3782 groups in the "mental health disorders" category in September 2009.</s><s xml:id="_cu4e9DR">Since the use health support groups is increasing, and because doctors deal with such patients on a daily basis, peer-to-peer support groups represent a vanguard population in need of study.</s></p><p xml:id="_QBmsEwz"><s xml:id="_9TdcRDN">We first explored the extent to which highly motivated members of a depression support group are aware of antidepressant advertisements.</s><s xml:id="_eVJcd4f">Public awareness of these advertisements is

antidepressant advertisements among individuals with depression is understudied.</s><s xml:id="_JbhGw4n">Other than a survey which found that 85% of respondents with depression had seen Prozac advertisements, we know little about how closely individuals with depression attend to these advertisements <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_pswVr3G">Second, we assessed perceptions of the educational value of antidepressant advertisements among individuals with a history of depression.</s><s xml:id="_NMXxZes">Many observers have questioned the quality of information in DTC advertising generally <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and antidepressant advertisements specifically <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_CfYts4h">Judgments of an advertisement's believability mediate people's responses to it <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, including their willingness to talk with their physicians after seeing such an advertisement <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_6fd3PT9">Ours is the first investigation to assess the views of people with depression about the educational merit of antidepressant advertisements.</s></p><p xml:id="_nwTvmce"><s xml:id="_eBTHH37">Third, we examined attitudes toward these advertisements among individuals with depression.</s><s xml:id="_Az3jyut">Consumers have usually reported neutral to positive attitudes toward DTC advertising <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HmdNDGR">Attitudes are important because people who are positively predisposed toward these advertisements are more willing to seek information about advertised medications, discuss these drugs with their physicians, and request prescriptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr"

antidepressant advertisements.</s><s xml:id="_8zeRSJx">Surveys have found that consumers request prescriptions after seeing DTC advertising <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31]</ref>, including requests for antidepressants <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qyAdTEf">Donahue and colleagues found that the initiation of antidepressant drug therapy was 32% higher when antidepressant advertising was most extensive <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_N8eCTQs">Unfortunately, these studies do not examine the varied ways in which these advertisements shape patients' information-seeking activities in the medical encounter and beyond.</s></p><p xml:id="_DEDUuaM"><s xml:id="_3akZ3vs">Fifth, we investigated if antidepressant advertisements influence treatment preferences by framing depression as an outcome of a brain chemical imbalance, a prominent view in such advertisements <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_D9ewA8Y">Our focus is not on the validity of the chemical imbalance explanation, which has been contested <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Te7GKaC">Rather, we ask if exposure to these advertisements is associated with acceptance of the chemical imbalance account.</s><s xml:id="_hWCAPj7">People who subscribe to this explanation may feel that pharmacological treatment is necessary <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, discouraging consideration of evidence-based psychotherapies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fYD5Am3">Antidepressant advertisements can affect the public's beliefs about depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, but no study has

antidepressant advertising.</s><s xml:id="_yWJt2XC">They typically gave a low evaluation of the quality of information provided in such messages and held neutral attitudes.</s><s xml:id="_x9Pk2a5">Not surprising, individuals who evaluated more positively the information in these advertisements were more inclined to have acted upon them.</s><s xml:id="_zfeyX7r">This finding suggests that the

xml:id="_FKdjVfh">Third, DTCA antidepressant advertisements have some positive influence on the behavior of individuals with depression.</s><s xml:id="_uvJRR3e">The most prominent effect is to promote

depression history taking and suicide screening <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_nFaMyYX">These advertisements were more likely to lead patients to initiate discussions about medications than depression per se.</s><s xml:id="_kHr5cQM">This finding may reflect the nature of our sample, which consisted primarily of individuals with chronic depression who have probably acquired a good understanding of their condition.</s><s xml:id="_MW5n94C">These advertisements also led to requests for new prescriptions or a change in medications in 20% of respondents.</s><s xml:id="_7zQNcX4">Survey length limitations prevented us from exploring the outcomes of such requests, but we can note that switching doctors as a result of request nonfulfillment was reported by

xml:id="_hccgkqP">Fourth, little support could be found for the argument that advertising encourages demand for antidepressants by attributing depression to a brain chemical imbalance.</s><s xml:id="_Cv8Pptn">Individuals who paid the closest attention to these advertisements were indeed more likely to subscribe to this explanation of depression.</s><s xml:id="_F4HvVNS">Belief in the chemical imbalance account was significantly but weakly associated with higher acceptance ratings for antidepressants and lower ratings for counseling.</s><s xml:id="_U5PaT2W">However, endorsement of the chemical imbalance model was not associated with advertisement-induced prescription requests.</s><s xml:id="_UcQMJua">Future investigations should explore the full range of potential pathways to influence, which may include symptom recognition, rolemodeling of care-seeking behavior, "medicalization" of depression in ways that go beyond attributions of cause, and stigma reduction.</s></p><p xml:id="_C7gSFFe"><s xml:id="_j6W9HPY">Fifth, more than half of these respondents had visited an official antidepressant drug website after seeing an antidepressant advertisement, which underscores the need to investigate promotional messages delivered through both traditional media and the internet <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WrjN7Xg">Respondents were ten times

antidepressants advertising, rated the information in these advertisements of higher quality, and were more likely to have acted upon them.</s><s xml:id="_WuQkGZS">Perhaps antidepressant
