million people newly infected with HIV and around 38.4 million people living with HIV (PLWH) in 2021 <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_PvrS8YB">However, after starting antiretroviral therapy, PLWHs have a similar life expectancy as the general community <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_XcYMjFv">Since HIV is no longer a fatal illness but has evolved into a lifelong but manageable condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>, improving and ensuring the quality of life (QoL) of PLWHs have become increasingly important in recent years.</s><s xml:id="_BUvAZSj">Scholars have even advocated the "fourth 90" treatment target to be the QoL target for PLWHs, extending the continuum-of-services paradigm beyond the current treatment endpoint of immune reconstitution and viral suppression <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_WCrHX9w"><s xml:id="_z4skD58">Living with HIV is a life-altering experience, posing substantial challenges for not only PLWHs but also their partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_UNpbKaC">For example, cross-partner HIV transmission, the negotiation of sexual relationships, couple-level stigma, and the disclosure of HIV serodiscordancy to others are particular challenges for HIV serodiscordant couples <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_jkfCkRA">Since HIVrelated experience can be regarded as both indirect stress (e.g., stress contagion from the PLWH to their HIV-partner) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and direct dyadic stress (e.g., couple-level stigma) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>, treating HIV serodiscordant couples as a unit during illness management may be more effective for maintaining their relationship and the QoL of both partners <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_4RS4FBR"><s xml:id="_WbMpMES">The concept of dyadic coping is useful in comprehending the challenges that couples dealing with chronic illnesses such as HIV face.</s><s xml:id="_8SFymN6">This construct encapsulates a systemic approach to coping, which involves explicit or implicit stress communication from partner A, a coping response from partner B, and how partner A perceives the responsiveness of partner B <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_cMWUsPw">According to the Systemic Transaction Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, dyadic coping is not a simple combination of partners A and B's individual coping but a transaction process wherein both partners adopt coping strategies, aiming not only to help the stressed person but also to maintain relationship functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_K7s3EhB">Regarding relationship satisfaction as an outcome, a recent meta-analysis revealed that dyadic coping is positively associated with marital satisfaction among couples living with medical conditions (r = .35)</s><s xml:id="_h2BdCKU"><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_GPXTXFR">However, the literature on individual outcomes (e.g., QoL) has shown contradictory findings, with some studies suggesting the beneficial roles of dyadic coping, wherein patients report a higher QoL, and other studies failing to find these benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_kkKeHPG"><s xml:id="_cTRd2Tv">The existing literature has limitations.</s><s xml:id="_58k43MB">First, dyadic coping is a multidimensional construct that comprises three positive dyadic coping strategies and two negative dyadic coping strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, with varying effect sizes between each dimension and the outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_kaBG2ST">Therefore, calculating an average or total score may cause the heterogeneity of each dimension to be ignored.</s><s xml:id="_T9amtkk">Among the dyadic coping strategies, common dyadic coping (CDC) denotes the collaborative efforts of two partners to mitigate the detrimental effects of stressful events and incorporates emotional-based strategies (e.g., showing affection to each other, helping each other to relax) and problem-based strategies (e.g., helping one another to put the problem in perspective and see it differently, searching for solutions together).</s><s xml:id="_Ab5DAFV">CDC is distinct from other dyadic coping strategies (i.e., unidirectional coping) since it reflects a collaborative effort to cope with shared stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, which might be more adaptive in clinical settings (e.g., cancer).</s><s xml:id="_qXZH8rU">For example, a systemic review and meta-analysis found that CDC is positively associated with relationship quality (r = .42)</s><s xml:id="_4znrvuq">and emotional functioning (r = .13)</s><s xml:id="_w6zgGdS">in couples coping with cancer, whereas the effect sizes were smaller (r = .17-.14) for the associations between other dyadic coping strategies and relationship quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9vgzDEX">However, the findings from this meta-analysis were inconclusive due to the limited number of eligible studies included (N = 2-4).</s><s xml:id="_J8pSs2h">The researcher also did not report the aggregated effect sizes between other dyadic coping strategies and emotional functioning due to the same issue.</s><s xml:id="_23ag4K5">However, in a large longitudinal study (N = 538), CDC outperformed all other dyadic coping strategies in predicting marital quality and mental health among couples living with breast cancer <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HW94MUP">Since HIV may be transmitted from a PLWH to their partner <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, and they may both face HIVrelated stigma as a unit <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, it is crucial to explore whether these dyadic stressors mobilize the use of couple resources (e.g., CDC) to better adjust to the illness.</s></p><p xml:id="_cnsQDKP"><s xml:id="_mJBp3wN">Second, very few empirical studies have examined the antecedents of dyadic coping, which may have impeded the in-depth understanding of dyadic coping.</s><s xml:id="_NQud7eQ">Recent studies have identified some individual-level psychological constructs that may serve as antecedents for dyadic coping in clinical settings (e.g., self-efficacy <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, fear of illness progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>, perceived stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and resilience <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_WzzYxtn">However, these studies were limited to individual-level antecedents.</s><s xml:id="_bjbwxs6">The term "we-disease" refers to the appraisal of an illness as a shared stressor and the consequent joint efforts that both partners make to manage the illness <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Xw2Jr9r">A qualitative study found that some couples coping with breast cancer viewed their stress as "ours" (i.e., a shared experience), discussing how breast cancer had changed their lives as a couple and how they transitioned from using individualistic coping strategies to mutual coping strategies <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_s9P6RAw">A few studies have directly examined how couples' appraisals of illness ownership (i.e., we-disease appraisal) influence their illness adjustment <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_r5XG9U7">For example, a recent study conducted with couples coping with diabetes found that we-disease appraisal and collaboration are independently linked to support interactions and better mood <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Eas3nwf">However, it remains uncertain whether CDC can mediate the link between we-disease appraisal and relationship satisfaction and QoL.</s><s xml:id="_EgaAEfw">Furthermore, unlike cancer or diabetes, HIV can be transmitted between partners.</s><s xml:id="_atsm6H8">As a result, HIV is likely to be appraised as a "we-disease," and coping effectively with the illness (e.g., achieving viral suppression) can benefit both partners, which can result in improved health outcomes for both individuals and the potential enhancement of their sexual experiences, ultimately leading to greater relationship satisfaction.</s><s xml:id="_r7qHrJD">Therefore, HIV provides an ideal context for assessing the mediating mechanism of CDC, which links we-disease appraisal with adjustment outcomes.</s></p><p xml:id="_ttTRTe8"><s xml:id="_8jHpYym">Third, most empirical studies have adopted the Actor-Partner Interdependence Model (APIM) to investigate the association between dyadic coping and adjustment outcomes in couples living with chronic illness.</s><s xml:id="_9KN4Qug">However, not all variables are theoretically appropriate to test at the individual level.</s><s xml:id="_uMrPDBX">Although family and relationship scholars have often posed dyadic-level research questions, they have tended to conduct statistical analyses at the individual level <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_sRVsTG4">The Common Fate Model (CFM) offers an alternative to the APIM since it assumes that two partners can be affected by a common relational latent variable <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mNy6xJW">That is, there are two types of common drives that affect both partners: common shared external forces (e.g., quality of housing) and common relational factors (e.g., we-disease appraisal, CDC, and relationship satisfaction in this study) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wttxXPe">On the other hand, the APIM assumes that the interdependence among couples is driven by the direct effect of a person's predictor on the partner's outcomes (i.e., the partner effect), controlling for the effect on their own outcomes (i.e., the actor effect) <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_yNzzqJj">In practice, the choice of statistical models (CFM vs. APIM) depends on how we measure the construct and the research questions.</s><s xml:id="_XsRzpW9">One major consideration is the wording of the scale items.</s><s xml:id="_yVrakmh">If the variable measures a relationship as an object (e.g., We both tell each other how we feel), and two partners report on the same variable, the variable is best modeled as common fate <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KDa5r8Y">However, if the reports of a construct are self-referential and evaluate one's own status (e.g., QoL), it may not be appropriate to model the variable as common fate.</s><s xml:id="_5e8etKt">Hence, while data may be available for both members' levels of QoL, and their reports are likely to be correlated, the variable is not at the dyadic level of measurement and may be better suited for the APIM <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DMTUmun">Therefore, in the current investigation, we conceptualized we-disease appraisal, CDC, and relationship satisfaction as common fate variables, as they assessed the relationship as an object, with both partners reporting on the same construct.</s><s xml:id="_2N39FCg">Contrastingly, QoL was operationalized as a manifested and observable variable.</s><s xml:id="_NQypWS8">Furthermore, due to the growing interest in dyadic-level mediation, scholars have started employing the common fate mediation model (CFMeM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>, an extension of the CFM.</s><s xml:id="_8MrxJEY">One noteworthy example of this is the work of İnce and Işık <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, who adopted the CFMeM to explore the effect of differentiation of the self on relationship satisfaction through the mediating role of love language.</s></p><p xml:id="_gFWvVRV"><s xml:id="_4BsXKtq">Based on the aforementioned dyadic coping models and limitations of previous empirical evidence, we assumed that CDC may act as a mediator in linking we-disease appraisal with both relationship satisfaction and QoL.</s><s xml:id="_mjX9WRC">To this end, we proposed the following theoretical framework using the CFMeM, with CDC serving as the potential mediator.</s><s xml:id="_wZkx9gq">More specifically, we hypothesized that: (i) CDC mediates the association between we-disease appraisal and relationship satisfaction at the dyadic level (H1); (ii) CDC mediates the association between we-disease appraisal and the QoL of PLWHs (H2a) and the association between we-disease appraisal and the QoL of partner (H2b).</s></p></div>

chronic illnesses.</s><s xml:id="_VMZfdVX">Furthermore, these dyadic resources can be especially important for illness adjustment in HIV serodiscordant couples.</s><s xml:id="_EHt3kbB">In the future, it would be helpful to extend this study and examine these assumptions in couples with diverse demographics, clinical stages, or other illnesses.</s></p><p xml:id="_A9vCn8C"><s xml:id="_vQBEx6y">Moreover, since our sample was dominated by malemale couples, our findings may have been biased.</s><s xml:id="_CGnJ6Jb">The small group sizes of female+/male-and female-/male+ disallowed group comparisons.</s><s xml:id="_RwrzBpd">Previous studies have found that gay couples utilize higher levels of dyadic coping compared with opposite-sex relationship couples <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, and gay couples may benefit more from dyadic coping behaviors than heterosexual couples <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qqbX73F">Therefore, future studies are needed to replicate this study and discover any group differences.</s><s xml:id="_CNpuWra">Moreover, the descriptive data suggest that the average relationship duration was slightly longer than the average diagnosis duration.</s><s xml:id="_H9jN6Qf">Future studies may explore whether we-disease appraisals are more likely to occur in relationships that begin before or after HIV diagnosis.</s></p><p xml:id="_yZfQEcZ"><s xml:id="_sYsyeyf">Fourth, since race and gender are two interconnected social identities, future dyadic studies should be designed within the theoretical framework of intersectionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_X2SSh2s">It is important for researchers to acknowledge the complexity of social identities and how they intersect, particularly in the context of HIV management.</s><s xml:id="_3eAvhDd">By using an intersectional approach, researchers will be better able to understand the unique experiences of individuals with multiple identities and how these experiences may differ from those with only one identity.</s><s xml:id="_96xQvhp">This can lead to more targeted interventions and policies that are better tailored to the needs of diverse populations.</s></p><p xml:id="_wssZNUu"><s xml:id="_EKmEz8p">Fifth, since our sample was collected during the COVID-19 pandemic, our findings may have been confounded by COVID-19 contextual variables.</s><s xml:id="_ff5Azbd">For example, uncertainty about COVID-19 is associated with increased levels of stress and anxiety among young PLWHs and directly affects their mental well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WHVTFrU">Future studies should consider how the "big era" (e.g., the pandemic era) affected individuals' and couples' lives.</s></p><p xml:id="_fpnpjhH"><s xml:id="_8N4hzyR">Our study provides a compelling example of how illness management occurs within the context of HIV serodiscordant couples.</s><s xml:id="_efUhDb6">Our findings offer empirical support for Bodenmann's Systemic Transaction Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, which was originally designed for nonclinical couples navigating everyday stressors, and extends the model to clinical populations.</s><s xml:id="_HbnzVns">We also provide empirical support for the notion that we-disease appraisal is a key agent in navigating dyadic resources in HIV serodiscordant couples <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xreW57F">Understanding how dyadic and individual mechanisms (e.g., dyadic and individual coping styles) interact in predicting the QoL of both partners is a fascinating area for further investigation.</s></p><p xml:id="_uMgwmCB"><s xml:id="_GjuCKKs">In summary, this research provides new knowledge about the dyadic illness management of couples living with HIV due to its collection of dyadic data and application of theoretically appropriate dyadic approaches (i.e., the CFMeM).</s><s xml:id="_4HQYYBq">Moreover, the present study considered both dyadic and individual outcomes to capture important psychosocial indicators.</s><s xml:id="_UvT8See">Our findings illustrate a robust mediational process between we-disease appraisal and adjustment outcomes via CDC, suggesting that couple-based interventions should incorporate psycho-educational components to raise awareness about we-disease appraisal, as well as skill-building components to encourage the use of CDC in clinical settings.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p xml:id="_yetyTEc"><s xml:id="_972XUrd">Fig.1.</s><s
