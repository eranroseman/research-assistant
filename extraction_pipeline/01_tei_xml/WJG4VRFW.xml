0.375).</s><s xml:id="_cbnyRWB">There were some significant differences in treatment effect estimates by patient race, suggesting tailoring communications on this dimension could be valuable, but our attribute analyses yielded nearly identical results for White and non-White patients.</s></p><p xml:id="_UjdDS9t"><s xml:id="_MNPZh3u">Overall, our findings show nudges sent via text messages to patients prior to a primary care visit and developed by behavioral scientists to encourage vaccine adoption can substantially boost vaccination rates at close to zero marginal cost.</s><s xml:id="_3qM8r98">Our bestperforming message, which increased adoption by an estimated 11%, reminded patients twice to get their flu shot at their upcoming doctor's appointment and mentioned that a shot was reserved for them.</s><s xml:id="_9HPYk8y">Although the factors influencing the adoption of vaccines for other diseases, including COVID-19, differ in important ways, this successful script could potentially be repurposed.</s></p></div>
