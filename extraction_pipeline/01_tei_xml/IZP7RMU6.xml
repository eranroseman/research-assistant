(2013), and a widelydistributed definition launched in 2001 by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation.</s><s xml:id="_CWHh3nZ">The principles and definition ground research practitioners in long-term commitments to co-develop research with community partners, and to build from community strengths and priorities for the purposes of translating research results into policy, practice, or system-change actions towards improving health and health equity.</s><s xml:id="_fW7TCmj"><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Minkler et al. (2012)</ref> added the principles of cultural humility and importance of addressing racism, sexism, homophobia, and other inequities of power hierarchies within academiccommunity partnerships and in society.</s><s xml:id="_4gBa5Wv">While CBPR has often been seen as calling for involvement of grassroots people from communities, neighborhood associations, or social movements, community partners in CBPR can extend to other stakeholders, such as staff from community-based organizations, public agencies or private-sector settings, and policy makers.</s></p><p xml:id="_ueMDvnC"><s xml:id="_Jr3kNrY">Each of the terms and fields named above have different histories, yet they are often divided into two separate traditions (Wallerstein et al., 2018).</s><s xml:id="_fyzaWFB">In the 1950s, Kurt Lewin defined "action research," often referred to as the Northern tradition, as a process of action/reflection/ action to engage teams of multiple stakeholders in research, predominantly for improving organizational settings (Lewin and Gold 1999).</s></p></div>
