conversational agents at home is widespread, both among the adults and children <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_UCVQgxA">Traditionally, children have been known to use technology at home not only to entertain themselves, but also to learn <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_cpstq9E">Lovato et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref> has showed that children primarily use CAs to seek information, which is considered a skill children require to succeed in school, as they are asked to complete homework and in-class assignments that hinge on search ability <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_btRCRmN">However, researchers <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b38">39]</ref> have also found that instead of helping children to understand concepts, CAs can currently only provide direct answers to children's questions.</s><s xml:id="_AfqF5sJ">Therefore, unsurprisingly, researchers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62]</ref>) have sought to improve CAs so that they can become virtual learning companions for children.</s><s xml:id="_bssZEnr">For example, Mack et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref> conducted a participatory design study with elementary and middle school children, with the intent to inform the interface design of a social studies educational application.</s><s xml:id="_8xSrqya">They concluded that including conversational dialogues in such applications, such as while communicating with virtual historical figures, improves children's perception of the technology.</s><s xml:id="_MfwENsM">Xu and Warschauer <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, in designing a storytelling CA, concluded that children enjoyed interacting with the device for activities such as reading books.</s></p><p xml:id="_qKE7KpF"><s xml:id="_sChE39D">Prior work has also suggested utilizing parasocial relationships (i.e., one sided emotional bonds that children develop with familiar media figures) to develop intelligent "characters" that children can use as learning tools or companions <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b41">42]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8y98ya4">Based on the experiences gathered from Sesame Workshop, Gray et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> emphasized the use of personification and social realism in developing intelligent characters to foster learning in children.</s><s xml:id="_MPBEv9U">Along similar lines, due to the human-like characteristics of robots, researchers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>) have found them to be superior to other educational media and technology in promoting and improving children's concentration, interest in learning, and academic achievement.</s><s xml:id="_HfDAxa4">Purington et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref> have provided evidence of adults and children who already attribute human-like attributes to CAs and perceive them as their companions.</s><s xml:id="_UhtenVp">Researchers (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>), however, have also argued that the development of these relationships is influenced by parental approval or disapproval -similar to how parent's opinions influence children's relationships with other people -as parents might selectively encourage or limit screen time (we go into detail on this in the next section).</s></p><p xml:id="_YaAwz4S"><s xml:id="_3zwjuDy">Another stream of research (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>) has investigated efficient ways of integrating such CAs into instructional and educational settings.</s><s xml:id="_zkmBTq3">There has been work around investigating the potential uses of conversational pedagogical Aritifical Intelligence (AI) in classrooms, including intelligent tutoring systems and chatbots <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref> and exploring how conversational agents can support inclusive education <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Puqw3ZN">Lester et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> pointed out that due to 'persona effect' children learned more and reported more satisfaction
