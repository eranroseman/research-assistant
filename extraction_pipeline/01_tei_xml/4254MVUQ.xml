<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_AQdsqMd">Background</head><p xml:id="_MkxpK2C"><s xml:id="_z44jGza">Evidence demonstrates that providing engaged individuals with a digital behavior change intervention improves health outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NySMkBq">In recent years, owing to increasingly ubiquitous smartphone ownership at a population level and rapidly reducing digital divides <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, smartphone apps have emerged as an important channel for health behavior interventions.</s><s xml:id="_rNv79TF">As individuals are in the vicinity of their smartphone most of the time, smartphone apps can be used to sense users' everyday context and offer behavioral interventions at the most suitable moments.</s><s xml:id="_EU7xWW3">Unlike the traditional health care system, most mobile apps are inexpensive and easy to access on demand.</s><s xml:id="_hjEcedn">They overcome demographic, socioeconomic, and geographical barriers to access by being able to reach populations that were unreachable until recently <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_45KSZBr">Consequently, smartphone health apps are now widely recognized as a public health promotion resource.</s><s xml:id="_aY3bWEn">For example, the World Health Organization Mental Health Action Plan 2013-2020 recommends "the promotion of self-care, for instance, through the use of electronic and mobile health technologies" <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_jfUrdw8">Websites of prominent and large public health organizations (such as the UK National Health Service <ref type="bibr">[NHS]</ref> website NHS Choices or Reachout Australia <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>) have also begun formally endorsing and recommending effective apps.</s></p><p xml:id="_aAYcxyU"><s xml:id="_Gsd78Pc">A pressing concern for the field of mobile health (mHealth), however, is the high rate of disengagement among individuals who choose to install an app.</s><s xml:id="_7RYSQbm">After installing a mobile app, over 80% of app users use it only once and eventually delete it <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xXGVg9Q">Only 5% of the apps continue to be used beyond a month <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_N8CYHpE">Even among those who use the apps, the amount of use depends on an individual's health and behavioral characteristics <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_XSuEv3B"><s xml:id="_9Dr6eS3">The lack of participant engagement is not unique to mHealth apps.</s><s xml:id="_DXQMDPE">In fact, traditional Web-based interventions observe decreases in engagement over time, with large proportions of participants dropping out or discontinuing the use of the app completely <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_GW69xvv">Although when compared with traditional internet interventions, the more recent smartphone app interventions have the potential to reach participants at moments when they are most likely to engage.</s><s xml:id="_vKx66kX">It is disconcerting that similar underlying disengagement patterns are emerging even with more advanced technology.</s><s xml:id="_Tp5Rfbc">Consequently, despite the potential of smartphone apps, lack of participant engagement with apps, which is critical to the success of interventions focused on health behavior change, is of major concern.</s><s xml:id="_4caZSRX">Given the fast pace of smartphone health app development, there is a pressing need for novel research to enhance engagement with these apps.</s></p><p xml:id="_SxCQP77"><s xml:id="_SdMC5xD">Effective engagement with digital health apps is particularly critical when this engagement is part of the health intervention, as opposed to simply opening the app.</s><s xml:id="_bxAXSJ5">For example, engagement might be classified as use of the app to self-monitor health behaviors and feelings; self-monitoring has been demonstrated to have a positive impact on well-being and improve health behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_f3QmUYf">Engagement could also be the subjective quality of user experiences with the app, which can be influenced by design elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_4mNVZAu">Individual characteristics such as age, education levels, and state of health are known to equally influence the adoption of mHealth apps, in addition to factors such as being female, younger, higher education levels, and lower body mass index increasing the odds <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Rrsy5NK">Another factor affecting the dropout in mobile app use could be the timing of intervention offered.</s><s xml:id="_nkq9gqn">For example, participants in an app study reported they were likely to drop out if the intervention did not meet their expectations and needs at the right time <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_sxukHVg">On the other hand, some qualitative research suggests that individuals tend to use app-based interventions in brief bursts only, often when needed and in a fleeting manner <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gPBZXuK">In this context, it could be argued that even short-term or varying intensity patterns of use with app-based behavior change interventions could be beneficial to users.</s><s xml:id="_gDTJAfV">For example, in the case of a self-monitoring app intervention, some individuals might monitor more frequently than others, but irrespective of how often they engage, every act of self-monitoring enables users to learn some strategies that can be practiced to improve behaviors without additional guidance from the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_qcZsarV">Thus, every time a user opens and interacts with the intervention activity of the app, they are effectively engaged.</s></p><p xml:id="_CnBnQFd"><s xml:id="_pfRszsj">As mobile phones are usually switched on and nearly always with users, the majority of app-based interventions adopt prompting as a strategy to encourage interaction and engagement.</s><s xml:id="_52VaK5c">In apps, prompts are implemented as push notifications, which appear on the smartphone screen at a programmed time.</s><s xml:id="_vqwPTZw">Both the content and timing of a push notification are programmable.</s><s xml:id="_j7kvVEM">Consequently, smartphone users receive a deluge of push notifications daily, approximately 50 time-varying notifications, from a diverse set of apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_nsFpZ5M">This sheer volume of notifications throughout the day has the potential to further exacerbate disengagement with the apps.</s><s xml:id="_QHdn3xT">A few studies that observed how users responded to push notifications received on their smartphone over the course of a day suggest that users are most likely to ignore a vast majority of notifications even when the notifications come from apps of importance to them <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fPZThHx">There are also concerns that receiving too many notifications might increase users' inattention and reduce well-being <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_aXMWX59"><s xml:id="_T4ZvTrw">Due to advances in smartphone-sensing capabilities along with algorithmic advances, apps can now utilize users' context, for example, location, social setting, and activity level to determine the most opportune times to send push notifications.</s><s xml:id="_DBqvzAK">Studies suggest that users are receptive to notification interruptions at convenient times <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_kQvmj6P">Within the human-computer interaction field, interruptibility research has emerged, with many studies focused on understanding and anticipating suitable moments for interruption <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3FSyGJa">However, most studies concerning the effects of push notification interruptions on engagement are observational studies based on small convenience samples with neither randomization nor control conditions.</s><s xml:id="_z5nZEPP">Thus, although rapid advances are being made in devising algorithms to predict when to interrupt users, because of the lack of appropriately designed studies, there is a significant gap in knowledge concerning when particular types of interruptions are effective.</s></p><p xml:id="_X3YEsaH"><s xml:id="_kHbqQsN">In contrast, the fields of public health and psychology contain several well-designed randomized controlled trial studies to evaluate text-messaging interventions that are similar to push notification interventions in mHealth apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_byuMNQG">Furthermore, a recent study randomized participants into 3 different conditions based on the different approaches used to determine the timing of push notification <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tXHYVqg">These studies, using baseline randomization of individuals into different conditions, were designed to compare between conditions in terms of a distal outcome (such as the percentage of notifications viewed or overall usage).</s><s xml:id="_UnQQMnF">However, baseline randomization is not suitable for addressing questions comparing prompts at different times or comparing a prompt (vs no prompt) in terms of their effect on near time, proximal engagement, and the conditions in which a prompt would be more or less beneficial.</s><s xml:id="_uVpvXGk">Indeed, on any given day, users may be concerned with the contingencies and demands of the day so that even a self-determined user may not think or remember to access support on the app.</s></p><p xml:id="_xEmzUkj"><s xml:id="_kpAtG8U">To our knowledge, this is the first study focusing on the effects of push notifications containing contextually tailored health messages on near-time, proximal engagement with the app.</s><s xml:id="_HhDQVya">Here, engagement in response to a prompt is operationalized as the user completing the self-monitoring intervention activity in the app within 24 hours of receiving the push notification (as opposed to just opening the app).</s><s xml:id="_rn7ArBj">This study examines data collected from a microrandomized trial (MRT) <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> implemented within the JOOL app, a commercial workplace well-being intervention product <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_aJ2jzKg">In an MRT, each user is randomized multiple times over a period of weeks and months.</s><s xml:id="_5Zjgtbh">In the JOOL app, push notifications may be randomized at each of 6 time points per day.</s><s xml:id="_QA5KPj8">This repeat-randomization design adjusts for potential biases that might arise from within and between the individual factors.</s><s xml:id="_AsZ6U3A">For instance, randomizing the decision to send a push notification at a time point ensures that within-and between-user factors contributing to day-to-day variations in engagement are balanced approximately evenly across both push notification and no push notification conditions.</s><s xml:id="_8cG7Dta">The specific primary and secondary aims and hypotheses of this study are presented in the next section.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_2bbbAsu">Implications</head><p xml:id="_t8vbGuf"><s xml:id="_SsaCQnJ">The findings suggest that users are more likely to engage with the app in the 24 hours following a push notification containing a tailored health message compared with no push notification.</s><s xml:id="_Y3KrYQ2">However, the effects are relatively small, with only a 3.9% greater likelihood of engaging with the app in the next 24 hours.</s><s xml:id="_XKPWEpP">The likelihood of users viewing the notifications within 24 hours is very high.</s><s xml:id="_sP8kJ7P">Previously, it has been noted that the probability of users clicking a notification increases from 50% within 30 seconds to 83% in 5 min <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_QkZUcWp">This suggests that prompts would have captured users' attention most of the time, but their attention would have translated to engagement with the self-monitoring activity in the app less frequently.</s><s xml:id="_2WZdQSs">On the other hand, even small effects on engagement can be of substantial benefit at the population level, given the scalability of app-based resources.</s><s xml:id="_DmREHnP">Similarly, the effects may be small because not all push notifications, even when messages are contextually tailored and personalized, are likely to be persuasive to all users at all times.</s><s xml:id="_kzgb63X">In the design of this study, push notifications were sent at different times and days of the week when users are likely to be in different contexts.</s><s xml:id="_REG4m8u">As a result, over the course of the trial, some users could have responded fewer times to prompts if they had received them in certain contexts where receptiveness to interruptions is low.</s><s xml:id="_CRhADXj">During such contexts, particularly if engaged in a cognitively demanding activity, they may be less likely to pay attention to notifications.</s><s xml:id="_aHxexmx">In fact, the results from the exploratory aim suggest that effects vary by time of the day and day of the week.</s><s xml:id="_yXJCNnC">In general, the largest effect occurs when the notification is pushed at 12:30 pm-users are 8.8% more likely to chart in the next 24 hours.</s><s xml:id="_PU65Bj6">During the weekends, the largest effects occur at 2 time points (12:30 pm and 7:30 pm).</s><s xml:id="_ufCVZN3">Specifically at 12:30 pm on weekends, users are 11.8% more likely to chart in the next 24 hours.</s><s xml:id="_buuV89y">The effect is similar at 7:30 pm on weekends.</s><s xml:id="_EFsE65D">These findings suggest that sending push notifications with contextually tailored messages over time, particularly if sent during those contextual moments when users are most receptive, can serve as an effective strategy to maximize engagement with mHealth app interventions.</s></p><p xml:id="_q2wKPAm"><s xml:id="_zZuCcEc">As this study population involved office workers, users who are typically at work during weekdays, it is likely that they responded more to weekend prompts because they were less busy.</s><s xml:id="_fQPCTkk">This was suggested by the secondary analysis where the effect of push notification versus no notification was estimated to be somewhat larger on weekends than on weekdays.</s><s xml:id="_rvhmUy4">The exploratory analysis suggests that on weekdays, effects are the strongest at 12:30 pm, which coincides with the time office workers generally have a lunch break.</s><s xml:id="_Z9HFU7R">This is consistent with previous research that suggests that engagement occurs more during nonworking hours <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DjU4SdB">In summary, the findings from this study suggest that push notification prompts hold promise as an effective engagement strategy for mHealth apps, and through contextual tailoring, further advancements can be achieved in reducing user disengagement.</s></p><p xml:id="_PuSDpTS"><s xml:id="_yEE62YS">Tackling the problem of poor engagement is further compounded by a lack of consensus on how to operationally define engagement with an app-based health intervention.</s><s xml:id="_t5U3yE8">Engagement has been typically operationalized in terms of usability or usage of the intervention, along with the factors that influence these <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_uqdVn8M">Usage can refer to the frequency or the duration of either interaction within the app, or the practice of behavioral and cognitive strategies offered by the app in the real environment.</s><s xml:id="_k7QZB5b">Under both scenarios, more usage, either interacting with the app more often, or practicing behaviors and cognitive strategies learned through the app more often, is viewed as better engagement.</s><s xml:id="_PUx76a5">This is based on the assumption that more usage is closely related to better outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_A83r3u5">However, the relationship between usage and health outcomes is weak, as supportive evidence is mostly anecdotal or correlational <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2YDrXZm">Instead, shifting the focus on effective engagement with the digital intervention that may or may not require sustained usage but that mediates positive behaviors is an emerging alternative <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SU7qWsJ">In published studies of different behavioral interventions, self-monitoring is encouraged at a variety of frequencies (up to multiple times per day) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_4zsBjKK">Evidence from these studies suggests effective self-monitoring can result in a profound positive impact on health outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_FTDMywy">However, the frequency of monitoring varies between individuals and over time, and as a result, it is not evident how frequently users should be encouraged to self-monitor.</s><s xml:id="_74q6Bv3">In fact, encouraging high rates of tracking could potentially worsen stress and cause harm <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EmYfjEP">Further work evaluating different self-monitoring frequencies is needed.</s></p><p xml:id="_6xDYjZp"><s xml:id="_QpGpUXs">There are several novel aspects and strengths to this study.</s><s xml:id="_wGyxdWY">First, this study is designed to investigate the effect of tailored push notifications (vs no notification) on immediate proximal engagement with an mHealth app.</s><s xml:id="_hsP9ryK">Second, this research is naturalistic, as the study did not pay users for study involvement nor did it employ clinical staff who text, telephone, or otherwise contact users to ensure that they stay engaged in the study.</s><s xml:id="_BCqc2Ua">There is no concept of dropout in this study.</s><s xml:id="_dCPtBAf">When individuals stop using the app during the trial, their outcome is recorded as disengaged in the analysis as opposed to being a dropout and excluded from the analysis.</s><s xml:id="_ABmwXgc">Third, the use of the MRT design to repeatedly randomize users over the course of the trial allowed us to investigate the causal effects of push notifications on proximal engagement and the real-time, real-world conditions that likely influence these proximal effects.</s><s xml:id="_KsT3jKy">In future, the MRT approach can also be used to adjust the probability of randomization to favor pushes in certain contexts.</s><s xml:id="_vPauQ95">This experimental approach, therefore, provides the empirical evidence necessary to optimize engagement.</s><s xml:id="_BnQkBDf">Finally, investigating engagement in a large sample of users with an app that focuses on multiple health behaviors is another strength of this study.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_r6cmPV7">Study Limitations</head><p xml:id="_9fJcFR9"><s xml:id="_Ju3dxKF">Individual characteristics such as personality traits and socioeconomic status (SES) are known to influence engagement with mHealth apps, and controlling for these variables could narrow the CIs to effects of time-varying push notifications.</s><s xml:id="_PyFjnyK">Qualitative assessment of users' experiences with push notifications would have offered greater insights into engagement, but as the study was constrained by data already collected within the app, such measures were not available for inclusion in our analysis.</s><s xml:id="_x3ETD8j">However, as noted earlier, randomizing the decision to send a push notification at a point in time ensures that within-user (eg, mood, location) and between-user (eg, personality traits, SES) factors contributing to the day-to-day variations in engagement are balanced across conditions.</s></p><p xml:id="_Wsp8gCc"><s xml:id="_nfYbwNY">Another limitation relates to the timescale used to define the proximal outcome in this study.</s><s xml:id="_AQ2UB3S">Specifically, the proximal outcome was whether or not the individual engaged (ie, completed charting) with the app within 24 hours.</s><s xml:id="_FqfXh3K">A more sensitive proximal outcome measure might enable investigating the more immediate effects of prompts on engagement, potentially yielding larger effects than those observed in this study.</s><s xml:id="_eeh25UA">Within these limitations, this study provides a first step to understanding whether and under what conditions push notifications promote proximal engagement in mHealth.</s></p></div>
