What digital media and devices are used for health-related purposes by children and young people, aged 5 to 30 years, living in countries in the Global North? 2. Which of these media and devices do they find most useful and helpful? 3. What are the age-related, gendered, socioeconomic, cultural, and geographical dimensions structuring their use or nonuse of digital health? 4</s><s xml:id="_vfm7fq7">. What risks and harms are associated with young people's digital health use? 5. What are the gaps in the social research literature on this topic?</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_snjgN8X">Methods</head><p xml:id="_Ayuw6R9"><s xml:id="_PFGX6NR">There are various approaches to narrative literature reviews.</s><s xml:id="_nAwQ4qF">The approach adopted here is not the hybrid systematic narrative review that is beginning to appear in the body of reviews focusing on medical internet studies.</s><s xml:id="_QHuYtFe">Instead, this narrative review draws from the long-established tradition of literature reviews in social inquiry.</s><s xml:id="_ef7hK38">The purpose of this type of narrative review is to provide a scholarly summary and interpretation of a body of literature rather than evaluate the validity of a method or a medical intervention, with the intention of integrating and deepening understanding of a particular research topic <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_S2KxAvp">The aim is to provide a synthesis of what is known about the chosen topic and identify research gaps <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2Bskmkq">It is particularly useful for synthesizing the scholarly literature in the humanities and social sciences-the disciplines encompassed in this review.</s></p><p xml:id="_Kpx58jT"><s xml:id="_nEyUVqS">This narrative review method does not attempt to adopt a quantitative approach focused on rigor, avoidance of bias, and interrater reliability, rather it focuses on a qualitative interpretation and synthesis of the state of knowledge in a selected body of literature on a defined topic <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_6rHcwVf">It is a different and complementary approach to the systematic review and is an appropriate approach to adopt for a review that is directed at social research <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_JPrFJm9"><s xml:id="_TkzPruv">The approach taken for this narrative review is similar, for example, to that undertaken for an assessment of the literature on the role played by gangs in adolescent mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> and the health effects of video gaming <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_nNtAdBU">Iterative searches of Google Scholar were conducted to find relevant publications published in English, using the search terms "children," "young people," "teenagers," and "adolescents" in combination with "digital health" and then, more specifically, combined with "health," "digital media," "websites," "telemedicine," "telehealth," "electronic patient records," "social media," "apps," "smartphones," "wearable devices," "exergames," "Facebook," "YouTube," "Instagram," "Pinterest," "Twitter," and "Snapchat."</s><s xml:id="_BJq3HRT">Google Scholar was chosen as the database to search because, unlike other major databases such as Web of Science, PubMed, or Scopus, it is far more inclusive of humanities and social sciences outputs, such as books, book chapters, and journals, which are not included in science-or medical-based databases, while simultaneously including the publications listed in those databases <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_aNWVwTT"><s xml:id="_WDcwVzZ">I read all of the publications found using these searches, including books, book chapters, reports, and journal articles.</s><s xml:id="_uwrWnRs">I then followed the citation trails, identifying and reading outputs that cited the initial identified studies.</s><s xml:id="_cvz4tJm">Only publications appearing since 2010 were included, as I wanted to limit the review to research that considers the most recent digital technologies for health.</s><s xml:id="_MpNC4Z3">As an initial search demonstrated, there has been quite a lag in research on young people's use of digital health, with most relevant studies published since 2015.</s><s xml:id="_wuCbzhx">Publications were not included in the review if they did not have a predominantly social research focus or if they did not specifically focus on children or young people's use of digital technologies for health-related purposes (eg, publications about digital health use by parents or health care providers on behalf of young people, or those concerning evaluations of the accuracy of digital health software or devices).</s><s xml:id="_wgM8VfG">Only those publications referring to children or young people living in the Global North were included.</s><s xml:id="_JtGwJF4">Using these criteria, a total of 71 publications were identified for inclusion in this review.</s></p><p xml:id="_kMZd9wH"><s xml:id="_6W5TsFu">Discussion of the literature review is organized by type of digital technology, beginning with studies presenting a broad overview of digital technology use for health across devices and software, followed by more specific topics: use of cross-media, internet, social media, health apps, and wearable devices.</s><s xml:id="_UNZGpmC">There is also discussion of the literature on sexual health support and information as well as mental health support and information, as these health areas were prominent in the social research on young people's use of digital health.</s><s xml:id="_kP2FPsH">The Discussion section summarizes the key insights and major gaps identified in the literature and suggests directions for future social research studies.</s></p></div>

(2) to share experiences and view others' experiences to gain social support or inspiration; and (3) to engage in self-tracking for health (ie, apps and wearables) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_QYBfj5q">This research found that social media was not a preferred mode to communicate with health care providers for the participants because of privacy and intrusiveness concerns.</s><s xml:id="_4kaG8jg">Online media and apps were considered easy to use, always available, nonjudgmental, and to have options to share information and experiences anonymously.</s><s xml:id="_dUM9XDn">Negative aspects identified by these young people included online health information not always being credible, not being able to afford some health apps and wearable devices, finding it burdensome to enter information into apps, being tempted to always have the phone on and being distracted, technology not being designed for teenagers' use, and peers sharing health information that may be inaccurate or may encourage risk-taking.</s></p><p xml:id="_pjkq5Mp"><s xml:id="_X39N98Z">Social research in other English-speaking countries in the Global North has indicated high use of the internet, apps, and wearable devices for health-related purposes among young people but also continuing support of long-standing digital platforms and tools.</s><s xml:id="_w7sJyvp">A 2017 study interviewing young Australians, aged 16 to 25 years, found that they valued the convenience, accessibility, detail, and diversity of health information offered by digital media and devices <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_vbwEjgg">These young people were active users of older technologies for health, such as search engines and websites, even more than of new technologies, such as social media, apps, and wearable devices.</s><s xml:id="_D3gg4xj">Similar to the respondents in the US survey by Wartella and colleagues <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, these young Australians continued to value personal connections with other people for providing health information and support, including family members and friends as well as medical professionals.</s></p><p xml:id="_WAyfT4k"><s xml:id="_vUM8QC7">A synthesis of findings across three English-based projects involving both qualitative and quantitative investigations among secondary school students reported on the findings relating to the use of social media, apps, and wearables for health-related purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Ry7Nfvk">These studies demonstrated that these young people were both critical and vulnerable users of these devices and software.</s><s xml:id="_6sb6YvC">The participants reported a range of positive benefits, particularly in relation to supporting promotion of healthy diet, exercise, and positive body image.</s><s xml:id="_Pa9tWnK">However, they also raised concerns about the power of these technologies to shape, influence, and change their health-related behaviors.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_MmZnmPj">Which of These Media and Devices do They Find Most Useful and Helpful?</head><p xml:id="_k4NyRCb"><s xml:id="_a6DgRZS">Young people in this body of research have reported many benefits from their use of digital technologies for health.</s><s xml:id="_P87PY2S">They appreciate the ready availability of information on the internet and the opportunities to learn more about their bodies and health states and how to improve their health and physical fitness by accessing websites, discussion forums, and social media and by using apps.</s></p><p xml:id="_uu2tHEC"><s xml:id="_HNtBVak">An important finding across the literature is that apps and platforms that may not have been specifically developed for young people as digital health resources (eg, YouTube, Tumblr, and Instagram) often better suit their needs.</s><s xml:id="_Qyhq5Mr">Young people appreciate being able to connect with peers and find emotional support and relief from distress by using social media platforms, YouTube, and online forums.</s><s xml:id="_8EMDAXt">They can find self-tracking apps and platforms helpful for learning more about their bodies.</s><s xml:id="_z6jDge7">However, they can become bored, feel overwhelmed by the vast quantities of data generated by these technologies, or find the labor involved in self-tracking as too burdensome for continuing use.</s></p><p xml:id="_SPXnRHa"><s xml:id="_7wpCwuM">Another key finding across some of the reviewed research is that young people can find the vast reams of information available to them on the internet to be difficult to navigate.</s><s xml:id="_Zvwpgt7">They often look to trusted adults, particularly their parents and medical professionals, to help them make sense of the information they find online and to provide alternative sources of information and support.</s><s xml:id="_XmWgtVm">Face-to-face interactions with these trusted providers remain important to young people.</s></p><p xml:id="_gBetch5"><s xml:id="_BsR9PPr">What Are the Aged-Related, Gendered, Socioeconomic, Cultural, and Geographical Dimensions Structuring Young People's Use or Nonuse of Digital Health?</s><s xml:id="_rur2h8c">Published studies have mostly been based in the United States and the United Kingdom, but there are also some publications from researchers in Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Canada.</s><s xml:id="_TqHEpaZ">Little research thus far has focused on comparing the experiences of young people based on sociodemographic attributes, such as their age, geographical location within a country (eg, in rural or remote regions compared with urban regions), gender, socioeconomic status, and race or ethnicity.</s><s xml:id="_UXtUufj">Those studies that have made these comparisons have identified that these factors can play an important role in structuring the ways that young people engage with digital health.</s><s xml:id="_Ggqy2tE">It is notable that the experiences of preadolescent children have received little attention; most studies published thus far have focused on teenagers and young people aged in their early 20s.</s></p></div>
