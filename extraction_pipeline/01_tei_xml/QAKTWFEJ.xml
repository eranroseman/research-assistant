furthermore, we arranged these features into categories (eg, text, button, spacing, color, and handedness), which made it easy for the app users to select their desired accessibility features in the settings.</s><s xml:id="_FQf6az8">Third, many of the accessibility features were implemented as individually adjustable components, allowing the app users to customize the user interface of the app according to their needs.</s><s xml:id="_AdWE7uX">This approach makes it possible to meet the needs of people with highly diverse types and levels of disabilities.</s><s xml:id="_37FrDf9">Fourth, when we conducted the study, we took into account the device form factor (phone vs tablet) and possible uniqueness of different mobile operating systems (iOS vs Android) to make sure that the accessibility features would work well regardless of the size of mobile device or the mobile operating system.</s></p><p xml:id="_nMhXdqP"><s xml:id="_n8eXs4C">As mentioned in the Methods section, we did not implement all the accessibility features requested by the study participants.</s><s xml:id="_gHaxZth">We evaluated each requested feature first to determine the nature of the request (a need or a preference) and whether the feature could improve the accessibility of the app for this population.</s><s xml:id="_Hhk2cYA">If the feature was only a preference, not a need, it did not have high priority on the feature implementation list.</s><s xml:id="_nZBXa3F">For instance, 1 participant requested very large text on buttons even though her vision was fine and she could read text contents in medium size.</s><s xml:id="_ExXxeQN">In this case, the request was a preference, not a need.</s><s xml:id="_Y7GjrA6">It may be addressed in the future but not in this study.</s><s xml:id="_2QKBrR4">If the feature was determined to be a need, we further determined whether the feature could improve the accessibility of the app.</s><s xml:id="_j5x2FtW">For example, 2 study participants requested the ability to use their voice to make selections on the app because they had difficulty clicking on their desired option located in the middle of the iPad.</s><s xml:id="_C9Z4KKR">This is a need rather than a preference.</s><s xml:id="_Xqj8R64">We still chose not to implement this feature in the app, however, because we believed that this particular feature would not improve the accessibility of the app and that there was a better way to make the option accessible to them (buttons crossing the page from edge to edge).</s><s xml:id="_gpHj5tu">We made this decision because all 5 study participants had issues with their spoken language being easily comprehensible.</s><s xml:id="_gGj56gN">For 1 participant, most people who did not know her well could not understand her sentences, except for some very simple words.</s><s xml:id="_PBXEWrP">We actually needed her mother's help to understand her.</s><s xml:id="_6E93vW6">Moreover, 3 other participants' spoken language was not very clear, either, including 2 who had requested this particular feature.</s><s xml:id="_s6MxK6H">Therefore, a natural language processing algorithm would have significant difficulties recognizing sentences generated orally by them.</s><s xml:id="_Mgxg8HB">Most likely, the error rate of the algorithm would be very high, and hence, this feature would ultimately not improve the accessibility of the app for this group of people.</s><s xml:id="_kvB8Qj5">This feature may be implemented in the future for a different group of people who can speak clearly but have significant difficulties using their hands to operate mobile devices.</s></p><p xml:id="_Bh8Sm2s"><s xml:id="_tWjHxbG">Although these accessibility features were developed according to the needs of people with dexterity impairment, they can also be useful for other people with similar needs, such as elderly people, people with big hands, and people with visual impairment.</s><s xml:id="_chBTeG9">For people who are not sensitive to color, the black and white theme (black background and white contents in most places) could be particularly useful and convenient.</s></p></div>
