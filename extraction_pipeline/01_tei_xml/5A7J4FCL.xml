of people, including financial barriers (both personal and insurance based), inadequacies in assessment (especially in primary care settings), patient reluctance to seek treatment, perceived communication barriers between patient and health care provider, and a paucity of comprehensive multidisciplinary treatment options <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr"

to supplement and extend established therapeutic and educational interventions for chronic pain with innovative, cost-effective, and empirically sound alternatives such as automated telephone services, progress monitoring via regular mail and e-mail, electronic diaries, video-based psychoeducational programs, and online sites for the delivery of health information <ref type="bibr"

reviews of Web-based interventions for chronic pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>, small but significant improvements in pain experience and

everyday task persistence.</s><s xml:id="_4qQb6yd">Such skills include (but are not limited to): self-observation (aka self-monitoring), selfstatement modification, goal setting, self-induced relaxation, physical exercise, attention control, emotion regulation, belief reappraisal, self-efficacy enhancement, planning, coping, and pacing <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25,</ref><ref

developed, multielement program for the self-management of chronic pain designed to be accessed via the Internet.</s><s xml:id="_TBsSNxK">The Chronic Pain Management Program (CPMP) leverages technical capabilities with program content and functionality derived from cognitive behavior therapy, interpersonal, and self-management approaches to address the adaptive burdens of chronic pain in adults.</s><s xml:id="_ea9dkXC">We provide the results of a preliminary test of the effectiveness of the program in the domains of pain-related outcomes, mental health, knowledge about the principles of pain management, and daily life functioning.</s><s xml:id="_8DvntPK">By means of an intent-to-treat analysis and linear growth curve models, we sought to demonstrate, via a randomized controlled trial, that the CPMP would yield improvements in pain adaptation, in psychosocial adjustment, and in pain-related knowledge relative to wait-listed, treatment-asusual control subjects.</s></p></div>

xml:id="_aeekpC6">in recent reviews/meta-analyses of Web-based interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_cxMeQwy">That is, the CPMP revealed significant albeit modest reductions in pain-related variables relative to wait-listed control subjects.</s><s xml:id="_cZhbScU">Notably, however, our attrition rate (25 of 330, 7.6%) was smaller than the average of 26% (yet ranging as high as 99%) reported in several reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>, and the effects for psychosocial outcomes (depression, anxiety, and stress) were more apparent than previously noted.</s><s xml:id="_k85d7Sz">That our participants showed an increase in pain knowledge after program exposure seems to be novel.</s></p><p xml:id="_EMvptyD"><s xml:id="_xvmaBtS">Because the growth curve model used as our data analytic strategy has not been widely used in the pain literature, its value may not seem immediately obvious.</s><s xml:id="_MVJrxv7">However, it should be noted that its ability to handle missing data and its capacity to obtain more precise estimates of individual change parameters relative to typical analysis of variance procedures enhances our confidence that the CPMP altered pain adjustment and pain learning.</s><s xml:id="_4g87WMu">That our effect sizes tended to be modest is not surprising in light of the unsupervised nature of the program.</s></p><p xml:id="_xBpA4qx"><s xml:id="_RPVnSMJ">Despite the comparatively low attrition rate in the present study, it would be premature to conclude that professional support for program participation would not have added significantly to the efficacy of the CPMP.</s><s xml:id="_YCpts3N">Whether self-paced training such as that provided by the CPMP is employed as an adjunct to face-to-face treatment, or whether clinician participation is used to support or bolster the effects of a fully self-contained e-health program, the combination of online and off-line learning and motivation may well maximize the program's ultimate adaptive yield.</s><s xml:id="_UJmXsZu">Further research is clearly needed that focuses on the pragmatics of merging Internet-based and traditional methods of treatment delivery for persons with chronic pain.</s></p><p xml:id="_tW7gMHG"><s xml:id="_NC76nkv">Several interpretive limitations of our findings must also be noted.</s><s xml:id="_yvKkgHs">First, whereas our recruitment from Internet sites is fully consistent with the expected mode of access to and delivery of the CPMP, we are nonetheless restricted in our ability to address the generalizability of the present set of outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_7KGQJW2">As there is no logical or clinical warrant for precluding patient recruitment from hospital and clinic sites, future investigations are needed to address program utility for individuals so recruited.</s><s xml:id="_eEnDZbQ">Of course, because most (91%) of our participants reported being under a doctor's care, we anticipate that our results are not seriously population specific.</s><s xml:id="_Ak2jVGJ">Second, as we sought to be minimally intrusive, we were unable to obtain the sorts of data that would allow us to address fidelity of program use, such as actual time spent on individual program components, or to address possible moderators of program success.</s><s xml:id="_RMxMDMH">But, once again, apparent program success tends to offset (but not fully justify) these omissions.</s><s xml:id="_QbpkyM2">In addition, as we had no control over the treatmentas-usual regimens available to our control participants, we cannot offer strong comparative evaluations of the potency of the CPMP.</s><s xml:id="_WeZG7H5">Interestingly, a recent study comparing an interactive Web site for chronic back pain management <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> against a structured text-based control condition, likewise found support for the relative superiority of the e-program on varied measures of pain adjustment.</s><s xml:id="_WxxqG9k">Nonetheless, although we have some reason to be optimistic that the CPMP provides more than mere expectancy enhancement, we must acknowledge the finding <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> that studies of computer-based intervention with lower levels of methodological quality tend to have a higher likelihood of reporting significant treatment effects relative to control conditions.</s><s xml:id="_2KAdSVt">Thus, we are cognizant of the need to enhance the assessment of treatment fidelity in a fluid medium such as the Internet.</s></p><p xml:id="_7g443WQ"><s xml:id="_WZhsK3w">Additionally, despite the differences in slopes between our experimental and control conditions (all in the hypothesized directions) as depicted in Figs.</s><s xml:id="_evVVxW5"><ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_3">4</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_4">5</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_5">6</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_6">7</ref><ref type="figure" target="#fig_7">8</ref>, future research would need to extend the postprogram follow-up interval to permit us to make justified comparisons between the CPMP and traditional therapist-led pain treatment modalities.</s><s xml:id="_MgJfSmM">Nonetheless, it is important to bear in mind that the CPMP, unlike interventions of fixed session length and fixed program duration, is designed to be used for as long as needed and at the convenience of the individual patient.</s><s xml:id="_7mGTy5z">Indeed, the concept of "follow-up" per se derives from the convention that treatment duration is necessarily restricted by third party payment options, patient finances, and patient-clinician scheduling constraints.</s><s xml:id="_YR3xGaB">By contrast, Internet-based training, retraining, and/or progress monitoring is meant to be a mouse-click away, deliverable on an as needed basis.</s><s xml:id="_EvKPduf">Thus, computer-aided psychoeducational assessment and training might best be evaluated on a regular and continuous schedule, one defined by patient need rather than logistics or pragmatics.</s></p><p xml:id="_hp3B49t"><s xml:id="_GvJPshh">We also acknowledge that the use of portable interactive interventions depends on patient readiness to assume a level of initiative and responsibility that may not characterize a large segment of children and adults with chronic pain.</s><s xml:id="_pYXPAJB">In fact, even the most conscientious users of the CPMP (ie, the most dedicated and compliant) may not have accrued maximal benefit from its many interactive features (Fig. <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_CvHd9na">Future research will need to carefully track program adherence among participants who differ in (among other things) types of pain, levels of pain-related disability, interest in self-managed change, and computer comfort in order to clarify which training elements work best for which types of patients.</s></p><p xml:id="_kMUfu8Y"><s xml:id="_8Tk9pPB">Despite the acknowledged limitations of the present study, the present findings offer a sense of cautious optimism in response to Eccleston's <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> query as to whether e-health technology can truly deliver on its promise for persons with chronic pain.</s><s xml:id="_9gGg2JD">Unlike several previous investigations, ours revealed that several psychosocial outcomes (indices of anxiety, depression, stress, and pain-related knowledge) could be improved along with the expected program-induced decreases in pain severity, fear, disability, functional interference, perceived emotional burden, and catastrophizing.</s><s xml:id="_PH4FxUf">It is also worth noting that, unlike several other computer-assisted pain intervention programs that have been formally described and evaluated, the CPMP remains available on the Internet.</s></p><p xml:id="_79Rtbpp"><s xml:id="_h7Y95wR">Finally, it must be acknowledged that the Internet as a means of clinical services delivery is still in its infancy.</s><s xml:id="_s43hdUs">The lure of technical advancements in patient monitoring and online program delivery should not overshadow the continuing need to ensure program quality and minimize risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_sXGdPFW">Advocates of electronic programs for chronic pain will, in the future, need to (among other things): provide evidence of their effectiveness relative to credible alternatives (not just wait-listed control subjects), ensure that social networking options do not lead to violations of ethics and privacy, address differences in user sophistication and attrition potential, maximize the safety of data storage, and better educate practitioners and the public about the benefits and challenges of computer technology relative to its costs and practical limitations.</s><s xml:id="_56Yv2MM">Pain.</s><s xml:id="_dqu463F">Author manuscript; available in PMC 2013 February 01.</s><s xml:id="_gsyKC7g">$watermark-text $watermark-text $watermark-text  Simple
