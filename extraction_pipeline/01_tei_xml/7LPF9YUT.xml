factors for global mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_E3MNvMt">Each year, physical inactivity is responsible for &gt;5 million deaths worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_r56Wruf">In contrast, regular physical activity (PA) prevents the risk of developing chronic diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>, limits their progression <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>, and reduces early mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xjejhFX">In parallel, there is a dose-response relationship between total sedentary time per day and overall mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8HZCjbP">Meta-analyses demonstrate that the risk of mortality in adults increases steadily with a sedentary lifestyle of &gt;3 hours per day and more significantly when this time exceeds 7 hours per day <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KRksFFd">However, recent studies have suggested that high levels of PA could attenuate or even eliminate the deleterious effects of SB on overall mortality <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_jdqduef"><s xml:id="_YuNWxUU">In this context, it is urgent to develop interventions that can effectively change PA.</s><s xml:id="_HqdvF6C">Therefore, digital health interventions constitute a new opportunity to take care of patients by involving them in their treatment in a dynamic and interactive way.</s><s xml:id="_e46nVq3">Gamification is a promising avenue to capitalize on the efficacy of digital interventions.</s><s xml:id="_7M8Ewf8">Gamification is defined as the use of game design elements in nongame contexts <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HGkbKyJ">By integrating game mechanisms in interventions that are initially devoid of them, the purpose of gamification is to integrate into daily life the ingredients that make games enjoyable to motivate participants to engage in PA <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_38xf72G">The use of motivational affordances created by gamification can influence psychological (eg, motivation, attitude, and enjoyment) and physical outcomes (eg, physical capacities) <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and therefore appears as a potentially powerful technique for behavior change.</s></p><p xml:id="_cYJJCG8"><s xml:id="_x8h6m64">By gamifying PA, participants are encouraged to move and walk to play, which tends to make their activities more enjoyable and playful <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7QnCXEG">Unlike serious games, which refer to the use of a full-fledged video game for educational or health purposes (ie, a video game in its entirety as opposed to selected elements or individual features of a game) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and require a dedicated time, a location, and implementation <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, gamification techniques are relatively open to varying situational modes of engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and concern instead global PA in all aspects of daily life (eg, walking, running, or gardening).</s><s xml:id="_TvY3F24">Gamification is made possible by mobile technologies and wearable devices that can track and collect daily activities in a continuous and web-based manner.</s><s xml:id="_CegrRjc">This allows for intervening directly on the lifestyle of individuals without adding material or time constraints for the participants.</s><s xml:id="_4M7WQ2P">However, several literature reviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15,</ref><ref type="bibr">16]</ref> have reported inconsistent results concerning the use of gamification in behavioral interventions, with some studies demonstrating positive effects and other studies providing more mixed effects.</s><s xml:id="_rSy4bEq">These reviews also emphasized the lack of high-quality studies and highlighted the need for more rigorous trials to isolate the impact of gamification (ie, randomized controlled trials <ref type="bibr">[RCTs]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_nAWzySN">Importantly, Koivisto and Hamari <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> suggested that the effects of gamification could be smaller when using rigorous experimentation.</s><s xml:id="_MypDqJ4">In sum, these reviews indicate that there is no clear evidence of the effectiveness of gamified interventions.</s><s xml:id="_HhF8aZV">Nevertheless, no meta-analysis has been conducted yet.</s><s xml:id="_vQQXAyf">Quantifying the effect size of gamified interventions and identifying moderators of this effect would provide important information about the effectiveness of such interventions.</s><s xml:id="_BzGYFzN">Moreover, a meta-analysis appears as timely, as there are now enough RCTs to conduct such an analysis.</s></p></div>
