<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_DJwRYk6">The evolution of software regulation</head><p xml:id="_WVRMcm9"><s xml:id="_GUV5X9f">The 1976 Medical Device Amendments to the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act requires that FDA regulate products intended to diagnose, treat, and/or manage disease.</s><s xml:id="_ER9mNgs">After 1987, FDA was fully aware of the potential role of computers and software in healthcare when it published its "Draft Policy on the Regulation of Computer Products."</s><s xml:id="_KzKCTnt">This document provided guidelines about which software products were regulated as medical devices and which were exempt from regulatory controls such as premarket notifications.</s><s xml:id="_bDNBXkK">Specifically, the guidance stated that the following software was not subject to registration, listing and premarket notification (i.e., FDA authorization): (1) general purpose articles, (2) computer products manufactured by licensed practitioners for use in their practice (3) computer products used in teaching and non-clinical research, and (4) computer products which provide opportunity for competent human intervention.</s><s xml:id="_DsBAg2a">The guidance further stated that the following computer products would require notification to FDA prior to marketing: (1) computer products excluding competent human intervention and (2) substantially equivalent computer products.</s><s xml:id="_WRt3rRA">Computer products that do not meet any of the other criteria would be subject to premarket approval (see section "FDA pathways for digital technologies").</s><s xml:id="_hFnbeqD">A 1989 draft policy statement, "FDA Policy for the Regulation of Computer Products," reiterated the 1987 draft and was the agency's operational policy for almost 20 years (2).</s></p><p xml:id="_ja6Z9vb"><s xml:id="_5Xrcs3S">In the years since, and particularly in the last decade, there has been a proliferation of consumer industry healthcare apps that were never considered in the original software policies.</s><s xml:id="_jHgJwaz">In addition, the sheer volume and diversity of the products and manufacturers has seemingly been daunting to FDA.</s><s xml:id="_u7geKfv">FDA attempted to clarify the kinds of software it would regulate in the draft Mobile Medical Applications (MMA) guidance document published in 2013 and updated twice in 2019 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_nV5T7CT">The 2019 guidance was updated to reflect the issuance of the final rule, "Medical Devices; Medical Device Classification Regulations To Conform to Medical Software Provisions in the 21st Century Cures Act" (86 FR 20278) and the guidance "Clinical Decision Support Software" (referred to as CDS guidance throughout the rest of this document) issued on September 28, 2022.</s><s xml:id="_h4vFkg8">This guidance excluded from regulation certain low-risk software that met the definition of a medical device, although certain quality-related activities were recommended for manufacturers.</s></p><p xml:id="_TjXJABk"><s xml:id="_VtBQPXp">FDA and industry seemed to be moving towards a common ground of using a risk-based approach to regulating software.</s><s xml:id="_ZPsu4Fx">Meanwhile, Congress was watching this evolution closely, and in December 2016, Congress passed the 21st Century Cures Act (4).</s><s xml:id="_Z6hJP7b">Among other changes, the Cures Act redefined "medical device" to exclude certain types of software such as medical device data systems (e.g., a device intended to transmit, receive, display, or convert without changing, data from a medical device).</s><s xml:id="_d5TtV4p">Many of the software types excluded from regulation were consistent with FDA's present risk-based approach and aligned closely with the MMA Guidance.</s><s xml:id="_nhTzbFG">The Cures Act also clarified that FDA was not permitted to review parts of a software system that were not regulated, although the boundaries of this system would be dependent on the manufacturer's risk assessment.</s><s xml:id="_GF2Zbdn">FDA has since published a flurry of guidance documents attempting to clarify their evolving interpretation of the Cures Act <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fGQA5re">Specifically, these guidance documents attempted to clarify <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(1)</ref> what types of clinical decision support the FDA would and would not regulate, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> what types of medical device functions FDA would and would not regulate, and ( <ref type="formula">3</ref>) what information FDA would expect to see in a submission for regulated medical device functions.</s></p><p xml:id="_xsbysRA"><s xml:id="_Eswxpse">FDA has also been examining the way in which it works with digital health companies.</s><s xml:id="_GbSJuRd">The Digital Health Center of Excellence (DHCoE) was created within the Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH) to lead efforts to catch up with the digital revolution <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(7)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_GquzDhy">The DHCoE takes a strategic view of digital health devices, i.e., by working broadly with the FDA, other agencies, and external stakeholders to address regulatory approaches as opposed to simply producing guidance documents regarding specific technologies or processes related to approval or product-specific efforts.</s></p><p xml:id="_DFp6mkC"><s xml:id="_5R4HpGW">The FDA currently regulates digitally-delivered treatments that meet the definition of software as a medical device (SaMD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SV2Fac2">SaMD is defined by the International Medical Device Regulators Forum as "software intended to be used for one or more medical purposes that perform these purposes without being part of a hardware medical device" (9).</s><s xml:id="_GZVWY3c">The "medical purposes" include the diagnosis, mitigation, treatment, or prevention of disease.</s><s xml:id="_H6uzNKd">In the United States, SaMD products are primarily regulated through the traditional approaches used to approve low-tomoderate-risk medical devices (i.e., devices that pose a low-tomoderate risk of harm to patients as a result of using a device).</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_caj9Fgn">FDA pathways for digital technologies</head><p xml:id="_pdaD5Cg"><s xml:id="_AY6TD5B">SaMD products, like all medical devices, are evaluated for their perceived potential risk to patients and are assigned to one of three classes: Class I (low risk); Class II (moderate risk); and Class III (high risk) (10).</s><s xml:id="_92sZcQn">Class II devices require general regulatory controls (i.e., broad requirements for provision of information to users), and often special regulatory controls, such as a requirement for clinical data specific to a product in order to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness or to demonstrate substantial equivalence to a predicate device <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(11)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2Uhkynq">Class III devices require general controls as well as premarket approval.</s></p><p xml:id="_d3fCxvS"><s xml:id="_fQRFmkQ">Although the first FDA-authorized PDTs were authorized as Class II devices based on their indications (requiring special controls) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(11)</ref>, different digital therapeutics may end up in different risk classes based on their area of treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(12)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(13)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(14)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2djWknA">The Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) lists a variety of regulations regarding computerized therapies that are unique to the diseases that a particular SaMD product is designed to treat.</s><s xml:id="_AfvSSpH">The regulations, therefore, are "fit for purpose."</s><s xml:id="_QDmRDf3">As an example, SaMDs developed for psychiatric disorders follow the requirements for Computerized Behavioral Therapy device for psychiatric disorders (21 CFR 882.5801) <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(15)</ref>, while SaMDs for gastrointestinal conditions are categorized and follow the requirements for Computerized Behavioral Therapy device for treating symptoms of gastrointestinal conditions (21 CFR 876.5960) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(16)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_FYnBEWH">FDA looks not only at past decisions but considers the specific circumstances involved in each approval.</s></p><p xml:id="_hcNg6kw"><s xml:id="_wKgBbQh">Importantly, Class II devices generally include special controls.</s><s xml:id="_esDVpG6">For example, FDA might specify requirements around labeling or clinical data to satisfy questions of safety and effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(11)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_XrSVEUb">Some existing PDT authorizations specify the requirement for subsequent products to include clinical data, which are necessary to provide reasonable assurance of safety and effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(17)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(18)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(19)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_rE48UDC"><s xml:id="_4quzsHg">Once any kind of digital treatment has been evaluated in one or more clinical studies (e.g., randomized controlled trials) the data and formal requests for authorization are submitted via one of two FDA pathways, each with regulatory and evidence-based requirements:</s></p><p xml:id="_hsqkSrF"><s xml:id="_S7UDdkU">â¢ The de novo pathway, which requires clinical data demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of the device <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(20)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_TJ8jwvS">Devices authorized via this pathway can then serve as "predicates" for other devices.</s><s xml:id="_2rw4yZK">â¢ The 510(k) clearance pathway, which requires the submission of clinical data demonstrating substantial equivalence in terms of safety and effectiveness to a predicate product authorized either via the de novo or another 510(k) pathway <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">(21)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_8RqkRh3"><s xml:id="_Suuv65D">Both pathways involve the submission of detailed data reports and product descriptions that inform the creation of patient and clinician labeling/instructions for use if the product is authorized.</s><s xml:id="_6JmUvuR">Work is underway to create a dedicated FDA regulatory framework for SaMD products such as PDTs that reflects the unique attributes of these devices.</s><s xml:id="_Y7uuPh9">For example, unlike pharmaceuticals, SaMD products can be frequently updated following FDA authorization, and products relying on artificial intelligence as a component of treatment may "learn" or change how their algorithms perform over time.</s></p><p xml:id="_cW28RqF"><s xml:id="_PjVeE5K">In 2017, the FDA announced the Software Precertification Pilot Program, which, it is hoped, will provide more streamlined and efficient regulatory oversight of software-based medical devices developed by manufacturers who have demonstrated a robust culture of quality, organizational excellence, and willingness to monitor their products once they reach the market.</s><s xml:id="_8FQbYAt">Nine companies have participated in the pilot program and have committed to reviewing real-world performance of their products to ensure patient safety and product quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">(22)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_DEvZuEW"><s xml:id="_HgZ4Fet">The proposed approach looks first at the digital health technology developer, rather than solely at the product, which is the current focus of traditional medical device regulations.</s><s xml:id="_QrS59SG">The new processes seek to accommodate the rapidity with which software products can respond to glitches, adverse events, and other safety concerns.</s><s xml:id="_DuFrHzy">In the Pre-Cert program, the FDA is proposing that software products from authorized companies would continue to meet the same safety and effectiveness standard that the agency expects for products that have followed the traditional path to market.</s><s xml:id="_S2nQs6Q">FDA released a final report on this program in September 2022 <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(23)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fz7dMFC">The report concluded that FDA could implement some changes under present authorities but would need legislative changes to implement others.</s></p></div>

may be prescription or non-prescription.</s><s xml:id="_DHpC49k">Prescription products require initiation by a licensed healthcare professional, as governed by state-level health authorities.</s><s xml:id="_zGrJD8W">The stipulation for prescription is based on review of the product and a variety of factors by FDA.</s><s xml:id="_7QeP78Q">Prescriptions may be required for the treatment of serious disease, the use of higher-risk devices, the need for a secure diagnosis by a trained clinician, monitoring and follow-up to determine appropriate response, and/or to compare treatment options to determine optimal treatment approaches.</s></p><p xml:id="_fcwJvsj"><s xml:id="_RfaCE5h">PDTs are software-based treatments delivered on smartphones or tablets that address the behavioral dimensions of many diseases and conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(8)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WZ3eHWe">The first FDA-authorized PDT to make treatment claims was reSET Â® (to treat patients with substance use disorders) in 2017 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">24)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_CJKjc6B">This new class of therapy is expanding rapidly, in terms of coverage by payors and overall market size.</s><s xml:id="_3Z2VC4E">In January 2022, a Research and Markets analysis valued the 2021 global market for digital therapeutics at $3.35 billion and estimated it would reach $12.1 billion by 2026 <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">(25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">26)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_FsqMqmB"><s xml:id="_5pWXHYJ">While the first software-based therapeutics were PDTs, nonprescription digital treatments are similar and some of these have received FDA market authorization <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">24)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_A28mtwj">For example, the non-prescription Natural Cycles <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(27)</ref> software application that lets women track their menstrual cycles was approved via the de novo pathway as a Class II device, while another nonprescription menstruation tracker, Clue, was authorized via the 510(k) pathway using Natural Cycles as a predicate device <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">(28)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_CAfsEUX"><s xml:id="_2eK6EQw">Unlike health and wellness apps, PDTs specifically treat diseases and, therefore, are regulated by FDA and categorized as Class II devices.</s><s xml:id="_jQVPbfK">Although PDTs, and digital therapeutics in general, are technologically different from traditional medical devices, they are currently reviewed and authorized by CDRH using regulatory pathways and processes that have not always been aligned with the rapid, dynamic, and iterative nature of treatments delivered as software.</s></p><p xml:id="_VBV7xK3"><s xml:id="_fyGZ4nx">In some cases, PDTs may be intended to be used alongside standard of care pharmacotherapy.</s><s xml:id="_RWAFDUn">In such cases, such as reSET-O Â® , which is intended to be used alongside the pharmacotherapy buprenorphine, both FDA's CDRH and the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) review and provide input, even if CDRH was the primary review center <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(12)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7XZ8R55">We are already seeing expansion of drug/software combination products that may be regulated as drugs with CDER as the primary
