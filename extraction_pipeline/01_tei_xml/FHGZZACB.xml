integral part of our lives today <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b89">90]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WYcdgwn">Their proliferation has given rise to Personal Informatics (PI), namely a class of systems that "help people collect personally relevant information for the purpose of self-reflection and gaining self-knowledge" <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SejKfvj">Such systems enable people to keep track of their productivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62]</ref>, finances <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">[60]</ref>, and learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_MxYpCqx">Yet, tracking various aspects of physical and mental health is particularly prevalent <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9gbfzQK">PI systems can continuously and unobtrusively measure and collect physiological and behavioral data, namely, "digital biomarkers", from users through integrated sensors.</s><s xml:id="_4Qu6juN">Digital biomarkers contain an uncanny amount of personal information.</s><s xml:id="_VQGsZDY">Even the coarser behavioral biomarkers acquired from consumer wearables (e.g., steps, calories) strongly correlate to a person's gender, height, and weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b60">[61]</ref>, while signals of finer granularity (e.g., accelerometer and heart rate), can predict variables associated with an individual's physical health, fitness, and demographics <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[89]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_RJMTHJf"><s xml:id="_kyU5tS9">At the same time, consumer smartphones and wearables are now packed with an increasing number of advanced health tracking features, innovating in personal health, research, and care <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_RVh9mXv">Flagship consumer wearable algorithms -some approved by the US Food and Drug Administration-can now identify signs of atrial fibrillation (AFib) through electrocardiogram (ECG) or photoplethysmography (PPG) signals <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_BZq6sAV">On a different note, newly released watches introduce novel cycle-tracking functionality, including fertility prediction and notifications, using logged period data and temperature measurements <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zK4cbcS">Mobility features include fall and crash detection through accelerometer and gyroscope measurements and notification of emergency services.</s><s xml:id="_DuQ2t7n">Similarly, newly integrated blood oxygen (SpO2) sensors on wearable rings can provide indicators and warn users about potential sleep apnea or lung diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[94]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ChXMJJf">It is evident that consumer smartphones and wearables have moved beyond step counts, marking a rapid transition towards mHealth .</s></p><p xml:id="_2X7D4m5"><s xml:id="_sdDnR2n">However, the prevalent PI adoption embeds important challenges due to the questionable transparency and unexplored biases in the systems' algorithms.</s><s xml:id="_xC9q9v2">Contrary to the common belief that algorithmic decisions are objective by definition, a machine learning (ML) model may be inherently unfair by learning, preserving, or even amplifying historical biases existent in the data <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[81]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_bHvBJrf">Unfortunately, real-world cases of unfair ML models are abundant even within the ubiquitous computing community.</s><s xml:id="_zUQmmXd">For example, neural network algorithms trained to classify skin lesions were found to exhibit lower diagnostic accuracy in black patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_neT3Mmc">Moreover, racial bias has been identified in health sensors such as oximeters, which were primarily tested on white populations, resulting in the misclassification of people of color <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_sgdjdHE">Given the growing potential of PI devices in mHealth, imagine the ethical and social implications if an AFib detection algorithm exhibited bias against a specific race or if a fertility prediction algorithm was biased against women in developing countries.</s></p><p xml:id="_YEpReqS"><s xml:id="_vjcnBqp">Despite this growing interest in ML fairness, a focused emphasis on the requirements of unbiased PI systems in mHealth settings is lacking <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">110]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_QxFytyW">Yet, PI systems are deployed in high-stakes health applications, while their input data modality, i.e., personal sensitive data, makes them susceptible to propagating bias.</s><s xml:id="_6t45hVr">Thus, exploring biases within these systems is critical to raise awareness regarding mitigating and regulatory actions required to avert potential negative consequences.</s><s xml:id="_f9ZHTXx">This need is further highlighted by the differences between PI and other domains, such as facial or speech recognition:</s></p><p xml:id="_kTaxp95"><s xml:id="_wuJBK8a">• The digital divide as a barrier of entry: To contribute data to an image or voice dataset, users do not need any technical knowledge or niche device.</s><s xml:id="_ExFHtjb">However, to contribute to a PI dataset, users face significant "entry barriers" in terms of digital capacity or device ownership, creating new-found representation biases.</s><s xml:id="_gfV85Hp">• Emerging technologies accuracy: Facial or speech recognition devices, e.g., camera or voice recorder, are mature technologies with high accuracy.</s><s xml:id="_55FMabd">On the contrary, emerging PI devices' accuracy significantly varies across models, creating unexplored measurement biases and discrepancies across user segments.</s><s xml:id="_QANRBV8">• Complex nature of data: It may be straightforward to identify biases in terms of skin tone, nationality and gender in facial or speech recognition.</s><s xml:id="_4CE2AJG">Yet, identifying biases in digital biomarkers, e.g., sensor data, is complicated.</s><s xml:id="_VCr2Whj">Biases in PI data can remain hidden and be further propagated or even amplified in ML models.</s><s xml:id="_J9fn3Pf">Motivated by these differences and research gap, we present the first comprehensive study on bias in PI: We adopt the most complete framework to date for understanding sources of harm in the ML life cycle <ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[92]</ref> ( §3), and explore biases in the data generation ( §4) and model building and implementation ( §5) streams.</s><s xml:id="_kpJxtFA">Ultimately, we apply our methodology in the largest real-world PI dataset to date, while providing preliminary indications of generalizability through differing datasets and use cases ( §6), and we offer recommendations for bias mitigation ( §7).</s><s xml:id="_Z6Pq9kF">Specifically, our research questions (RQs) and the respective contributions are as follows:</s></p><p xml:id="_jmgzwdg"><s xml:id="_gyPf57t">(1) Are PI data susceptible to biases?</s><s xml:id="_thqpfV2">We examine whether ubiquitous digital biomarkers are subject to historical, representation, and measurement biases.</s><s xml:id="_K6zjVjg">To demonstrate our point, we analyze the MyHeart Counts dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, comprising physical activity, fitness, sleep, and cardiovascular health data for 50K participants across the United States (US).</s><s xml:id="_qn65enC">Our results reveal biases across all stages of the data generation stream, highlighting the need for careful usage of PI datasets, in general, and the MyHeart Counts data, in particular.</s><s xml:id="_3yhtVDA">(2) Do ML models inherit PI data biases?</s><s xml:id="_nQrAq7b">We examine whether biases inherent in PI data persist during modeling.</s><s xml:id="_x7pAAQp">Specifically, we assess various learning and personalization models for aggregation, learning, and deployment biases.</s><s xml:id="_bR2PArj">Consistent with prior research <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref>, our findings indicate that data biases are propagated to learning models, particularly for user groups with intersecting identities.</s><s xml:id="_ZuXYFnr">They are also significantly amplified in their personalized counterparts, prompting further exploration of personalization trade-offs.</s><s xml:id="_zGAvy2B">(3) Do synthetic benchmarks hide the imperfect nature of PI?</s><s xml:id="_5utyjVY">We explore whether "perfect" synthetic benchmark datasets can hide PI data and model "imperfections" and biases during evaluation.</s><s xml:id="_PgjK2NZ">Specifically, we compare a random benchmark, representative of our data, with one designed to achieve demographic parity for evaluation biases.</s><s xml:id="_fjHfpx3">Our findings highlight the importance of establishing PI benchmarks that are representative of the intended target populations to avoid deploying models with unidentified biases.</s></p></div>

widespread adoption of intelligent systems and applications in our everyday lives, accounting for data and model biases has gained significant traction in designing and deploying systems.</s><s xml:id="_YZpNhRb">Specifically, these notions have been studied extensively in domains such as natural language processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr"

type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b105">106]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DnTDQUw">Yet, evidence for biases in the PI setting is lacking.</s><s xml:id="_xmZ9BHX">Closer to PI, fairness research in healthcare is still in its infancy <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mmQNPVR">The digitization of medical data has enabled the scientific community to collect large amounts of heterogeneous, multi-modal data and develop ML algorithms for various medical tasks.</s><s xml:id="_D36AwyP">During the process, various limitations have been uncovered based on the three most prominent data types: medical image data, structured electronic health record (EHR) data, and textual data.</s></p><p xml:id="_sgZaJWV"><s xml:id="_mzDecBZ">Medical imaging has been the most widely used data source for ML in healthcare, and biases in them have received attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_YA3zFWT">For example, Larrazabal et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b63">[64]</ref> utilizes two commonly used X-ray image datasets to diagnose various chest diseases under different gender imbalance conditions and showcase that the minority gender group systematically performs worse than the majority gender group.</s><s xml:id="_Uqk6GPF">Similarly, according to Adamson and Smith <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, relying on ML for skin cancer screening may exacerbate potential racial disparities in dermatology.</s></p><p xml:id="_HNE3vgN"><s xml:id="_ZFDtmKD">On a different note, EHR systems store multi-modal, heterogeneous patient data, such as demographics, diagnoses, and clinical records, and have been used for various tasks, such as medical concept extraction, mortality prediction, and disease inference.</s><s xml:id="_23Qn8MJ">Regarding EHR data fairness, Meng et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref> identify race-level differences in the predictions of neural network models on the MIMIC-IV dataset <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">[57]</ref>, with Black and Hispanic patients being less likely to receive interventions or receiving interventions of shorter average duration.</s><s xml:id="_k6asDRT">Similarly, Röösli et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[82]</ref> reveals a strong class imbalance problem and significant fairness concerns for Black and publicly insured ICU patients in the same dataset.</s></p><p xml:id="_x66HQas"><s xml:id="_TmpppWB">Concerning textual EHR data, Chen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> examines clinical and psychiatric notes to predict intensive care unit mortality and 30-day psychiatric readmission.</s><s xml:id="_qjrXKtb">Their analysis reveals differences in prediction accuracy, and biases are present in terms of gender and insurance type for mortality prediction and insurance policy for psychiatric 30-day readmission.</s><s xml:id="_hR5fz6v">Within the same scope, Zhang et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b111">[112]</ref> train deep embedding models on medical notes from the MIMIC-III database <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>, and find that classifiers trained from their embeddings exhibit statistically significant differences in performance, often favoring the majority group regarding gender, language, ethnicity, and insurance status.</s></p><p xml:id="_ZfW2sEB"><s xml:id="_eUksmpA">Yet, despite the emerging research on biases in healthcare, its proximity to PI, and the widespread adoption of PI technologies, biases in PI have been barely explored.</s><s xml:id="_g4aHP2J">Paviglianiti and Pasero <ref type="bibr" target="#b78">[79]</ref> reported gender biases in digital biomarkers using Vital-ECG, a wearable smart device that collects

physical activity and the digital divide, leading to data generation that is not representative of the general population.</s><s xml:id="_pfzsbFb">This is indeed the case in the MyHeart Counts dataset, where female, non-white, underweight, overweight or obese, young, and hypertensive users, are undersampled.</s><s xml:id="_9u8NWdr">Unacknowledged historical biases, though, can creep into the ML pipeline perpetuating social injustices.</s><s xml:id="_5pmpKCK">Yet, even within well-sampled user groups, data imbalances, either in terms of user attributes or measured behaviors, are still prevalent due to realistic differences across user segments.</s><s xml:id="_X7XAFDs">Specifically, in PI, we see significant underrepresentation of minority groups across all protected attributes and measured behavioral differences -not necessarily realistic-for users with diabetes, joint issues, unhealthy BMI, non-white users, and females.</s><s xml:id="_cuUefgu">Unresolved representation biases can lead to performance discrepancies for minority groups, which in turn might lead to differences in treatment or care <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_TJgJNJZ">Finally, PI data is susceptible to measurement biases, due to the heterogeneity in input modalities, performance and hardware differences across generations of devices, and usage of third-multiple party apps of unknown accuracy.</s><s xml:id="_hq4kcxD">Females are especially affected by such biases in our dataset, as they tend to own older devices with fewer capabilities and use more fitness-related third-party apps.</s><s xml:id="_Nu6jSsM">Unknown measurement biases in seemingly "objective" sensor data can lead to errors in downstream tasks that disproportionally affect certain protected groups.</s></p><p xml:id="_d7XWXwJ"><s xml:id="_wC8BmHW">In an initial attempt to offer guidance to researchers in the field of ubiquitous computing, we present the following guidelines in the context of the data generation stream on how to mitigate the impact of historical, representation, and measurement biases, respectively:</s></p><p xml:id="_r8jh5EH"><s xml:id="_WkgpM56">Guideline #1: To identify historical biases relevant to the use case at hand, consult prior literature and domain experts (e.g., oximeters are proven susceptible to biases against darker skin tones <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>) or conduct small-scale feasibility studies with relevant and diverse demographics.</s><s xml:id="_sF5kdHX">Guideline #2: If data are self-collected, aim for diverse user recruitment and collect and report relevant protected attributes (e.g., via datasheets for datasets and data statements).</s><s xml:id="_z7qXf24">Otherwise, evaluate algorithms in generalizable cross-dataset benchmarks [108] and inclusive synthetic data <ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[98]</ref>, whenever possible.</s><s xml:id="_3kTJaPa">In either case, consider appropriate data manipulation actions to alleviate biases, e.g., re-sampling/rebalancing populations conditioned on demographic attributes.</s></p><p xml:id="_6y8smKy"><s xml:id="_rUQUF6h">Guideline #3: When working with data originating from diverse devices, investigate device ownership differences conditioned on demographic attributes.</s><s xml:id="_hxWtBt2">Also, incorporate uncertainty estimation approaches and be transparent about possible measurement error effects in downstream tasks.</s></p><p xml:id="_nYehkp5"><s xml:id="_N22WGYp">Summing up, we believe that our findings shed light on the biases that can creep into the data generation and model building, and implementation streams of PI technologies.</s><s xml:id="_mxxQZ3R">While our mitigation guidelines are by no means exhaustive, they provide a starting point for researchers and practitioners to incorporate bias assessments "by design" in the life cycle of their works to alleviate the potential negative effects of such biases.</s></p><p xml:id="_6AqGVtB"><s xml:id="_URE89CW">7.1.2</s><s xml:id="_Wzj2XuT">Model Building and Implementation Stream.</s><s xml:id="_WHP7xFZ">Based on our results, digital biomarkers representation biases can be propagated or even amplified by learning models, regardless of the inclusion of protected attributes in the feature set.</s><s xml:id="_UjcjuxF">This is due to the existence of proxy variables in PI data that can be used by models to infer hidden protected attributes.</s><s xml:id="_qWkH4JX">Such aggregation biases are also prevalent in our use case for users with joint issues, diabetes, hypertension, and female users.</s><s xml:id="_nS9kQF6">These biases may (or may not) lead to discrimination depending on the context.</s><s xml:id="_guq7Mnr">Yet, mitigating them is the safest way to ensure fairness.</s><s xml:id="_Ag3zqcQ">Additionally, common learning choices in PI, such as personalization, can introduce learning biases, if trained on biased data.</s><s xml:id="_5FaRtNF">In our case, they perform worse -in terms of bias-across all attributes, while, in extreme cases (e.g., diabetic users), they can even introduce maximum bias.</s><s xml:id="_vWWhKFa">Accuracy gains emerging from alternative learning choices can be tempting, but their trade-offs should be thoroughly assessed.</s><s xml:id="_p6jPt6r">On a different note, our empirical results illustrate that model performance is highly susceptible to the representativeness of the PI benchmark used and highlight how evaluation biases can affect ubiquitous models in the evaluation phase.</s><s xml:id="_mWHDwkW">In such cases, performance and fairness drift can emerge if the evaluation data is not representative of the target population.</s><s xml:id="_vmwgQpZ">Finally, the application of ML in PI is not free of deployment biases, which can emerge from outdated evaluation practices emerging from the PI systems' early applications or the false assumption of autonomous PI systems' existence.</s><s xml:id="_dCfSnXU">Yet, mischoosing evaluation metrics or focusing solely on aggregate metrics can hide discrepancies in performance for minority groups.</s><s xml:id="_yMKz3FB">Developing high-stakes systems in isolation might also lead to (unintended) system misuse.</s></p><p xml:id="_uFyeSsh"><s xml:id="_U2ppGKN">To provide guidance in the context of model building and implementations, we offer guidelines to alleviate the potential negative effects of the aggregation, learning, evaluation, and deployment biases, respectively: Guideline #4: Utilize fairness toolkits, such as FairLearn, AIF360, and Aequitas for implementations of pre-, in-, and post-processing bias mitigation algorithms and fairness metrics.</s><s xml:id="_wpPB2Cq">Guideline #5: Move beyond accuracy in evaluating learning paradigms by incorporating fairness metrics in the evaluation pipeline of ML models, conditioning performance on intersections of protected attributes.</s><s xml:id="_bxCpqa7">Guideline #6: Aim for representative and realistic evaluation datasets -beyond carefully-curated benchmarks-, if available, or reassess your model after deployment.</s><s xml:id="_pBedpH6">Re-train with the target population's data if you encounter performance drifts conditioned on demographic attributes.</s><s xml:id="_28hHypb">Guideline #7: Choose multiple, appropriate fairness metrics based on "fairness trees" <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[85]</ref> and domain expertise for the use case at hand.</s><s xml:id="_9XFAHtv">Consider a human-in-the-loop design approach for high-stakes applications to account for human biases that affect system design.</s></p></div>
