and (b) at the intrapersonal level, showing that day-to-day fluctuations in psychological need satisfaction co-vary with day-to-day fluctuation in well-being (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Ryan et al. 2010)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SQ6c2T3">Such findings have been reported in diverse life domains, including education (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">Mouratidis et al. 2011)</ref>, the workplace ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">Van den Broeck et al. 2010)</ref>, and health care <ref type="bibr" target="#b92">(Williams et al. 2011)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_BhrrRN7"><s xml:id="_eTHkdHb">Consistent with the proposed differentiation between satisfaction and frustration of the psychological needs, an increasing number of studies have found need frustration to relate uniquely to ill-being (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">Bartholomew et al. 2011;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Stebbings et al. 2012</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_s8qECMy">Further, these findings were corroborated in a diary study including binge eating symptoms as an outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Verstuyf et al. 2013)</ref>, as well as in a study that used an objective (i.e., physiological) marker of distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Bartholomew et al. 2011)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_CzsBrAp"><s xml:id="_BrqbaCH">Despite the substantial evidence in favor of BPNT, two important issues deserve additional research.</s><s xml:id="_2mjy4Ky">These critical issues concern: (a) whether there exists cross-cultural variation in the degree to which individuals benefit from psychological need satisfaction and suffer from psychological need frustration; (b) whether the well-being benefits deriving from the satisfaction and risks associated with the frustration of the basic psychological needs are moderated by individual differences in people's explicit valuation or desire for the satisfaction of those needs.</s><s xml:id="_kEemGDy">We turn to these issues in the following sections.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_WW2Q5Pa">Cultural differences and similarities</head><p xml:id="_9ASvwHj"><s xml:id="_6tENzqS">People are under the influence of numerous contexts embedded in the broader cultural climate (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">Bronfenbrenner 1979;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">Connell and Wellborn 1991;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Deci and Ryan 2012)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Qvf8Eke">Highlighting the critical role of the cultural context, within a cultural-relativistic perspective on psychological well-being, it is maintained that there is no universal human nature or universally critical psychological needs.</s><s xml:id="_SpkpCgP">Instead, consistent with a social-constructivist perspective, individuals' goals, values, and needs are primarily conceived as social constructions or scripts that are largely shaped by the specific social-cultural contexts, that is, through demands, obstacles, and affordances available in the social environment (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">Buttle 1989)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_QgPXfEY">Thus, what people need to flourish psychologically is contextual relative, malleable, and not ''essentialistic'' (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">Burr 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b76">Shweder et al. 1998)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_dny32AA"><s xml:id="_STYQqfG">Indeed, various cross-cultural psychologists primarily focus on cultural differences that influence individuals' wellbeing in particular cultures (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">Heine et al. 1999)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_M548m7h">For instance, <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Oishi et al. (1999)</ref> found that satisfaction with self and one's autonomy was a significantly stronger predictor of life satisfaction in countries high, relative to low on individualism.</s><s xml:id="_MsVEmj5">Along with such findings, some theorists have suggested that being autonomous would only be beneficial for those in individualistic societies, such as the middle class European or American context, since being autonomous and acting independently is highly valued in such contexts (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">Iyengar and Devoe 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b81">Uchida and Kitayama 2009)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_nnyuUd3">In contrast, individuals in a more collectivistic-oriented Asian context, for instance, would benefit from being involved in caring and harmonious relationships, as they are socialized into a more interpersonal mode of functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">(Iyengar and Lepper 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Uchida et al. 2004</ref>).</s></p><p xml:id="_VgyJrmM"><s xml:id="_25cp78w">On the other hand, as pointed out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Diener (2009)</ref>, one should not neglect the possibility of universal dynamics underlying different cultural syndromes.</s><s xml:id="_MpR8kUX">SDT has precisely posited the existence of such universal factors.</s><s xml:id="_GkkxrM3"><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Diener (2009)</ref> argued further that ''more research is needed on which influences on well-being are universal across cultures and why' <ref type="bibr">' (p. 288)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2jk5Y49">Meeting this call, we examined whether satisfaction of the three basic psychological needs would contribute similarly to well-being across four cultures or, in contrast, would vary in the degree to which they predict well-being in different cultures.</s><s xml:id="_HfB2qxp">To shed light on this issue, we took into account a number of critical points.</s></p><p xml:id="_jsBsN5G"><s xml:id="_uaqmbc3">First, we emphasize the necessity of being precise in how the needs, and autonomy in particular, have been defined in SDT, as part of the controversy surrounding autonomy is due to conceptual confusion.</s><s xml:id="_cCZ2rn2">Several crosscultural psychologists have defined autonomy as independence or individualism, which gets contrasted with dependence and collectivism (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Markus and Schwartz 2010)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zY9ErSe">Instead, within the SDT tradition, autonomy has consistently been defined as the experience of volition and willingness, which stands in contrast with the experience of external control, pressure, and coercion.</s><s xml:id="_5WVkPc6">Various SDT writers have been very clear that the term autonomy does not refer to independence (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chirkov et al. 2003;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b64">Ryan and Lynch 1989)</ref>.</s><s

that engender need satisfaction from one culture to another, these different behavioral pathways might lead to the same outcomes, that is, the phenomenological experiences of feeling effective,

reduced self-control.</s><s xml:id="_X3sGwtm">Promising in this regard is a recent longitudinal study showing that need frustration (but not need satisfaction) was related to increases in bulimic symptoms over a 6-month period <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Boone et al. 2014)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_9gc4PVA"><s xml:id="_jqxe4tY">Another limitation is the fact that we did not directly measure

differences between the participating countries.</s><s xml:id="_n99xdrp">The inclusion of such cultural markers would also allow us to move beyond just testing the moderating role of between-country cultural differences and to also take into account within-country cultural heterogeneity.</s><s xml:id="_TwhtB2F">Indeed, past work <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(Chen et al. 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Chirkov et al. 2003)</ref> shows that cultures are not monolithic entities, but that there is considerable cultural diversity within a given culture, which could also be

role of the psychological needs for well-being and results revealed that little variance in these relations was explained by cultural and individual differences.</s><s xml:id="_6TJ5FSA">Yet, the universality of this psychological process does not exclude the possibility that there could be important individual and cultural differences in how people get the needs satisfied and how people
