Mbuagbaw 2012; Ybarra 2016) where trialists ensured that messages did not refer to the recipient's name, their health status, or the name of the medication; encouraged recipients to delete messages; and gave them information about privacy settings on their phones.</s></p><p xml:id="_tv2JphM"><s xml:id="_nb3KMuv">Other barriers identified in our synthesis were created by language problems, low literacy, or limited techno-literacy.</s><s xml:id="_UFnbMM2">At least a third of the trials made no reference to these issues.</s><s xml:id="_DUkFXc4">Another third actively excluded people who did not speak one or two mainstream languages, and several trials also excluded people who could not read these languages or who were illiterate.</s><s xml:id="_ef9xbmf">Some trialists described efforts to overcome these problems, including designing text messages so that they scored low on readability scales ( Bigna 2014; Stockwell 2014); offering text messages in the local language (Kassaye 2016); or sending voice messages or pictorial messages instead of text messages (de Costa 2012; Smith 2015).</s></p><p xml:id="_fhn3cQC"><s xml:id="_hjxJjqD">Our synthesis also found that people's trust in and perceptions of the information they received was influenced by their perceptions of the sender.</s><s xml:id="_zEkRVfS">Attempts to address this issue were rarely described by trialists.</s><s xml:id="_MteCrcy">Exceptions included a UK-based trial, Cooper 2015, that highlighted in advertising materials that the intervention was supported by the National Health Service (NHS) (Emery 2018); and a USA-based trial (Bull 2016), where messages were linked to celebrities that the target audience said were most interesting to them (Devine 2014).</s></p><p xml:id="_93t2nqj"><s xml:id="_8DjfuDp">The final issue we assessed in our matrix was the extent to which the target group had been given an opportunity to offer feedback about their needs, preferences, and experiences regarding the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_T9mHumK">More than half of the trialists described collecting user</s></p></div>
