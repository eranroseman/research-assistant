develop, and improve the ReadySetGoals application, a gamified mobile application aimed at supporting therapy within youth addiction care.</s><s xml:id="_bBHgWYy">The overall process involved four key stages in which various formative research methods were utilised with 53 participants from varying backgrounds (professional game designers, therapists etc.).</s><s xml:id="_gnGD6xF">These stages include identifying the transfer effect, investigating the real-world context, creating a core game loop and iterative development and testing, first with general users and then with the targeted audience and care staff.</s><s xml:id="_WysEWDM">Afterwards, we implemented the improved ReadySetGoals gamification as a module within a therapy support application called "Luca" which is not only used in youth addiction care but also in youth mental healthcare.</s></p><p xml:id="_CQCK6ts"><s xml:id="_3twf6Ru">The overall design process provided several valuable lessons and reflections for designing mental healthcare gamifications.</s><s xml:id="_W8yWVPn">This includes the value of user-centred design approaches to incorporate stakeholder feedback throughout the design process and aligning user expectations through framing.</s><s xml:id="_YEMCwvG">The Research through Design methodology was particularly useful in this regard with the various artefacts and prototypes at each iterative stage serving both to generate situated design knowledge as well as to align stakeholder expectations.</s><s xml:id="_Gku7Ht7">In addition, we also discussed how the interactions between the game world and the real world could cause difficulty in gameplay design, especially when realworld elements are incorporated with traditional game mechanics.</s></p><p xml:id="_Mux2VmQ"><s xml:id="_rzxkaCv">Usage of new eHealth by therapists is essential to successfully conduct an evaluation study on eHealth outcomes and adoption of eHealth by therapists is essential for future successful implementation of eHealth in a healthcare system.</s><s xml:id="_cpSWUNQ">Even though we trained therapists in the use of the Luca app and gamification and we reminded them of the study, there are some lessons to be learned from the therapists that were interviewed.</s><s xml:id="_rH6GhUz">Firstly, therapists need to be better informed about the beneficial effect of gamification and the fittingness of gamification with individual users.</s><s xml:id="_UGe99vH">Therapists that participated in the interviews thought that gamification would be more motivating for younger adolescent patients compared to older ones.</s><s xml:id="_D7zjK8w">However, they do not know for certain if this is actually the case.</s><s xml:id="_ksmMKUG">Since therapists are fairly cautious in applying new tools in therapy, as they do not always see the benefits, the gamification should be designed in such a way that it is flexible and allows for a return to a non-gamified intervention if players do not find it motivating.</s><s xml:id="_jvhqCKv">We expect that this will make therapists less cautious in applying gamification in therapeutic practice with a variety of patients, as they can always go back to a "normal" non-gamified version.</s><s xml:id="_43UgE65">In addition, it is important to manage the stakeholder expectations of eHealth by informing therapists in detail about the fittingness of eHealth with face-to-face practice.</s><s xml:id="_XuPvT4Z">For example, the fact that eHealth is not a copy-paste of the therapy protocol but supports general assignments and tasks of CBT that a patient can execute outside a therapy room.</s><s xml:id="_mXsWnqT">Lastly, therapists need to know when eHealth and gamification can be applied in the therapeutic process.</s><s xml:id="_cNBaZnD">For example, therapists thought that eHealth and gamification distorted the therapeutic alliance and wanted to enhance the motivation of patients for behavioural change themselves, before applying eHealth and gamification.</s><s xml:id="_zbYa36V">Therefore, it is important to explicitly allow therapists the freedom to apply eHealth and gamification when they think it is most suitable in a design process, so that it does not distort the therapeutic alliance.</s><s xml:id="_XYVFgxh">Even though this may conflict with a study set-up, it will enhance future adoption and the influx of new participants in an evaluation study.</s></p><p xml:id="_uN3twNN"><s xml:id="_h3DUxTd">One of the limitations of this study is that the used research methods were mainly generative or formative in nature.</s><s xml:id="_4ejmuUU">Although these methods are essential in providing answers to the questions encountered during the development of the gamification, more research is needed to properly evaluate the effectiveness of the desired transfer effect of ReadySetGoals (see <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_SNCUwh9">In particular, a key disadvantage of the Research through Design approach is the blurring of the overall transfer effect.</s><s xml:id="_Rw73Wnb">For example, would the factors found in this design stage that make the game more entertaining also make the overall gamification more effective health-wise?</s><s xml:id="_GxsXEq6">In the future, experimental studies need to be carried out to compare the effectiveness of a gamification integrated in a therapeutic approach as opposed to regular therapy.</s><s xml:id="_ZnqcGkQ">Another limitation is that the presented case study focuses on a specific therapeutic domain, i.e. youth mental health and addiction treatment health care, and treatment type, i.e.</s><s xml:id="_zZ235PP">Cognitive Behavioural Therapy.</s><s xml:id="_Nc2yqGC">To develop a generalisable framework, the sequential design stages need to be tested with gamifications designed for other therapeutic domains and treatment types.</s></p><p xml:id="_TKmTTbs"><s xml:id="_AgqWgYE">The key contribution of this paper is to provide more knowledge about designing gamifications for the mental healthcare domain.</s><s xml:id="_6QYb9X3">A detailed description of the structural process used to develop the ReadySetGoals application as well as the reflected learnings of gamification design in this context are provided.</s><s xml:id="_xSCdyeK">In addition, case-specific examples of the various methods used to address the challenges encountered at each stage of the design process are also provided to add more bottom-up knowledge to this domain.</s><s xml:id="_XEnut9x">In the future, the structural design processes employed in this study can be used as the basis for the development of a generic framework for gamification in mental healthcare.</s></p></div>
