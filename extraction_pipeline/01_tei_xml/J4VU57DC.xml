are on their physical health.</s><s xml:id="_mzwwPt4">Stress is an enduring aspect of everyday life and one of the critical determinants of mental health.</s><s xml:id="_fw7jAqK">Thus, an accurate understanding of the daily behaviors associated with stress is central to mental health management.</s><s xml:id="_6pjNDSr">The advent of personal informatics (PI) systems has enabled users to capture and analyze data about their personal behaviors that might affect mental health (e.g., stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>, mood <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">54]</ref>, depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">51]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_Bzzsecp">PI researchers have also strived to help individuals accurately assess daily stress from physiological signals, smartphone application usage patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">55]</ref>, social media logs <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>, and even from the users' self-reported data <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fkSvawY">Due to the subjective nature of stress, which involves highly personal, social, and environmental factors, it is particularly important to engage individuals in the form of self-experimentation-an iterative PI procedure of personal data collection and reflection-to gain meaningful self-insight <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref> and create personalized behavior-change plans to mitigate stress <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_NNey2dk"><s xml:id="_KHg4fHv">However, most prior PI systems have been past-centric in nature, addressing the retrospective aspects of data collection and analysis.</s><s xml:id="_qvvC6WF">Relatively few studies have examined methods for helping users engage in prospective and proactive approaches, such as anticipating events to help them generate actionable and remedial plans to improve mood or health conditions.</s><s xml:id="_mgQt2NF">Recent studies have found that presenting users with future forecasts based on their past data (e.g., mood <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>, weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>) positively influenced motivation for behavioral change.</s><s xml:id="_p8QhJWq">Thus, it is worth investigating how the aspect of future could be incorporated into the design of PI systems.</s><s xml:id="_DQQyUSw">In this work, we examine how anticipation, a future-centric self-tracking practice, affects users' daily stress in the near future.</s></p><p xml:id="_pt6zXZk"><s xml:id="_wxVp5gW">Anticipation-an ability to imagine negative or positive future events-is associated with psychological well-being.</s><s xml:id="_QkfSfTm">Greve et al. present that the anticipation of emotional outcomes provides the opportunity to avoid risks, to recognize opportunities in time, and to adapt behavioral strategies accordingly <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NnHewEg">Anticipation is comprised of two key elementsimagining concrete future scenarios (i.e.</s><s xml:id="_CdpDBrV">expectations) and preparing ways to navigate any challenges they present (i.e.</s><s xml:id="_hE3hr3c">preparations)-, both of which are significant factors in constructing coping planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, a psychological concept in the domain of health behavior change.</s><s xml:id="_65DC3VP">Coping planning is also known as a self-regulatory strategy that involves the anticipation of barriers and ways to overcome them.</s><s xml:id="_fXxUS6H">Regarding this concept, having concrete anticipation criteria, instead of mere suppositions or fantasies, is the key to behavioral change <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_A7EUEmX"><s xml:id="_fVVmubh">To exploit the benefits of anticipation and thereby mitigate stress, we designed MindForecaster (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>), which allows users to anticipate stressful events in advance, prepare personalized intervention plans to deal with the stress, and evaluate actual stress levels compared to previously estimated stress levels.</s><s xml:id="_BaUrjaP">Incorporating the concept of coping planning <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>, MindForecaster asks participants to predict the level of stress associated with a specific scheduled event and to create a remedy plan if negative experiences are expected, through the use of a smartphone's calendar.</s></p><p xml:id="_kCPTz6e"><s xml:id="_kkvJ3at">We conducted a four-week field deployment with 47 participants comparing the complete version of MindForecaster (i.e., allowing full processes of anticipation), with a basic version of the system excluding the creation and execution of interventions, to address the following questions:</s></p><p xml:id="_j3XChYR"><s xml:id="_6n5Ed3k">• Stress and resilience: Does MindForecaster actually reduce stress?</s><s xml:id="_7MXx8Vw">If so, what is the underlying mechanism for achieving stress reduction?</s></p><p xml:id="_wwJgqkj"><s xml:id="_AsNFAAc">• Anticipation: Which components of anticipation (expectation and/or preparation) affect stress reduction?</s><s xml:id="_JegsYbF">In particular, does intervention reduce stress more than non-intervention?</s></p><p xml:id="_h2Sq3y5"><s xml:id="_fAuY84X">Our results indicate that the experiencing the entire procedure of anticipation from stress prediction to intervention execution can lead to more effective stress reduction.</s><s xml:id="_gNNUdWs">Our statistical analysis shows that the effectiveness of anticipation alone or intervention planning without execution is limited.</s><s xml:id="_tWnZAby">By employing MindForecaster's specific features (e.g., scheduling interventions on a specific time and sharing interventions with fellow participants), participants were able to prepare for the anticipated stress by generating a variety of problem-focused and emotion-focused coping plans.</s></p><p xml:id="_2bXGrjH"><s xml:id="_3d76z9d">This paper concretely makes the following threefold contribution to the research in this area:</s></p><p xml:id="_U3M5FcK"><s xml:id="_BHWmxC5">• We developed MindForecaster, a digital tool that helps users anticipate stress in their upcoming schedule and manage it by preparing personalized (i.e., "Self" mode), systemrecommended i.e., "System" mode), and shared by fellows participants (i.e., "Peers" mode) interventions based on theoretical frameworks;</s></p><p xml:id="_AHUrf8e"><s xml:id="_n4e8yVD">• We validated the effectiveness and usefulness of MindForecaster on stress reductions and resilience, through usage logs, questionnaires, and interviews from a four-week field study with forty-seven participants; and</s></p><p xml:id="_ZVKtsTZ"><s xml:id="_3xceBjP">• proposed implications for designing future-centric PI systems that incorporate the properties of anticipation, which is the opposite to existing past-centric PIs to address mentalhealth-related challenges, especially daily stress management.</s><s xml:id="_9HP3qVq">This could guide future research on anticipation (i.e., coping planning) in the course of health behaviour
