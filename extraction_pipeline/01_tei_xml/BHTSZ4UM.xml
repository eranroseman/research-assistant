and outcomes are measurable.</s><s xml:id="_TfUzkEX">While this was a working assumption, we were mindful that the meta-analytic process itself would yield valuable information about the validity of this assumption through both indices of heterogeneity and the results of subgroup analysis.</s></p><p xml:id="_EyQG6bp"><s xml:id="_akNChd2">We hypothesised that SMS messaging would have a small to medium effect on overall health behaviour change because the majority of individual studies and reviews have found such effects, especially when interventions comprised SMS messages alone.</s><s xml:id="_42eQGw8">Given our more rigorous inclusion criteria, we thought that a small effect size was more likely than a medium effect.</s><s xml:id="_S6VtnAn">Research findings concerning the efficacy of SMS messages to enhance healthy behaviour informed our choice of moderators.</s><s xml:id="_dSzDQxC">The evidence for SMS dose effects is mixed, with some interventions finding benefits of high dose (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">Franklin, Waller, Pagliari, &amp;
