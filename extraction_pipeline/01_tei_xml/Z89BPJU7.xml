(2018)</ref> has more recently developed a set of "practical considerations for scaling digital health initiatives in LMICs" (e.g., program characteristics, human and technical factors, ecosystems <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_uPnCuaw">A major limitation is that these extant guidelines neither provide specific guidance regarding the detailed nuances involved with selecting and developing text messaging for HBC nor do they present "short message service" (SMS; text messaging) as a single mHealth technology of choice.</s><s xml:id="_CKvmNCm">SMS is generally a widereaching, accessible, affordable, and popular mHealth methodology and may be best fit in various interventiondelivery scenarios for enhancing the reach and effectiveness of HBC programs in LMICs.</s></p></div>

programming framework System architecture and programming frameworks are helpful for SMS implementation planning as they can guide researchers in determining different parameters for the way messages should be sent to participants.</s><s xml:id="_McK9fHx">A message architecture specifies aspects such as the message types (e.g., texts sent to prepare participants for the program, texts sent to remind participants of the upcoming session, texts sent after intervention sessions to reinforce content), timing and scheduling of message delivery, the volume of messages, personalization and any other advanced programming or logic considerations.</s><s xml:id="_N3BTHmf">These frameworks should be broadly robust (i.e., applicable across different users, sites, and adaptable to idiosyncratic disruptions such as different schedules for different groups) and not produce additional barriers to access (e.g., not sending messages at inconvenient times, not sending an overwhelming number of messages), The first SMS system decision researchers should make is whether it should function as a two-way or one-way messaging program.</s><s xml:id="_3xcMeGf">In two-way systems, participants not only receive program messaging to their mobile devices, but they are supported to text back questions and receive individual attention and responses from program staff assigned to monitor the system (e.g., CHWs) or advanced chatbots (automated systems that generate replies, often based on keyword content).</s><s xml:id="_KEETP9C">One-way SMS systems only support communications to be sent to participants; participants may text into the program, but in a one-way system, inbound communications are not monitored in real time (or at all) and participants would generally receive no replies to their text messages.</s><s xml:id="_N2FFeHj">Deciding upon implementing a two-way vs. one-way system involves discussion around both pragmatism (e.g., does the project have the available resources and staff to support consistent two-way monitoring and replies?) and need (e.g., does the population and behavior require ongoing interactive support to achieve targeted outcomes?).</s></p><p xml:id="_GPXJdQx"><s xml:id="_UKWDSVJ">Attrition and retention are key indicators of the system's implementational success, and conceptualization and measurement of these outcomes may differ depending on system architecture -specifically, whether a oneway or two-way system is built.</s><s xml:id="_eCs7PEA">For both types of systems, if a "STOP" command is built in (i.e., a participant can reply "STOP" at any time to leave the SMS program), tracking the number of participants who opt out is one metric for attrition.</s><s xml:id="_8VveRKE">Regarding retention, most SMS systems will allow researchers to identify if participants are successfully receiving SMS messages to their phones.</s><s xml:id="_AtDwjNh">For one-way systems, retention can be measured over time by tracking how many messages are successfully delivered between and within individual participants.</s><s xml:id="_qPEdzqy">For two-way systems that generally elicit dialogue between a coach and participant or require the participant to reply to particular messages, participant responses can be tracked as a measure of retention.</s><s xml:id="_taBkY4N">Overall, to mitigate attrition and support retention with the SMS system, a research team member (e.g., a CHW) should be tasked with reaching out to participants who are either not receiving their SMS messages or not responding as requested.</s><s xml:id="_yJSYwvA">In some cases technical assistance may be necessary (see "Developing training and technical assistance frameworks" section below).</s></p><p xml:id="_EEfa3rC"><s xml:id="_3hhbyT4">As a general rule of thumb when considering system architecture, researchers must ensure potential participants will find the SMS system's programming logic (i.e., timing, volume of SMS) to be culturally appropriate to their needs and preferences.</s><s xml:id="_rkVDQ3W">One way to ensure system architecture matches the target population's preferences is to seek the help of a community advisory board (CAB) made up of multiple stakeholders from the target community (e.g., local residents and community leaders) who can assist researchers by making system programming recommendations regarding timing and frequency that would be acceptable to target participants <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_M4rGDzn">Feedback from the research team and from the CAB should also be sought out to make decisions on the different types of messages that will be sent.</s></p><p xml:id="_2MrHMCe"><s xml:id="_P2Rbw9T">Researchers should also consider specific requirements of the intervention program that the SMS system is designed to support in terms of "types" of messages and timing.</s><s xml:id="_xaGBz8C">For example, is it sufficient to send messages from a single bank of messages (i.e., a single type) on a consistent schedule over time (e.g., 2 weekly messages from the bank for 8 weeks)?</s><s xml:id="_fyQAjA2">Alternatively, some intervention programs may require different types of messages to be sent at different times and at different frequencies (e.g., there may be messages that need to be sent in the early phase of the program that are different from messages that need to be sent at a later phase and/or messages may need to be sent more frequently initially and then taper).</s><s xml:id="_5aBQFt7">Based on these kinds of considerations, the types of messages and the schedule may be quite simple or very complex to design.</s><s xml:id="_Aq7ecQh">Researchers should also consider the possibility of potential schedule disruptions and how any time-based message system will adapt to those scenarios.</s></p><p xml:id="_sfcTWuZ"><s xml:id="_aEc9U4K">In many LMIC contexts, program participants may be close friends, neighbors, or family members living within the same household or community-and participants may share their individual text messages with others.</s><s xml:id="_uUFmYKt">This prompts another level of consideration of the system's architecture -the degree of personalization integrated into SMS logic and content (e.g., including participants' names, tailoring content to individuals' data).</s><s xml:id="_kb3jFub">With close cross-participant interaction in mind, messages may be more impactful if some elements of personalization are adopted, which may enhance participants' internalized feelings of program "fit", commitment, and engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_RZ8pb8r">For SMS programs that intend for all participants to receive the same "dosage" and library of messages, however, it may be necessary to avoid personalization strategies that would result in differential treatment (e.g., participants receiving different numbers of messages, or messages with different content).</s></p><p xml:id="_HhDVYqE"><s xml:id="_zA98BHM">Researchers may choose to adopt an SMS framework that incorporates an individualized "tailoring" process.</s><s xml:id="_merX2dw">This

program that is "personalized" for them <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_V3zzwGt">Text messages sent to individual participants can include tailored data that is housed in the SMS system's backend, such as participant name, their specific behavioral goals and program progress, and other ongoing tracking or monitoring information such as step counts or weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9YGtpJv">It is not always feasible, however, to integrate personalized information like this into message programming (e.g., due to financial constraints for building this level of technology, staffing constraints in finding time to update such data).</s><s xml:id="_5cbCprd">In this case, researchers can still develop a framework that mimics a tailoring process for close-knit participants.</s><s xml:id="_a8BRfcc">For example, a simple randomization programming scheme can make the order of all SMS message receipts different for each participant.</s><s xml:id="_ktCk8Se">In this approach, participants still receive equivalent treatment (in content and 'dose' of SMS), as all participants receive the same messages (and hence the same level of exposure to intervention content); but in this programming scheme, messages can be delivered in random orders and at random times within segmented parts of the days that make the participant SMS experience feel less homogenous, specifically in the event they share their messages with another participant.</s></p></div>
