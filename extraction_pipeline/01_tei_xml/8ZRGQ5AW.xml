4] elicit stronger and more far-reaching emotional responses than positive events <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WqkFeGM">In fact, social media <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> or other forms of many-to-many communication systems, seems to accelerate the transfer of emotions between users and can elicit collective emotions as well <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, leading to a collective experience of a discrete emotion [e.g., anger <ref type="bibr">; 21]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_UTTGgdv"><s xml:id="_bQb6HDj">Regarding the present study, we decided to focus on one discrete emotion, namely anxiety.</s><s xml:id="_5c7sCvF">Anxiety is an individual's physio-psychological reaction to specific stimuli (threat) from the external environment and acts as a precursor of distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> and general ill-being when experienced over longer periods.</s><s xml:id="_FxFaQct">And although anxiety is one of four discrete crisis emotions, anxiety serves as the default emotion in crises, regardless of crisis type <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8hYXTpm">Thus, when faced with "an imminent, specific and overpowering threat" <ref type="bibr">[15: 3]</ref> such as the consequences of an organizational crisis, individuals experience anxiety and begin to search for and implement quick crisis resolutions to reduce the experienced anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Aj2NDzv">We argue that the public is most likely to experience anxiety in any case, given the initial uncertainty on how to cope with the crisis and how the organization might continue to manage and react to the fallout of the crisis <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Rc2pJxf">Hence, we would expect that the perceived anxiety in organizations' crisis response communications (e.g., a respective, crisis-relevant post from the organization on social media) is positively associated with public anxiety, as expressed in public interactions with the organization (e.g., comments in response to an organization's crisis communication).</s><s xml:id="_Zr7tNmE">We hypothesize the following:</s></p><p xml:id="_VPHD3Gq"><s xml:id="_ZX22AFP">H1: Perceived organizational anxiety is positively related to the public's experienced anxiety.</s></p></div>
