United Kingdom and experience menopausal symptoms (eg, hot flushes, disturbed sleep, depression, and cognitive dysfunction) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref> that can contribute to job dissatisfaction and decreased commitment to work <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8qe9M9v">The impact can be bidirectional, with symptoms such as poor concentration, poor memory, and sickness absence impairing job performance <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and the workplace exacerbating menopausal symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3TWeGcM">Moreover, an individual's health-related quality of life in midlife is influenced by many additional nonmenopausal factors such as lifestyle, physical activity (PA), and social integration <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_geE6pVF">Evidence suggests that midlife for women represents a critical window for preventing chronic disease and optimizing health and functioning, whereas it is increasingly recognized that a healthy lifestyle may mitigate such health risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ePUpY4q">Improvements in diet, PA, and lifestyle can provide an effective intervention to manage menopause symptoms, improve health-related quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, and reduce menopause-related health risks <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref> (eg, neurodegenerative diseases, particularly Alzheimer disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>, and increased cardiovascular disease risk <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, low bone-mineral density, fractures, and osteoporosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>).</s></p><p xml:id="_EGPGKGj"><s xml:id="_UEGdSNJ">Behavior change interventions (BCIs) aimed at promoting population-level participation in key behaviors have been widely applied in the general population <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and, to some degree, also in midlife women <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_UCgy5VD">Women in midlife are willing to make positive health behavior changes but need support (eg, social connectivity <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>) for those changes to be effective <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8ZHWkgS">However, changing established behavior patterns can be challenging as it requires addressing a strong psychological, environmental, or social gradient <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_AymhpX8">BCIs are typically complex and involve many interacting components and, therefore, a theoretical understanding of how the intervention causes behavior change is needed to strengthen the effects of BCI on clinical outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_jAea4tZ">A recent scoping review <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> identified limitations in describing PA interventions in midlife women, with only 59% of the 51 studies specifying an underlying theoretical model.</s><s xml:id="_u8bvmGt">Many studies provided a limited description of how behavior change techniques (BCTs) were activated to achieve desired outcomes and provided limited insight into how the BCTs were received by midlife women <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zPjxDav">As a result, interpreting designs and evaluations of complex interventions can be challenging without sufficient description of key intervention content <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> and, therefore, characterizing interventions by BCTs can be insightful in understanding the effectiveness of interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_TnVbCSf"><s xml:id="_3GRV2TP">The use of psychological theory in the development of BCIs (including digital BCIs) is associated with greater intervention effects <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hYGhcj9">Although there is a wide range of theoretical models of behavior (eg, the theory of planned behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and the Health Belief Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>), health-promoting interventions that are based on a single theory have generally been shown to be more effective in changing behavioral intentions than actual behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qZNhFB7">Therefore, integrated theories have been proposed to overcome this limitation by drawing their hypotheses from several different theories with the aim of providing a more comprehensive explanation of behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_4u36DTM">Theoretical frameworks such as the Theoretical Domains Framework (TDF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> integrate insights of multiple behavioral theories to identify relevant constructs that may be implicated in various health behaviors.</s><s xml:id="_KrBAzmv">Together with the capability, opportunity, and motivation-behavior (COM-B) model <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> that aims to identify the sources of target behavior, they form the behavior change wheel (BCW) framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_kBBheF4">The BCW framework provides a systematic and theoretical basis for understanding and changing behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_nsvEJrF">It has been used extensively to develop and evaluate the implementation of interventions in health care settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and lifestyle (eg, smoking cessation <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref>, alcohol use prevention <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, sedentary behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>, PA <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[40]</ref>, and dietary patterns <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>) but also in other areas such as personal transportation habits <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_efvFsXv"><s xml:id="_mMhSueE">Behavioral interventions to promote PA in midlife women have been traditionally delivered face-to-face or in group settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_nwnafXW">However, the use of digital technology to change health behaviors has increased exponentially in recent decades, primarily after the introduction of smartphones in 2009 <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_57EuCVb">Moreover, digital health technology (ie, apps, wearables, and websites) has the potential to increase scalability through broader user reach <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref> throughout the day, improve intervention effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, and achieve greater cost-efficiency <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b45">46]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_V7dgRuc">Indeed, digital health interventions (DHIs) are both feasible <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref> and acceptable among midlife women <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_TYc29Tq">Digital health technologies (including therapeutic interventions, online support communities, and web-based consultations) can provide important means for midlife women to obtain evidence-based menopause-related health information and recommendations, social and health practitioner support, and symptom tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>.</s></p></div>
