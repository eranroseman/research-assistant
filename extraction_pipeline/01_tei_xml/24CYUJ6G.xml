Toms define engagement as a quality of users' experiences with technology; they identify dimensions of challenge, aesthetic and sensory appeal, feedback, novelty, interactivity, perceived control and time, awareness, motivation, interest, and affect. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref></s><s xml:id="_2Y3pEZC">Other researchers approach DBCIs as a specific method of delivering health interventions, viewing engagement with DBCIs as similar to engagement with face to face interventions.</s><s xml:id="_7cgFzaT">This approach focuses on users' engagement with the process of achieving positive cognitive, emotional, behavioral and physiological change.</s><s xml:id="_YGw2MVm">It draws on evidence-based therapeutic principles (such as cognitivebehavioral therapy), existing behavioral theories (such as social cognitive models) and research on broader engagement processes (such as the therapeutic alliance and social support).</s><s xml:id="_EkCMEgF">For example, key design features of DBCIs identified by Morrison et al. include social context and support, contacts with the intervention, tailoring, and self-management. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s xml:id="_ckJjHZW">derstand and analyze the relationship between engagement with technology and behavior change it may be helpful to distinguish between the 'micro' level of moment-tomoment engagement with the intervention and the 'macro' level of engagement and identification with the wider intervention goals, while appreciating that these are intimately linked.</s><s xml:id="_tUf6HZg">Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref> illustrates how engagement with the DBCI and the behavioral goals of the intervention may vary over time.</s><s xml:id="_EQjD7TD">Engagement is a dynamic process that typically starts with a trigger (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_9bpCFEA">recommendation by health professional or peers), followed by initial use, which may be followed by sustained engagement, disengagement or shifting to a different intervention.</s><s xml:id="_qk96d4c">The timing of and relationship between the different forms of engagement will vary depending on the intervention, the user and their context.</s><s xml:id="_4nQeKx6">Some engagement models attempt to encompass the full range of factors that may influence engagement with both the digital technology and the health-related behavior change.</s><s xml:id="_8JqNgv6">For example, the Behavioral Intervention Technology model <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref> builds on and integrates several other relevant models, <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> providing a framework for articulating the relationship between the behavioral intervention aims, elements, characteristics, and workflow and the technological methods of implementing the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_9HxETyF">New interdisciplinary models of engagement are emerging but are largely untested; consequently, their validity is not yet established.</s><s xml:id="_tWHycRh">Some authors have used literature review to identify retrospectively which factors are associated with success of DBCIs, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> but the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn is limited by the correlational nature of the evidence and incomplete descriptions of the interventions.</s></p><p xml:id="_kMDj45W"><s xml:id="_KBDWK9R">Establishing which elements of these models are most influential on engagement is therefore a key research priority, and new theoretical frameworks and models may need to be developed (as discussed elsewhere in this issue). <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s xml:id="_haE54Vd">Taxonomies of features specific to DBCIs (such as digital delivery methods 10 ) may prove useful for this purpose; for example, taxonomies have helped to clarify what types of supplementary support are associated with positive DBCI outcomes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> what features of computerized clinical decision support systems are effective, <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> and the importance of feedback in weight management DBCIs. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s xml:id="_FnYurMP">engagement is also supported, undermined or shaped by socio-contextual influences, such as the role played by family members and the broader cultural setting.</s><s xml:id="_UVwBk73">Comprehensive models of engagement need to encompass not only individual-level user dimensions but also the effectspositive and negativeof social dimensions.</s><s xml:id="_wuA3E6Q">For example, technologies can harness social support by sharing behavioral tracking and/or promoting encouragement from peers, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> but some users may be less likely to commit to behavioral goals if they will be publicly shared. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s xml:id="_dUF6BN8">cial implication of explicitly recognizing the distinction between engagement with the technological and the behavioral aspects of the intervention is that intervention usage alone cannot be taken as a valid indicator of engagement.</s><s xml:id="_UZr5Tjg">In the absence of agreed definitions and well-validated theoretical models of engagement, much previous research has operationalized engagement as the extent to which people use the digital intervention as intended, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> on the assumption that usage is closely related to outcome.</s><s xml:id="_WnmzuCG">There are several problems with this assumption.</s><s xml:id="_z83MB5F">Firstly, the evidence that usage is associated with intended outcomes is mixed, and largely correlational. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref></s><s xml:id="_b5gzV2k">2]<ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> It is difficult to determine to what extent usage mediates behavioral and health-related outcomes, as this may be confounded by common factors such as higher motivation and self-regulation skills.</s><s xml:id="_a2VkxFH">Usage metrics also reveal little about offline engagement with intervention content, which is important in interventions that require homework outside the context of the digital intervention.</s><s xml:id="_utqugNa">A further complication is that cessation of usage could indicate disengagement from an intervention, or could signal sufficient mastery that continued access to the digital technology is no longer needed (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_3Q2s6G9">Continued engagement might indicate positive, healthy engagement with the intervention content or, conversely, dependence on the guidance or feedback, and thus a lack of successful self-regulation.</s><s xml:id="_mnF8ukf">Rather than focus on 'engagement', it would be beneficial to focus on 'effective' engagement that mediates positive outcomes; this may or may not require sustained engagement.</s><s xml:id="_nKKzhSk">Effective engagement is thus defined in relation to the purpose of a particular intervention, and can only be established empirically, in the context of that intervention.</s><s xml:id="_nXEZcMM">A further consideration is that users may value different outcomes from those intended by designers; <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> for example, a DBCI may not achieve behavior change but may provide valued information, reassurance or opportunities for interaction.</s></p><p xml:id="_WVjRQva"><s xml:id="_khSwsrR">In summary, a key research challenge is to conceptualize engagement more consistently, comprehensively and dynamically, taking into account user experiences of the technology and the social and therapeutic context.</s><s xml:id="_CwWWa9v">The next step is not simply to propose but to test and validate models of effective engagement by demonstrating which elements of these models positively influence different aspects of engagement and mediate outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_3ZK3EMt">The following section explains how the multidimensional nature of effective engagement can be captured by using complementary methods of assessment.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_HwZCh7P">Evaluating Engagement</head><p xml:id="_yV8hjGn"><s xml:id="_w5VtM7Y">A range of methods is available to measure effective engagement (see Table <ref type="table">1</ref>) that offer complementary insights into different dimensions of engagement, and can be used at different stages of intervention development, evaluation, and implementation.</s><s xml:id="_bvrkWWh">These include reports of the subjective user experience, elicited by qualitative methods or questionnaires, and objective measures of technology usage, user behavior, and users' reactions to the intervention.</s></p><p xml:id="_zS6442M"><s xml:id="_FeH5txe">In-depth qualitative analyses of user experiences can capture critical information about how a user reacts to the content and design of DBCIs and offer explanations for why the user interacts with a DBCI in particular ways.</s><s xml:id="_DFhyvRs">These data enable researchers to explain objective usage patterns more reliably and generate hypotheses about the factors influencing effective engagement that can be tested using other methods.</s><s xml:id="_2fCwyuh">Qualitative analyses can capture critical information about offline behavior (particularly engagement with the behavioral target of the intervention) and the wider social and contextual influences on engagement. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref></s><s xml:id="_BbA7sBU">Qualitative methods can also reveal aspects of engagement with the technology that may not be captured by quantitative usage datasuch as "lurking," a common phenomenon whereby users read and may benefit from the content in online social communities but do not actively interact with the digital intervention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s xml:id="_msTQeN3">Typical qualitative methods include focus groups, interviews, observation of user interaction with the

the increasing reliance on participant involvement in DBCI design, it is vital that research clarifies what users are able to report accurately.</s><s xml:id="_TVXEqxp">For example, users can usually identify aspects of a DBCI that they dislike or describe their views and behavior, but few users can prospectively anticipate factors that will encourage effective engagement with DBCI content or retrospectively recall their reasons for engagement or disengagement.</s></p><p xml:id="_bUecqq7"><s xml:id="_EX8MVeM">Self-report questionnaires can also measure dimensions of engagement (including off-line engagement) that cannot be assessed objectively.</s><s xml:id="_MrJU6Sa">Questionnaires to retrospectively assess engagement with DBCIs at selected time points are available. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref></s><s xml:id="_p7uYHpA">Alternatively, ecological momentary assessment (EMA) enables immediate, repeated measurement of users' experiences with interventions in-the-moment. <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30</ref></s><s xml:id="_XRwtPkd">A dilemma for self-reporting is to balance the need to measure all relevant dimensions of engagement with the response burden for users, which may also lead to measurement effects such as response shift and be an intervention in itself.</s><s xml:id="_YjpJ9gM">While a solution may be to develop validated instruments to measure
