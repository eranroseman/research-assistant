the dashboard, we are following a methodology the largely resembles the Learning Awareness Tools User eXperience (LATUX) workflow <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_RC9WxcF">Although that paper focuses mostly in the design and deployment of awareness tools in the classroom, the worflow applies in the case of targeting designers as it consists of an iterative process of five stages commonly found in software engineering and user experience approaches | problem definition, low-and higher-fidelity prototyping, pilot studies and validation in-thewild.</s></p><p xml:id="_tUbTjSq"><s xml:id="_TxPXH7u">Despite the fact that our focus of attention is e-book designers e.g.</s><s xml:id="_K38xfP5">rather than teachers, through our iterative design process it has become clear that we need to also pay attention to the pedagogical requirements behind the design of the tools as they have potential for classroom use by teachers.</s><s xml:id="_wUJkeKn">Nevertheless, in this paper, we focus on the design, prototyping and early pilot studies targeting our main stakeholders | tech savvy designers (but not necessarily developers) and authors of e-books.</s><s xml:id="_DCZ6BJU">The latter group are mostly teachers but are not necessarily the same teachers who end up using the resources.</s></p><p xml:id="_vxPXW4y"><s xml:id="_Dx7FnB2">In order to evaluate our work, we developed a framework that extends previous work <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> with criteria regarding usability and technical aspects.</s><s xml:id="_kQj7pQW">This paper focuses on our e orts to evaluate both the quality of the tools and the user experience vis-a-vis the requirements that emerged from earlier iterations through prototyping sessions.</s></p><p xml:id="_H3AnDTc"><s xml:id="_MfDA5T7">Before we present the prototype evaluation, we first describe below the set of usage scenarios for the e-books as specified by the CoIs in the project and the initial high-level requirements that were identified.</s></p><p xml:id="_TKyKFnf"><s xml:id="_W3hY8UG">In brief, we first need to take into account that digital resources like e-books are being used either directly in the classroom or in 'blended' learning scenarios (e.g. for practice exercises at home) or in a 'flipped' learning model where students read and interact with the e-book content online (e.g. at home) and complete other parts of the e-book in the classroom with the help of other students or the teacher.</s><s xml:id="_rYTkrCz">So, neither context can be excluded.</s></p><p xml:id="_MTaSS74"><s xml:id="_7hjkEFM">Based on the above usage scenario, in early stages of our design cycle we identified the process of analysing e-book interaction as having similar characteristics as exploratory data analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_xd7xUNW"><s xml:id="_ZhQRXvZ">We also identified the following high-level requirements.</s><s xml:id="_8PNxFZY">Designers should be able to: 1. utilise the service at any time and from anywhere without any restrictions and dependencies on technologies and platforms.</s></p><p xml:id="_hEZ9zCY"><s xml:id="_76jg2wv">2. retrieve, process and analyse data about any chosen period of an e-book's lifetime, which can be changed as one is working the dashboard.</s><s xml:id="_7RAM3nF">3. perform different types of analysis of the same data at different times throughout a session.</s><s xml:id="_hKNGxBg">4. analyse an e-book at different levels of granularity (book, page, widget, user). 5. go back in time and inspect past data (flashback operations).</s></p><p xml:id="_5zQW8vg"><s xml:id="_CcNT3ya">It is also worth clarifying that while, in principle, a dashboard like the one we are presenting here could be used by teachers to support their work in the classroom, our focus here is primarily authors (who could, of course, be teachers).</s><s xml:id="_JyzCaVK">For previous related work on dashboard for teachers we refer the reader to related work (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_jjr9swH"><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_s9YKHY9">So, an additional requirement is being able to monitor the usage of an ebook unit in real-time.</s><s xml:id="_9TSbuzX">In this paper, however, we are focusing on the use of the tool for reflection and redesign purposes.</s></p><p xml:id="_AVsWCNj"><s xml:id="_Squf9nf">Early iterations and feedback on low-fidelity prototypes from members of the CoIs helps us convert these requirements to a specification and eventually to a higherfidelity prototype that is the version we present in this paper.</s><s xml:id="_wZGk9MR">Section 7 presents in more detail the evaluation of this prototype with designers.</s></p></div>

transferable to other work in the area.</s></p><p xml:id="_V4gVgD5"><s xml:id="_skapWeN">Insight generation by zooming in and out.</s><s xml:id="_dRVD6Rp">We mentioned already that one of our expectations is to enable the generation of insights in relation to the usage of the ebooks and the widgets they contain.</s><s xml:id="_ysX2XQV">In general, all participants answered the questions that related to the use case scenario correctly and quickly developed an understanding of the way the e-book was used, the difficulties with one of the central pages and the 'playful' interaction of two of the students in particular.</s><s xml:id="_8DrjdMv">Looking into the way the system was used we identified the need for switching between page-and widget-level visualisations very often.</s><s xml:id="_xupSpxv">Thanks to the robust design of the system and the efficient data-handling this switching is seamless in terms of time.</s><s xml:id="_9ybgEsv">However, is seems that the switching process is rather demanding especially when looking into a complex pattern and when the insight that the user is developing requires them to scroll through multiple visualisations.</s><s xml:id="_YFUzFfE">This was cognitively demanding for some of the participants.</s></p><p xml:id="_fsQnC3P"><s xml:id="_cBSx3Hn">One approach to addressing this is to allow the user to pick the visualisations they are interested in seeing simultaneously.</s><s xml:id="_6YEQdUu">This can also help in comparisons between different historical versions of the e-book and a reflection on the modifications that are taking place.</s></p><p xml:id="_W6NV43B"><s xml:id="_8gK5gyH">Data granularity.</s><s xml:id="_7wWPdfy">Another issue brought up by the participants was the difficulty to identify patterns using the timeline visualisations at the widget level.</s><s xml:id="_yDvb3MU">The problem becomes noticeable when there are too many events of different types recorded for a short period of time.</s><s xml:id="_VyE2k3T">The solution, in this case, is to deselect the types that are not needed and perform the same analysis in a shorter period of time.</s><s xml:id="_cjdF2cP">That gives the ability to focus and distribute the data of interest more evenly in the available space.</s><s xml:id="_zfHajpZ">A useful suggestion given by one of the participants was the ability to select certain types and group them up.</s><s xml:id="_EystEhz">That would certainly make things less complicated in some cases without changing the required level of granularity.</s><s xml:id="_9cvYJJm">The ideal solution, of course, would be to employ algorithms for pattern recognition and identify these things automatically.</s><s xml:id="_bUhHXdx">In a fully automated solution we could perform this processing only for students that have achieved an acceptable result.</s><s xml:id="_2fNJTkg">That could also be detected in an automated fashion.</s><s xml:id="_5fZV8gv">Then, after the recognition of the patterns the system would be able to zoom in and present the data of interest at the optimum level of granularity.</s></p><p xml:id="_4T6FJDf"><s xml:id="_rR3Ag45">Context -from learning design to actual usage.</s><s xml:id="_Bcp3Dv2">Most of the participants are experienced educators and resource designers.</s><s xml:id="_r7AFmg4">Some, however, were challenged by not having been involved in the initial data-collection process.</s><s xml:id="_SknHWse">We anticipated that access to the original design discussions and the reflection documents would compensate the lack of context by providing a thorough description of the learning design decisions covering the objectives in relation to the specifics of the pages and the widgets that were used for the activities and the anticipated usage.</s><s xml:id="_pUb4ue7">However, what was missing was some record of the actual usage by the classroom teacher.</s><s xml:id="_4wYxp9K">As such, the system should be able to provide some support regarding the context of usage used by people that are not both designers/authors and teachers of the particular resources.</s></p><p xml:id="_StbK6pN"><s xml:id="_4gZZJ2C">Familiarisation and data literacy.</s><s xml:id="_VVnn9c9">As mentioned, the participants in our study had a minimal introduction to the tool (5 minutes) and a fixed amount of time to go through the guided walkthrough and questionnaire (40 minutes).</s><s xml:id="_Dy9BjZ2">We expected that because of their familiarity with the project that would suffice.</s><s xml:id="_aghub2W">While in general that was the case, we could not help observing that different participants reacted differently to some of the visualisations.</s><s xml:id="_VWSUATY">While we selected carefully the visualisations from the early low-fidelity prototype sessions, and despite the fact that most are commonly found in dashboards and normal descriptive statistical software, some familiarity with the exact information they provide is required.</s><s xml:id="_M2xsmw6">This is of course an issue of general data literacy and something that must be carefully taken into consideration in the future as we scale up the usage of the dashboard.</s><s xml:id="_ENMqRpJ">We observed that participants had to go through a phase of familiarisation with the potential usefulness of the visualisation in relationship with the data vis-a-vis the rest of the available metrics.</s><s xml:id="_4QHR5Rh">The availability of several visualisations led them sometimes to wonder where to focus their attention.</s><s xml:id="_rzTMnCJ">We believe that this is something that will be overcome with familiarity with the dashboard but a possible solution is also to allow the configuration of the available or preferable visualisations for each user.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head n="8" xml:id="_88a25yt">Conclusion</head><p xml:id="_txGRf27"><s xml:id="_vUWBut5">This paper presented the Reflective Designer Analytics Platform (RDAP) that helps learning material authors reflect on their designs and improve them so that they can meet their original objectives.</s><s xml:id="_4HMzZnu">A prototype was designed and tested with the MC Squared learning platform that utilises interactive e-books include dynamic widgets aimed at enhancing students' mathematical problem solving and creativity.</s><s xml:id="_QJ4pMHG">RDAP is designed to operate as a standalone, platform-independent application that communicates with partner systems through standardised interfaces and data formats.</s><s xml:id="_RWFNYNr">It features a highly efficient data management mechanism that enables incremental synchronisation of data and disconnected operation at the client side.</s><s xml:id="_uJApKwx">This eliminates server bottlenecks, prevents excessive network load, increases the analytical capacity of the tool and delivers the results through a highly responsive user interface.</s><s xml:id="_vQdN32s">A technical strength of the system is the seamless interoperability with other systems generating data as long as a standard format is used for data interchange in a looselycoupled fashion.</s></p><p xml:id="_FAGNhFK"><s xml:id="_Mt2gegy">In the case of the M C Square platform, by providing a tighter integration between the authoring, discussion and analytics tools, analysts have access to the original learning design decisions emerging from the online discussions of the authors as also represented from the configuration they have provided about what data is logged.</s><s xml:id="_MFUqtyz">The automatic tree structure representation of the design in the analytics dashboard is a particular strength in that it does not require technical intervention but uses the e-book representation to extract the meaningful information and present the design to the analyst.</s><s xml:id="_35ybftu">From an analytical viewpoint, the strong points of the system are the ability to analyse data from diverse and dissimilar widgets (learning activities), the ability to switch between different levels of specificity with ease (shallow, deep analysis).</s><s xml:id="_pFe4zqu">The latter is especially advantageous in exploratory data analysis.</s></p><p xml:id="_vRwJ8HB"><s xml:id="_xUMquqP">The system has been thoroughly tested and formally evaluated by designers in relation to its usability and analytic potential.</s><s xml:id="_WnvhM8f">The feedback we received is positive and feeds into discussions of new features and modifications.</s><s xml:id="_w4g2HTJ">Reflecting on the challenges that even experienced participants had indicates that we still need to pay attention to cognitive overload and therefore allowing the configuration of the dashboard according to users' preference seems to be important.</s><s xml:id="_2CMMJV9">Similarly, enabling historical comparisons should enable even reflecting on the evolution of the e-book usage and subsequent design changes.</s></p><p xml:id="_NUYwW9Y"><s xml:id="_XNFwCc8">As mentioned, our focus here has been on designers conducting retrospective data analysis but, technically, the system can be used for real time monitoring, and therefore we plan to extend it with appropriate visualisations to support teachers as well.</s><s xml:id="_U94HuA2">Finally, because of the extensibility of the system we can easily include new visualisations as and when they are needed and plan to include more advanced algorithms to help analysts identify important events or patterns that are worth exploring further.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1 :</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p xml:id="_RyatWD8"><s xml:id="_RE9C3QJ">Fig. 1: (a) Data Repository; (b) The Dashboard</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="5,112.37,508.12,274.32,86.55" type="bitmap" /></figure>
