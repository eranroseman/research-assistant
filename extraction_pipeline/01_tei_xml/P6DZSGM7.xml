39 studies.</s><s xml:id="_aDYYtDB">Three key findings emerged.</s><s xml:id="_G5F7gnX">First, the ICERs of most of the high-risk approaches were well below the range that is generally considered to be costeffective.</s><s xml:id="_Fhz5pEZ">Importantly, differences between delivery methods were small, and the group-delivered translational DPP provided by a combination of health professionals and trained lay health workers seemed most cost-effective.</s><s xml:id="_G48g85s">Our findings reinforced the fact that interventions to prevent T2D among highrisk individuals are highly cost-effective and practical in any given setting.</s><s xml:id="_RmACvGs">Second, implementing a population-wide SSB tax was CS and has the potential to benefit a large population.</s><s xml:id="_zeXcdFS">SSB taxation can be considered as an important population-based policy approach to prevent T2D globally.</s><s xml:id="_tkZanQH">Third, although there were many proposed populationbased interventions (including subsidies for fruits and vegetables, health promotion approaches, and environmental changes), the CE of these interventions needs further investigation with real-world data in order to draw a conclusion.</s></p><p xml:id="_7HqmRRv"><s xml:id="_9aGGMNa">Our findings for high-risk approaches are consistent with previous literature in that lifestyle programs utilizing the translational DPP curriculum are somewhat more cost-effective than lifestyle interventions that do not follow the DPP curriculum <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">(17)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KBzHPRY">The translational DPP lifestyle program is widely used in the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)-led National Diabetes Prevention Program (National DPP)da U.S. translational program providing a framework and infrastructure for targeting high-risk individuals, and this program is covered by several commercial and public insurers <ref type="bibr" target="#b64">(65)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_k3rKqej">For

xml:id="_XUYhSFc">Additionally, more rigorous studies are needed to assess the CE of virtually delivered programs.</s><s xml:id="_JRXGQm7">The results of our review also demonstrate great potential for populationbased interventions to prevent T2D (69).</s><s xml:id="_xk6bHYm">Among fiscal policies, taxing SSBs may be a better approach than subsidies for healthy foods for two main reasons: 1) tax policies generated better CE outcomes and 2) evidence supporting tax policies was stronger as multiple studies collectively reached a consistent conclusion.</s><s xml:id="_BbYDv9N">From a health care system perspective, SSB taxes would be CS.</s><s xml:id="_DNFbWET">The SSB tax would reduce SSB consumption at zero or little health intervention costs and would also reduce health care spending.</s><s xml:id="_uZ87sHX">The nine studies in our review showed how much health care costs would be saved from SSB taxation.</s><s xml:id="_csEpyTK">In addition, these studies showed that such an intervention would be CS or cost-effective from the governmental perspective.</s><s xml:id="_ePmT3VV">On the other hand, the ICERs of interventions to promote the consumption of fruits and vegetables ranged widely.</s><s xml:id="_TDy46Sm">These studies differed in features that would change the results, such as the targeted population (general population vs. participants in the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program [SNAP]), analytical time horizon (10 years vs. lifetime), and study perspective (governmental, health care system, or societal).</s><s

approaches did not conduct formal CEA.</s><s xml:id="_Qpggcce">As a result, the CS results from these studies needs to be better understood, as they were a simple comparison of costs given a certain level of health benefit.</s><s xml:id="_yhJWnWT">Also, many of the CE results were estimated from governmental or health care system perspectives rather than a societal perspective.</s><s xml:id="_ScznVyM">Third, the societal perspective defined in population-based approaches was not as inclusive as it was for highrisk approaches.</s><s xml:id="_N8TK5xm">Some cost categories were not
