messages can be framed differently (eg, positive or negatively framed) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>, and the messages can be short or long and generic or tailored <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xaHKmzN">As a result of these diverse implementations and designs, interventions might evoke different user responses, even though they use the same persuasive strategy.</s><s xml:id="_sEWf9FY">This renders it difficult to draw a conclusion about the effectiveness of the persuasive strategy at the theoretical level.</s></p><p xml:id="_rfSNVz8"><s xml:id="_wzeHcfm">Several studies have argued that design characteristics influence the effectiveness of the strategy, such as the use of different social media features <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> or the content of messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_euJuqGt">However, the technical implementation of these strategies has received little attention so far (eg, the device used or the accessibility of the strategy).</s><s xml:id="_4XasXh9">This is surprising, as technical implementation can influence user experience, usability, and intervention exposure, which, in turn, likely influences the effect of the intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_884RkCV">Thus far, only one review has examined whether both design characteristics and technical implementations could impact the effectiveness of digital exercise or dietary interventions on the persuasive strategy feedback <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_sskBSDq">A great variety in implementation forms of feedback was found, for instance, regarding the accessibility of feedback (continuous access or daily messages) and the form of feedback (visual or not).</s><s xml:id="_XsCcuYH">Moreover, the findings indicated that not all types of feedback were equally effective in changing PA behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9x4n4vM">Schembre et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> limited their study to feedback; however, other strategies likely face the same diversity in design characteristics and technical implementations.</s><s xml:id="_6zFSW8v">Therefore, this scoping review sets out to explore the designs and implementations of other promising persuasive strategies in mHealth PA interventions for adults and explores whether previous mHealth studies examined the influence of the different design characteristics and technical operationalizations of common persuasive strategies on the effectiveness of the intervention to persuade the user to engage in PA.</s><s xml:id="_k9VgSdY">As analyzing all strategies is beyond the scope of this study, the analysis is limited to the most common and evidence-based strategies for PA <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>, namely, monitoring, goal setting, reminders, rewards, and 2 social strategies (sharing and social comparison).</s></p></div>
