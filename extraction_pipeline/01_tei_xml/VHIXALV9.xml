health care because it has the potential to reduce preventable deaths <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5fMdrDB">There is a huge range of digital health technologies that can deliver health care interventions, including apps, SMS texts, emails, internet, interactive chatbots, and voice agents <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_k6BuPth">Since the first iPhone was released in 2008, smartphone technology has become increasingly prevalent and capable, offering a promising means of delivering health care interventions to the general population.</s><s xml:id="_vGuJJBF">The large number of mobile health apps currently available for download is a testament to their popularity <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KB6vb7T">Many mobile phones now have the ability to passively collect a variety of health data-including physical activity, social interaction, sleep, and mobility patterns-and make inferences about mental and physical health <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wjdV7Jd">Combining these capabilities with active user interaction allows mobile apps to deliver many different behavioral interventions, which can help users lead healthier lives and potentially reduce the likelihood of preventable health issues.</s></p><p xml:id="_GwS5S8A"><s xml:id="_wRx5DNM">Mobile apps have been designed to target a wide variety of actions to prevent problems and maintain and improve patients' health <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_pZ5PStd">There are five main types of health behaviors-physical activity, diet, drug use, alcohol use, and mental health <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>-but other actions such as the management of chronic conditions, medication adherence, doctor appointments, vaccinations, dental hygiene, sun protection, and sex safety can also be considered health behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_jAQ236m">However, mobile health apps' effectiveness has not been sufficiently established <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ER63ZAn">Many studies do not even report whether or not their mobile health behavior apps are based on behavioral theories.</s><s xml:id="_xtN8A2H">Although there is a debate on the role behavioral interventions can and should play in the population-level behavior, behavioral theory is agreed to be an important component of successful health-related behavioral interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fGfaz8W">Further evaluation of the effectiveness of mobile health apps is needed to determine which apps are most useful and which behavioral change theories and techniques best promote positive behavior change, which in turn can guide future development.</s><s xml:id="_mK5RGQN">This is important because of the ubiquity of mobile health apps in society-if they are to fulfill their intended goal of improving health, they must be able to effectively improve and maintain positive health behaviors.</s></p><p xml:id="_qsXCb5m"><s xml:id="_g3MTcYF">Many systematic reviews are currently examining these topics.</s><s xml:id="_wcJEdra">However, with a few exceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, most of these reviews are restricted in scope to specific types of health behaviors, patient groups, or combinations thereof.</s><s xml:id="_TsNcAK7">This has the advantage of being able to more directly compare the studies, and perform meta-analyses, if the studies are similar enough.</s><s xml:id="_vaSAB8a">The diversity of the mobile health app field makes it difficult to coalesce the results of studies into a coherent overview.</s><s xml:id="_vc6CyKR">A few systematic reviews have taken on this challenge.</s><s xml:id="_6N4q3Yu">These examined studies focused on a variety of health behaviors, patient groups, or types of app intervention.</s><s xml:id="_A28kTAf">Overall, they found that mobile health apps were effective in improving participants' health behaviors <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5txGFJc">They also identified the most commonly used behavior change constructs: self-monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>, cues to action, feedback, and social support <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref> However, each of these systematic reviews has limitations.</s><s xml:id="_snyD7Cq">These limitations include the exclusive use of broad search terms, which likely missed many relevant mobile health app articles that used more specific key terms <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>, and that the articles reviewed were primarily pilot studies with small sample sizes <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ychwrR3">In addition, data for these systemic reviews were collected in 2014 <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, 2015 <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, and 2017 <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xShHBAz">Given the rapid pace of technological development, a new systematic review is necessary to provide an accurate assessment of the effectiveness of the most recent mobile health app interventions.</s></p><p xml:id="_rtFvvat"><s xml:id="_2VzCq6F">Identifying the behavior change techniques (BCTs) that are most effective in fostering positive change is necessary to develop the most effective and engaging interventions to improve the participant health behavior.</s><s xml:id="_dffxGq3">An update to and expansion of previous systematic reviews is needed to provide an overview of current mobile health app technology, the BCTs being used, and their effectiveness in changing behavior and participant health outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_9Da48mH">New, innovative apps are continuously being developed and tested, and systematic reviews must keep pace so that overall trends in the features, theories, and effectiveness of these apps can be tracked and updated.</s><s xml:id="_fHFPqSk">To ensure that the mobile health apps that patients are using are achieving their promises of health behavior change, it is essential to have a clear understanding of what is currently being used and whether it is working.</s><s xml:id="_VpdwvZ5">If barriers-in the apps' features or use-can be identified, app developers can use that information to design more effective interventions.</s></p></div>
