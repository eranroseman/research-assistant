however, a recent network meta-analysis that evaluated all types of interventions for HIV adherence globally has classified WelTel as a short messaging service (text message) intervention only <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_XxmM9aQ">An in-depth analysis of WelTel has revealed a comprehensive blend of mechanisms behind its digital health outreach platform for promoting ART adherence, thus differentiating itself from other mHealth applications considered one-way in nature and other forms of two-way communication that provide a relatively low degree of social support and personalized care.</s><s xml:id="_ztGk8tX">Through consistent weekly automated text messaging and subsequent provider follow-up by phone if patients report a problem or are nonresponsive, WelTel is postulated to deliver a variety of BCTs that comprehensively induces ART adherence.</s><s xml:id="_BrZscRX">The automated text message component of the intervention is hypothesized to primarily influence one's physical opportunity and automatic motivation.</s><s xml:id="_2FPABmX">More importantly, the personalized, interactive patient-provider communication component may have the potential to impact all influences on behavior (physical and psychological capability, social and physical opportunity, and reflective and automatic motivation).</s><s xml:id="_WzE7acn">Through application of the science of behavior change, we have been able to strengthen the qualitative evidence base for how interactive two-way mHealth interventions may impact both nonintentional and intentional nonadherence.</s></p></div>
