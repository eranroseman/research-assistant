xml:id="_jX3ZXfs"><s xml:id="_KuTEArP">Therefore, a more comprehensive understanding is needed to examine how research and design of tracking technologies can better support holistic aspects (e.g.,

their daily tasks, activities, and health.</s><s xml:id="_huDyQEE">They keep track of their memories, family histories, and legacies to preserve emotional attachments with loved ones, objects, and life events.</s><s xml:id="_GGJDswa">They also tracked to contribute to their families, friends, communities, and society through supporting relationships and caregiving and generating knowledge for

data.</s></p><p xml:id="_Mwp4Eah"><s xml:id="_qufhEG6">Findings of this study contribute to the HCI research and design in the following ways.</s><s xml:id="_62WRdPQ">First, our research provides an empirical understanding of older adults' perspectives on their tracking goals, their considerations for using diferent tracking tools, and their strategies to make sense of data.</s><s xml:id="_7bzqqGU">We fnd older adults keep track of various information in their everyday lives to support themselves (e.g., managing everyday life tasks), their relationships (e.g., preserving sentimental values and caregiving), and their community (e.g., generating knowledge).</s><s xml:id="_pNbDEvZ">These diverse tracking goals allow them to engage in life and contribute to family, friends, and community, which eventually help them age actively and ensure the overall quality of life.</s><s xml:id="_UXt5VfP">Second, building upon our fndings, we discuss design implications for tracking technologies to better support active aging by expanding choices available for older adults that ensure physical, mental, and social well-being based on their needs and abilities.</s><s xml:id="_GY9FbeF">Proposed design considerations include (1) expanding the domain of tracking motivation beyond health management and physical activity to incorporate non-medical goals, such as knowledge generation, reminiscing, and relationship building, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> facilitating the use of personal data for the broader community (e.g., future generations), and
