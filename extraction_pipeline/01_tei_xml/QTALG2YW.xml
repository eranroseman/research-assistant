however, 38% of participants in the behaviour change intervention group and 54% of participants in the control group did not meet the physical activity recommendations of 150 minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity during this time <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_3cFhzUG"><s xml:id="_tdSHMyU">Although the results from DPPs are promising, there is potential for time-and cost-efficient maintenance interventions to improve adherence to long-term behavior changes.</s><s xml:id="_aBCh36C">Given the wide availability and accepted use of mobile technologies in daily life, mobile health (mHealth; defined as health services that are delivered by mobile devices) offers the potential to improve DPP service delivery and patient outcomes by providing the opportunity for patients to leverage the technologies they are already using to learn about their conditions, monitor their health-related behaviors and outcomes, and actively participate in their own health care <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Xd5Ak8b">Despite this promise, the rapidly evolving landscape of health technologies has resulted in a dearth of evidence-based mHealth interventions used in clinical practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_88pVM7H">Furthermore, mHealth tool and service design are often driven by the technology sector (not the health care industry), which prioritizes the rapid development of technologies to reduce time to market, often at the cost of the rigorous development and evaluation processes associated with traditional medical device and intervention design <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_J7EyEG7"><s xml:id="_8qtrn9Y">The challenge of developing and translating effective and scalable mHealth interventions into practice to improve public health, preventive medicine, and health communication has been well documented <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_YEvjQSM">In fact, it has been noted that research findings can take up to 17 years to be integrated into clinical practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_VqdDP5x">Even more disheartening is the fact that 50% of clinical innovations never reach widespread clinical use <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, and 80% of medical research dollars do not make a public health impact and result in research waste <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_JMzYP7a">At this pace, technological advances will perpetually outpace research.</s><s xml:id="_NSGtuFN">Furthermore, when technologies are designed for research purposes without clinical implementation in mind, they may need significant modifications to be applicable for use in practice, resulting in increased cost and time-barriers that hinder the delivery of potentially meaningful mHealth programs to those in need <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gRz37RY">Establishing the effectiveness of an mHealth innovation is insufficient to ensure its uptake in routine practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KfuKebp">The question then remains: how can rigorous, evidence-based mHealth interventions be developed for clinical practice in a time-sensitive manner?</s></p><p xml:id="_n3uFPU9"><s xml:id="_GUZs2V6">A potential method is to use methodological frameworks to aid in navigating the process from mHealth development to its implementation.</s><s xml:id="_fKnNhWJ">This paper provides an example and recommendations for how the Multiphase Optimization Strategy (MOST) can be used to develop mHealth interventions and how the implementation context can drive decision-making throughout.</s><s xml:id="_XxBvpDc">Implementation science focuses not on the impact of an mHealth innovation but rather on the factors that influence the adoption of that innovation into routine use <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8s97Gav">Implementation science has been defined as "the scientific study of methods to promote the systematic uptake of research findings and other evidence-based practice into routine practice and, hence, to improve the quality and effectiveness of health services" <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_dcjx3Xu">By using the MOST and integrating an implementation-focused lens early in formative mHealth development, mHealth interventions can be developed in a way that will ensure that they are not only effective but also immediately scalable <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s></p></div>
