<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_5vkhcvy">Digital Health Intervention Log-Ins and Outcomes</head><p xml:id="_FZydT6u"><s xml:id="_aFkQhWB">Despite the growing prevalence of digital/mobile health tools in health care with more than 100,000 medically related apps available for download, there are sparse data to show an overall benefit let alone promise of a dose-dependent effect of DHIs.</s><s xml:id="_xDeBnq6">There are data supporting the notions that increased follow-up frequency improves weight loss in a bariatric surgery population <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> and increased telephone contact after discharge can have a positive impact on patient engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_smBHqCQ">While these pieces of information are not surprising based on our prior work in primary prevention <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, the dose-dependent effect is one possible explanation for the neutral findings of the South Asian Heart Risk Assessment (SAHARA) trial.</s><s xml:id="_zAKYE6X">This promising and well-executed combination of precision and digital medicine had a positive initial feasibility component <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> that did not carry over to the RCT <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9dxwz8f">In fact, the RCT was entirely neutral showing no difference in the digital arm compared with the control arm in an educated Western population found to be at high risk for CVD based on genetic screening.</s><s xml:id="_tTZzXn7">One notable difference in the two components of the study, aside from randomization, was the reduction in digital contacts from nearly 4 times per week (mean of 2.6 log-ins and at least one weekly reminder) in the feasibility trial to 2 per week in the RCT.</s><s xml:id="_vaUQQB4">There is almost certainly an optimal number of digital touches to maximize the adjunctive effect of digital health on CVD prevention, which also likely varies with each individual modality and patient population.</s><s xml:id="_4huW8Y2">This should be an important lesson in designing future DHIs and carefully considered in future research endeavors.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_Wb9xr4P">Engagement and Weight Loss</head><p xml:id="_TpXUD8f"><s xml:id="_GzxvYbq">Our study is congruent with prior subanalyses showing that improved DHI use equates with improved target attainment and intentions toward behavior change <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rakPk4n">Our study evaluated weight loss on a population in which nearly 40% had metabolic syndrome (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>)-clearly a target rich sample in need of weight loss.</s><s xml:id="_4JTvFn2">Clinically speaking, these data demonstrate that for approximately every 10 log-ins, participants lost approximately 1 kg in the absence of increased dietary or exercise adherence (Figures <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref> and <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_Pnr25fR">This is a potentially powerful weight loss intervention in a group with a large majority being overweight and plurality having metabolic syndrome.</s><s xml:id="_95pWP2b">Interestingly, increased log-ins did not correlate with improved dietary adherence or minutes of exercise performed per week (Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_2">3</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_XCur4tk">Moreover, we showed that increased weight loss was seen with both increased number of active tasks performed and passive educational modules performed.</s><s xml:id="_UqcFyTA">So while there might not be a specific component responsible for the weight loss, an interesting piece of data from this study involves tracking the nonmonetary incentives, Healthies.</s><s xml:id="_uGv42qv">Insurance incentives were an important driver in adherence in our previous population-based work <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>, and it could be that this portion of the program encouraged adherence and engagement to support a healthy secondary CVD prevention lifestyle.</s><s xml:id="_RJVmuc8">Further work on the importance of incentives and the extent to which these digital programs should be incentivized is another area ripe for further thought and investigation.</s><s xml:id="_AnMSTzM">We are unable to delineate what specific aspect of logging in with increased frequency led to the improvement in weight loss but believe incentives-even if nonmonetary-may play an important role in engagement and potentially increased QOL.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_gxe2TVm">Limitations</head><p xml:id="_yfAKkzQ"><s xml:id="_g8hBEYZ">Despite the positive overall message supporting a dose-dependent effect of a DHI on weight loss, there are a few limitations in this study.</s><s xml:id="_fQkQKcJ">Notably, this is a willing convenience sample comprising a feasibility/pilot study and the subsequent RCT.</s><s xml:id="_WdJJwjq">However, there were not substantial changes to the protocols among the two sections of the overall project, and the baseline demographics are similar.</s><s xml:id="_Fs9PPf2">Another limitation is the lack of standardization on how to quantify use in the digital/mobile community.</s><s xml:id="_MvpUyCY">This has been previously studied in a systematic review which elegantly details that justifications for use are usually lacking in the assessment of DHI adherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gTbRbYw">Certainly in this substudy this idea presents a post hoc challenge, and thus we evaluated the most convenient metric, total log-ins, which appeared to match total days active in our statistical analyses.</s><s xml:id="_2v65UGA">The ability to obtain such multitudinous and granular digital data creates a research dilemma as to what metrics to analyze.</s><s xml:id="_hqemcQA">This is an understudied area and one that will require clinicians, engineers, informaticists, and behavioralists to carefully study the available data and determine the best way to monitor digital/mobile use.</s><s xml:id="_WZu6GDD">Finally, although we report repeat CVD events in our prior RCT publication, this information was not analyzed with regard to use.</s><s xml:id="_9TvaZMK">First, these small numbers would likely lead to an underpowered sample and no appreciable conclusions.</s><s xml:id="_752vwND">Second, once the patients had a rehospitalization, they likely suspended their CR program and their app use therefore reducing use after the event and giving biased data for the final analysis.</s><s xml:id="_GGafDz3">Ultimately, hard CVD outcomes and use metrics will need further analysis in a larger, more nuanced randomized trial.</s></p></div>
