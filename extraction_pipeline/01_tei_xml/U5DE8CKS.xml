<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_esqUFRm">DISCUSSION</head><p xml:id="_G8RxCnw"><s xml:id="_pxv27wv">We compared health policies regarding health apps across nine countries.</s><s xml:id="_3qx6R6E">Our results demonstrate that countries are at different stages of development and vary in the degree to which the evaluation of health apps is envisioned to be centralized, but there are several commonalities, including ongoing initiatives involving a set of national agencies, and the use of relevant existing and emerging international regulations (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_fkJab4f">There is great interest in the use of apps in all the countries evaluated, but even Belgium, Germany and the UK, which are relatively far along in their operationalization of frameworks, are struggling with efficient implementation.</s><s xml:id="_UFRHudm">We acknowledge, though, that this is a space in which the power of individual governments may be limited and there is ongoing disintermediation of traditional gatekeepers such as healthcare organizations.</s><s xml:id="_6GPDCgK">Below, we discuss implications of the current developments and focus on points around which we believe international collaboration might be beneficial.</s><s xml:id="_Npt9t59">We focus our discussion on two major types of future challenges: first, challenges tied to the implementation of frameworks; and second, challenges tied to specific criteria dimensions.</s></p><p xml:id="_VvatPHj"><s xml:id="_2GuzXzQ">While previous work has highlighted the need for frameworks 2-5 or focuses on evaluations in single countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> , we focus on showing the actual status of digital health app regulation in nine countries and three regions of the world.</s><s xml:id="_KHHqKrp">There are many reasons that international collaboration among researchers and policy makers could be valuable in this area, with an obvious one being that health apps do not respect national boundaries.</s><s xml:id="_yMyTaYc">The potential users of English-language apps, for instance, are not only consumers/patients in nations where English is the primary language but also individuals anywhere in the world who have English language proficiency.</s><s xml:id="_f8PTwnK">Thus, the expanding use of health apps within and beyond formal healthcare-and the information health exchanges this involves-implies a diminishing of the power of traditional (national) gatekeepers of medical information (and national governments).</s><s xml:id="_7hcprFT">Standards and soft policy can play an important role here-but we expect the disintermediating to continue irrespective of standards.</s><s xml:id="_4Jm8jFE">Monitoring, adjusting, experimenting with how to address this to ensure safe and effective health apps is thus a key challenge.</s></p><p xml:id="_dmfaZ5y"><s xml:id="_zMuywXe">As regards challenges related to the implementation of the emerging frameworks, most countries have opted centralized approaches evaluation.</s><s xml:id="_yccTcXt">This is preferable to self-evaluation.</s><s xml:id="_mzfttpV">However, centralized approaches also run the risk of creating bottlenecks, a risk that seems important given the vast and growing supply of health apps but a low number of apps that are currently 'approved' in countries having a well-developed process (for example, only 20 apps and 1 app had been approved for reimbursement in G and B respectively, as of the beginning of September 2021).</s><s xml:id="_A8V5JAN">For this reason, a more decentralized approach, such as the 'accreditation' of evaluation agencies may be a viable solution (as discussed in Sweden).</s></p><p xml:id="_pzKwNsy"><s xml:id="_KDcckaS">Countries that are further along in their operationalization limit their approvals to health apps meeting criteria for being defined as medical devices.</s><s xml:id="_dQrJKn6">This necessarily excludes certain products that are not classified by the International Devices Regulators Forums as 'Software as a Medical Device' (non-SaMD) products and raises the question of how wellness apps-that do not fulfil these criteria but can still create demonstrable value for patientsshould be vetted (see Definitions below and Supplementary Note 1 for additional detail).</s><s xml:id="_9y56Sdu">The emerging ISO standard, which provides visual symbols representing different aspects and degrees of quality to be displayed within apps (thus providing guidance to users independently of through what store/website the app is found), and other creative approaches, such as 'nutrition labels' for direct-to-consumer apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref> , much like other food product regulation which have been proposed by digital health researchers but have not yet been implemented, can provide valuable guidance here.</s></p><p xml:id="_9DZQPBJ"><s xml:id="_CZfGqTX">In most countries, a combination of approaches will most likely emerge, wherein some apps with intended use in clinical/self-care practice will be formally evaluated and displayed as formally 'approved' or 'authorized', while other wellness-oriented apps may be subject to market-based evaluation by potential consumers.</s><s xml:id="_5Nv58fH">Yet a basic level of quality check is important even for wellnessoriented apps.</s><s xml:id="_vHrEdW4">The platforms that enable sales of these such as the established App and Play stores, therefore, hold an important role in conveying information about apps-if not formally 'approving' them-before displaying them in their stores.</s><s xml:id="_vJ4vGNp">While these intermediaries have several criteria in place (Supplementary Table <ref type="table">5</ref> outlines the criteria used by Apple's App and Google's Play store), research shows that an alarming number of low-quality apps pass through them <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_MMkSVcc">Hence, having a third party play this role, using for instance the emerging ISO standard, or potentially through standardized labelling requirements or crowdsourcing, would be an alternative.</s></p><p xml:id="_5xw3QP3"><s xml:id="_2tyD7f5">Overall, a middle road may make sense in many cases, for example when risk is low, the bar for approval is low-although, in Europe, the MDR makes it likely that most apps that meet the definition of SaMD will be (more stringently than previously was the case) classified as at least Class IIa medical devices and therefore subject to regulation <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_TQ6f7pj">For apps that help to manage or treat chronic conditions which are responsible for a large proportion of healthcare costs and require long-term use or involve high-severity short term conditions an additional certification of some sort, perhaps by a third party, is almost certainly advisable and regulatory approval should be required for those that are high risk (such as suicide prevention apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> ).</s><s xml:id="_ZaMmJvk">This approach is consistent with the 'risk-based framework' outlined in U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)'s Precertification ('Pre-Cert') Program for Digital Health Products.</s><s xml:id="_6yTWRzm">Although Pre-Cert is still in its pilot phase, it is expected that it will expand to include other companies and software products beyond those meeting the definition of SaMD in the future (<ref type="url" target="https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/digital-health-center-excellence/digital-health-software-precertification-pre-cert-program">https://www.fda.  gov/medical-devices/digital-health-center-excellence/digital- health-software-precertification-pre-cert-program</ref> (2021)).</s></p><p xml:id="_p2Y86Pw"><s xml:id="_3sr74AB">More broadly, as countries are expected to use different combinations of evaluations by central 'trusted' actors and market-based approaches, there will be an opportunity for cross-country knowledge exchange among researchers and policy makers, focusing on how centralized and market-based approaches can co-exist and complement each other, and the throughput vs. trust in evaluations achieved in countries using different approaches.</s></p><p xml:id="_Dh48aME"><s xml:id="_pSWQAUw">Regarding the specific criteria for app evaluation in specific domains, several questions warrant further attention among actors developing, implementing and using such frameworks at the national and international levels.</s><s xml:id="_HKJr8vT">For instance, while most countries consider 'transparency', which is a prerequisite for informed consent, this domain may need further specification.</s><s xml:id="_st7aDHe">As noted in the recent piece by Grundy et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> , apps currently provide alarmingly low levels of information to consumers about data use.</s><s xml:id="_aE2rvYp">Against this backdrop, 'use of data' (as suggested by the emerging ISO standard) is thus welcome but could mean many things.</s><s xml:id="_mYcUkzh">While most discussions concern the need for informing users about the immediate use of the data the apps collect and generate about them, allowing patients to consent to reuse by additional actors may further be equally important, as patients may want to make their data as impactful as possible while ensuring privacy.</s><s xml:id="_uH3KBjh">Transparency regarding 'how the app achieves its decisions' (suggested by ISO) is similarly critical but needs to be better operationalized in all countries, not least in relation to the increasing incorporation of AI-based algorithms in apps.</s></p><p xml:id="_YXzqVfG"><s xml:id="_cRNT8Cy">With respect to health content, approvals in pioneering countries such as Germany have been based mainly on medical trials.</s><s xml:id="_beQbSgm">As many apps aim at creating structural and procedural improvements to care (e.g., patient literacy, improved interaction between physicians and patients, improved sense of control among patients in self-management of their disease, etc.), different types of evidence beyond RTCs may be required.</s><s xml:id="_yVuZkSx">Realworld data (RWD) and real-world evidence (RWE) are expected to play a role in the ongoing evaluation of apps in practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_fHsstsK">Further, whether medical evaluations done in one country will be considered valid evidence in others is a further reasonable and legitimate source of uncertainty.</s><s xml:id="_uPYfmRK">So far, national approval has been based on medical trials in a given country, but, for small countries or products with a small patient population (e.g., those targeting individuals who suffer from a rare disease) this may not be practical, and such a requirement also creates a significant burden for companies.</s></p><p xml:id="_wJXxS7d"><s xml:id="_EMeCqnt">Another dimension of health content involves the degree to which information is presented in a clear and accurate way on the app to its different audiences (purchasers, patients, or health care professionals).</s><s xml:id="_Yw2EASv">This aspect, which refers to information quality more than the evidence supporting the clinical value of the app, is largely non-operationalized in existing/emerging frameworks, although Germany does require manufactures to present proof of the basic quality of medical content and usability, which combined can address this challenge for regulated apps (see Supplementary Table <ref type="table">4</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_zb6tPqm">This aspect is pertinent to address more in frameworks given that recent studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> identify numerous safety concerns relating to the quality of information presented by apps.</s></p><p xml:id="_qus38rf"><s xml:id="_W5AVxBv">A key issue regarding technological interoperability is whether data can be exchanged with electronic health records.</s><s xml:id="_rdDBHR4">This is considered in several existing/emerging frameworks (EN, SE, G, ISO).</s><s xml:id="_gv3kkXu">Yet, so far, most apps do not exchange data, even though this could potentially be highly beneficial, especially for chronic disease management.</s><s xml:id="_TCRYet7">Most EHRs now do have open APIs, which should make exchange possible.</s><s xml:id="_k92tJXS">In Germany, interoperability is a requirement of the Fast-Track and further compatibility with the newly introduced e-prescription system and the electronic patient record is also planned.</s><s xml:id="_2Hq5FeY">B and EN also have this requirement, but all countries experience struggles with how to implement automated tests in this area.</s></p><p xml:id="_BChYghn"><s xml:id="_AHYheGw">Security/privacy in Europe is defined in terms of GDPR compliance, while in the U.S. HIPAA is the relevant statute.</s><s xml:id="_R8xjRR7">While most apps do ask patients whether they consent to secondary use of their data, often this consent is buried.</s><s xml:id="_FhKBNhC">Further, while criteria such as protection against theft and viruses, signalling of breaches, authentication, data sharing, and maintenance work are discussed, there is uncertainty regarding their operationalization.</s><s xml:id="_8aQpeAb">Indeed, among traditional (regulated) medical devices that contain software, it is already known that there is a deficit in the provision of information about cybersecurity in publicly available documents, suggesting that more regulatory guidance and/or public policy is likely needed in this area <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22</ref> .</s></p><p xml:id="_bV4H7vP"><s xml:id="_FjfqXmP">Usability represents a critical concern, as many apps score poorly in this regard, and many are especially inaccessible to patients with low language skills or literacy, even though this group may particularly stand to benefit.</s><s xml:id="_dtKbrmS">It is also unclear what group(s) or institution(s) should evaluate app usability, as perceptions of this could differ markedly among patients with different conditions and experiences.</s><s xml:id="_tybJQgr">This is perhaps where an ongoing crowdsources/market-based rating system could particularly complement initial evaluations performed by centralized actors, even though it would create a risk of gaming.</s></p><p xml:id="_EmT5dGA"><s xml:id="_M4uPQe8">Little attention to date is given to criteria and standards for continuous updating of health apps, in terms of software performance, content, as e.g., new guidelines emerge and evidence for latest best evidence for mobile interventions, e.g., on human-computer interaction, AI or meaning of sensor data.</s><s xml:id="_MuBb7sA">This domain requires attention especially as this is an emerging and dynamic field where not only medical evidence progresses but even faster mobile phones, their operating systems, features and functionalities.</s><s xml:id="_tsFRRYS">This is critical also considering the evidence <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> suggesting that apps on the market exhibit many flaws in software functionality, which could potentially be addressed in updates.</s></p><p xml:id="_M6J3732"><s xml:id="_RmeMexH">Finally, accountability (for not only medical effects but also for side effects of apps and changes in consumption patterns triggered by the app) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> and the related issue of the integration of apps into care pathways 24 are two dimensions of critical importance for the effective implementation of apps.</s><s xml:id="_BfTuT9U">These issues are lacking in most emerging frameworks and warrant future attention.</s><s xml:id="_fepZYTV">ISOs criteria for 'social benefit' (5.2.5) (<ref type="url" target="https://www.iso.org/standard/78182.html">https://www.iso.  org/standard/78182.html</ref></s><s xml:id="_95WhQtq">(2021)) and B:s requirements for level 3 can here be used as inspiration, as it encourages app developers to include economic analyses that consider healthcare savings in other healthcare settings than where the cost is generated, and benefits for society more broadly.</s></p><p xml:id="_CqnMZKu"><s xml:id="_fZRPgTD">Overall, a balance needs to be achieved between detailed evaluation criteria on the one hand, and the applicability of frameworks on the other.</s><s xml:id="_erFb7PK">As most emerging/existing frameworks represent soft law (not legally binding but based on voluntary use) and/or early-stage programs or pilot projects, usability (also considering the time and other costs of using them) of the frameworks is important too.</s><s xml:id="_jNJehux">This again, speaks for a staged model with different 'levels' of approval, in order to strike a good balance between product risk and information/regulatory requirements.</s></p><p xml:id="_2wbqxRu"><s xml:id="_njbYe4a">In summary, while ongoing initiatives in many countries are ambitious and continue to make progress in the service of bringing better products to patients, the effectiveness of approaches in use is uncertain, as the operationalizations of criteria to date are rarely sufficiently specific to offer providers and patients the guidance they need to make evidence-based decisions about apps.</s></p><p xml:id="_STXv55H"><s xml:id="_gYCnRXh">Current end-user interfaces are especially immature.</s><s xml:id="_japNF4a">Ideally, a clinician seeing a patient with a chronic or acute condition might have available a portfolio of favoured/vetted/approved apps that they could pick from, based on the patient's characteristics.</s><s xml:id="_cGVKQWU">A clinician should also be able to prescribe an appropriate app for the patient, making it easy for the patient to access the intended product, which in most instances would interoperate with their electronic health record <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_eD9dyQx">Indeed, this is the goal (and a key early success) of the German system for regulating and approving 'prescribable apps' for individuals in the statutory health insurance system.</s></p><p xml:id="_JsPkpGB"><s xml:id="_xnKyySg">Patients would like to be able to search for certified apps (fulfilling basic criteria) for both health and wellness as well as chronic conditions that they feel best meet their needs.</s><s xml:id="_Y6np8rN">For example, a patient with diabetes might opt to try several apps, ultimately settling on the one they find most motivating.</s><s xml:id="_HPm3GAR">Thus, the presentation of app quality to end-users is critical.</s><s xml:id="_bM7naPH">If apps are to be provided through multiple channels, the apps themselves may need to include information about their quality level and other features such as data privacy and security.</s><s xml:id="_aFr8wz8">The emerging ISO standard provides a symbol system with visual 'labels' to be displayed in the app, to guide users.</s><s xml:id="_HetFaqv">This may be viableassuming it becomes a standard implemented globally.</s><s xml:id="_zgNxWC5">Search functions need to complement this, allowing users to search for apps for specific intended uses, with well-established minimal levels of quality.</s></p><p xml:id="_dJ5DhZY"><s xml:id="_9GDf2Ck">Payers are another group facing the selection challenge.</s><s xml:id="_QHT2vMJ">Like the above, guiding interfaces facilitating the identification of meaningful apps from the perspective of this groups are also needed.</s><s xml:id="_th8R59E">These actors act as gatekeepers since apps that do not pass their filters will not be widely used while those that do may have large audiences.</s></p><p xml:id="_ZBgY5yf"><s xml:id="_zGgjcFf">From the app manufacturer's perspective, such criteria may or may not be welcome, and many developers may be concerned about barriers to entry that they perceive to be 'too high'.</s><s xml:id="_uqG56BZ">But manufacturers would likely welcome approaches that enabled approvals in one country to be transferrable or expedited in others.</s><s xml:id="_dWPQt7M">Regarding transparency, privacy, and security, compliance with GDPR provides some degree of transferability across European countries.</s><s xml:id="_aJdv5ZT">But in other contexts, criteria and associated regulations are sometimes primarily available in the native language (e.g., Germany).</s><s xml:id="_9EpsSGU">This is a key issue for app producers in small countries.</s></p><p xml:id="_cBCJhhs"><s xml:id="_FYgsAfb">In this study, we have explored the current policies around the app marketplace across nine countries and based on this evaluation provide a set of recommendations and common issues for consideration.</s><s xml:id="_Ye2dWan">Health apps and the exchange of data between new actors will continue to undermine the power of traditional gatekeepers.</s><s xml:id="_ywsWnrh">Nonetheless, national standards could play an important role in creating awareness in markets, setting norms, and safeguarding basic quality dimensions.</s><s
