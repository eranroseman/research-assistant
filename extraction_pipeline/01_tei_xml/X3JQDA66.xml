the optimal development of print media accounting for working memory constraints, the choice of medium itself can also extrinsically affect cognitive load.</s><s xml:id="_dbPecTP">A core element of Mayer's multimedia learning theory is the modality principle, which suggests the medium through which information is delivered can dramatically influence the ease with which new information is understood and remembered <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_jRpr74E">According to the theory, although cognitive resources have a finite capacity, working memory has multiple, distinct stores for information based on the modality through which information is presented.</s><s xml:id="_j2J4Q4K">In particular, visual and aural information are processed separately <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">34]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_X8fUVYU">When content is depicted nonredundantly via images and words, verbal content is better encoded when heard via narration rather than when seen via print.</s><s xml:id="_8Rv5A9j">The use of audio to convey verbal information frees visual working memory to process related images, while print-based text forces readers to split visual working memory resources between written words and pictures <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">33]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_awB9gzp"><s xml:id="_QheHkfa">According to the modality principle, the use of video as a communicative device, with dynamic images and audio narration, should be superior to print-based media that require all content to be displayed visually to audiences.</s><s xml:id="_HakdeWU">Indeed, video may be preferable if it allows audiences to encounter information in a manner that is less taxing on mental processes such as working memory.</s><s xml:id="_XCp6t9E">In such an instance, the use of video would allow for greater allocation of cognitive resources towards comprehension of intrinsic components of the intended message.</s><s xml:id="_hExAjMB">The use of video may lessen the working memory load required to comprehend text and free resources to process message-relevant information, a benefit especially relevant for populations who already are challenged by reading difficulties.</s><s xml:id="_DcjsnVK">Video may also be preferable to print in cases where material involves procedural information (e.g., step-by-step instructions to complete self-care behaviors such as blood glucose monitoring or asthma inhaler usage).</s><s xml:id="_wVRyNDT">In these instances, video can provide audiences with more explicit depictions of actions than text or static images are able to impart to an audience.</s></p><p xml:id="_GY5mNHf"><s xml:id="_33MQEmj">Despite intuitions from Mayer's multimedia learning theory, empirical evidence supporting one medium over the other is conflicted, suggesting that the relative benefits of video may be specific to certain contexts or types of information.</s><s xml:id="_uZZMNG8">For example, presenting messages across multiple modalities (i.e.</s><s xml:id="_mqKWXvx">visually and aurally) can improve comprehension and recall <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WAEJPaU">However, in a direct comparison of print to animated material, Mayer et al. found that college undergraduates who studied concepts presented via print better understood and recalled the information than did those who viewed videos containing identical information <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qSXKtwt">These seemingly counter-intuitive results are explained through the static-media hypothesis.</s><s xml:id="_Y338qBG">This hypothesis suggests that in cases where still images and print can focus readers' attention to specific, imperative information and allow readers to review and control the pace, print may facilitate recall better than video <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SnQVbat">In certain medical contexts, it is plausible that the use of print could reduce extraneous working memory load and benefit patients more than the use of video.</s><s xml:id="_xjJWfSD">For instance, in chronic disease self-management scenarios where there is an evident need to repeatedly review a substantial amount of information (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_rxy6tkB">daily use of a preventive inhaler to control asthma symptoms or daily monitoring of blood glucose levels among diabetics), print materials may be quite useful as tangible external aids.</s><s xml:id="_Je6uBfW">However, video may have greater success in describing procedures pertaining to a single-event decision, such as the need for colorectal cancer screening or a flu vaccine.</s></p><p xml:id="_WUZJ5H3"><s xml:id="_M34TzB4">While specific cases may exist where the use of video over a message-equivalent print-based counterpart better supports comprehension and recall of information, the opposite is also true.</s><s xml:id="_9Eq9pwS">Print materials are easier and cheaper to produce than message-equivalent videos, which can allow for wider distribution to patients of different socioeconomic backgrounds.</s><s xml:id="_QUzhgWq">For individuals trying to learn new concepts, self-pacing the flow of incoming information is facilitated when it is presented via print relative to video <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_YK2tVRe">In effect, readers can easily choose how to prioritize time spent with print-based information.</s><s xml:id="_RGWFVSb">The use of print also excludes motion and the amount of visual information presented to audiences, allowing for increased focus on key points of information and decreased distraction of attention towards nonimperative and secondary content.</s><s xml:id="_DSPnkhe">Finally, print-based materials are tangible and relatively permanent compared to video: patients can take print information home after receiving instructions from providers and can review the information as needed more easily than can be done with instructions given via video format.</s><s xml:id="_pBsNfUe">The opportunity for such repetition and rehearsal of the information can subsequently aid recall of instructions and support the completion of prospective behaviors such as remembering to take one's medication or carry out other self-care acts.</s><s xml:id="_uFthx7r">Thus, certain situations might call for one modality over the other, but other conditions might be better depicted by the opposing medium (see Table <ref type="table">2</ref> for a summary).</s></p></div>
