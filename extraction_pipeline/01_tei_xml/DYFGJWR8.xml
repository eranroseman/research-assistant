resulted in the different tendencies for reading times as our study additionally analyzed the influence of each lesion type and abnormality scores.</s></p><p xml:id="_svptQ7V"><s xml:id="_JW2tV7Z">There are several limitations to this study.</s><s xml:id="_Xbyyqn8">First, this study only utilized one source of commercially available software and the generalizability of its results could be limited.</s><s xml:id="_gnrfzJT">However, because our hospital integrated the AI-based lesion detection software for all CXRs and the processes for referring AI results are well organized, this could be an advantage when proving the actual influence of AI on workflow efficiency.</s><s xml:id="_M4vA6GN">Second, the number of CXRs containing lesions was different in the AI-unaided and aided periods unexpectedly because we did not control CXR types for participants in this observational study.</s><s xml:id="_peh8fXb">One possible explanation is that the participating radiologists may have been able to read a greater number of easy and normal CXRs in the AI-aided period than in the AI-unaided period using total abnormality scores visualized on the worklist.</s><s xml:id="_7sU4mXX">The involved radiologists might preferentially read CXRs with low AI scores during the AI-aided period.</s><s xml:id="_Bet79Uh">Another possibility is that the radiologists not participating in this study could read normal CXRs more and fast in the AIunaided period than participating radiologists using the sorting function of scores on the worklist.</s><s xml:id="_rS3vjQS">However, it was impossible to control CXR images containing similar proportions of each lesion during the 4-month study period, and whether radiologists prefer to read normal CXRs using the AI scoring system was not assessed in this study.</s><s xml:id="_HVuQacv">Third, we could not check whether the participating radiologists indeed referred to AI results in all CXRs or prioritized worklists according to the scores during the AI-aided period.</s><s xml:id="_9uBRKGU">To encourage participation and compliance in this prospective study over 4 months, we allowed radiologists to read images just as they normally did and did not force them to refer to AI results for all CXRs in the AI-aided period.</s><s xml:id="_2hk2kQb">However, in a recent study, radiologists of our hospital answered that they refer to the AI results in about 83% of CXRs that they read in a day <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_vU4Z5AV">Therefore, we could suggest that our study reflected the actual influence of AI on the daily interpretation of radiologists.</s><s xml:id="_T5CdqXV">In addition, as there was only one chest radiology specialist at our institution, it was not possible to compare the reading times between specialists and non-specialists in chest radiology.</s><s xml:id="_DB3aDjc">We believe that investigating whether there are differences in reading times based on the experience and expertise of radiologists will be an important area for future research following this study.</s><s xml:id="_X2pVu4t">At last, we did not evaluate whether the presence of lesions or the abnormality score was accurate according to the radiologists' reports or CT images.</s><s xml:id="_9XV3hSm">We only utilized the AI results concerning
