burden, such as the rising proportion of unhealthy older people <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_C4VEcCS">Aging is a major risk factor for chronic fatal diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mpduZ2f">As longevity increases, an individual's health declines and the probability of developing various chronic diseases increases.</s><s xml:id="_GMCQEX8">Chronic diseases mainly include cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), cancer, diabetes, and chronic respiratory diseases (CRDs), also known as noncommunicable diseases (NCDs).</s><s xml:id="_fNEVD7g">NCDs are the leading global cause of death and are responsible for just over 70% of deaths worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ADTvgZw">CRD and CVD have a particularly significant impact on older adults.</s><s xml:id="_VQSzeZh">For example, in 2017, an estimated 3.91 million people died from chronic respiratory diseases, of which, 3.2 million (81.7%) died from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EGUgSKH">Similarly, cardiovascular diseases are a major cause of high mortality rates among older adults.</s><s xml:id="_eZ5NmDk">According to a WHO report, in 2019, cardiovascular disease deaths accounted for 33% of all global deaths.</s><s xml:id="_TwMAzXG">Moreover, 80% of CVD deaths can be prevented through optimized risk factor management, including smoking cessation and increased physical activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_q3WJPwy">The key risk factors underlying chronic diseases are hypertension, obesity, physical inactivity, tobacco use, harmful alcohol consumption, and trans fatty acids (TFAs) intake <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hcG7Exu">Due to the long course of chronic diseases and the delay of the diseases, the quality of life and productivity of patients can be negatively affected.</s><s xml:id="_j8ZeExy">If not effectively managed, it can lead to acute and long-term complications requiring expensive hospitalizations and readmissions <ref type="bibr"

management of chronic conditions by individuals throughout an illness <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_sZW4dZw">The term "self-management" indicates that patients with chronic diseases manage their disease as it progresses <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WHhxcma">It suggests that patients with chronic diseases are the ones who manage their illnesses, as only they themselves can be continuously responsible for the daily care of their diseases.</s><s xml:id="_Ub9QyVx">Traditional healthcare models have consistently focused on managing specific disease conditions rather than providing comprehensive patient care, proving to be both costly and ineffective in the treatment of chronic diseases.</s><s xml:id="_kAd9dkz">Given that many patients face multiple chronic illnesses alongside challenging living environments, this approach hinders patients' ability to effectively self-manage their conditions.</s><s xml:id="_yyMvMw8">Studies show that a significant portion of unnecessary healthcare expenditures and poor health outcomes associated with chronic disease treatment primarily stem from patients' inability to effectively self-manage their conditions.</s><s xml:id="_vYKtDW9">Patients with chronic diseases who engage in disease self-management do have a better disease prognosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8xtfRp8">There are many forms of self-management of chronic diseases, such as self-management based on networks, telephone, meetings, printed materials, etc. Self-management of chronic diseases can improve patients' clinical indicators, such as systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and HbA1c <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_U6TzHHm">Meanwhile, it can improve patients' depression and anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wUZF3QE">Meta-analysis evidence demonstrates that self-management interventions have positive impacts on patients with various chronic conditions, including, but not limited to, asthma, chronic heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and type 2 diabetes mellitus <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_whFt6Zw">With the extension of the self-management cycle, patients will change their behavior to improve their quality of life and reduce complications.</s><s xml:id="_4AdxtTG">Effective combinations of prevention, treatment, and education are encouraged to educate patients to strengthen self-management, improve living habits, prevent disease deterioration, and ultimately control the overall medical cost <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_nEdfQvk"><s xml:id="_W6pjDFD">The results of existing randomized controlled studies are inconsistent due to the different combinations and means of implementation of self-management interventions for chronic diseases <ref type="bibr"

xml:id="_EKJyVhM">In addition, several studies have systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the impact of self-management interventions on clinical indicators in patients with chronic diseases.</s><s xml:id="_C7fSZkr">In a systemic review and meta-analysis of self-management of hypertension using mobile health, it was concluded that mHealth interventions resulted in better blood pressure control <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_XEPXUPU">Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) self-management via mHealth app could reduce T2DM patients' hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_AAWf573">However, these studies have focused primarily on specific clinical indicators, and there have been relatively few systematic assessments of the impact of nonclinical indicators such as quality of life, self-efficacy, depression, and anxiety in patients with chronic diseases.</s><s xml:id="_Vm2Gjgg">Therefore, this study aims to explore the effects of self-management interventions on the quality of life, self-efficacy, depression, and anxiety of patients with chronic diseases through metaanalysis.</s><s xml:id="_3czT877">This study identified the advantages of self-management interventions through meta-analysis to provide a theoretical basis for future self-management
