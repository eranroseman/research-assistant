including managing fatigue, pain, emotional distress and 'things other than medications'.</s><s xml:id="_AjEn2pa">A previous study with cancer survivors found that self-efficacy can vary greatly across domains <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[18]</ref>, indicating that evaluating them together may dilute their individual interpretation.</s><s xml:id="_79xNs5T">Domain-specific baseline scores

interventions (both not significant).</s><s xml:id="_zg5KQkq">Therefore, a domain-specific self-efficacy scale that aligned with EMPOWER-SMS content (physical activity, nutrition, fatigue, medication adherence) may have been more appropriate.</s></p><p xml:id="_TQdw4Kd"><s xml:id="_E9RdwXy">Despite the positive data relating to usefulness and motivation, it is also possible that text messages alone are insufficient to produce a change in self-efficacy for female breast cancer survivors.</s><s xml:id="_dE5m2Aj">A systematic review with meta-analysis of healthy adults found that the effect

similar text message studies targeting breast cancer survivors' self-efficacy, direct comparison with previous research is not possible.</s><s xml:id="_BDr98jt">However, a recent study with women of

communication can increase adherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[40]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_pWqYysv">Moreover, a pre-post study of 100 breast cancer survivors found evidence that daily medication

target="#b41">[41]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rpqpRTA">Qualitative results (focus groups, text message replies, free-text feedback survey responses) of the EMPOWER-SMS RCT found that the messages helped

lifestyle-focused text message intervention with only one medication-related message per week and found evidence of improved adherence to endocrine therapy medication.</s><s xml:id="_Kx4eJC4">Since overestimation of self-reported adherence to endocrine therapy tablets compared to objective measures is common <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[42]</ref> and may limit study findings, further robust

xml:id="_VGSJnRP">A systematic review of RCTs, including 764 adults diagnosed with depression, found that interventions that delivered 1-5 daily text messages were effective for improving depressive symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_bJauUjB">The current study, on the other hand, did not specifically recruit patients with depression or anxiety and message content targeted general lifestyle support, rather than daily support for depressive or anxiety symptoms.</s><s xml:id="_4bV6z9u">Despite this, this study found a text message intervention was feasible,

several limitations should also be considered.</s><s xml:id="_agFDH9b">Due to COVID-19 restrictions, half of the participants were followed-up by phone.</s><s xml:id="_Xrpxuxc">Body composition data (body fat percentage, muscle mass percentage) were therefore unavailable and weight and waist-circumference measurements were self-reported, which limited power and accuracy <ref type="bibr"
