returning to clinic after a recent visit, the SMS itself also often facilitated negotiation of transportation refunds and/or time away from other responsibilities to get to clinic.</s><s xml:id="_eu9ssbV">Additionally, we identified a number of clinic-related barriers to successfully returning for ART-initiation after receiving an SMS, such as the clinic's limited capacity to absorb unscheduled visits, echoing previous findings from similar settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">48</ref> .</s></p><p xml:id="_HuHuUdJ"><s xml:id="_vYVehDA">Because we were primarily interested in understanding how acceptance and use of the technology led to clinic return and ART initiation, we introduced "target outcome" as the endpoint of our model, similar to some prior technology adoption and success models <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">50</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_HswY8Dc">This endpoint contrasts with classic technology acceptance models, which typically use either "behavioral intention to use" or "actual use" of the technology as endpoints, but do not consider outcome of technology use.</s><s xml:id="_5bmZjyc">However, we found that barriers and facilitators downstream to desired use of the technology may substantially impact the effectiveness of even highly acceptable technologies.</s><s xml:id="_hzj5VjS">We therefore argue that they warrant inclusion in the TAM-RLS, and consideration when developing and deploying similar mHealth technologies.</s><s xml:id="_FuHm89a">Notably, we exclude "behavioral intention to use" from our framework.</s><s xml:id="_rn597gf">Historically, the behavioral intention concept was used because it was easier to measure than actual use of a technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">9</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_4JY8DVk">However, in our study, because participants were interviewed after an experience with the intervention, they largely described actual use as opposed to intention to use.</s><s xml:id="_nqY2BZe">The distinction between intention to use an SMS and actual use in our study was largely limited to instances in which someone did not open a message she had received.</s><s xml:id="_h3wXxVm">To put the exclusion of behavioral intention in context, prior technology acceptance research has found that behavioral intention is less important in predicting use when use is highly likely at the outset (as was the case in our study). <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">51</ref></s><s xml:id="_as3m75u">In our model, both upstream (literacy, technology experience) and downstream (structural barriers) barriers that might disentangle behavioral intention from actual use are accounted for elsewhere in the conceptual framework.</s></p><p xml:id="_xBrapFX"><s xml:id="_kPJtNfm">One particular threat to mHealth evaluation and scale-up is the loss of funding and ancillary support, which is often made available only through research or pilot funding mechanisms.</s></p><p xml:id="_Qv9DhUk"><s xml:id="_7sSnRHZ">In our study, interviewees often described experiences in which research assistants, who were supported by the study and who were not clinic staff members, acted as de facto case managers.</s><s xml:id="_v8kcexR">Research staff were frequently called to help participants arrange clinic visits, facilitate navigation through clinic, and explain the meaning of messages to confused participants.</s><s xml:id="_94VzAJZ">These additional paid staff appeared to contribute to program success.</s><s xml:id="_YPGVZfG">Others have similarly reported that research staff in HIV trials often prioritize participant wellbeing over the discrete obligations of their roles <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">52</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_P4SXzbB">As such, failing to account for the contributions of personnel and support systems provided during intervention evaluation stages could threaten the effectiveness health technology scale-up in RLS.</s><s xml:id="_h9AYdFQ">It could also partially account for the low rate of scale of successful pilot programs in the literature.</s></p><p xml:id="_DTwzsSN"><s xml:id="_887HMYq">At present, most published data on mHealth interventions deployed in RLS targeting PLWH have described SMS-based systems.</s><s xml:id="_M8QwajK">However, as more sophisticated (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_2YpXURZ">smart phonebased) cellular technologies become increasingly available, interventions may become more app-or internet-based, as they have in resource-rich settings <ref type="bibr" target="#b51">53</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_GSbC5Wf">Research on acceptability of app-based interventions in resource-rich settings suggests that broad concepts related to mHealth acceptability that we describe in our framework, such as concerns about privacy, may continue to be relevant as mHealth technology in RLS advances <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">54,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">55</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_SmNegvY">Nonetheless, as new mHealth technologies gain penetrance in RLS, a critical re-evaluation of our framework will be necessary to incorporate unevaluated cultural attitudes related to newer technologies, as well as the unique social milieus into which these technologies will be introduced.</s></p><p xml:id="_V24Z9SD"><s xml:id="_dKasFdG">Our study had several limitations.</s><s xml:id="_JG7g5Bg">First, we investigated beliefs about use of a single intervention, among a single, purposefully selected group of individuals, in a single setting.</s><s xml:id="_DhcHkfH">Second, we did not undertake a quantitative assessment of predictors of intention to use the system during the study.</s><s xml:id="_729krPu">Instead, by employing a qualitative approach to understanding acceptance of the SMS system, we were able to uncover emergent contributors to technology use in this setting, and develop a rich understanding of participants' experience with the technology and how this influenced their decision to respond to the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_eghRjrW">Nevertheless, our results do not allow us to formally define components of these experiences as "predictive" of actual use, or of target outcome.</s><s xml:id="_NXJQvjh">Third, although we attempted to make participants feel comfortable expressing both positive and negative attitudes towards the SMS system during interviews, social desirability bias might have affected our findings.</s></p><p xml:id="_zW9cukD"><s xml:id="_d3HPsYx">In summary, we conducted a qualitative study of attitudes surrounding use of a novel SMSbased intervention to notify Ugandan HIV patients of lab values requiring ART initiation, with the goal of understanding factors related to acceptability of mHealth interventions in low-literacy RLS.</s><s xml:id="_n29VKkC">The TAM-RLS outlines key considerations for researchers, public health practitioners, and clinicians planning to develop and deploy health-oriented mHealth interventions in RLS.</s><s xml:id="_wyWjTmn">Our framework has particular relevance for populations in RLS, but also includes key considerations for PLWH and other stigmatized conditions regardless of geographic or economic setting.</s><s xml:id="_d9yM6td">It includes several themes that are unique from the classic TAM.</s><s xml:id="_ZQGXetd">Specifically, we include confidentiality as a contributor to mHealth acceptance, and posit that its effects are mediated by prior disclosure and internalized stigma.</s><s xml:id="_fnXTgaf">We also propose a novel endpoint of technology acceptance-target outcome achievement-which extends the standard definition of acceptance to include functional use.</s><s xml:id="_yvSmfbu">Doing so permits the model to attend to factors downstream from technology use, such as structural barriers, clinic caseloads, and Hawthorne effects (i.e., changing behavior through observation) of evaluation programs.</s><s xml:id="_NtUM2pz">By leveraging ubiquitous cellular networks and related technologies, myriad mHealth technologies continue to be developed to address many of the most intractable health problems in the developing world.</s><s xml:id="_x2UHN9K">An accurate understanding of usercentered factors affecting acceptability of these technologies
