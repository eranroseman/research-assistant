evaluating the importance of the theoretical domains; conducting an interdisciplinary evaluation and synthesis of the domains and constructs; validating the domain list; and piloting interview questions relevant to the constructs and domains.</s><s xml:id="_PhSbFuJ">This resulted in 12 theoretical domains and exemplar questions for each to use in interviews or focus groups to provide a comprehensive theoretical assessment of implementation problems.</s></p><p xml:id="_R2NgD6p"><s xml:id="_myH4QAD">This framework has been used by research teams across several healthcare systems to explain implementation problems and inform implementation interventions.</s><s xml:id="_Zv6Xwxa">For example, in Australia it has been used to identify the barriers and enablers to the implementation of evidence-based guidelines for acute low back pain <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref> and develop theory-informed behaviour change interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HJ3qqft">In the UK, examples include studies of the barriers and levers related to hand hygiene <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>;

support for the basic structure of the TDF and led to refinements producing 14 domains: 'Knowledge' , 'Skills' , 'Social/Professional Role and Identity' , 'Beliefs about Capabilities' , 'Optimism' , 'Beliefs about Consequences' , 'Reinforcement' , 'Intentions' , 'Goals' , 'Memory, Attention and Decision Processes' , 'Environmental Context and Resources' , 'Social Influences' , 'Emotions' , and 'Behavioural Regulation'.</s><s xml:id="_6aDNkK7">There are three key advantages of this framework.</s><s xml:id="_JuYkXDS">First, there is comprehensive coverage of possible influences on behavior.</s><s xml:id="_xu2HJZM">Second, there is clarity about each kind of influence, as a result of each domain being specified by component constructs.</s><s xml:id="_kqjQFyu">Third, the framework makes links between theories of behaviour change and techniques of behaviour change to address implementation problems.</s><s xml:id="_MYb2as2">The framework can be applied by gathering either qualitative data (interviews or focus groups) or quantitative data (e.g., by questionnaires).</s><s xml:id="_wqU2FEH">The findings have strengthened the evidence for the structure and content of the domains, increasing confidence in the usefulness of the TDF as an approach to assessing implementation and other behaviour problems, and laying the foundation for theoretically informed interventions.</s></p><p xml:id="_NXdKpUv"><s xml:id="_RzkvcPS">To the authors' knowledge, Fuzzy Cluster Analysis and Discriminant Content Validity have not been used in combination to determine the validity of a framework structure.</s><s xml:id="_aJxa8FG">By combining these methods, we have investigated the validity of the original framework both when the original domain labels were, and were not, presented.</s><s xml:id="_ujKqNV8">The results from both the open and closed sort tasks generally replicated the original framework, which adds confidence to the validity of the framework's structure.</s></p><p xml:id="_KDjR6V3"><s xml:id="_sTZvyPm">The study findings pointed to some changes in the framework, which had good face validity.</s><s xml:id="_8cQr8xd">First, there was a separation and clarification of a number of existing domains.</s><s xml:id="_BVuqpJS">The separation of 'Motivation and Goals' into two domains of 'Intentions' and 'Goals' was indicated by both the closed and open sort task results and was particularly apparent in the labels provided by the participants, with labels relating to 'intentions' and 'goals' amongst the most frequently used.</s><s xml:id="_5DPCM6v">The APA dictionary of psychology defines a goal as 'the end state toward which a human or non-human animal is striving: the purpose of an activity or endeavour.'</s><s xml:id="_MBatTyZ"><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> and defines intention as 'a conscious decision to perform a behaviour; a resolve to act in a certain way or an impulse for purposeful action.</s><s xml:id="_ZSZVZJV">In experiments, intention is often equated with goals defined by the task instructions.'</s><s xml:id="_YzxvHHZ"><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_yS6sb9Q">Therefore 'Goals' tends to refer to an end state that can be seen as a preferred outcome, whereas 'Intentions' is concerned with the resolve to initiate or terminate a behaviour.</s><s xml:id="_5nVFkk6">The separation of 'Beliefs about Consequences' into two domains, one retaining the original name and one termed 'Reinforcement' , made psychological sense.</s><s xml:id="_JeA9BGq">The former refers to beliefs whereas the latter refers to constructs of associative learning.</s><s xml:id="_HN5TtCE">There was also a separation within the 'Beliefs about Capabilities' domain with a separate 'Optimism' domain being formed.</s><s xml:id="_nwrk88J">This separation makes psychological sense in that the constructs in the optimism cluster concern general disposition rather than specific capabilities required to achieve an outcome.</s><s xml:id="_teQj9wf">The domain 'Behavioural Regulation' is clearer in the refined framework where it refers to self-regulatory processes rather than including a mixture of self-regulation and goal-related constructs, as was the case in the original TDF.</s></p><p xml:id="_AKqw4d5"><s xml:id="_5nh67B4">Second, the 'Nature of the Behaviours' domain was dropped in the new framework, because its original component constructs were not assigned to the domain in the closed sort, and there was no cluster representing the 'Nature of the Behaviours' in the open sort.</s><s xml:id="_FeHMrrH">This strengthens the coherence of the new TDF because the domain did not sit easily in the original TDF.</s><s xml:id="_Rbk3JWd">It was defined as the 'Essential characteristics of the behaviour' , had constructs relating to habit and experiences/past behaviours, and constituted an outcome, or dependent variable, rather than an independent variable.</s><s xml:id="_tHA2atw">Whilst understanding the nature of behaviours is absolutely key to analyzing implementation and other behavioural problems, analysing the nature of behaviour is a different task than analysing influences on behaviour.</s><s xml:id="_6EWbZdZ">A complementary theoretical approach to analyzing behaviour as a basis for intervention design has been recently developed, as part of the 'Behaviour Change Wheel' <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5C4CdaU">Previous studies that have adopted the TDF framework have seldom used the 'Nature of the Behaviours' domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_TaWrJgG">Furthermore, where the domain has been used, in relation to changing transfusion practice, it was noted that when participants were asked questions relating to the 'Nature of the Behaviours' domain they often repeated answers that were previously given in response to questions relating to the 'Behavioural Regulation' domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, therefore making responses in respect to 'Nature of the Behaviours' redundant.</s><s xml:id="_f6zuvzy">This along with empirical evidence shown in the present study shows a clear indication that the 'Nature of the Behaviours' domain should be considered differently to the components of the TDF.</s></p><p xml:id="_VzF4sSX"><s xml:id="_VeyBpPc">In designing interventions, the TDF fits well with the Behaviour Change Wheel (BCW) <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref> referred to above.</s><s xml:id="_rVr4tb7">The BCW characterises the target behavior in terms of Capability, Opportunity and Motivation (the COM-B system in the Behaviour Change Wheel), with Capability divided into psychological and physical capability, Opportunity divided into social and physical opportunity and Motivation divided into reflective and automatic motivation.</s><s xml:id="_UnnJn5c">The domains from the refined framework have been independently mapped onto the COM-B segments by three experts in behavior change, with 100% agreement (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_5">3</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_bzFMFCC">Use of the COM-B may help identify the TDF domains that are likely to be important in changing behaviour.</s><s xml:id="_4eUPmep">By All definitions are based on definitions from the American Psychological Associations' Dictionary of Psychology <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_DbHkxKh"><s xml:id="_q4WNXDS">starting with a behavioural analysis such as this, intervention designers can be selective about the domains they investigate to inform the nature of the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_HYTvVDn">Research using the TDF has identified lack of knowledge as a potential barrier to a number of professional health behaviours, including hand hygiene <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, changing transfusion practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, and the adoption of tobacco use cessation counseling in dental practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_kJuYNa6">However, for most health-related behaviours that are the target of theoretically-based behaviour change interventions (e.g., smoking, healthy eating, physical activity), knowledge is not an important source of variance <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">[52]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_nkZtjP5">This may be why participants did not identify a separate domain for knowledge, but that it has been identified as an important influence on some health professional behaviours.</s><s xml:id="_rDda2eR">We therefore recommend that knowledge be assessed along with the other TDF domains.</s></p><p xml:id="_FqQ3qut"><s xml:id="_cGxg7eK">Of the original 112 unique constructs in the TDF, 34 have been removed.</s><s xml:id="_ApFYqTV">They appear to be a mixture of rather vague constructs (e.g., Mindsets), very general constructs (e.g., Review), ambiguous constructs (e.g., Commitment), and infrequently used constructs in behaviour change theory (e.g., Generating alternatives).</s><s xml:id="_QvjfPQM">Because constructs that are 'poorly defined' , 'undifferentiated' , and 'imprecisely partitioned' have previously been found to influence the content validity of assessment instruments <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref>, their exclusion from the refined framework seems warranted.</s><s xml:id="_NPaD8uw">The remaining constructs stand as a more defined, focused set of constructs that are more relevant to behaviour change theory and more precisely partitioned into domains.</s><s xml:id="_BsdkmVJ">Within these remaining constructs, there are also a number of constructs that appear in more than one domain.</s><s xml:id="_xVVguyE">Such allocations indicate the relevance of constructs across different domain contexts.</s><s xml:id="_3JGVdzz">For example, ' Action Planning' appears in both the 'Goals' domain and the 'Behavioural Regulation' domain and can be considered as being influential in achieving a particular goal (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_VYeHjmm">I plan to achieve goal x through specific actions) and also in regulating behaviour (e.g. in a certain situation I plan to behave in a particular way).</s></p><p xml:id="_yg6pu5c"><s xml:id="_s8MDBEs">Two domains showed weak clustering: 'Environmental Context and Resources' and 'Behavioural Regulation'.</s><s xml:id="_2Zj4n3a">However, these domains, alongside the domain of 'Knowledge' , were comprised of constructs consistently assigned to them when the original domain labels were presented in the closed sort task.</s><s xml:id="_8Rv4CTA">This suggests that people are clear about the constructs within these domains when the domain labels are present.</s><s xml:id="_udY6UHj">A second limitation is that the refined framework is limited to the constructs identified in the original framework.</s><s xml:id="_zKcMfME">Whilst the current range of component constructs is quite extensive, it does not cover all theories of behaviour change <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>, and future research is likely to identify others that are important to behaviour change.</s><s xml:id="_3YGGPBa">Just as the current framework is an advance on the 2005 version, so future work is likely to improve it further.</s><s xml:id="_bmN24AD">The issue of how to evaluate appropriateness and quality of theories in given contexts is an under-researched area, but one that is beginning to be addressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[54]</ref>.</s></p></div>
