and cost. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s xml:id="_zTuThbA">HF is also one of the most common reasons for hospital readmission. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref></s><s xml:id="_hWXz2rs">As value-based payment approaches have increasingly put health systems at financial risk for the costs of readmissions, many health systems have developed and tested interventions to prevent recently discharged patients from returning to the hospital with exacerbations of their illness.</s></p><p xml:id="_b8ZU99G"><s xml:id="_wKXJEfs">It is a challenging problem: HF is a chronic disease requiring a complex array of medications, intensive follow-up care, and daily self-management, including significant lifestyle changes.</s><s xml:id="_4mKqMPe">A few missed doses of a diuretic or a small increase in dietary sodium can easily start a vicious cycle that leads to readmission.</s></p><p xml:id="_6vK2kKz"><s xml:id="_C8u6wdx">Indeed, the combined need for clinical management and patient self-management may be what makes HF such a challenge.</s><s xml:id="_Hd6FGQF">Past approaches relied primarily on patients seeking care after they were symptomatictypically too late to intervene without hospitalization.</s><s xml:id="_nQRaNeH">Newer approaches recognize that outcomes are driven largely by activities at home, out of the view of providers.</s><s xml:id="_EQVRVf3">Yet, trials of self-management-using patients as their own workforce through intensive traininghave shown no significant reductions in mortality or rehospitalizations. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s xml:id="_u9Rjpkz">Complex disease management programs that combine clinical and self-management, often staffed by clinical nurses and sometimes including remote monitoring, have been shown in small studies to reduce readmissions and improve quality of life.</s><s xml:id="_haV7p8H">These programs, however, are typically too costly and labor-intensive to effectively scale, and the promise seen in the small studies has not been realized in the larger trials that followed. <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref></s><s xml:id="_8FG7M3X">6]<ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> Patients offered such support may not participate at all, and many of those who do participate may quickly lose interest. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s xml:id="_2jHj4rV">Additionally, many of the trials do not effectively integrate monitoring into the electronic health record (EHR) or clinical practice workflow, creating ineffective alerts and substantial additional effort for providers that result in unsustainable clinical burden.</s></p><p xml:id="_CfrMQve"><s xml:id="_SEaWPKK">The lack of practical success is frustrating because the mainstays of HF management are well understood.</s><s xml:id="_5rEnWJw">Effective management of HF depends on medication adherence and sodium restriction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s xml:id="_cXwbyuA">Poor adherence to HF medications is associated with more frequent admissions and higher mortality rates. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s xml:id="_fGyguKn">Although sodium intake is difficult to monitor, increases in body weight, reflecting increases in fluid, are situated on the mediating pathway toward exacerbations and are also easily measured.</s><s xml:id="_9AA8Gt2">Often the earliest sign of decompensation is a weight gain of a few kilograms (ie, several pounds), signaling pending clinical deterioration that can be avoided with early intervention. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s xml:id="_YmgdFaM">Adherence to weight monitoring and subsequent diuretic self-adjustment have been found to be associated with lower adjusted odds of HF-related emergency department visits and hospitalization. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s xml:id="_V5AGwju">Thus, the hope has been to create an approach that persistently engages patients in selfmonitoring (because patients with HF have the disease for their lifetimes) and that also efficiently engages clinicians in the care of those patients outside of office visits.</s><s xml:id="_kmavUZd">For these reasons, the EMPOWER trial (Electronic Monitoring of Patients Offers Ways to Enhance Recovery) intervention focuses on adherence to both daily weight monitoring and daily diuretic use.</s><s xml:id="_MSVZc5w">A remote monitoring strategy focused on these twin elements-with relevant information transmitted to nurses empowered to act on it-could be highly effective if participation and adherence rates can be maintained at high levels and over long periods of time.</s></p><p xml:id="_aF6wGMX"><s xml:id="_BY7VsSU">New insights from the field of behavioral economics offer promise for sustaining this kind of patient engagement. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref></s><s xml:id="_7qJPspr">6]<ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> Research has shown that common decision errors that normally lead people away from healthy behaviors can be used to instead promote healthy behavior. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s xml:id="_EzQqdMX">For example, present bias, the tendency to overvalue present costs and benefits (the tendency that leads patients to eat a salty snack while knowing that it could set off an HF exacerbation later) typically works against healthy behaviors.</s><s xml:id="_cCkuWEC">The benefits of those behaviors (eg, better health, fewer hospitalizations) are delayed and often intangible, but the challenges (eg, resisting temptation) and opportunities (eg, enjoying the snack) are immediate.</s><s xml:id="_5w5sMQf">To counteract this balance, incentives for healthy behaviors can create immediate benefits from activities whose benefits would otherwise be delayed; for example, small but tangible and frequent positive feedback or rewards can be offered to promote daily medication adherence and weight monitoring. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref></s><s xml:id="_bjPAMzf">1]<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref> Behavioral economics also has shown that the structure and timing of incentives can be as important as their magnitude. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s xml:id="_AERJmfc">Rather than merely paying people for medication adherence in a transactional way, daily lotteries have been shown to improve medication adherence and weight loss; these have incorporated anticipated regret (people are notified whether they won or would have won) and frequent small payoffs and infrequent large payoffs, which are effective because people tend to overweigh small probabilities and find variable rewards fun. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref></s><s xml:id="_MqqsmMN">ottery-based incentives with frequent feedback thus have the potential to encourage sustained behavior change among patients with HF when incentives, such as simple fixed payments might be less effective.</s></p><p xml:id="_RMgVvve"><s xml:id="_AavSmzc">Here, we describe the design of EMPOWER, a pragmatic randomized trial to evaluate whether automated hovering-a term coined to synthesize the concepts of remote but constant engagement and evaluationcan improve outcomes among HF patients recently discharged from the hospital and prevent readmissions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24</ref></s><s xml:id="_g3h8srV">he trial is innovative in its use of remote monitoring technologies to connect with patients, its use of behavioral economics to inform the structure and content of the intervention, and its integration with a healthcare delivery system to provide data and insights that are actionable within the existing context of clinical care.</s><s xml:id="_dgYzVeQ">The EMPOWER intervention is deployed via a novel software platform that allows daily monitoring of weights and medication adherence in a user-friendly way. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref></s><s xml:id="_47zthA3">The intervention is enhanced with a series of behavioral economic tools to promote behavior change, including a regret lottery and social support. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref></s><s xml:id="_xF3kJeM">Importantly, the intervention is embedded into routine clinical practice within a healthcare delivery system and is implemented with existing clinical resources with direct integration into the EHR.</s></p></div>

incentive payments to patients; staff time to enroll patients, troubleshoot devices, and monitor alerts; the Way to Health platform that enrolls patients and calculates their incentives; and medical utilization during the trial, which captures services in response to alerts and the intervention's success in reducing hospital admissions.</s><s xml:id="_rxqY9qt">Device and incentive costs are available from the trial records.</s><s xml:id="_b3epBKG">To ensure that only the time required for the intervention itself is costed, and not time involved in trial-and research-related activities, staff will record their time, by activity, for a sample of weeks using time logs.</s><s xml:id="_nUs6m2M">Medical utilization will be measured using the billing and service utilization data systems of Penn Medicine and costed using national Medicare payment rates; this information includes Penn Medicine inpatient and outpatient hospital services and services at Penn Medicine outpatient practices.</s><s xml:id="_49pB3UW">We will have information on inpatient prescriptions but not outpatient prescriptions, making it difficult to calculate a measure of adherence in both arms.</s><s xml:id="_AzP2hdf">We will also obtain information on admissions outside of the Penn Medicine system using state hospital discharge records from Pennsylvania, New Jersey, and Delaware.</s><s xml:id="_23drcv2">We will estimate confidence intervals around these values and perform sensitivity analyses to reflect underlying uncertainty in inputs and assumptions.</s></p><p xml:id="_aMV5tkx"><s xml:id="_nJ56Epk">As is standard for cost-effectiveness analysis, the analyses will report: (1) a comparison of the costs in the UC and intervention arms, which will show whether the intervention reduced medical costs, a primary aim of the trial; (2) estimates of years of life gained by participants in the intervention arm compared with UC, based on differences in mortality across arms, differences in Seattle Heart Failure Model scores across arms, or both; and (3) if the intervention costs more than UC, cost-effectiveness ratios that show the additional cost per readmission prevented or year of life gained.</s></p></div>
