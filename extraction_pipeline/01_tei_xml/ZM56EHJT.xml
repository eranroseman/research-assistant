the lungs, the primary transmission method is through the respiratory tract.</s><s xml:id="_2HjMtwv">As a result, the transmission tracks include air, droplets, and body contact.</s><s xml:id="_VSU6XZs">Therefore, the transmission tracks must be prevented from being polluted by the virus.</s><s xml:id="_zwkhZam">Until effective vaccines and treatments are developed, the easiest and quickest solution is to block the virus transmission chain.</s><s xml:id="_DHwdpws">For people who have not been infected, wearing appropriate protective tools, such as masks, is the essential

xml:id="_wJdh7SZ">Specialized hospitals with professional medical equipment are necessary for severe patients.</s><s xml:id="_Pvd5AtT">The physiological states should be stabilized through supportive therapy and strictly monitored, with the hope that the immune system of a patient can eventually overcome the virus and gradually recover.</s><s xml:id="_JJuaYJw">However, due to the number of patients skyrocketing in the short term, hospitals did not have enough equipment and human resources to fulfill the difficult situation.</s><s xml:id="_CMSnzdW">Therefore, the government could only arrange locations and simple food supplements as basic isolation needs for patients with mild or asymptomatic symptoms.</s><s xml:id="_kQ6sBVr">Because of privacy issues, camera equipment cannot be used, and patient situations can be evaluated through only intermittent voice or short face-to-face checkups and confirmation.</s><s xml:id="_ZCGdwNX">Currently, using a smartphone as a monitoring tool is a practical method.</s><s xml:id="_rewV9E4">However, accuracy and effectiveness are challenged by the use of smartphones, particularly with respect to ensuring that quarantined people stay within their allowed places.</s><s xml:id="_hT7CKnY">The advantages and limitations of this method will be further explained in Chapter 2.2.</s><s xml:id="_8f2ZC9y">These passive and indirect methods

of this research is to develop a system consisting of a wearable device as well as a backend monitoring and warning application that can monitor, upload and warn of the exact locations and essential physiological parameters of mildly symptomatic and asymptomatic patients who are quarantined.</s><s xml:id="_Szggddz">To be efficiently carried, miniaturized optoelectronics were used.</s><s

quarantined <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_r9gMsTM">The body temperature, oxygenation, and heart rate are monitored because the virus

type="bibr" target="#b10">(11)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_BZ9NdkY">Furthermore, abnormal observations of body temperature, peripheral oxygen saturation (SpO 2 ), and heart rate necessitate immediate medical attention.</s><s xml:id="_qPr29kK">Otherwise, a life-endangering event or irreversible damage may occur.</s></p><p xml:id="_xVY5yp4"><s xml:id="_JzmxCZu">The system includes a wearable

this research.</s><s xml:id="_xup77Db">The system consists of three parts.</s><s xml:id="_ekDcaK9">The first part is the anti-epidemic watch, a wearable device worn on the hands of quarantined people,
