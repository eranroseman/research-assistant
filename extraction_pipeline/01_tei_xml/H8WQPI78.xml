(2) Participants successfully selfreported daily time-restricted eating status and weekly blood pressure and weight through text messages; (3) There was substantial interest in study participation, with nearly 15% of potential participants receiving an unsolicited email regarding the study navigating to the study website to learn more, and &gt;
