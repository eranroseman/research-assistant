study and the minimal movement with this intervention suggests more intensive, system wide strategies are needed to address this intractable problem.</s><s xml:id="_qFx3QAS">Traditionally, intervention approaches look at supply side (provider and system) strategies and demand side (consumer-focused) strategies.</s><s xml:id="_x9bcQDj">Digital health interventions for cardiovascular risk are proliferating and effect sizes vary greatly.</s><s xml:id="_AGBRDqK">On the consumer side, the Text2Pre-ventCVD Collaboration found text messaging systems have modest but potentially important reductions in cardiovascular risk factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">17</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_DDK7P3b">Similarly, supply-side interventions to improve quality include audit and feedback, decision support tend to show mixed outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">18</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_9pCKFP6">Patient and provider education strategies are moderately successful.</s><s xml:id="_34t3Acs">A

was also complexity with the adopter system which was attempting to promote a more engaged discussion between provider and patient by integrating the application with EHR systems.</s><s xml:id="_xVUetTy">This link was perhaps not sufficiently strong and research on the impact of direct messaging between patient and providers is an area for greater exploration.</s><s

complex interventions where there are multiple moving parts <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">22</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_WaubNJH">Together with the improvements in self-reported physical activity, our findings suggest there may have been some value to users for lifestyle changes and motivation.</s><s xml:id="_Wj9rCkU">For example, qualitative research conducted alongside this RCT found that 40% of

clinical outcomes and patient preferences is an important consideration when evaluating this research and future RCTs of complex interventions.</s><s xml:id="_4ZbAmc9">Other studies have also highlighted the importance of relevance of outcome measures to consumers/patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">25</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_C3nFAN2">This is an area that requires further research to help understand how future studies can ensure emphasis on outcomes that are of high value to patients but are also scientifically robust so we can most effectively estimate the potential benefits of digital health interventions that are consumer-directed.</s><s xml:id="_qYcFfk7">Study limitations include the following.</s><s xml:id="_Skg7AbJ">First, as in the "Methods" section, the study was originally powered on risk factor control and we were aiming to recruit 2000 individuals.</s><s xml:id="_2k9cHmk">This resulted in a slight imbalance in numbers in the control and intervention groups although no major difference in measures.</s><s xml:id="_BGe9JYQ">Despite low withdrawal rates, recruitment proved challenging where primary care practices are not well supported to undertake research.</s><s xml:id="_nGwj3Xz">We had to revise the recruitment target to 1000 patients and a more appropriate primary outcome (prescription of evidence-based medications).</s><s xml:id="_TECsXhP">It is possible that given the trend to significance in risk factor target control that the study was underpowered to show an effect, however, even if such an effect was observed it would have been modest at best and the broad conclusions remain unchanged.</s><s xml:id="_r3haYyG">Second, there was a much higher proportion of men recruited to the study than women.</s><s xml:id="_2ga8xbN">The reasons for this are complex and are related to both a higher proportion of men identified at high CVD risk, but also a higher proportion of men than women agreeing to participate in the study.</s><s xml:id="_MYB6BB6">This is important given the emerging data on gender disparities in both health status but also health care.</s><s xml:id="_dmfDxp2">Third, the study was conducted in mainly urban primary care practices in one city and practice level factors may be different in other settings which may lead to different conclusions.</s><s xml:id="_j3pZguC">Also, two practices experienced challenges with installing the software to upload data to the shared EHR and this limited the ability of these sites to refresh information from the patient record into the CONNECT application.</s><s xml:id="_92c2BJB">Finally, due to the low numbers of ACCHSs recruited, we are not able to make any scientific conclusions about differential impacts for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people compared with the general study population and hence have not attempted to do so.</s><s xml:id="_c329Z8q">This would need to be the subject of further specialized research.</s></p><p xml:id="_CTCqWmX"><s xml:id="_fFWrtpH">In conclusion, a consumer app integrated with primary health care EHRs was not effective in increasing medication usage in a population at high risk of CVD events with low pre-existing use of recommended medications.</s><s xml:id="_GnyaavX">Borderline improvements in risk factor control and modest behavioral changes were observed.</s><s xml:id="_rYRKcZH">When considering the current evidence of behavior change strategies for CVD risk reduction, this study affirms that such interventions remain challenging to implement and to achieve clinical effectiveness.</s><s xml:id="_ZMt3suC">Innovative approaches to intensify the effects of such interventions are needed and it is likely such approaches need to target multiple levels of the
