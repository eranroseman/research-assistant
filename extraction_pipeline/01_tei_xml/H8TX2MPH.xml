since the criteria varied from state to state, many health systems turned to internal software-development teams to generate customized tools to comply with state rules.</s><s xml:id="_669c88P">For example, to comply with Wisconsinspecific vaccine distribution and prioritization criteria, ThedaCare (a Wisconsin-based health system) turned to their EHR vendor to build a customized tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_WEpXRJT">The Mass General Brigham health system (Boston, MA) internally developed a tool to comply with specific guidance from the Massachusetts Department of Public Health (MDPH) on screening visitors and employees for respiratory symptoms before entering healthcare facilities (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>) <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> .</s></p><p xml:id="_BjPRJuB"><s xml:id="_e7bZWfU">Internally built tools are also often built with a deeper understanding of the health system's problem in context, and tailored to the IT configuration and security standards of the health system.</s><s xml:id="_CfjuKhH">Internally developed tools can also be frequently updated to reflect the specific needs of the organization.</s><s xml:id="_nZTF4Cr">A drawback, however, is that an internal department may not have the bandwidth to troubleshoot or update the tool frequently or rapidly.</s><s xml:id="_7Jazcrm">While this drawback for internally developed tools is a strength of third-party tools, integration and interoperability with a health system's existing IT infrastructure may be a challenge of third-party products.</s><s xml:id="_f5fHDjd">Further, external tools are often updated less frequently and have their own development priorities that may not match the needs of the organization.</s><s xml:id="_29aBkM7">When evaluating a thirdparty tool, a health system must ask itself the following question: could a tool by an existing vendor of ours (e.g., our existing EHR vendor), or one that already exists internally, accomplish the same task?</s><s xml:id="_HaPNvYC">If so, these options may be more favorable to adopting a new third-party tool.</s><s xml:id="_XK6RpBg">Duplicative efforts should be avoided at this stage by identifying and repurposing existing tools within the health system that may already address the same problem.</s></p><p xml:id="_JZsynt6"><s xml:id="_PqbJxXw">Another advantage of externally built tools is that they may already be in use at other health systems.</s><s xml:id="_YTgTuVD">Health systems should seek out such case studies or references when evaluating thirdparty tools.</s><s xml:id="_QscEeEC">Assessing the experience of these other health systems in using this tool may reveal valuable evidence for or against the adoption of the tool.</s><s xml:id="_8AsY7eu">For this reason, there is an important distinction between digital health tools built by the EHR vendor as existing products versus those built as site-specific configurations.</s><s xml:id="_tjeFF7g">Products offered by the EHR vendor may be more likely to have a track record of deployment and use at other health systems previously, which can be used to assess the tool's value.</s><s xml:id="_En7Rpgn">In some cases, health systems use varying configurations of the tool; this enables some EHR vendors to offer libraries in which other health-system customers can share their tool configurations.</s><s xml:id="_PexNxVN">For example, in the case of a health system seeking to address a common problem such as poor operating-room (OR) utilization, their EHR vendor may offer an OR-scheduling tool as an optional add-on (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p xml:id="_ZQagzuh"><s xml:id="_tTHYMkm">Increasingly, an additional model of product development is also being adopted by large academic medical centers in which they form private-sector partnerships to codevelop digital health tools <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_hQXGDMw">This approach has many advantages for health systems, including the ability to tailor tools for ease of adoption and institution-specific needs, the ability to scale the tool beyond one health system, and the ability to generate nonclinical revenue through IP licensing <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_yhByRGZ">It may be advantageous for vendors as well, as it increases the likelihood of adoption of the product they are codeveloping.</s></p><p xml:id="_gF3a7Zv"><s xml:id="_tKQAWtU">Given the complementary opportunities and challenges associated with each method of digital health-tool selection, we suggest giving four methods full and equal consideration before selecting one.</s><s xml:id="_8RpKdRM">Once there is a deep understanding of the need that the health system is trying to meet, first consider if the organization's EHR vendor or vendor for an existing digital health tool offers a solution.</s><s xml:id="_vq9wdKW">Second, consider if there is another external, validated solution on the market.</s><s xml:id="_3UwGbYa">Third, consider identifying a vendor who is willing to codevelop the solution.</s><s xml:id="_Ey5pNDW">Finally, also consider internal custom development of the desired tool.</s><s xml:id="_8vCZAWK">In Fig. <ref type="figure">1</ref>, we highlight considerations for each of these approaches.</s><s xml:id="_ydGRV49">The ideal product-selection approach may vary by a health system's specific needs.</s></p></div>
