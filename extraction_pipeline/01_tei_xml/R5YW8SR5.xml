explain why they did not use alternative, more robust methods such as LASSO or LAR <ref type="bibr" target="#b79">[82]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Qmdj9Rr">They argue that their results "...show some significant patterns, indicating that the safety and quality of services and patient experience could improve if trusts acted on feedback from their staff."</s><s xml:id="_Cg3PVbX"><ref type="bibr" target="#b80">Dawson (2009)</ref> asked whether the experience of staff working in the NHS was reflected in patients' experience of care <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">[83]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_JAhJVtM">Using data from 2007 to test for correlations between trust level aggregated inpatient and staff survey items he found a staggering 12,214 bivariate correlations of which 56 per cent were statistically significant.</s><s xml:id="_K5w7D4C">No level of significance was given, and there was no evidence of Bonferroni or alternative multiple test correction (a Bonferroni correction

were intuitively plausible, for example, high levels of bullying, harassment and abuse against staff by outsiders were related to many negative patient experiences.</s><s xml:id="_cMg4Dac">Similarly, inpatients' perceptions of the adequacy of staffing levels and the amount of dignity and respect with which they were treated were correlated with employee's feelings of work pressure and staffing levels.</s><s xml:id="_Eepp3c3">However, some findings lacked any theoretical or intuitive support, such as higher numbers of staff who have had health and safety training leading to more patients perceiving staff as conscientious and available.</s><s xml:id="_7anQHRR">This suggests that a stronger theoretical framework could be a useful guide to future analyses.</s></p><p xml:id="_WJKr97h"><s xml:id="_MY3k82r">The Healthcare Commission's Acute Hospital Portfolio Review: Ward Staffing <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[84]</ref> also linked inpatient and staff survey data and evaluated changes in ward staffing since the Audit Commission's first investigations in 2000/01 <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[85]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_vMT4kFy">They reported a very strong relationship between the use of temporary "bank" and agency staff, indicating high levels of vacancies and low levels of patient satisfaction.</s><s xml:id="_J4ZtjYE">London hospitals had high vacancy rates and used temporary staff more frequently than hospitals outside the capital.</s><s xml:id="_NXExnDb">This relationship was so strong that it made it difficult to investigate other staff variables related to patients' evaluations of care so separate analyses had to be conducted on Trusts inside and outside London.</s><s xml:id="_jCbAMZj">These analyses showed that higher proportions of registered, more experienced and skilled staff, greater numbers of staff who were satisfied with their jobs and had lower expressed intention to leave their current job were related to better patient evaluations of care.</s><s xml:id="_NbsUhyP">Consistent with the Audit Commission's earlier findings, the Healthcare Commission found no relationship between the total number of nurses or total expenditure and patient satisfaction.</s><s xml:id="_TfsuzhQ">Together, these findings suggest that to improve patients' experiences, hospital trusts should invest in a richer skill mix (more experienced and skilled nurses), rather than just increasing the number of nursing staff.</s><s xml:id="_qnratQe">Although these results could be important in improving the quality of care in the NHS, it was difficult to critically appraise the research conducted by the Audit Commission as the report did not give detailed information about the data used and the ways in which they were analysed.</s><s xml:id="_RFEzF2m">Their report was originally backed up by a detailed document explaining the statistical analyses but a Freedom of Information (FOI) request to the CQC confirmed that this paper is no longer available.</s></p><p xml:id="_vMUFvQR"><s xml:id="_mgnmzUy">The final article in this review used inpatient survey data to derive a trust measure of the "civility" of staff towards patients, King et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[86]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_be8bHRK">The measure was a 14-item scale, using questions such as being treated with dignity and respect.</s><s xml:id="_gfEuvHa">Additional data sources were used to calculate the ethnic diversity of the medical and nursing workforce in the trust, the similarity of the ethnic makeup of the workforce and the local population, and the trust's performance.</s><s xml:id="_fm8YJNA">Civility was found to be negatively associated with ethnic diversity in the medical and nursing workforce.</s><s xml:id="_KW4ByAp">Low civility was in turn associated with poor trust performance.</s><s xml:id="_pj2kqD6">On the other hand, similarity of the ethnic makeup of workforce and local community was associated with increased "civility" and hence with better trust performance.</s><s xml:id="_tVptZYn">The study had a strong theoretical framework from which hypotheses were derived and tested.</s><s xml:id="_PnCCTjd">A number of different datasets were used and data were analysed using appropriate statistics.</s><s xml:id="_V25MG9V">One problem that remains is that it was not entirely clear that

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_gDewGZv">Discussion</head><p xml:id="_sqhc7t9"><s xml:id="_Grq2W9V">After a systematic search of the published literature, we identified a number of reports and publications that were based on analyses of national adult inpatient survey data conducted in England from 2002 to 2009.</s><s xml:id="_GMYVuKU">These explored the role of ethnicity, age and factors that influence patients' experience of care and assessed the association between staff and community characteristics on patients' evaluation of care.</s></p><p xml:id="_ESVw32h"><s xml:id="_hqVPRTD">Some reports used a single year of data and others used multiple years providing historical comparisons or trend analysis.</s><s xml:id="_XxNfDFn">Many of these were compiled by the organisations involved with co-ordinating or collecting the survey data.</s><s xml:id="_nrG9axj">Results were mostly displayed descriptively, with more recent papers applying more advanced analytical techniques.</s><s xml:id="_kVgFShY">Many of the identified papers did not perform original analyses and used reported outcomes from official annual survey reports.</s><s xml:id="_tZtsnQv">Sometimes the data were used in questionable ways, such as comparing different datasets as if they were alike and using patient level or trust aggregated data.</s><s xml:id="_rGW2fFE">The adopted methodologies varied greatly and the choice of statistical techniques was not always explained.</s></p><p xml:id="_3ErWysX"><s xml:id="_5kTRgtW">The question "Overall, how would you rate the care you received?" was used by many papers to gauge the importance patients' placed on different aspects of their care.</s><s xml:id="_apdmJwy">However, patient surveys were emphatically not designed as satisfaction surveys.</s><s xml:id="_kFeHeJD">Previous research has shown that patients tend to be reluctant to make negative comments about their overall experience and satisfaction measures provide an unreliable measure of quality <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[87]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_PAqEXMN">Asking patients to report in detail on "what happened" is much more useful.</s><s xml:id="_SbvfaBH">There is consequently a real need for the development of a summary score which combines all of the questions included in one survey to create a dependent variable that better represents the breadth of topics covered.</s></p><p xml:id="_cfYjSkS"><s xml:id="_RqdsUsp">One of the findings from the national inpatient surveys was that some patient characteristics relate in a statistically significant way to their evaluation of care, for example, age, gender, ethnicity, their evaluation of their own health status and whether or not they were admitted as an emergency.</s><s xml:id="_2eyXR39">Findings also report that Trusts outside of London tend to receive more positive responses than those inside the capital <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[71]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_npxffn6">A recent paper suggested that ethnic diversity, both in the Trust and the local community, can also shape patients' experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[86]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HjDb2SJ">Studies linking data from the staff surveys to the inpatient survey demonstrate a relationship between the two, and ward staffing characteristics has also been shown to contribute to patients' experiences, for example, it is not solely a question of staffing volume, but of employing more experienced and skilled nurses <ref type="bibr" target="#b81">[84]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_SYeNjp4"><s xml:id="_zsTegvC">One of the most important findings from the trend analyses is that those areas that show sustained improvement such as waiting times, cleanliness, handwashing and mixed sex accommodation are areas which have been the focus of national campaigns, using a range of mechanisms including targets, incentives and penalties to change behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b53">[55,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[68]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[69]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[70]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xCe2XJ2">All too often national reports document similar findings from year to year, exaggerating small changes by marking them as statistically significant (which is a function of the large sample size rather than large changes in the percentages of responses).</s><s xml:id="_AVW8fDz">Overall, it seems that there was very little improvement in patients experience at the aggregate level from 2002 to 2009.</s></p><p xml:id="_szu2VFE"><s xml:id="_7KB2tGM">The local use of inpatient survey data for quality improvement has not been addressed here.</s><s xml:id="_2XR9W29">Although the search strategy was thorough and systematic regarding national usage, it would have required a great increase in resources to fully investigate individual NHS trust publications or the grey literature, where local quality improvement studies might be found.</s><s xml:id="_ZM2Gg4p">It is known that survey data are being used locally, for example alongside PALS and steering groups to improve care records <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref>, to manage pain more effectively <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">[41]</ref> or to aid local education programmes <ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[88]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mtrNgQg">However these projects are not necessarily officially documented or nationally publicised.</s><s xml:id="_r4kAfyD">Investigations into local level usage and trust movement against the national average from year-to-year would be incredibly beneficial, with the potential to highlight successful schemes for national application.</s></p><p xml:id="_ms7KSJG"><s xml:id="_W43RRRC">The emerging picture is that the inpatient survey is not in itself a quality improvement tool.</s><s xml:id="_5GXeNgh">It can monitor trends and can provide comparative data but simply providing hospitals with patient feedback does not automatically have a positive effect on quality standards.</s><s xml:id="_M7W9ycN">The survey programme has revealed that focusing attention on specific areas or devising targets that hospitals are expected to attain, can have a beneficial effect on patients' reported experiences.</s><s xml:id="_TwY6nT5">The DoH address local targeting through the Commissioning for Quality and Innovation (CQUIN) payment framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[89,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b87">90]</ref>, which incentivises "locally agreed quality improvement schemes" through proportioned conditional income.</s><s xml:id="_JXrjmSf">Questions from the adult inpatient survey are used as a measure in the CQUIN model.</s></p><p xml:id="_tCGuNwG"><s xml:id="_pWxSjB7">There is an opportunity for individual academics and research teams to produce theoretically informed, methodologically sound and socially significant research using data from the national inpatient survey.</s><s xml:id="_5cUAMdN">As public spending is reduced in the in times of economic hardship, researchers will increasingly be encouraged to use data that are readily available, rather than collect new datasets.</s><s xml:id="_dqfgRas">Funding bodies such as the National Institute for Health Services Research Standard Delivery and Organisation (NIHR/SDO) <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[91]</ref> are providing opportunities to support such projects, which may increase interest in the analysis of large national datasets and this survey in particular.</s><s xml:id="_HJGA3vB">With many countries around the world basing their research on inpatient survey questionnaires <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, there is also the potential to conduct comparative analyses using international datasets.</s><s xml:id="_E2WUJKP">Such collaborations would enable the transfer of knowledge and best practice to
