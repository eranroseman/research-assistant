target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7gYetyB">One of the most proximal influences on service providers' attitudes and behaviors is the social context of the organizations in which they work <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Ep4X9bf">This paper examines the association of organizational social context, other organizational factors, and clinician demographics with clinician attitudes toward adopting EBPs in a United States national sample of mental health clinicians.</s></p><p xml:id="_Qwx8nEK"><s xml:id="_QHBk79z">The role of organizational social context in the development of individual-level work attitudes and behavior has been the focus of organizational research for several decades.</s><s xml:id="_WcAY9Dw">This long line of research has established that work-related attitudes of individuals in a variety of different types of work environments are influenced by the organizational social contexts in which they work <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_UTC4btn">Organizational social context includes the norms and expectations (i.e., culture) of the organization for its members as well as the psychological impact of the work environment on the individual workers (i.e., climate).</s><s xml:id="_DZx6nKY">Culture and climate are related, complex, multidimensional constructs, but there is evidence that they are distinct and that each affects work attitudes in unique ways <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_VrrgxFb">Culture is expected to influence the work attitudes of individual workers through their accommodation to the expectations (e.g., an emphasis on proficiency) that govern their day-to-day work behavior.</s><s xml:id="_B6BbK2r">Climate is expected to influence work attitudes through the psychological impact of the work environment (e.g., the level of stress) on the workers.</s></p><p xml:id="_rGBDZjw"><s xml:id="_khm37fs">While the vast majority of research on culture and climate has been conducted in business and industrial organizations, there is a growing interest in the cultures and climates of healthcare, mental health, social service, and other human service organizations.</s><s xml:id="_7Y7TGDq">While few controlled studies have examined actual organization context change efforts <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, research provides evidence that culture, climate, and work attitudes compose an organizational social context that is associated with worker turnover, new program sustainability, service quality, and service outcomes <ref

target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_E7ZsZWJ">Here, we examine variance in mental health clinicians' attitudes towards EBPs explained by specific dimensions of organizational culture and climate in order to better understand the role that organizational social context might play in complementing or inhibiting efforts to disseminate and implement EBPs.</s></p><p xml:id="_CrcmFSU"><s xml:id="_6wwNrtj">Mental health clinicians have varying and complex attitudes toward EBPs <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ufU5E7N">While an overall positive or negative view of EBPs may be held by clinicians, clinicians can also simultaneously hold somewhat contradictory attitudes.</s><s xml:id="_ShrRdG9">That is, clinicians can be positively predisposed to EBPs on one dimension and negatively predisposed on another.</s><s xml:id="_XYdG7Na">For example, the idea that the practices clinicians use in providing mental healthcare should be informed by empirical evidence might be appealing to some clinicians who might also be unwilling to implement specific EBPs that are required by their employer or by a state mental health agency <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_dytYXeh">Or, clinicians may be open to learning more about EBPs, but at the same time believe that what they have learned in the world of practice experience is much more salient to selecting appropriate psychotherapeutic approaches than evidence provided by published research <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_cmaDtF2"><s xml:id="_KASSpWE">Aarons et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref> captured this complexity in the Evidence-Based Practice Attitude Scale (EBPAS) and documented four distinct dimensions in clinicians' attitudes toward EBPs.</s><s xml:id="_F2psNcD">The four dimensions include the intuitive appeal of EBPs, the likelihood of adopting EBPs as a result of institutional requirements, the perceived divergence between research-based practices and current practice, and general openness to learning new practices.</s><s xml:id="_e7Vb9zp">Moreover, they found that certain clinician characteristics at the individual level (e.g., years of experience, education level) influence each of these various dimensions differently.</s><s xml:id="_GpjcuUj">For example, clinicians with more advanced degrees described EBPs as more appealing but at the same time were less willing to implement EBPs simply because they were required.</s></p><p xml:id="_UfWd9W9"><s xml:id="_cntpPpS">EBPAS scores have been associated with provider characteristics related to implementing new service technologies (See Aarons et al., 2012 for a review <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_EeMqBMy">For example, female service providers have higher scores on the Appeal <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> and Requirements subscales <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref> as well as higher total EBPAS scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_PDENjxM">Higher educational attainment has been associated with higher scores on the Appeal subscale <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> and lower scores on the Requirements subscale <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7NxKPkv">Aarons <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> found no difference in EBPAS scores by discipline (e.g., social work, psychology), but a later study found that providers with their highest degree in social work had higher Openness subscale scores and higher Total EBPAS scores than those with their highest degree in psychology.</s><s xml:id="_yHf3mKZ">Clinicians with a degree in psychology, however, endorsed lower perceived Divergence between EBP and usual practice compared to clinicians with a degree in social work <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_MNfbHTn"><s xml:id="_Gy9DJ8e">EBPAS scores have also been associated with knowledge and use of EBPs in other healthcare disciplines and settings.</s><s xml:id="_CMfNqHF">In a study of physicians, more positive EBPAS scores were associated with higher levels of physician knowledge of technological innovations supporting evidence-based clinical practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_V7dMTmb">In a study of implementation of Parent-child Interaction Therapy (PCIT), more positive scores on Appeal were related to increased clinician attendance in PCIT consultation, while lower perceived Divergence between EBP and usual care was associated with increased phone coaching <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_chh7hD2">In substance abuse treatment settings, more positive attitudes toward EBP have been demonstrated to predict selfreported use of evidence-based cognitive/motivational treatment approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> and adoption of contingency management, an evidence-based substance abuse treatment approach <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_XrZ5sYz"><s xml:id="_eaYQat3">Studies examining transfer of learning in varied settings and types of health practice have also found relationships between attitudes and EBP.</s><s xml:id="_z7TDpBz">One study found that occupational therapy students in Ireland endorsed willingness to practice EBP <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_prguwHt">Another study found that while medical residents in Japan endorsed generally positive attitudes toward EBP, few could articulate the construct or were familiar with the use of standard research sources in medical decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_cNVf4FU"><s xml:id="_sdTU8sd">However, a survey of physicians in the United Kingdom found a greater prevalence of positive attitudes toward EBP and greater ability to articulate elements of evidence-based medicine <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gT8KATg">Thus, while studies across countries and healthcare practice settings have indicated variability in attitudes and knowledge related to EBP, none have examined the link between organizational context and attitudes in nationally representative samples.</s></p><p xml:id="_hxbVTjY"><s xml:id="_aKfygv4">Studies have indicated that change in organizational culture and climate in healthcare settings is a complex proposition that must take into account the impacts of autonomy and influence that occur in complex healthcare organizations <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HFEVcmN">In addition, individually held attitudes constitute but one factor in a complex context that may influence adoption and use of EBP <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_TwtWtag">Still, providing conceptual linkages between system and organizational context, provider attitudes and characteristics, and adoption and use of EBP is needed to help understand and develop strategies to improve EBP implementation and sustainment.</s></p><p xml:id="_Xc4EGvp"><s xml:id="_EYsAArv">The organizational social contexts of providers' work environments are also related to providers' attitudes toward EBP.</s><s xml:id="_DqHqZBd">Positive climate measured by the Organizational Readiness for Change scale was negatively related to Divergence scores on the EBPAS <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>, and demoralizing or negative organizational climate has been found to be positively related to Divergence scores <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EnsyPwb">These results indicate that providers in organizations with positive climates perceive less Divergence between EBP and their usual practice, while those in organizations with poor climates perceive more Divergence.</s><s xml:id="_bFYqGXc">An organizational culture that promotes achievement and mutual encouragement has been positively associated with higher scores on Appeal and

culture and climate dimensions of clinicians having positive overall attitudes toward EBPs is working in a proficient organizational culture.</s><s xml:id="_szk59wG">Clinicians in proficient cultures (i.e., the organization expects them to place the well-being of the clients first, to be competent, and have up-to-date knowledge) endorsed more positive overall attitudes toward adopting EBPs and
