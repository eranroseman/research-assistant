defects.</s></p><p xml:id="_yYw4k6z"><s xml:id="_WMQbSfC">Many previous exercise interventions aiming to improve hip BMD have required significant time, equipment, or instruction to carry out.</s><s

<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(10)</ref> and premenopausal women. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref></s><s xml:id="_z7837xE">It is important to understand the feasibility of a unilateral, high-impact exercise intervention in postmenopausal women and to establish its effect on both bone and joint health.</s></p><p xml:id="_dWxUpjN"><s xml:id="_4CV73cX">The aim of the current study was to investigate the effects of a progressive 6-month, unilateral high-impact exercise intervention in healthy postmenopausal women on femoral neck BMD, BMC, and geometric properties while quantifying

additional neuromuscular exercise to improve balance and strength prior to unilateral hopping.</s><s xml:id="_WTyBddg">For the majority, the level of adherence and the MRI findings indicate that regular, highimpact exercise is a feasible and intervention to improve hip strength in this population.</s></p><p xml:id="_seFfpG7"><s xml:id="_eUJWRUf">The strengths of this study are that it is a randomized trial with a duration that has been shown to be sufficient for both changes in bone <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(9)</ref> and cartilage. <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">(41)</ref></s><s xml:id="_fubmDJC">This is the first study to investigate changes of knee OA imaging biomarkers in those without a diagnosis of OA (albeit with a substantial prevalence of pathology) and the first to use semiquantitative analysis to analyze any effects of high-impact exercise.</s><s xml:id="_zYcxnR6">To our knowledge there is only one previous study that has investigated both bone and cartilage outcomes following high-impact exercise in postmenopausal women <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(16)</ref> reporting similar findings to the current study.</s><s xml:id="_PYmN5QJ">Assessing the whole joint health in addition to the biochemical composition of the articular cartilage gives a more complete picture on the effect of high-impact exercise to the knee.</s><s xml:id="_rQbBSFn">The withinparticipant control design removes the influence of systemic factors such as habitual activity, diet, and previous exercise that would be confounders in a study using an exercise and control group comparison.</s><s xml:id="_qmktvCS">These systemic factors, which may affect the boneʼs adaptation to exercise, would be expected to affect both the exercise and CL equally, and thus not influence the findings, as well as reducing variance and increasing statistical power.</s><s xml:id="_uQn9kaJ">The current intervention is simple, brief, and home-based, requiring no special equipment or instruction.</s></p><p xml:id="_AtvHqNN"><s xml:id="_tkp5J5D">The limitations of the study are the recruitment of healthy postmenopausal women with normal BMI and no diagnosis of so findings may not be generalizable to overweight women or clinical groups.</s><s xml:id="_x8asnjE">Although habitual high-impact exercise was an exclusion criterion for recruitment, many of the participants were active and accustomed to physical activity.</s><s xml:id="_Js63XTu">How this exercise would be accepted by a more symptomatic or sedentary population is unknown.</s><s xml:id="_CpADD2e">Evidence suggests that exercise does improve articular cartilage composition in those at risk or diagnosed with knee OA, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(15)</ref> but many of these interventions are designed to improve OA outcomes and not induce an osteogenic response.</s><s xml:id="_Qqs6mxC">Because the current study is a home-based intervention, adherence is self-reported and no measures of activity levels during the intervention were recorded.</s><s xml:id="_y9WQ52Q">Changes in physical activity outside of the intervention may affect the regions measured, but because the design of the study includes a within-person control then these changes should affect both legs equally.</s><s xml:id="_Dk7FV8R">In the current study the intervention was not quantified during the exercise session: vGRF data were collected preintervention and postintervention and not in the same conditions as an exercise session.</s><s xml:id="_bMbMJWM">This may not fully represent the GRF, and mechanical strain, generated during the home-based, multidirectional exercise.</s><s xml:id="_KhcDmC5">Because of the feasibility of collecting MRI data it was not possible in the current study to analyze all features detailed in the MOAKS scoring system, meaning there may be other features associated with OA progression that we have not identified.</s><s xml:id="_TTyEERm">However, the features shown most likely to change following exercise are BMLs <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(18)</ref> and there is no evidence of advanced progression being related to the current intervention.</s></p><p xml:id="_5M8T2p3"><s xml:id="_nsdkF73">In summary, this study provides evidence that brief and feasible, unilateral, high-impact exercise can improve femoral neck bone mass and geometric properties in postmenopausal women.</s><s xml:id="_ZNAJV87">This is the first study to examine effects of exercise on BMLs and cartilage defects and showed no adverse effects of exercise; in fact, some spontaneous resolution occurred in the EL as in the CL.</s><s xml:id="_Aru8eaX">In addition, measures of articular cartilage biochemical composition showed no negative effects of this type of exercise after 6 months.</s><s xml:id="_FXmgwy4">Impact exercise may be an effective intervention for reducing the risk of hip fracture in postmenopausal women without affecting pathological features associated with knee OA.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><figDesc><div><p xml:id="_JYTXxgU"><s xml:id="_RZ4geVN">(repetition time [TR] = 1004 ms, echo time [TE] = 6.4 to 51.4 ms,
