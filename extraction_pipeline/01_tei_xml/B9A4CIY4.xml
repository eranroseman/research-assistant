been quit], and if you tell me it's over this three-month period, as a pack a day smoker I've already saved this much, [that would be helpful].</s></p><p xml:id="_a9aeXsK"><s xml:id="_8pcStMU">In addition to tailoring generated by an automated program, participants were interested in user-generated content, such as personal tips, strategies, and motivations for quitting.</s><s xml:id="_DKdHeBs">For example, one participant explained, "You could tell me, 'Don't forget, your daughter really wants you quitting,' or . . .</s><s xml:id="_tj5mc58">'Hawaii's only a few months away'" and suggested that message content could be written by participants themselves.</s><s xml:id="_udZmDsr">Finally, participants suggested that message content could be adjusted according to user feedback or ratings on the usefulness of received texts.</s><s xml:id="_dC4hyt3">One participant suggested integrating immediate feedback into the system: "What about list of ways to get by [when having a craving].</s><s xml:id="_Ag3C8yp">So it might say, 'Have you tried this?' and you text back 'yes' or 'no,' and then it gives you another option."</s></p><p xml:id="_cWyjXBD"><s xml:id="_tdPPHDM">Overall, all focus group members agreed that it would be important for the program to individually tailor messages based on personal goals, motivations, and characteristics of the user.</s><s xml:id="_FK8zSnK">Participants perceived tailoring as critical to a variety of possible types of messages, including specific intervention strategies, reminders, general encouragement, and feedback.</s></p><p xml:id="_nBbVTSZ"><s xml:id="_a24nVTP">Message timing.</s><s xml:id="_nXWndkA">Another theme that was highlighted during the focus group discussions was the utility of tailoring the timing of message delivery.</s><s xml:id="_BP6VkhE">Participants generally agreed about receiving some messages at standard times: "Something in the beginning of the day . . .</s><s xml:id="_2RdyUDy">right in the morning to motivate you."</s><s xml:id="_AeexTdf">However, some reported that receiving messages at fixed times would not be useful.</s></p><p xml:id="_xJ6w7Xc"><s xml:id="_Sfa7W4R">If I know that I'm getting a text at, let's say, 9:00 in the morning and 5:00 in the afternoon every day, after a while I'm just going to be like "I'm not even going to answer that, I already know what that's about."</s></p><p xml:id="_DJ39MTu"><s xml:id="_5NeJXHZ">These suggestions indicated that participants valued the regularity of messages but perceived a need to vary the timing of messages over the course of the program.</s><s xml:id="_Ua3aS9F">A number of participants recommended using smoking behavior information collected at the start of the study (e.g., typical smoking times and related activities) to tailoring the message timing: I would want a text message to say, "You just got out of work, you always want a cigarette now, you can make it home" . . .</s><s xml:id="_aDPZeMS">I don't smoke in the morning . . .</s><s xml:id="_427sdET">so I wouldn't need like a general one that says, "You can get up and go to work without one."</s></p><p xml:id="_PtbxKHt"><s xml:id="_w4VQjB9">In addition to scheduled messages, another suggestion highlighted a need for immediate support for cravings: "If there was like one number or something and you text to it, and say like, 'I really want a cigarette,' or whatever, and then get a text message back."</s><s xml:id="_tTqBMdS">Participants saw this feature as a way to interact more dynamically with the system and personalize their experience.</s><s xml:id="_s8mQEsQ">Many people identified parallels between this feature and strategies they had used during past quit attempts that were helpful for coping with cravings: When I try quitting, you know, I'll call my husband . . .</s><s xml:id="_j27s2Wd">[and say] "Really want to have a cigarette," and he'll tell me "It's not worth it, just, you know, think about what you can get."</s><s xml:id="_BrgtkfN">So you definitely need someone to interact back with you.</s></p><p xml:id="_nx7h2Ef"><s xml:id="_GvdkVv5">Importantly, allowing participants to influence message timing may increase their sense of control and allow them to avoid receiving messages at times when additional encouragement or support may be unnecessary.</s></p><p xml:id="_wJsMJnJ"><s xml:id="_3Hsa2Yg">Program duration.</s><s xml:id="_anfJcNT">The ideal length of a text message-based intervention was discussed with participants.</s><s xml:id="_adP7cvq">The proposed program was designed to last 7 weeks after the quit date.</s><s xml:id="_Px543t5">However, participants overwhelmingly recommended a substantially longer intervention: "Seven-week is way too short.</s><s xml:id="_GvcJ3br">I've been able to pull three months before [without smoking] . . .</s><s xml:id="_ESuehZr">but usually it's sometime after that, where you kind of let your guard down."</s><s xml:id="_ht82tKU">Another participant suggested, "I think if it was just something that you could just stay connected with indefinitely, more like a social website, where you could just stay connected to it."</s><s xml:id="_z5Tyh3v">Participants recommended that with a longer program, they would want additional flexibility in the frequency of messages: "After seven weeks, if I'm doing really good, I [would want to] lighten the load a little bit with the text messaging, but I wouldn't want to stop it all together after seven weeks."</s><s xml:id="_786njKn">Overall, participants were interested in lasting support that could be tailored in message intensity according to their quit progress.</s><s xml:id="_D8ZCCj6">They suggested this could be accomplished through a website that tracked their use of the program and facilitated adjustments to the intensity of the program (e.g., frequency of messages).</s></p><p xml:id="_TSnug3m"><s xml:id="_Urqx6qt">Preparation leading up to quit day.</s><s xml:id="_QdhmuVv">As originally proposed, this program had a preparation period leading up to the individual's identified quit day.</s><s xml:id="_7y93jGU">Focus group participants had mixed reactions to the potential utility of receiving text messages in the days leading up to their quit day.</s><s xml:id="_GS6ZyWS">Some people preferred receiving information and support before quitting.</s><s xml:id="_dsnDT9c">However, many participants reported past quit attempts occurred spontaneously after inadvertently remaining abstinent for a period of time or following a specific experience or event:</s></p><p xml:id="_MXZEZyk"><s xml:id="_6EWtVVg">When I quit last time I walked up a flight of three stairs and after the top I was totally out of breath and I wanted a cigarette, and I was like, "What the hell?"</s><s xml:id="_erNNfMA">And I quit the next morning.</s></p><p xml:id="_ymf9sTj"><s xml:id="_pjNPzFM">Together, participants' feedback indicated interest in a program that had the capability of preparing an individual to quit but could accommodate spontaneous decisions to quit as well.</s></p><p xml:id="_QUWc9yX"><s xml:id="_WukW7J8">Role of social networking.</s><s xml:id="_dkXTNnD">An intriguing emergent theme was participants' strong interest in exchanging messages with others enrolled in the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_NdkZBnW">They perceived this feature as another opportunity to interact with the program and have access to social support at key times: "If there was like a group, someone like in your group you could text and be like, 'I really need a friggin' cigarette right now.'"</s><s xml:id="_pFtn9mH">In discussing the logistics of this process, some participants suggested online profiles: "Almost like a Facebook for smokers . . .</s><s xml:id="_apM4EW4">Yeah, that'd be cool cause you could go online, change your profile, whatever you want, and then that's what you get on your phone."</s><s xml:id="_qcKGaDJ">Focus group members supported the idea of collecting information from participants on enrollment and using this information to match participants based on demographic or other key features (e.g., quit day, interests, etc.):</s></p><p xml:id="_gSbX55E"><s xml:id="_UT2DXR2">You fill out what your interests are and stuff like that . . .</s><s xml:id="_bA5EwfK">[and the program could] pair up a woman with a woman, a man with a man, and so on and so forth . . .</s><s xml:id="_dFp7N7K">just kind of like a buddy system."</s></p><p xml:id="_a8n5fHu"><s xml:id="_WxBgk2e">Overall, it was clear that focus group members believed that interacting with other participants in the program either via a website or text message would be an important feature of the intervention.</s></p></div>

Naud, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Hughes, Peters, &amp; Naud, 2008)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ypxVAHj">Optional extensions of text-messaging interventions may be critical for participants with a history of late relapse.</s><s xml:id="_PVVuv4G">This feedback may also be of interest to clinical practitioners who conduct face-to-face smoking cessation, as text-messaging programs could offer practitioners a means of providing continuing long-term intervention for patients at greater risk for relapse.</s></p><p xml:id="_fKZ5zVx"><s xml:id="_g6DwZN8">A second unexpected finding from the focus groups was the perceived lack of helpfulness of a preparation period leading up to their quit date.</s><s xml:id="_TAYAeb6">Participants' recommendation to allow people to begin the program on their actual quit date challenges the commonly used approach to smoking cessation treatment, which typically requires a preparation period in order to provide patients with the necessary skills and resources to successfully quit.</s><s xml:id="_pCUfStU">Eliminating this treatment phase could be problematic, particularly if participants have no previous quit experience and/or have not taken any preparatory steps on their own.</s><s xml:id="_tqBUc7y">Nonetheless, it is reasonable that some people may begin this preparation phase before presenting for treatment; thus, artificially delaying their quit date may limit their motivation for treatment.</s><s xml:id="_k5g2dFe">As such, offering patients greater flexibility in beginning a text message-based program may be important for improving intervention reach and attrition.</s></p><p xml:id="_shH5vBw"><s xml:id="_mybf2EK">User preferences contrasted with standard smoking cessation intervention practice in several ways.</s><s xml:id="_F9YwRRu">As mentioned above, smoking cessation programs typically include some preparation prior to quitting <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fiore et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_XJMatvF">Participants in our focus groups however, tended to think they would sign up for a text message-based program on their quit day, without advance preparation.</s><s xml:id="_MT87ArQ">This creates a challenge for system developers to create a program that is flexible in dealing with setting and resetting (if necessary) quit dates and providing information throughout the program that is typically given to patients prior to their quit date.</s><s xml:id="_xRBcxhB">In addition, while participants requested a longer program than expected, they also requested a limited "dose" of treatment during this time.</s><s xml:id="_F63S8Aa">For person-to-person counseling sessions, the length of each session, total amount of contact time, and number of contacts correlate with treatment effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Fiore et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_B4NFGyW">However, for interventions delivered through a medium (text messaging) that is inherently brief, more may not be better.</s><s xml:id="_4ZcHEEJ">Our participants indicated that a few texts per day would be helpful but more would be seen as irritating (similar to "spam" e-mails) and likely to induce dropout from the program.</s><s xml:id="_7xKaNhC">Additional research identifying the optimal message frequency and duration of text message-based smoking cessation programs is needed, although the present findings suggest a high degree of variability in personal preferences.</s></p><p xml:id="_dzSNFrH"><s xml:id="_7UgjSkK">Participants were very interested in adding social networking capability to the intervention program, although they envisioned using it in a variety of ways.</s><s xml:id="_FnPVemu">As such, a critical component of any text message-based intervention is that it must allow flexibility across users.</s><s xml:id="_TreHWFF">One way participants suggested this could be accomplished is by coupling the text messages with a website, where users could create profiles and set preferences.</s><s xml:id="_mBBAJyB">Another suggested use of the online website for the purpose of social networking.</s><s xml:id="_ggZpfkw">Focus group members reported appreciating the opportunity to connect with other participants either via text messaging or as one participant explained, the program could develop into "Facebook for smokers."</s><s xml:id="_aBe7stJ">This structure differs from the "Text2Stop" program, which includes a one-to-one "buddy" system for support <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">(Free et al., 2011)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_CJAsz3h">With the growing availability of cellular phones with Internet access, it would be possible for some participants to remotely access a smoking cessation program website or smartphone application (i.e., "app").</s><s xml:id="_TW8aU9J">Although Internet access on cellular phones is not nearly as common as text-messaging capabilities, it is certainly growing, with the Pew Research Center reporting that from April 2009 to May 2010, the percentage of U.S. cellular phone users who use their phones to access the Internet rose from 25% to 38% <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Smith, 2010)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_s4Qe3Hy">The suggestions of the focus groups to incorporate web-based profiles and social networking, coupled with the growing rates of cellular phone Internet use, suggest a potential area of opportunity for researchers and/or practitioners designing mobile technology-based health behavior interventions.</s></p></div>
