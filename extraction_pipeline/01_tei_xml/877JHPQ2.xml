outcomes can be predicted by attachment variables at the within-person level.</s><s xml:id="_8vPdcvm">Overall attachment security, as well as models of self and other within relationships, positively

studies we used samples of college undergraduates, so it will be important to replicate this research with participants of different ages.</s><s xml:id="_spXmKvC">Similarly, like most studies of adult attachment, these were done primarily with North American participants, so mere are limitations to the work bolh in terms of the age range covered and the cultural context considered.</s><s

reasoning.</s><s xml:id="_5gNjDn5">Still, these studies do not allow any conclusions about the direction of causation and, as we also argued, people undoubtedly derive greater need satisfaction from partners to whom they are more securely attached.</s><s xml:id="_DkfqZzb">Indeed, we believe that the relation is bidirectional, that people report greater security of attachment in relationships in which they experience need satisfaction and that people experience greater need satisfaction with people to whom they are securely attached.</s><s xml:id="_QR7n5ee">Furthermore, it is possible that yet other variables could affect both attachment security and need satisfaction.</s><s xml:id="_9WUjRB3">Gaining a fuller understanding of these processes will require a longitudinal examination of the issues.</s></p><p xml:id="_Tr6sQt6"><s xml:id="_D4VsVSa">In conclusion, these studies support the view that, although significant variance in adult attachments exists as individual differences in working models, there is a substantial amount of variability in people's security of attachments from one relational partner to another.</s><s xml:id="_w6XMmGq">It seems important for the field of adult attachment research to give greater attention to within-person variability, as well as to between-person variability, in attachment processes.</s><s xml:id="_dGjC6C2">The studies further suggest that satisfaction of the fundamental psychological needs for autonomy, competence, and relatedness plays a very important role in the formation and maintenance of secure attachments to others and that research on attachment would be enhanced by giving greater consideration to the concept of psychological needs in both the between-person and withinperson analyses.</s></p></div>
