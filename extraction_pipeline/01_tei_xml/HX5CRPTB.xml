years ago.</s><s xml:id="_PfvVyT4">In 1997 Weiss pointed to theory-based evaluation being mostly used in the areas of health promotion and risk prevention.</s><s xml:id="_y3Nf9Cw">The use of program theory is now commonplace and Weiss's chapter has been cited in a wide range of program areas, including evaluations of energy conservation <ref type="bibr">(New York State Energy Research and Development Authority, 2006)</ref>, comprehensive community-based initiatives <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(Judge and Bauld, 2001)</ref>, supported housing <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Rog and

xml:id="_6cTjmFg"><s xml:id="_mwdrg4Q">Along with this proliferation of activity has come a proliferation of terminology.</s><s xml:id="_dRYwvP9">Weiss referred to the use of the different terms program theory and logic models to refer to essentially similar concepts.</s><s xml:id="_dA7gMpy">Now there is an ever-longer list of labels that have been used, not with consistently distinct definitions, including theory-based, theory-driven, theory-oriented, theoryanchored, theory-of-change, intervention theory, outcomes hierarchies, program theory, and program logic.</s><s xml:id="_fGRgWPp">Despite the use of the term program, the method has been used for planning and evaluating interventions ranging from small projects to multisite projects, multiyear strategies and even whole-of-government processes <ref type="bibr">(for example, Public Service Commission, South Africa, 2003)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_WWhTvV6"><s xml:id="_8cCth4R">One of the biggest changes in the use of program theory since 1997 has been its increasing incorporation in program management processes.</s><s xml:id="_HTps7QV">This phenomenon had occurred earlier in some places and program

theory.</s><s xml:id="_FsSVSGa">Weiss found that many of the program theories were based only on practitioners' assumptions and logical reasoning and hence were "simplistic, partial, or even downright wrong."</s><s xml:id="_2maVyGc">Although it can be useful to articulate practitioners' assumptions about how a program is intended to work, this is often not an adequate program theory for planning and evaluating the program.</s><s xml:id="_ffgV6e5">Unfortunately, many examples of program theory evaluation are still based on poor theories-for example, health promotion programs based solely on the discredited theory that improved knowledge will change attitudes and hence behavior.</s><s xml:id="_72Yz8CJ">But how realistic is it to expect an evaluation to include the development of a better program theory or a full-fledged research theory?</s><s xml:id="_X6NBdqB">This is the issue behind <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Stufflebeam's (2001)</ref> trenchant criticism: "There really is not much to recommend theory-based evaluation, since doing it right is usually not feasible and since failed or misrepresented attempts can be counterproductive" (p.</s><s xml:id="_jKfZxy2">80).</s></p><p xml:id="_D6PJEB7"><s xml:id="_xNDzfTS">Examples of good practice in program theory evaluation demonstrate that it can be feasible and useful to improve the quality of the theory by better logical analysis of alternative causal explanations, better use of existing research theories, and better use of alternative perspectives on how programs work, including understanding how program clients or intended beneficiaries understand it, and through a process of competitive elaboration and testing against the data.</s><s xml:id="_cADQbk5">For example, the Centre for Communication Programs at Johns Hopkins University has moved on from using a "Knowledge-Attitudes-Practice" model of behavior change to underpin its evaluations, and now uses the frameworks of "Ideation and Communication for Participatory Development."</s><s xml:id="_hCWY6Cj"><ref type="bibr">Murray-Johnson and others (2000-01)</ref> compared the utility of four different theories: health belief model, theory of reasoned action, extended parallel process model, and social cognitive theory.</s></p><p xml:id="_jm9PGKb"><s xml:id="_DDcj6yD">The third issue is how program theory is used in evaluations.</s><s xml:id="_beBzx4R">In 1997 Weiss observed that many evaluators developed program theory but then did not use it at all to guide the evaluation.</s><s xml:id="_eRER8YG">This seems less of a problem now, in part because of the widespread practice of developing performance measurement or operationalizing variables on the basis of the program theory.</s><s xml:id="_AdKmMgp">However, the ways program theory are used to guide evaluation are often simplistic.</s><s xml:id="_aTEYHYv">In many cases the evaluation consists only of gathering evidence about each of the components in the logic model, and answering the question "Did this happen?"</s><s xml:id="_4nC6Wad">about each one.</s><s xml:id="_KcwTKw3">Although this can be useful in reporting on the program or policy in terms of a coherent performance story, it does not use the full potential of program theory evaluation, including its ability to address the issue of causal attribution.</s></p><p xml:id="_D6bBdAU"><s xml:id="_Uj3uK7A">There are three possible responses to the challenge of causal attribution.</s><s xml:id="_26ANhwD">One is to give up the attempt to use program theory evaluation for this purpose, deciding to use it only "to improve, not to prove."</s><s xml:id="_nn9yJur">Another option is to combine program theory with other methods for causal</s></p><p xml:id="_2cxZpXf"><s
