health systems strengthening is necessary to address this critical context.</s><s xml:id="_gJp58gA">mHealth has the potential to reduce inequalities in care through a variety of applications that aim to facilitate the communication between clients and providers, promote women's behavioral change, simplify and extend training, and assist in data collection;
