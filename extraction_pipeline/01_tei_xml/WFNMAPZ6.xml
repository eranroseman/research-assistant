measures of the identified AI-based conversational agents and their effects on the targeted chronic conditions were broad and not unified.</s><s xml:id="_NVGN7VF">The most commonly reported

different disease types, this variation complicates the comparability within and between conditions.</s><s xml:id="_cfqPa6T">Future research could aim at first developing and evaluating within-chronic disease-related differences of AI-based conversational agents (eg, individual chatbots for asthma, COPD, and sleep apnea as examples of chronic respiratory diseases) before extending their scope of research to between-chronic disease-related comparisons (eg, respiratory vs cardiovascular chronic conditions).</s></p><p xml:id="_YdYUnyM"><s xml:id="_u7YrKbK">Following such a research agenda could lead to the development of more consistent studies with higher standards and increased validity of reported findings.</s><s xml:id="_pKjzHkT">Similar considerations concern the large variety of reported health goals; while self-care management is the main health goal of 30% of existing AI-based conversational agents for chronic conditions before offering assistance of disease monitoring, the remaining 70% address intervention goals such as general conversation, therapy, education, and diagnosis.</s><s xml:id="_EgzFJbR">This inconsistency presents another complication of the comparability of the existing chatbots.</s></p><p xml:id="_nQ5prua"><s xml:id="_7QJuHD8">Of the studies investigated, 70% were quasi-experimental, 20% RCTs, and the remaining 10% proof-of-concept.</s><s

xml:id="_GmDTpDB">For a better understanding of the real-world effects of AI-based conversational agents on health care for chronic diseases, future research should aim at conducting field experiments, which in the best case are designed as longitudinal experimentations in order to investigate long-term effects.</s><s xml:id="_tWvx2EE">This is especially important when considering the time span of chronic diseases; they typically affect patients for at least 12 months but can prevail for a significantly longer period of a patient's life span <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[39]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_EghWTqy"><s xml:id="_5pexjuf">It is further noteworthy to point out that the only 2 RCTs of this review mentioned a commercial interest in the investigated

connections in order to enrich the chatbots' evaluation by a purely external point of view.</s></p><p xml:id="_M5t4mP4"><s xml:id="_sqsnV7T">While it is not unexpected to find that patients were the majority of targeted intervention partners, it is somewhat surprising to see that only 2 conversational agents further included additional social contacts of patients, here the patients' parents.</s><s xml:id="_svWbgVC">We want to highlight that chronic diseases often heavily affect the immediate and wider social context of the affected patient <ref type="bibr"

future research.</s></p><p xml:id="_FfxATbU"><s xml:id="_zdJ3zQe">One potential danger of such presumably naturally conversing chatbots is harm or even death of the patient in case the chatbot's

addition, it hinders the development of a generic system architecture, which could be used as an informative framework for the development and structure of AI-based chatbots in the context of health care for chronic diseases.</s><s xml:id="_VwXJ8E4">We strongly advise future researchers to report all necessary technical features required to replicate study results and further (partially or exemplarily) allow access to the developed AI-based conversational systems.</s><s xml:id="_KMKbRsr">In addition to the above-mentioned standardized guidelines for research in health care, future
