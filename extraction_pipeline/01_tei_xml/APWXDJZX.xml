medications, and thus a greater need to complete paperwork, track conditions, manage medications, make decisions, and plan for the future. <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">1</ref> This process of managing various aspects of personal health information (PHI), which includes organization, integration, and use of information, has been called PHI management (PHIM). <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref></s><s xml:id="_CVZjjYb">dvances in health information technologies (HITs), such as assistive living technologies, self-management monitoring systems, patient portals, and health dashboards have helped patients to gather, track, and organize their health information both within and outside of clinical settings. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref></s><s xml:id="_S6d4enJ">4]<ref type="bibr">[5]</ref> Some HITs have improved patients' quality of life, relationship with their doctor, <ref type="bibr"

engage in PHIM than older adults in assisted living where PHIM work was generally transferred to staff.</s><s xml:id="_qTZpYJ9">These results align with recent studies focusing on patient work, which

xml:id="_sEYe5RZ">While patient work seeks to support health, it can often be invisible to the medical community, and is thus crucial to understand and to incorporate into HIT. <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">51</ref></s><s xml:id="_WSqEPpW">ver the last 20 years there has been increased focus on research related to successful aging, emphasizing the importance of social support systems,

maintain wellness and independence and continue living fully for as long as possible.</s><s xml:id="_RES5uSw">Most participants were not aware of performing PHIM activities because they were healthy and were more focused on activities they cared about, such as spending time with family and friends.</s><s xml:id="_s7WKKvB">Our interviews reinforced prior findings regarding the importance of incorporating wellness information into HIT systems for older adults. <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">46</ref></s><s xml:id="_uM2b7ZG">Although older adults lag behind younger adults in adopting new technologies 9 many of our participants actively sought health information online, used patient portals, and owned cell phones.</s><s xml:id="_ekzJCpY">It is important to envision what an effective system to support PHIM would be for those facing the dynamic process of aging with potential physical and cognitive decline.</s><s xml:id="_tq8zfXR">Designing for older adults must also take into account the variety of approaches to PHIM activities as they relate to both maintaining health and monitoring illness.</s><s xml:id="_UftS6Pf">Current patient portals generally focus on the latter.</s></p><p xml:id="_eSDYkFK"><s xml:id="_vMGAY5T">Approaches to PHIM activities are dynamic and sensitive to changes often outside the control of older adults, such as illness and changes in vision, mobility, memory, and support networks.</s><s xml:id="_UEDzVHM">These changes may require additional supportive technologies such as walkers or wheelchairs, care services, or asking for help from friends and family.</s><s xml:id="_EZBUfVd">Within our study, each PHIM approach taken was dependent on and interacted with personal habits, motivations, and goals.</s><s xml:id="_jgAAddV">So, choices to pile or file were influenced by both organizational habits and decisions related to whether then information was "just-in-time," "just-at-hand," "just-in-case," or "just-because." <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">54</ref></s><s xml:id="_cjDUeYP">articipants were motivated by what was easiest and best in terms of information storage and access at a particular point in time, often based on their needs for support and their perception of the usefulness, availability, accuracy and timeliness of the information. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">34</ref></s><s xml:id="_3P58awJ">This was evident in patients who had had an acute illness or cancer and would carefully file PHI at one point in time and then stop when in remission, or participants who chose to use a patient portal while stopping their storage of paper-based health information.</s><s xml:id="_4Wjtk8q">Participants' choice to keep papers out in places where they would visually remind them to do a health related task was another easiest and best scenario.</s><s xml:id="_G99VhN2">Effective HIT design must take into account the importance of understanding these points of intersecting influences when attempting to design for patient access to and retrieval of PHI.</s><s xml:id="_3QrGVun">For example, based on our findings, it might be anticipated that most older adults will rarely check the patient portal when healthy and therefore the portal is not necessarily a good venue for routine communications or reminders to update emergency information.</s></p><p xml:id="_tv78jNn"><s xml:id="_NsBGESC">Different forms of social support become important with aging and the impact of and need for PHIM support networks for older adults is clear. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">55</ref></s><s xml:id="_S6M5Eus">In our previous research, participants described varying levels of sharing of information and tasks, and differing sizes of PHIM support networks. <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">48,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b54">56</ref></s><s xml:id="_hSCHgEn">We found that participants expressed varying needs for sharing PHIM activities based on their situation.</s><s xml:id="_fWkBbZH">For instance, older adults were more likely to allow involvement of others in their PHIM as they moved from independent living to retirement facilities, and from retirement facilities to assisted living.</s><s xml:id="_v9q7BbT">Those who were willing to share some information while continuing to manage their PHI either were sharing to augment their PHIM practices, or to keep the communication channels open for family and friends.</s><s xml:id="_29DcX9c">As with other aspects of PHIM, these relationships were dynamic, often changing over time and depending on the situation.</s><s xml:id="_Gy2aMSW">Children or friends that were listed as important at one point of time, could change because of moving, growing responsibilities, a falling out, or a newly formed connection.</s></p><p xml:id="_6G6rV5C"><s xml:id="_E5MVmgV">Those who did not want to share information or PHIM expressed a desire to maintain independence and not burden others. <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">57</ref></s><s xml:id="_GG5KZNV">As designers look at ways to support sharing and communication, <ref type="bibr" target="#b56">58,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b57">59</ref> it is important to remember that these needs and preferences are dynamic and are influenced by a variety of sociotechnical factors and contexts. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">30,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">60</ref></s><s xml:id="_KW3CPhe">Nearly all older adults wanted control over what, when, and with whom health information was shared.</s><s xml:id="_3VJnb6S">One design strategy that could support older adults as they plan for the future and think about the types of health information they would like to share is using "What if" videos, similar to what is available to help create advanced directives (<ref type="url" target="https://prepareforyourcare.org/welcome">https://prepare- foryourcare.org/welcome</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_B5VwZaX">Such tools could help older adults think through who, what, and when they would like to share health information with others.</s></p><p xml:id="_y2NQuxX"><s xml:id="_2wZG5Kb">PHIM can be a burden. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">50</ref></s><s xml:id="_2wy8zu8">We found that consistently performing certain PHIM activities such as tracking or updating emergency planning materials was difficult.</s><s xml:id="_udSUery">Our population was generally healthy and interested in PHIM to the extent that it maintained their health.</s><s xml:id="_ctN2G6f">Individuals tended to stop PHIM activities when they were acutely ill.</s><s xml:id="_PHHbkSf">This is consistent with findings by Ancker, 50 who interviewed adults (mean age 64 years) with multiple chronic diseases and found that health information management was a burden for those who are ill or debilitated.</s><s xml:id="_J23ZdKj">PHIM systems must support the variable role others play in performing PHIM activities when individuals are not up for performing this work. <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">50</ref></s><s xml:id="_wW62Cyc">Some older adults preferred not to anticipate decline or lack of wellness. <ref type="bibr" target="#b59">61</ref></s><s xml:id="_FzCmsdc">This translated to a lack of preparing for future events, whether small disrup-tions such as minor illness, or large disruptions such as medical emergencies.</s><s xml:id="_AhHzwMp">There is a need for researchers and HIT designers to consider how to best encourage and support planning for future changes, particularly because research
