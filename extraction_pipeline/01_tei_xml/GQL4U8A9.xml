(2009, p. 9</ref>) list the special features of shared interfaces as 'encouraging externalisation, …[providing a ] rich set of cognitive tools, providing structure to a task, designing for different ability levels and supporting reflection' through structure and logging tools.</s><s xml:id="_d47c87F"><ref type="bibr" target="#b56">Rogers and Rodden (2003)</ref> propose responses to a cogent set of uncertainties and tensions that arise in shared displays while <ref type="bibr">Scott et al. (2003a)</ref> cite the need to support natural interpersonal interactions, smooth transitions and simultaneous actions with tabletops.</s><s xml:id="_Xp7z2nE">However, such guidelines, invaluable though they are, tend to give us the 'what' rather than the how and why.</s><s xml:id="_uhHgJaD">The latter require a more psychological perspective, explaining how it is that people manage to coordinate interactions in everyday social interactions.</s><s xml:id="_YFRFVm2">An especially illuminating way to do this is to look at the emergence of collaboration, a thriving area in developmental psychology.</s><s xml:id="_rXfD7hb"><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">Tomasello (2009)</ref> premises the distinctive human ability to collaborate on our evolved disposition for shared intentionality, which is based on attention, background knowledge and a drive to cooperate.</s><s xml:id="_sVdPExR">In this paper we translate these properties into three mechanisms of interaction that can be used to inform the design of shareable interfaces.</s><s xml:id="_f62fmGx">We can understand how best to design and use such interfaces if we are clear about what it is that gives them their apparently natural and motivating properties in supporting interaction, and what makes them an apparently superior means of collaboration, compared for example to paper, remote sharing or individual devices.</s><s xml:id="_Wa934JW">We therefore draw on examples from our own research with young children learning to collaborate and with groups who have difficulties with collaboration, to produce a framework that recognises some of the challenges of collaboration that may be hidden when studying only competent collaboration, and when observing users who recover quickly and silently from breakdowns of collaboration <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Easterbrook, 1996)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_P7ArtbX"><s xml:id="_zPvebBB">New multi-user interfaces represent a qualitative shift in supporting collaborative groupwork: the freedom of input enables gesturing, speaking, and touching.</s><s xml:id="_GuqBRwK">These can all be seen, heard and experienced by others whereas mouse clicking and key pressing are individual, private acts.</s><s xml:id="_DEuAHYF">While such actions may become largely invisible to those executing them, as they are so familiar, their enaction, in contrast, remains visible to others.</s><s xml:id="_K8EjRrk">Developers of surface technologies and tangibles have been inventive in logging and presenting information about users' interactions, in the hope of improving people's interactions, e.g.</s><s xml:id="_XcA8kYC">making them more equitable <ref type="bibr">(e.g. diMicco et al., 2007</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">, Bachour et al., 2008)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gMth5jY">Surfaces, tangibles and shareable public displays also enable simultaneous control by multiple users.</s><s xml:id="_sxaJb6a">These technologies therefore provide striking new opportunities for awareness --gesture, body orientation and more so-called 'natural' means of communication, for making salient in displays the availability of information supported by the public space provided, and for equitable simultaneous control, such as 'entry points' <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Rogers et al., 2008)</ref> to the technology.</s><s xml:id="_ufWSDEt">In this typology, collaboration might look easy.</s><s xml:id="_6sxvtcf">But if it is so natural, why is it that not every such application is a success?</s><s xml:id="_A2W58fb">For example, why does increasing awareness of spoken contributions sometimes lead to lower productivity and lack of equitable participation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(di Micco et al., 2007)</ref>?</s><s xml:id="_D6bebsk">Why might users show less equal contributions with multitouch applications than with single-touch <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">(Harris et al., 2009)</ref>?</s><s xml:id="_cHev8qV">And do the advantages of such interfaces compensate for the loss of feedback or trace of interactions provided in traditional GUIs <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Norman, 2010)</ref>?</s></p><p xml:id="_U6a3St2"><s xml:id="_TQpUSBT">The answers to these questions are needed to understand, support and explain the effective design of new user interfaces for multiple users (e.g. with tabletops, public displays, tangibles), that can capitalize on the mechanisms we have identified above to facilitate new forms of collaboration, e.g., in decision-making, brainstorming, planning, learning and creating.</s><s xml:id="_YxzXggT">In what ways can an interface exploit people's implicit social behaviours for good social effect?</s><s xml:id="_9hBvARA">Can they be designed to make it more obvious as to how to behave and give appropriate cues?</s><s xml:id="_ZV9khD2">Is it possible to make more salient the cues that can lead to improved understanding, explication of intentions and focus of attention?</s><s xml:id="_G6axTeN">Can people become more aware of what is good collaboration and conduct through interacting with a given interface?</s><s xml:id="_7ap9snH">Our goal is to provide a principled way for researchers and designers to be able to make sense of the emerging empirical literature on the benefits of multi-user interfaces, and to enable them to make predictions about their value for collaboration.</s><s xml:id="_Z8vKJzN">We present the mechanisms framework to inform the design of interfaces for collaboration through considering social-psychological properties of shared intentionality.</s><s xml:id="_4uA6NXm">These properties can explain why a multi-touch surface that enables simultaneous interaction may be less effective at facilitating collaboration than a single-touch interface, why gesturebased interactions might be better than mouse-based or tangible interactions for collaborative learning and why apparently minor increases in salience of users' actions can have big effects on the connectedness of social interaction.</s></p><p xml:id="_YUVTUQA"><s xml:id="_6x664cD">We first define the three mechanisms, awareness, control and availability of information, based on the psychological literature on processes of social development, and we illustrate them in the light of existing literature on tabletops designed for collaborative work.</s><s xml:id="_7pWdZU6">We then explain the crucial role of constraints on these mechanisms, using the psychological literature on social development to show how constraints support smooth social interaction, and identifying three sources from which constraints can arise, again using examples from the literature on tabletops.</s><s xml:id="_z4hVjRB">We next present three case studies illustrating how the framework of mechanisms and constraints can be used to design for and evaluate collaboration.</s><s xml:id="_HKFeGu9">We finish by showing how the framework could be used by designers of collaborative applications on multi-user interfaces, for a wide range of audiences, from family groups at leisure, through children working collaboratively in formal settings to remedial work supporting people with social, sensory and language impairments.</s></p></div>

group.</s><s xml:id="_RHmkmrU">This case study shows how the mechanisms can be extended to digitally-augmented tangible objects.</s><s xml:id="_yy7w9ut">As these are usually based on cultural artefacts that already exist, there is robust background information available about how the objects are to be used, functionally and socially.</s><s xml:id="_SyKy2MB">In the AKC, this is built on by

xml:id="_w6YXA9v"><s xml:id="_QtBs68W">We have highlighted different sources of constraint to help designers think about the many different ways in which constraints can be modified.</s><s xml:id="_mttQcYq">For example, awareness can involve any sense modality, alone or in combination, and haptic and audio channels could be used more extensively, particularly in the case of tangibles.</s><s xml:id="_RKT6EnS">The focus is often on technological sources of constraint but it is important to be aware of</s></p><p xml:id="_9hnMcjt"><s xml:id="_E37T7Hc">the role of constraints that operate without being explicitly designed in, such as implicit norms about group behaviour.</s><s xml:id="_YZ5JDzs">Underlying assumptions of how to behave have powerful effects which we sometimes see better when we move beyond the lab or design studio, and beyond the easily available user.</s><s xml:id="_QJCEH4V">Considering how variations in constraints of different types influence the mechanisms of behaviour can support the systematic empirical investigation of design on collaborative interaction and provides a strong bridge between HCI and psychology.</s><s xml:id="_bFJJm4b">• Awareness, control and availability: questions to ask When considering what users will be aware of from moment to moment, we need to consider what information is at hand and how it is constrained.</s><s xml:id="_vfaBsWU">This requires consideration of orientation of display, presence of personal 'territories' for users, size of surface in relation to users, amount of information a user is able to apprehend, possibility of users interfering with each other's awareness and the role of personal technologies that might require sharing, or might inhibit mutual awareness.</s><s xml:id="_ZnrUJTQ">Designers need to consider how control by different users can be coordinated or constrained, how this might be orchestrated by the technology, by the users, or by the technology having a role in moving control from the technology to the group, and the extent to which users might undo each other's work or might need to negotiate agreement.</s><s xml:id="_bRcVYUE">For availability, we need to consider what information is made manifest, and whether</s></p><p xml:id="_6773BCY"><s xml:id="_wnhmute">there are implicit norms underlying the use of such information.</s><s xml:id="_gV52VV5">The norms may be implicit but not shared.</s><s xml:id="_k3wPxtT">Multi-user technology has the capacity to present otherwise hidden information to the users' mutual awareness, and hence users' potential to control how this information is used to support better collaboration.</s></p><p xml:id="_THSkkXZ"><s xml:id="_gRGnnzY">• Designing for different user groups</s></p><p xml:id="_WJc8h8J"><s xml:id="_gzynQ9d">We have placed a particular focus in our review on user groups beyond the typical.</s></p><p xml:id="_WP34ZFH"><s xml:id="_5dH5v3Q">Designing for users who are less able to self-regulate naturally leads to the idea that the technology has to constrain in order to ensure, e.g. that users behave equitably, take turns and focus on the information that is most important.</s><s xml:id="_Bg4nFCB">However, there may be cases, particularly in pedagogical design, when designers may want to relax constraints, perhaps gradually, so that users develop the ability to self-regulate, either through their own behaviour or through altering the way that the technology operates throughout an interaction session.</s><s xml:id="_rrAqkmU">This gives technology an important role in constrain control, which might help focus attention but prompts a need to negotiate turn-taking.</s><s xml:id="_z88DxPu">If this negotiation is difficult, the designer could choose to constrain control by using identification of users to enforce turn-taking.</s><s xml:id="_JRkRgJ5">In multi-touch, all can act simultaneously, so several events can occur simultaneously in users' peripheral field of attention, reducing awareness of what others are doing.</s><s xml:id="_9ryvTMw">Control is less constrained than in single-touch and users might find this liberating, if actions are not very interdependent, or frustrating, if one user's action is contingent on another's.</s></p><p xml:id="_Kfh2B3u"><s xml:id="_7PpjGJg">Multi-touch can work well when seeking to support serendipitous effects and creative solutions.</s></p><p xml:id="_rv4SnKR"><s xml:id="_urTv7Gg">• The value of availability of background information and making norms explicit Ambient displays have great potential for conveying background information in real time, e.g. on contribution, previous actions, use of space.</s><s xml:id="_b6F4Jvz">However, making such information transparent is not enough: designers have to consider how this information is to be used.</s><s xml:id="_ZAvhfzn">Such displays rely on the group accepting and abiding by the social norm that underlies the design.</s><s xml:id="_Yp9MDvE">In this sense it is a low constraint, since people can simply choose to ignore the display.</s><s xml:id="_g8TkjfF">When there is little mutuality about the background assumptions and no easy way to step outside the task to discuss them, this sort of approach seems doomed to failure.</s><s xml:id="_DdWhZHm">Previous research largely ignores the norms that prevail in multi-user settings, in part because studies are often carried out in relatively artificial lab settings.</s><s xml:id="_njbdvu4">The potentially important but hidden effects of availability suggest the need to consider users' underlying assumptions.</s><s xml:id="_qB4Gq9X">Providing such background information could be used as an opportunity for focusing users' awareness on group processes, allowing them to reflect as a group on how they might be guided by this information.</s></p></div>
