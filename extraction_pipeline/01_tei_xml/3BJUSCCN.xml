blood.</s><s xml:id="_GEdtMzU">Blood sugar levels are normally controlled by insulin, a hormone released by the pancreas.</s><s xml:id="_aFw6aHK">In people with type 2 diabetes (the commonest form of diabetes), blood sugar control fails because the fat and muscle cells that normally respond to insulin by removing excess sugar from the blood become less responsive to insulin.</s><s xml:id="_Z96PVpu">Type 2 diabetes, which was previously known as adult-onset diabetes, can often initially be controlled with diet and exercise, and with antidiabetic drugs such as metformin and sulfonylureas.</s><s xml:id="_qsacfNa">However, as the disease progresses, the pancreatic beta cells, which make insulin, become impaired and patients may eventually need insulin injections.</s><s xml:id="_HpCCupE">Long-term complications of diabetes, which include an increased risk of cardiovascular problems such as heart disease and stroke, reduce the life expectancy of people with diabetes by about 10 years compared to people without diabetes.</s></p><p xml:id="_ayzmJRU"><s xml:id="_5DUVD6C">Why Was This Study Done?</s><s xml:id="_sZP8dUN">Type 2 diabetes is becoming increasingly common worldwide so better preventative strategies are essential.</s><s xml:id="_QRJAKKU">It is well-established that regular aerobic exercise-physical activity in which the breathing and heart rate increase noticeably such as jogging, brisk walking, and swimming-lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes.</s><s xml:id="_2JNzctz">The World Health Organization currently recommends that adults should do at least 150 min/week of moderate-tovigorous aerobic physical activity to reduce the risk of diabetes and other non-communicable diseases.</s><s xml:id="_Eg8G85K">It also recommends that adults should undertake muscle-strengthening and conditioning activities such as weight training and yoga on two or more days a week.</s><s xml:id="_KgYz5QB">However, although studies have shown that muscle-strengthening activity improves glycemic control in people who already have diabetes, it is unclear whether this form of exercise prevents diabetes.</s><s xml:id="_QN586HM">In this prospective cohort study (a study in which disease development is followed up over time in a group of people whose characteristics are recorded at baseline), the researchers investigated the association of muscle-strengthening activities with the risk of type 2 diabetes in women.</s></p><p xml:id="_GpY74Ha"><s xml:id="_Ttbw9FX">What Did the Researchers Do and Find?</s><s xml:id="_c24pphc">The

diseases in women, for 8 years.</s><s xml:id="_TFenGKG">The women provided information on weekly participation in muscle-strengthening exercise (for example, weight training), lower intensity muscleconditioning exercises (for example, yoga and toning), and aerobic moderate and vigorous physical activity (aerobic MVPA) at baseline and 4 years later.</s><s xml:id="_xCQnRNM">During the study 3,491 women developed diabetes.</s><s xml:id="_RyCNub9">After allowing for major risk factors for type 2 diabetes (for example, diet and a family history of diabetes) and for aerobic MVPA, compared to women who did no muscle-strengthening or conditioning exercise, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes among women declined with increasing participation in muscle-strengthening and conditioning activity.</s><s xml:id="_XXXXwkQ">Notably, women who did more than 150 min/week of these types of exercise had 40% lower risk of developing diabetes as women who did not exercise in this way at all.</s><s xml:id="_9UuNd9V">Muscle-strengthening and muscle-conditioning exercise were both independently associated with reduced diabetes risk, and women who engaged in at least 150 min/ week of aerobic MVPA and at least 60 min/week of musclestrengthening exercise were a third as likely to develop diabetes as inactive women.</s></p><p xml:id="_xkS7wET"><s xml:id="_p86q38m">What Do These Findings Mean?</s><s xml:id="_NtNT7rd">These findings show that, among the women enrolled in NHS and NHSII, engagement in muscle-strengthening and conditioning activities lowered the risk of type 2 diabetes independent of aerobic MVPA.</s><s xml:id="_VMfyGrK">That is, non-aerobic exercise provided protection against diabetes in women who did no aerobic exercise.</s><s xml:id="_esGGvxN">Importantly, they also show that doing both aerobic exercise and muscle-strengthening exercise substantially reduced the risk of type 2 diabetes.</s><s xml:id="_xhA4Ucq">Because nearly all the participants in NHS and NHSII were of European ancestry, these results may not be generalizable to women of other ethnic backgrounds.</s><s xml:id="_mShkr9k">Moreover, the accuracy of these findings may be limited by the use of self-administered questionnaires to determine how much exercise the women undertook.</s><s xml:id="_JsbKVWM">Nevertheless, these findings support the
