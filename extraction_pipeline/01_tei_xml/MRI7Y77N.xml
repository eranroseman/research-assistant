<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_cBQXhzY">Introduction</head><p xml:id="_MnrmstE"><s xml:id="_2zmhEwR">Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine disorder that affects 8-15% of women in their reproductive years <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zQhGRTs">The diagnosis of PCOS requires at least two of the following three criteria: (i) oligo-ovulation or anovulation (irregular or no menstrual cycle), (ii) clinical hyperandrogenism (hirsutism) and/or biochemical signs of hyperandrogenism (elevated free androgen index or elevated testosterone levels), (iii) polycystic ovarian morphology (by transvaginal ultrasound), and the exclusion of other etiologies that might cause hyperandrogenism <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NcjFKqX">Most women with PCOS experience one or more of the following physical symptoms in varying degrees: hirsutism (excessive body hair growth), acne, infertility, obesity, insulin resistance and dyslipidemia <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_UnUCJC2"><s xml:id="_UwFttRv">Women with PCOS experience more depressive and anxiety complaints, have lower selfesteem, and experience a more negative body image compared to women without PCOS <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_G5jh66P">In particular, depression scores are significantly higher <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> and seem to be consistently elevated throughout the lifespan of women with PCOS compared to controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_MRZVx8d">A recent meta-analysis of depression rates among women with PCOS resulted in a median prevalence of depression of almost 37% compared to 14% in controls <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5pbfg9C">Hence, the recent international guideline on PCOS states that depressive and anxiety symptoms should be screened, assessed and managed with the requirement for awareness of emotional wellbeing <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref> Women with PCOS and BMI � 30 kg/m 2 have significantly higher depression rates compared to women with PCOS and a healthy BMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3KdNEXn">A 5% to 10% weight loss improves many PCOS features, including psychological factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mhUSp7m">It is unclear how these psychological improvements are generated and whether these psychological improvements are sustained in the long-term.</s><s xml:id="_JSxFTgX">One of the first lifestyle (LS) interventions in women with PCOS was developed by Clark and colleagues.</s><s xml:id="_adSCesv">This involved 6 months of seminars covering weight-related topics and resulted in significantly lower depression scores, although no control group was used <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_AkE5KuV">Thompson and colleagues developed a 20-week diet and exercise intervention and found significant improvements with respect to depression during the first 10 weeks of the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_HJNfTMG">It is unclear why depression scores did not improve after 10 weeks as participants continued their weight loss and PCOS symptoms improved <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_x38KYZh">A more recent paper demonstrated that a 16-week LS intervention programme resulted in better quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_YmmpKuh">This LS intervention included behavioral modification strategies, although these specific strategies were not described <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_94mgJSw">Others found improvements in depression, health-related quality of life and self-esteem during a high-protein and low-carbohydrate diet, but not in the amount of weight loss <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_WXY7T6A"><s xml:id="_xxEhHAG">In the general population there is a bidirectional association between obesity and the odds of depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2Un2Cr8">In women with PCOS the results are inconclusive: some authors concluded that women with PCOS and a higher BMI are more depressed, while others suggest the opposite.</s><s xml:id="_ThqpsGg">Women with PCOS still have higher odds for depressive and anxiety symptoms when matched for BMI <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hCQajz7">A recent review presented potential mechanisms other than obesity for the increased depression risk in women with PCOS.</s><s xml:id="_gjY9Ndt">Insulin resistance, increased testosterone levels, higher hirsutism scores measured by the modified Ferriman-Gallwey questionnaire, infertility due to oligo-ovulation, increased corticotrophin-releasing hormone, increased cortisol, markers of inflammation, low vitamin D status <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, and elevated Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, may contribute to the association between PCOS and depression.</s><s xml:id="_Gs9n4uh">Despite the evidence that women with PCOS have increased odds for depression and anxiety, there is no evidence supporting a single etiology for this increased prevalence of depression and anxiety <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hnfnP3f">Thus it remains unclear whether depression is related to one of the above mechanisms and if depression rates could change through weight loss.</s></p><p xml:id="_w3YyyVb"><s xml:id="_5WAbatR">The first-line treatment for depression is cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and, depending on the setting, can be combined with antidepressant treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KNwkC7g">In the general population, long-term results are mixed; some meta-analysis found CBT to be equally effective compared to other psychological treatments while other meta-analysis found favorable results for CBT <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_nkPayBK">Little research has been undertaken concerning CBT among women with PCOS.</s><s xml:id="_rb7CDzV">A pilot study demonstrated that 8 weeks of 30 minutes' CBT combined with 30 minutes' LS sessions resulted in a significant improvement in quality of life but no improvements in depression scores were observed <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ghW632Z">A recent randomized control trial (RCT) showed that 8 CBT group sessions of 45 to 60 minutes was effective for psychological fatigue and quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hAt35qG">In the new PCOS guideline there is no referral to a specific treatment for depression in women with PCOS, and the advice is to follow regional clinical guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_kX8qjh5"><s xml:id="_yEVmpPe">In conclusion, previous studies covered study periods of 24 weeks at most, were not randomized controlled trials, had small sample sizes, and did not use a structured CBT protocol.</s><s xml:id="_vWfhwgY">Hence, we investigated whether a CBT programme for women with PCOS who were overweight and obese achieved weight loss in the long-term in a large sample.</s><s xml:id="_q6u3Zx9">The aim of this secondary analysis was to compare the changes in depression scores in a three-component CBT LS intervention (with or without SMS), with these scores in the control group.</s><s xml:id="_A3UxY3v">In addition, the effectiveness of additional SMS on self-esteem and body image was examined.</s><s xml:id="_fyhPCBV">We hypothesized that there is an interaction of androgens (testosterone, androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA)), insulin, HOMA-IR, and cortisol, on well-being scores in women with PCOS.</s><s xml:id="_WTXaS7T">Hence, we tested whether the relationship between lifestyle treatment and wellbeing is mediated by changes in androgens (testosterone, androstenedione and DHEA), insulin, HOMA-IR,
