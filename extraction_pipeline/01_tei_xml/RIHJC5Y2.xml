<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_kxYqxqa">Community is the key unit of identity in CBPR</head><p xml:id="_j8EVrER"><s xml:id="_TaymMmM">In most branches of psychology, participants are individuals, and individuals are the primary unit of identity.</s><s xml:id="_fMpegdz">CBPR practitioners acknowledge that individuals belong to larger, socially constructed identities that shape strengths, challenges and disparities.</s><s xml:id="_U4vaGEw">Thus, individuals are viewed as embedded within their communities, which are characterized by connection and identification with other individuals, common symbol systems, shared values and norms, mutual influence, common interests, and joint commitment to meeting shared needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Wallerstein et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_P8uUAWT">Communities may be defined by geographical boundaries or may be dispersed across geographical place but have a common identity or shared fate <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">(Wallerstein et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SdmnsxH">Communities must be defined, engaged and involved in the research process to maximize the psychological and physical health of their constituents.</s><s xml:id="_juqWwtH">A CBPR framework has often been applied in working with marginalized communities that experience health disparities and inequities; however, CBPR principles may be applied in work with various types of communities, including those not traditionally considered marginalized (e.g., police officers, health care workers, business management).</s></p></div>
