pattern of opting out in parallel with relapse is supported by an analysis by Heminger et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, who found that participants who opted out of the text messaging

results are to the SmokefreeTXT user population, as their analysis occurred in the context of a clinical trial and most participants remained enrolled in the program.</s><s xml:id="_saDbfU3">The potential differences in how users interact with text-messaging programs within and outside a research setting are potentially large, given that in the study by Heminger et al <ref type="bibr"

opting out for users who were frequently around other smokers, compared to users who were never around other smokers.</s><s xml:id="_93VHtbp">This finding could indicate that people who are only sometimes around other smokers (almost one-third of SmokefreeTXT users) face unexpected cravings that they are not prepared for and indicates the potential need for additional skill building early in the quit attempt to help plan for and resist unexpected cravings.</s><s xml:id="_SH9n78e">One way to do this could be to provide additional reminders about the on-demand keyword functionality embedded

tailoring; smokers with higher versus lower levels of nicotine dependence might benefit from different forms, doses, or schedules of pharmaceutical support to achieve long-term smoking cessation.</s><s xml:id="_4MMvbEb">For example, evaluations of pharmacotherapy for cessation show that smokers with higher levels of nicotine dependence benefit more from combination pharmacotherapy (ie, combinations of smoking cessation medications) than smokers with lower levels of nicotine dependence.</s><s xml:id="_HnD8WzS">Currently, nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) or other pharmaceutical cessation aids are not provided to SmokefreeTXT users.</s><s xml:id="_Zk3gAr8">Nonetheless, there is potential opportunity to increase the use of NRT, particularly among SmokefreeTXT users with the highest levels of nicotine dependence, by tailoring the intervention to provide additional suggestions and information on the use of NRT in this group.</s><s xml:id="_9cPTmP4">Additionally, the use of pharmaceutical therapies for cessation is higher among former smokers who visited a physician in the year before they quit smoking <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[48]</ref>; thus, identifying ways to integrate clinical care, where access to pharmaceuticals is increased, and digital cessation care might also lead to more successful quitting attempts and motivation to stay engaged with a text message-based cessation program.</s><s xml:id="_MjGQPUd">One example of integration of clinical and digital cessation is the use of the electronic health record to identify patients who currently smoke, which then prompts providers to offer tobacco dependence counseling and medication and include a referral to the local quit line <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_jjfyzqq">Within this framework, it could also be feasible for clinical practices to include referral to other digital tools like text messaging, depending on patient preference.</s></p><p xml:id="_KUQhe4j"><s xml:id="_Y53nSe6">People who enrolled within 1 week of starting their quit attempt were more likely to opt out than those who enrolled between 1 and 2 weeks before initiating their quit attempt.</s><s xml:id="_MnWxju4">One interpretation of this result is that greater exposure to preparation messages increased the odds of successfully quitting smoking.</s><s xml:id="_Wm8CwxX">This finding is in line with clinical practice guidelines, which recommend that smokers create a quit plan and take time to prepare for their quit attempt <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_HJBtGWP">Previous text messaging-based cessation interventions have also included time for preparation by requiring participants to set quit dates in the future <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">52,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b52">53]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_E72kNgd">However, when implemented in a real-world setting, there is no oversight about how much preparation a user receives and in our study population, almost 38% of users opted to initiate their quit attempt immediately and thus received no preparation messages.</s><s xml:id="_aNBNxSA">Further, requiring a specific amount of preparation may create a barrier to accessing support for a smoker who is ready to quit immediately.</s><s xml:id="_TWwcmXJ">Since SmokefreeTXT users are allowed to set their own quit date within a 2-week period, it is unclear what the impact would be if all users received the same amount of preparation messages.</s><s xml:id="_JMMgNEx">Further, it is unknown how users are selecting their initial quit date in this setting.</s><s xml:id="_wNDBWAP">Future research should examine the motivations and preferences of users setting their own quit dates and continue to explore this critical period of the cessation attempt.</s></p><p xml:id="_7tC92ST"><s xml:id="_hSadfhV">People who used the feature of resetting their quit date were less likely to opt out of SmokefreeTXT.</s><s xml:id="_tJbGvXN">Use of this feature was the only independent variable to show a protective effect with opting out and was associated with early and overall program retention.</s><s xml:id="_PbjRSDz">It is possible that use of this functionality represents smokers remaining committed to their cessation goals, especially as use of this feature is optional.</s><s xml:id="_mbXwNMb">Staying committed to a quit attempt is extremely important early on when the risk of smoking relapse is the highest; therefore, utilization of this feature could represent people who might have left after failing to initiate their quit attempt (ie, smoked on quit day), but instead of giving up on quitting smoking altogether and opting out, they immediately recommitted to quitting by using the reset feature.</s><s xml:id="_G4yAuRd">Thus, there is potential value in reframing a smoking lapse not as a failure but as part of the process of cessation that can still help smokers get to their end goal of being smoke free.</s><s xml:id="_6JkPJbp">Further investigation is needed to better understand this phenomenon and the best way to promote re-engagement in a cessation attempt after a slip or another setback.</s></p><p xml:id="_QGhzuFx"><s xml:id="_yxXdNnU">This study has several limitations that need to be considered.</s><s xml:id="_VwDm456">First, given the real-world implementation of this study, participant burden needed to be minimized; therefore, only two additional baseline items were added per user to the SmokefreeTXT sign up webpage.</s><s xml:id="_J5JWECt">As a result, complete information for all the independent variables of interest were not available for each user.</s><s xml:id="_YKpe7xX">However, as these data are all missing completely at random, future research could consider employing imputation techniques to allow for simultaneous examination of all independent variables of interest.</s><s xml:id="_YVYcJ38">Second, to reduce respondent burden, only single-item measures were used for data collection.</s><s xml:id="_pzRCfmk">However, validated items and scales were used when available.</s><s xml:id="_QHpp4sx">Additionally, this study focused on smoking context and motivational characteristics associated with retention and therefore did not measure all potential user characteristics of interest, such as measures of depression or stress, or other substance use behaviors like alcohol use.</s><s xml:id="_VvMyMDz">Fortunately, it appears that SmokefreeTXT users tolerated the additional items, as sign-up rates to the program were not reduced during the study.</s><s xml:id="_eH8tfqN">Therefore, a future implementation could consider adding more than two new items to the sign up webpage to expand data collection.</s><s xml:id="_vedqpzT">Lastly, this study was unable to account for the potential influence of technology-related characteristics; for example, previous use of text-messaging programs and cell phone availability during working hours or assessment of users' input on why they decided to opt out.</s><s xml:id="_ShPp8qA">Future qualitative studies might be particularly well suited to explore the larger contextual factors that impact a smokers' use and disuse of technology-based interventions.</s></p><p xml:id="_SdQUTZG"><s xml:id="_2DhgSMe">This study identified several important smoking context and motivational characteristics associated with opting out of a smoking cessation text-messaging program.</s><s xml:id="_kc3pzkF">Although some characteristics were associated with opting out over the entire 42-day cessation program, others were only influential very
