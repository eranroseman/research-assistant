mental phenomena such as fear, anxiety, anger, contamination disgust, embarrassment but also happiness <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_4UWEjVm">Decreased heart rate and

disorder (OCD).</s><s xml:id="_7w5A84A">Several types of OCD symptoms are linked with specific emotional profiles (eg, fear of contamination and contamination disgust, fear of harming or violating others, and guilt and shame), which could be detected using affective computing.</s><s xml:id="_BZnvMAP">Thierfelder et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> showed that an increase in heart rate and a decrease in heart rate variability (HRV) are indicative of an increase in stress during OCD events.</s><s xml:id="_c2xQhBx">Heart rate and HRV show distinctive patterns of anxiety when patients are exposed to fearful situations and relief when performing compulsive behavior.</s><s xml:id="_vBrNhhc">These patterns were found to be highly different between individuals but useful for distinguishing between cognitive stress, exposure and response prevention (ERP) episodes, and physical activity.</s></p><p xml:id="_PubXGQ4"><s xml:id="_ZQpr7TW">OCD is a burdensome psychiatric

incompleteness, that is, marked distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_BJTrEUG">Compulsions are repetitive or ritualized behaviors or actions the patient feels compelled to perform, despite their sometimes nonsensical nature <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_AJnzsks">Distress can arise from performing compulsions and when prevented from performing

compulsions (response prevention).</s><s xml:id="_qUP7eZn">During ERP, patients are asked to intermittently report their level of distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s

increase therapeutic learning <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_J6jU6jB">Therefore, monitoring distress levels during exposure is important for optimizing ERP and measuring the severity of symptoms in OCD.</s><s xml:id="_wKjnQaa">Similarly, when collected over time, distress can provide information about the progression and improvement of the condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_Xhu9svW"><s xml:id="_QRk7xn4">Many symptoms of OCD are directly related to specific objects or situations

using wearable devices may also be used to identify distress in patients with OCD caused by exposure during ERP sessions.</s><s xml:id="_dnxefQn">Additionally, relief through compulsive behavior is reflected in the recorded heart rate and HRV, but the results also suggest that a change in the environment or simple distractions may reduce anxiety.</s><s xml:id="_Rgdr49J">This paper aims to assess the possibility of using machine learning models for the detection of OCD events in the wild based on signals from wrist-worn devices.</s><s xml:id="_ZFAJ3V6">Automatic detection of OCD events will

spectra.</s><s xml:id="_dNRTKty">However, this is not common to all compulsive tasks and requires the need for an accelerometer on both hands to look for asymmetric movements.</s><s
