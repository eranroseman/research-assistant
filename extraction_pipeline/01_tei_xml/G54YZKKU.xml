<ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_BNAV73e">This work focuses on stress management in mental health.</s><s xml:id="_pB5PPvZ">Stress is associated with contextual factors such as activity, place, social setting, or time.</s><s xml:id="_SsDyT8T">For instance, some people become stressed around others, regardless of the activity or location.</s><s xml:id="_58h7CTk">As context could afect one's stress, a holistic view of contextual factors is needed to understand the causes of stress.</s><s xml:id="_q8veGNd">Moreover, users should identify causally related contextual factors for efective long-term stress management, given their routine and repetitive occurrence.</s></p><p xml:id="_YyNZeTQ"><s xml:id="_p5TMtvV">Yet, prior PI systems are limited in efectively supporting users in investigating contexts causally linked to stress.</s><s xml:id="_KDnNTsf">Existing studies have focused on presenting a correlation between factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b48">49]</ref>, but analyses overlooking the complex relationships within the data may lead to diferent conclusions.</s><s xml:id="_8qC6Zyg">For example, when identifying the efects of studying on stress, it is necessary to compare stress levels during studying and non-studying.</s><s xml:id="_RQxhSaM">However, comparing studying in a cafe to not studying in a dormitory may not be reasonable, as the diference in place could also infuence the causal relationship.</s><s xml:id="_ypguhaF">Instead, all other factors besides the factor of interest should be identical (e.g., comparing stress levels while studying in the cafe to those while not studying in the cafe) to ensure that the diference in outcome comes only from the factor of interest.</s><s xml:id="_75FHCKW">This shift from an 'apples-to-oranges comparison' to an 'apples-to-apples comparison' minimizes

settings when investigating causal relationships between context and stress is difcult.</s></p><p xml:id="_GBfNtNJ"><s xml:id="_vkJrwtf">To address such practical issues, we suggest a quasi-experimental approach with observational data in PI system design.</s><s xml:id="_Nr2sycj">Unlike the experimental approach, this method uses observational data obtained without random allocation of samples to the treatment and control groups.</s><s xml:id="_cUJW592">Before analyzing the causality of a specifc context, it balances the distribution of confounding factors (i.e., contexts other than that under analysis) between the two groups to minimize their efect on stress.</s><s xml:id="_r4bMNxK">If a signifcant diference in stress levels exists after balancing, we may conclude that the context has a causal relationship with stress.</s><s xml:id="_RPKHG7f">We opted to employ 'matching' among the various balancing methods, as it is intuitive and widely used <ref

causal analysis in DeepStress would empower PI system users with more alternatives, potentially motivating users to explore causal relationships from various angles.</s></p><p xml:id="_Xrb8cWM"><s xml:id="_tNTNt2j">In our follow-up diary study, DeepStress motivated participants to revisit the refection and data collection steps in the stage-based model.</s><s xml:id="_FngHKqm">They iterated refecting on whether each context's causal relationship was accurate while experiencing that context in their daily lives, which can be considered as 'refection-in-action' <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">[58]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_MzrDHJz">This difered from the main study's 'refection-on-action,' where they relied on analysis results or memory.</s><s xml:id="_6EnZdJj">From the data-sensemaking perspective, users utilized this active refection to fnd cases supporting hypotheses generated during the 'refection-on-action' process.</s><s xml:id="_NucqEpb">This process may help users construct a rationale for analysis results and expand their self-knowledge.</s><s xml:id="_YkJ33Xk">In addition, the participants recognized the need for further data collection, questioning whether the results could be reproduced with the new data.</s><s xml:id="_jqwxaKQ">Therefore, supporting continuous data collection is necessary to enable users to examine stressful contexts over any period of interest and to investigate how the relationships change over time.</s></p><p xml:id="_deW72sf"><s xml:id="_DuPeNNP">Given the recurring process after refecting on causal relationships, our system could be more benefcial when the value of the quasi-experimental approach exceeds the users' burden.</s><s xml:id="_v9XVXWJ">Previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[66,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b67">68]</ref> also emphasized balancing the benefts and burdens of self-tracking to encourage users to continue data collection while gaining new insights.</s></p><p xml:id="_UYM8m29"><s xml:id="_NEFurYE">First, DeepStress could be used with passively collected data, reducing the data collection burden.</s><s xml:id="_EX2VJTD">For instance, the system could assist users with diabetes in identifying behavioral causes of blood glucose spikes by utilizing sensor data, including accelerometers (physical activity), GPS (place), ambient light (sleep), and heart rate (stress), along with photos of food intake <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b55">56]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_n3fsFFf">By combining them with continuously monitored glucose levels, PI systems could estimate causal relationships and alert users to potential risk factors without requesting users' manual data collection.</s><s xml:id="_4btr7Kv">Moreover, it would be valuable for laborious cases that purely rely on selfexperimentations, such as identifying triggers of gastrointestinal discomfort.</s><s xml:id="_EBQ3tZW">Our approach reduces the complicated process of setting experiments and testing each case individually, as users can derive causality from data they naturally collect in their daily lives.</s></p><p xml:id="_nkuVgqh"><s xml:id="_2ATtDQe">Alternatively, we may reduce user burden by narrowing down the scope of data collection.</s><s xml:id="_pjApUhx">Given that users formulate hypotheses and assess them using self-tracking data <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>, PI systems could ofer specifc guidelines for data collection based on the hypotheses rather than simply requesting extensive data collection.</s><s xml:id="_XKhhMkb">The causal analysis process can be improved by referring to suggestions in <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>, letting users explore testable variables, conduct a preliminary analysis, and perform a main evaluation focusing on specifc hypotheses.</s><s xml:id="_eDk6N59">Furthermore, PI systems may empower users to start with a narrow, specifc question, such as determining whether context X increases their stress, as opposed to a more general inquiry about which contexts elevate stress levels.</s><s xml:id="_vk4Vg3j">This approach would enable users to collect sufcient samples for causal inference within a shorter period because the treatment condition is predefned.</s><s xml:id="_gC9hA9V">This facilitates the acquisition of more treated samples, which are often sparser than controlled ones.</s><s xml:id="_uNUwjk6">Considering the iterative nature of the refection-and-action cycle in PI systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>, users can identify relevant factors (to the initial context) during their exploration and subsequently conduct the same analysis on those factors.</s><s xml:id="_7uUKMCn">These approaches would encourage continued self-tracking for users to explore and test various aspects of daily life.</s></p></div>
