primary care settings and considering it in relation to depressive symptoms.</s><s xml:id="_T3CqqYV">Low PAM scores were strongly associated with increased depressive symptoms and poorer quality of life.</s><s xml:id="_m35AnEW">Similar inverse relationships have been reported among individuals with serious illnesses such as multiple sclerosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and HIV <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8sqpRrg">Munson et al. also reported a positive relationship between the PAM score and health-related quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qCyB5k7">These findings have implications beyond the PAM score itself.</s><s xml:id="_WSaNkah">Depressive symptoms are usually associated with feelings of helplessness and decreased quality of life, which in turn are associated with low PAM scores, leading to a self-perpetuating cycle.</s><s xml:id="_jqYY6sN">Although this study cannot point to causation, but only to the association of activation and mood, this association is important in itself.</s><s xml:id="_tsCWZTD">It illuminates a possible entry point for breaking the cycle.</s><s xml:id="_nadPG3F">In other words, caregivers could develop strategies to increase patient activation, thereby reducing depressive symptoms, increasing quality of life, and improving health outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_htakR6P">For example, providing patients with information, clear instructions and specific caretaking tasks might empower them to begin taking a larger role in their self-care.</s><s xml:id="_CkpWPUT">Small successes at these tasks can build confidence and encourage patients to take additional actions, until they are finally able to manage their own healthcare <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_u4BUnFR">Hibbard and Tusler <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> showed that offering a workshop in the community setting once a week for two or three hours over a 6-week period could improve patients' ability to manage their healthcare and maintain active and fulfilling lives.</s><s xml:id="_BazFn9S">Indeed, Hibbard and Cunningham <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> reported that participants with increased activation over the study period had lower depression scores over 6 months.</s><s xml:id="_JHyCgtN">In another intervention conducted by Hibbard, Greene and Tusler <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>, coaches were in telephone contact with patients, instructing them in accordance with their PAM level and building on success at each level to progress to the next level.</s><s xml:id="_VS23ynG">Deen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> found that a brief intervention focused on improving patient activation levels was successful in a primary care setting and Shively et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> reported that among participants with heart failure, a patient activation intervention was successful in improving levels of activation, as well as adherence to medication and health behavior recommendations.</s><s xml:id="_X5X75yG">The physician can use the PAM concept as a guideline for action.</s><s xml:id="_EwrfExM">For example, if the physician assesses a patient as being at the equivalent of PAM Level 1 (i.e.</s><s xml:id="_mw89NFC">does not consider his/her role in health management as being important), the physician can first focus on this aspect and then attempt to empower the patient by offering encouragement and appropriate information regarding what steps the patient can take to improve his/her own health.</s></p><p xml:id="_AkpRd6q"><s xml:id="_KBWC8C6">Rask et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref> found that patient activation was related to selfcare management among patients with diabetes, similar to the positive association found by Marshall et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref> among patients with HIV.</s><s xml:id="_n5HBzPg">Indeed, in a retrospective analysis, Remmers et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> found that PAM scores were predictive of future health outcomes among diabetic patients.</s></p><p xml:id="_dRBw5et"><s xml:id="_qJCrfvy">When asked the hypothetical question about help for emotional difficulties, the fact that the majority of participants stated that they would be willing to pursue evaluation, treatment, and followup care for such difficulties by their family physician indicates that the primary care setting could employ such strategies to improve patient compliance and outcomes, and might be a receptive entry point.</s><s xml:id="_Hja9Ywt">Deen et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> found that patient activation intervention was particularly effective for those with PAM scores at Levels 1 and 2 (i.e., the less activated patients).</s><s xml:id="_GU4JR4b">However, activation can increase at all levels.</s><s xml:id="_kZHBAH3">Harvey et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref> reported that among participants with and without chronic disease, changes in PAM levels were directly related to changes in health status, e.g., cancer risk, stress and mental health, as well as health behaviors such as exercise, even among those who were at PAM Level 4; indicating that improvement in patient activation leads to better health outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_ecRUPgv">Nagykaldi et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b36">[37]</ref> found that engagement in a ''wellness portal'' improved both patient activation and preventive health behaviors among primary care patients.</s></p><p xml:id="_nkxCYA8"><s xml:id="_MaTcW6t">An added benefit of improving health-related quality of life and reducing depressive symptoms related to patient activation is the positive impact on utilization of healthcare services.</s><s xml:id="_E2fWPBC">Shively et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> found that cardiac patients who participated in their activation intervention group had fewer hospitalizations over the six-month study period.</s><s xml:id="_QUgbqmg">Donald

participants who reported depressive symptoms were not identified as depressed by their physicians.</s><s xml:id="_nsZ3tNE">The relatively high rate of depressive symptoms and the impact on physical well-being, suggests the importance of providing continuing education to physicians on topics related to mental health.</s><s xml:id="_EzNcnkQ">Nearly half of the participants in this study whose PHQ-9 score indicated possible depression (i.e., !10) were not recognized by their physician as being depressed.</s><s xml:id="_Qhv4fkY">These individuals might constitute cases of 'hidden depression', which screening with the PHQ-9 could identify for further inquiry and clarification.</s><s xml:id="_bRmZD7B">The apparent contradiction between the findings regarding physician assessment and PHQ-9 scores reflects a limitation of this study.</s><s xml:id="_uhwaKdg">The participants' actual status vis-a `-vis depression diagnosis would be best determined by an acceptable gold-standard, such as the Goldberg Standardized Psychiatric Interview <ref type="bibr" target="#b40">[41]</ref>, Spitzer's Clinical Interview for DSM-IV Axis I disorders (SCID) <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">[42]</ref> or an interviewer-assessed diagnostic standard based on DSM-IV criteria for depressive disorder.</s><s xml:id="_5AqjYwZ">This was not possible in the current study, but is recommended for future research.</s><s xml:id="_Pf8mu8x">On the other hand, the instruments used here have several practical clinical advantages.</s><s xml:id="_3fNCfhD">They are brief and administration did not require a mental health specialist, which makes them especially suitable for use in primary care practice <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">[43]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_yhgDP5F">Since there was no significant difference in the rate of depression among those who completed the questionnaires at the clinics and those interviewed by telephone, depression screening via telephone interview could offer a satisfactory and efficient method for detecting depression among community populations.</s></p><p xml:id="_gh7NjVG"><s xml:id="_FE5RRY8">Additional limitations of this study were the relatively low response rate and the use of two interview methods.</s><s xml:id="_WNrF8Kn">However, the fact that associations between the variables were in the expected directions lends credence to the findings.</s><s xml:id="_pQU7cvd">The fact that both interview methods yielded similar PAM, PHQ-9 and SF-12 scores indicates that this did not affect the findings.</s><s xml:id="_JEVxR22">While the findings of this study confirm the expected association of PAM scores with depressive symptoms and quality of life measures, it is recommended that the translation of the PAM be validated in Hebrew and in Arabic, for the Israeli population.</s></p><p xml:id="_7T5zyBc"><s xml:id="_XvvymV2">An important note of caution should be drawn from the research of Chubak et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref> who found that PAM scores fluctuated over time among their patients.</s><s xml:id="_WYx7aah">The factors determining and affecting patient
