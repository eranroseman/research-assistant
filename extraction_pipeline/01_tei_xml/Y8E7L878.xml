Chaiken, 1991)</ref> revealed that a loss-framed message about breast cancer promoted BSE only among those women who previously reported that they perceived BSE to be a risky behavior.</s><s xml:id="_bwDaEr9">If people perceived all health behaviors as risky, one would expect a consistent advantage for loss-framed appeals.</s><s xml:id="_dhuRvAW">However, not all health behaviors are perceived as risky or uncertain.</s></p><p xml:id="_xTrJMy8"><s xml:id="_DmXFK6s">An important distinction between health behaviors can be made based on the function that they serve.</s><s xml:id="_2ArAxZh">Detection behaviors such as BSE or mammography serve to detect the presence of a health problem and because they can inform people that they may be sick, initiating the behavior may be considered a risky decision.</s><s xml:id="_jMbm6YJ">Although detection behaviors such as mammography provide critical long-term benefits, characterizing them as risky accurately captures people's subjective assessment of these behaviors (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Hill, Gardner, &amp; Rassaby, 1985;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">Mayer &amp; Solomon, 1992;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">Meyerowitz &amp; Chaiken, 1987)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qdPz48J">In contrast, prevention behaviors such as the regular use of sunscreen or condoms forestall the onset of an illness and maintain a person's current health status.</s><s xml:id="_yqRKdK7">In fact, these behaviors are risky only to the extent that one chooses not to take action.</s><s xml:id="_TCgfjzC">This distinction is important because it provides a useful heuristic to predict which behaviors people tend to perceive as risky and which behaviors people tend to perceive as relatively certain or safe (for a discussion of these issues, see <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Rothman &amp; Salovey, 1997)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_FsaaaT6">Moreover, it suggests that lossframed appeals would be more effective in promoting detection behaviors but gain-framed appeals would be more effective in promoting prevention behaviors.</s></p><p xml:id="_AVMwyzn"><s xml:id="_xzfQBXA">To date, conclusions concerning the relative effectiveness of gain-and loss-framed appeals have had to rely on comparisons drawn across studies and across health domains.</s><s xml:id="_aN5VQgA">That these effects have been obtained across a variety of health threats is encouraging with respect to the generalizability of this approach to health promotion.</s><s xml:id="_d96x99S">However, the numerous differences between the health domains and health behaviors studied make it difficult to assert unequivocally that the relative influence of gain-and loss-framed appeals is contingent on the function of the behavior.</s><s xml:id="_TfZVZ8b">Even within a single health domain, prevention and detection behaviors (e.g., con-doms and HIV testing) can differ on dimensions such as cost, familiarity, difficulty, frequency, and the need for trained personnel to perform the behavior.</s><s xml:id="_8Y53kxa">These substantial differences leave open the possibility of alternative explanations for the observed pattern of findings.</s><s xml:id="_wF2UTkV">Studies are needed that experimentally manipulate both the framing of a health message and the function of a specific health behavior.</s></p><p xml:id="_vEj64Hy"><s xml:id="_QqEUFW9">The following two experiments provide the empirical evidence needed to support the theoretical framework proposed by <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Rothman and Salovey (1997)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EHtxRg6">Experiment 1 tested the proposed framework in the context of a hypothetical disease.</s><s xml:id="_YXpd4NQ">The use of a hypothetical disease afforded the opportunity to construct a single health behavior that could be presented as either a prevention or a detection behavior.</s><s xml:id="_vss3cdh">Of course, there are limitations to any study that relies on a hypothetical, and consequently unfamiliar, health problem.</s><s xml:id="_xUuHX4V">Experiment 2 complemented and extended the findings obtained in Experiment 1 by testing the proposed framework in the context of real health problems, tooth decay and gum disease, and using real health behaviors that differed only in terms of their described function (prevention vs. detection).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_8HsC4Hw">How Do Gain and Loss-Framed Messages Influence Behavior?</head><p xml:id="_sqAZGbg"><s xml:id="_5gU7KxY">There is little question that providing people with either gain-or loss-framed health information influences the decisions they make and the behaviors they choose to perform.</s><s xml:id="_jnjgKw2">Moreover, framed information has been shown to influence behaviors taken both soon after the information has been presented and up to 12 months after participants have viewed a framed presentation (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Banks et al., 1995)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tvrc8a4">In contrast to the behavioral findings, investigators have had difficulty identifying the psychological processes that mediate the influence of framed information on behavior.</s><s xml:id="_tM5Ufyq">Although some evidence of mediational processes was obtained in Experiment 2, the findings were inconsistent across the two behavior conditions.</s><s xml:id="_zvKbPSb">Why would participants' inten-tions and behavior be more closely linked for a prevention behavior compared to a detection behavior?</s><s xml:id="_z4r3sFb">Perhaps the feelings of concern and anxiety that people associate with adopting a detection behavior undermines their determination to act on their intentions.</s><s xml:id="_7fhd9rj">Although investigators have long been interested in the premise that too much fear will undermine behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">Janis, 1967)</ref>, this perspective has received minimal empirical support <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Sutton, 1982)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_eRzHReT">In fact, in the current study, participants in the detection behavior condition who received loss-framed information reported the highest proportion of card requests.</s><s xml:id="_spXmwch">Of course, we have no information as to the proportion of participants across the experimental conditions who actually used the product that they were mailed.</s></p><p xml:id="_pfEdekj"><s xml:id="_MvayHTu">Some researchers have suggested that a messageprocessing approach may help elucidate the influence that message framing has on behavior (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">Maheswaran &amp; Meyers-Levy, 1990;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">Smith &amp; Petty, 1996)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wRH2m8E">Specifically, any observed advantage for either gain-or loss-framed messages may rest on the fact that people have processed one version of the message more extensively than the other.</s><s xml:id="_tBDBhjz"><ref type="bibr">Smith and Petty (1996, Experiment 2)</ref> found that information that is framed in an unexpected manner (e.g., people expect a loss-framed but are given a gain-framed message) is processed more extensively than information framed in an expected manner, and consequently had a stronger influence on people's attitudes and intentions.</s><s xml:id="_HT4ym5w">However, this effect was limited to those people who were otherwise not motivated to process the message (i.e., people low in NFC).</s><s xml:id="_JFKtHe5">People who were dispositionally motivated to process the message were unaffected by the expectancy manipulation.</s><s xml:id="_4TCNWNJ">It is not clear how a differential processing perspective could account for the fact that framing effects on behavior have been obtained with people who were highly involved in a health issue and therefore likely to have systematically processed the information they received regardless of how it was framed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">Banks et al., 1995;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">Detweiler et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">Rothman et al., 1993)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_aKnnNpG">Moreover, in Experiment 2, participants appeared to process the gain-and lossframed pamphlets in a similar manner, although in the predicted behavior condition, each frame was shown to be more effective than the other.</s><s xml:id="_YCxvNUQ">However, comparisons of the total amount of cognitive responding provide only a general assessment of cognitive elaboration <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">(Smith &amp; Petty, 1996)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_uwdA67Q">Measures of participants' responses to strong and weak framed arguments provide a more sophisticated assessment of message processing, and including these measures in subsequent research should help to clarify these issues.</s></p></div>
