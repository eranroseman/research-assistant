xml:id="_Ft5PKzR">In response to this increasing interest in data-driven technologies for personal health, research communities have generated a rich body of knowledge on ways individuals engage with self-monitoring in a variety of domains including health <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gVpQphK">In addition, theoretical frameworks emerged that can help researchers and practitioners develop a richer understanding of this phenomenon and guide future work.</s><s xml:id="_Dr6k62n">One such framework, the staged-based model of personal informatics, has become particularly influential and inspired a slew of research projects and design solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WHzxygC">However, the vast majority of previous research on attitudes towards self-monitoring and self-tracking has focused on individuals who are intrinsically motivated to engage in data collection and who want to discover more about themselves and their health <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_p95xydu">These individuals comprise the Quantified Self movement, characterized by their curiosity and desire for self-knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_F4cpMtE">They also share specific demographic characteristics: a recent study found that "quantified selfers" are primarily young and middleaged men of white or European descent <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_6nxmkrW"><s xml:id="_5NsUJ4k">In contrast, individuals most in need of effective solutions for personal health often reside in economically disadvantaged, low-resource communities that have a higher prevalence of chronic diseases, such as obesity and diabetes, than their more affluent counterparts <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_yQs6UDA">Evidence suggests that these individuals are far less likely to spontaneously engage in proactive self-monitoring <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_s3Y7auw">Specifically, there is increasing evidence that individuals reporting lower incomes and education attainment are less likely to track a health indicator or symptoms, and are less likely to use an application or medical device to do so, compared to individuals with higher levels of income and education <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_PmTYG3A">This lack of engagement with self-monitoring may preclude these individuals from the opportunities to improve their health using personalized interventions that rely on data.</s><s xml:id="_5WNX8cB">Moreover, it can further increase the digital divide and create a new data divide between those who can take advantage of personal data and data-driven solutions and those who lack the knowledge, motivation, and skills to do so <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_ZsTB4qq"><s xml:id="_9GY2kgr">While engagement among well-resourced individuals has been well described, there exists a considerable knowledge gap in understanding what motivates low-resource individuals to engage in self-monitoring, how these individuals engage with personal data, and whether there are important differences in engagement between different populations.</s><s xml:id="_HSVUG4y">Therefore, in this research we aimed to develop a better understanding of how individuals in low-resource, medically underserved communities with a high prevalence of chronic conditions engage in self-monitoring for health, their attitudes towards personal data, and factors that both facilitate and inhibit such engagement, with the goal of increasing both empirical and theoretical knowledge in this area.</s><s xml:id="_sNeSBnm">Our specific focus was on individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM).</s><s xml:id="_Ea4s6CQ">Individuals living with T2DM must make numerous daily decisions that affect their blood glucose levels and ultimately their risk of diabetes-related complications <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rYhMv8m">These decisions include dietary choices (what, when, and how much to eat), exercise, sleep, and stress management, among many others.</s><s xml:id="_xcMqXYm">While there exist general guidelines for self-care behaviors, <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27]</ref> due to the high individual differences in blood glucose regulation, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref> specific self-management strategies must be tailored to each individual <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_D5G5BuH">Data collected through self-monitoring can inform these strategies and provide between-visit measurements for healthcare providers <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_c72sEm3">Yet there exist considerable challenges to engagement in self-monitoring for individuals with T2DM <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Mg95dUP">Moreover, T2DM is disproportionately prevalent among individuals who are older, reside in economically disadvantaged communities, and Latino and African American individuals <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2qarvdJ">Many of these individuals are medically underserved <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref> and effective self-management interventions could bridge existing gaps in care <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_Bga4PCD"><s xml:id="_ErFk3rj">In order to address this knowledge gap, we conducted a qualitative study of attitudes and perceptions about tracking and planning among low-income Latino adults diagnosed with T2DM.</s><s xml:id="_7DVJ2ze">To gain a richer understanding of participants' perceptions about tracking and planning, we explored the topic in both health-specific and non-health (e.g., finances) contexts.</s><s xml:id="_R7VDZc9">In this paper, we present empirical and theoretical
