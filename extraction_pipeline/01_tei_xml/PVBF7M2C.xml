of multiple DHTs, data from low-income and middle-income countries are mostly absent.</s><s xml:id="_MfjxKVQ">A further limitation worth mentioning is that some DHTs might require long intervals of time post implementation before the health-care institution can measure a benefit.</s><s xml:id="_Wnjhysb">Therefore, the effect of a DHT on an outcome might vary if comparing a shorter assessment period with a longer assessment period.</s><s xml:id="_NqzkXq2">Since several systematic reviews included in our study might have chosen to assign equal weighting across primary studies with multiple measurements periods, this could preclude the ability to distinguish between short-term and long-term effects on health workers' metrics.</s><s xml:id="_WYEJrWb">Additionally, even for high-income nations, high-quality scientific data are still difficult to interpret, hampered by low-quality methodological reporting and vague measurements of professional performance.</s><s

applicability for a particular health condition or disease.</s><s xml:id="_YtD5btf">This process of understanding the emerging technologies should be assessed through high-quality epidemiological,
