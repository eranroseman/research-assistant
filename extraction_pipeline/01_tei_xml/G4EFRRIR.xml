Sheeran, 2007)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_BCmmSVu">According to Gollwitzer, by linking the intended response to a suitable opportunity, one does not need to deliberate whether to act, or how to act; when one encounters the planned context, action is initiated quickly, efficiently, and without need for conscious awareness.</s><s xml:id="_VmWWWMZ">However, a number of instances have been reported where implementation intentions have no impact on behaviour (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_993bEhs"><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">Higgins &amp;

Gollwitzer, 2005)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_J4JjeqP">A second reason for null effects of implementation intentions could be that the mechanisms proposed to underlie these effects (enhancing the accessibility of the anticipated environmental cue, and strengthening the link between the planned situation and the goal-directed response) might not persist in real-life settings over a period of days or weeks.</s><s xml:id="_ApjYBth">Studies that have examined implementation intention mechanisms have almost exclusively been laboratory-based and examined effects on behaviour in the immediate experimental setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">(Aarts et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">Webb &amp;
