assess whether a smartphone app improved medication adherence and BP control in patients with uncontrolled hypertension <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">35]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_RZ7xrBw"><s xml:id="_hwDnzPQ">An interesting aspect of this trial was that it was an entirely virtual RCT with no in-person visits.</s><s xml:id="_7ZaS5f7">Recruitment was done via social media, online patient communities and advertisements; informed consent was provided via the study website; eligibility assessment was conducted via an online questionnaire; and home BP measurements performed using a Bluetooth-enabled automated BP monitor mailed by the study team.</s><s xml:id="_u2rxxgA">At 12 weeks, the results showed an improvement in self-reported medication adherence and no significant difference in systolic BP in the app users compared with nonapp users.</s></p><p xml:id="_T2MbwvH"><s xml:id="_fvhZbwE">A second trial published by Santo et al. in 2019 also aimed to assess whether medication reminder apps improved medication adherence and other clinical outcomes, such as BP and cholesterol levels <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">36]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3Ar3jpQ">This study was a 3-arm RCT comparing a basic medication reminder app, an advanced reminder app and usual care (see Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref> for intervention details) in a coronary heart disease population.</s><s xml:id="_RbrNznj">Similar to the previous trial, the results showed an improvement in self-reported medication adherence that was not accompanied by any statistically significant improvements in clinical outcomes in app users compared with usual care.</s><s xml:id="_xzCyaCR">Of note, a mixed-methods evaluation of this trial found that the majority of patients who received the app intervention found useful to have an easily accessible record of their medications names and dosages on their smartphones and that the medication reminders helped them take their medications correctly <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[37]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_JmpqWAp">In terms of usability and engagement, most patients found the app was easy-touse and used the medication reminders at least once a day, while only a small number of patients have technical difficulties while using the app.</s></p><p xml:id="_BegG2AS"><s xml:id="_usCFQjT">A few interesting aspects of both of these trials should be discussed.</s><s xml:id="_S3x6Q23">Both studies had a small but statistically significant improvement in self-reported medication adherence at a shortterm follow-up of 3 months.</s><s xml:id="_JxWCB4p">First, the magnitude of effect might have been too small, and second, the follow-up period might not have been long enough to translate the benefits of improved medication adherence into clinical outcomes, such as BP and cholesterol levels.</s><s xml:id="_8gnfdPr">Of note, both trials reported that some participants in the intervention groups did not download the apps and, therefore, did not receive the intervention, while some participants in the control group downloaded a medication reminder app during the course of the trial.</s><s xml:id="_KD6Ta5Q">Both of these situations could also have contributed to the null effect in the clinical outcomes.</s></p><p xml:id="_p4jmWQW"><s xml:id="_abfvDUr">The third relevant trial by Redfern et al. assessed whether a consumer-directed digital health strategy for CVD risk management, which included a website and an accompanying app (CONNECT), would improve medication adherence and clinical outcomes in patients with moderate to high risk of CVD <ref type="bibr">[33, 34•, 38]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Gwv7SHV">The intervention was integrated with the patient's electronic health record at the primary healthcare facility.</s><s xml:id="_dN2SvHt">At 12 months, the study results did not show a statistically significant improvement in medication adherence in the intervention group compared with the control group.</s><s xml:id="_QUzbZPX">However, there were more intervention participants who were physically active and had high eHealth literacy than control participants.</s><s xml:id="_RvhQD6j">Interestingly, qualitative research of participants in the CONNECT trial found that 87% of primary care physicians said they would recommend the strategy.</s><s xml:id="_b5sEPfV">Also, as a result of the CONENCT intervention, 31% of patients reported improved medication adherence, 40% reported doing more to improve mental health and well-being, 47% reported higher weekly physical activity and 61% reported healthier eating habits <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[39]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ak3Wgxx">Taken together, the results of the CONNECT trial highlight potential health value usefulness for patients despite no significant improvement in medication adherence.</s></p><p xml:id="_ayjf3Kh"><s xml:id="_8r259qe">Taken together, the three recent RCTs described above provide insight into the assessment of outcome measures and the potential value for patients, and the importance of this when evaluating digital health interventions.</s><s xml:id="_Tdckce3">The trials highlight the importance of patient engagement and interest in the intervention and the alignment of those aspects with perceived benefit.</s><s xml:id="_ayDRn5p">As stated in the WHO guide on monitoring and evaluating digital health interventions, it is essential to monitor the digital intervention in terms of whether the intervention worked as it was intended to, as well as how much the user interacted with the technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ayEKzVG">Therefore, it is extremely important to engage different stakeholders (including health professionals and consumers) in codesigning the digital health interventions to maximize the potential benefit of such interventions.</s><s xml:id="_XGvcA9U">Another aspect is engaging key players in the delivery of the intervention; for example, if the apps are prescribed by a physician, patients might feel more motivated to engage with the app than downloading an app on their own or even as part of a research study.</s><s xml:id="_buRVRbD">In the aforementioned RCTs, there was no physician involvement in reinforcing the use of the apps, and thus, this might have contributed to some of the trial results.</s><s xml:id="_2wS9b35">Finally, the RCTs highlight challenges with assessing outcomes that are clinically measurable but also meaningful to patients.</s><s xml:id="_NutkPyb">It is important that digital health interventions be developed and evaluated in collaboration with end users and that patient-reported outcomes and experience measures are considered in the final evaluation.</s></p></div>
