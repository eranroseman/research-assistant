authoritative voice.</s><s xml:id="_sdDaUBn">Advisors used rules, procedures and evidence to support clients in applications and appeals, navigating the benefit system through their knowledge, skills and experience, in relation to individual clients' needs.</s><s xml:id="_CZ96sdy">Advice service outcomes included manifold value types <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Donati and Archer 2015)</ref> such as:</s></p><p xml:id="_YKGF6kv"><s xml:id="_KyjfE7h">• economic value, where advice led to increases in people's income, often from situations of severe poverty where people with illnesses or disabilities did not have money for rent, food and bills.</s><s xml:id="_k9Yckt7">Advice could support people in debt management and sometimes prevented potential homelessness.</s><s xml:id="_zb5724n">• use value, where advisors' knowledge of the benefit system could help clients' particular problems.</s><s xml:id="_7eA3Yjh">• relational value, where the relational connections with an advisor could give people a sense of not being alone, having someone who acknowledged their difficulties, illness or disability issues, and giving advice that could empower clients in times of difficulty.</s><s xml:id="_FK6T7pN">• value as dignity, where people's sense of identity and own value could be reaffirmed and people marginalized by the system could be reintegrated ('I won't be fobbed off'</s></p><p xml:id="_EAaRqqQ"><s xml:id="_kDdd3mK">[56]), supporting clients' well-being and mental health.</s><s xml:id="_UHy2Tzr">In relation to where advice made a difference, the case of benefit appeals stands out, where external benefit assessment failures could lead to severe poverty, stress and anxiety.</s><s xml:id="_MkqHV3w">Whilst three clients reported that advice thankfully prevented severe mental illness that may have led to in-patient psychiatric care or self-harm/ suicidal feelings, in other research there are several documented cases where suicides have been related to benefit assessment processes <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">(Mills 2017)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8j88gsV">Why advice created public value in our interviewees' cases, relates to how advisors could contest injustices of benefit assessment decisions and advocate for clients' rights, reinstating people's basic income where appeals were won.</s><s xml:id="_m5MJSxg">Advice services provided a source of solidarity, advocacy and empowerment for clients caught up in the personal consequences of welfare reform.</s><s xml:id="_6kQ7sB9">Yet advice services continue to face funding cuts, when there is little other support around to help people with disabilities navigate the benefit system (UN 2016).</s></p><p xml:id="_Ca4AMWG"><s xml:id="_ttTB8QB">At a wider policy level, and in relation to power dynamics within the political economy, whilst health and disability benefit assessments may create private economic value for the contracted companies, this does not necessarily create public value either for the individuals being assessed, nor wider public values such as due process and justice.</s><s xml:id="_wEHV5g6">Nor is it clear that the current assessment process creates public economic value for the state.</s><s xml:id="_NCsEkf2">The main policy aim of welfare reform has been to reduce state welfare bills, but the DWP has still yet to generate value for money in its contracted-out health and disability assessments <ref type="bibr">(NAO 2016b, 12)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_bjcGWT7">'Major structural reforms to the incapacity and disability benefits systems have proceeded more slowly than expected and have saved less than initially predicted' (Office of Budget Responsibility 2016, 12).</s><s xml:id="_S9eXPAB">In relation to the desired policy outcomes of encouraging people on health and disability benefits back into work, ESA eligibility assessments such as WCA, have not on average led to more people entering employment, who were previously out of work with long-standing health problems <ref type="bibr">(Barr et al. 2016b)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_ntDWr5B"><s xml:id="_SGGrWZ9">Research implications for public managers include that, when faced with diminishing resources, cutting preventative services such as advice services may be a false economy in the long run, as they can have a significant impact on preventing homelessness and use of health services.</s><s xml:id="_89sVUN5">Further research in alternative welfare policy systems is needed, as current welfare reforms do not appear to be meeting their aims.</s><s xml:id="_ENnwkWA">Both PIP

xml:id="_5SsRXU3"><s xml:id="_h7tU2hJ">Other policy implications about social impact methods include that the advice services SROI ratio did not seem to significantly influence decision making about advice services funding in a context of austerity.</s><s xml:id="_8zChVK9">Considerations about social value have yet to be embedded in most councils' commissioning processes, staying 'on the margins of the debate' under austerity and financial pressures <ref type="bibr">(Khazbak 2017, 3)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SUzbt8R">Within NHS commissioning, the use of the Social Value Act is also limited <ref

understand how different tangible and intangible public values may operate at different individual, organizational, and policy levels.</s><s xml:id="_eENqMnG">This analytic approach has been applied to a subset of clients seeking advice about health and disability benefits, one of the most recurrent policy issues in our sample.</s><s xml:id="_43KFUed">However the approach could have been applied to a different set of client case types, such as those in difficulty with 'payday' loan companies, who charge extremely high interest rates.</s><s xml:id="_sw8j2Jv">In this example, Financial Conduct Authority (2014) policy level changes such as price cap rules, may make a difference to advice clients' experiences through potentially reducing escalating debts; or introducing legislation such as Lord John Bird's Creditworthiness Assessment Bill <ref type="bibr" target="#b39">(Geraghty 2017)</ref> to help renters get fair access to credit.</s></p><p xml:id="_RCsaGMA"><s xml:id="_QY2Qt3T">Limitations include that our empirical data was focussed at an individual level.</s><s xml:id="_dvr5GxV">Because the data presented was part of a broader study on the impact of all types of advice, interviewers did not ask specific, overt policy-related questions to clients about ESA and DLA/PIP.</s><s xml:id="_ghbGvrr">However by combining our data with other research and government reports, we have illustrated how individuals' stories relate to wider public value processes at policy levels.</s><s xml:id="_VsB9RA3">Other limitations of the study include that we had to rely on self-reported attribution, asking clients themselves about the extent to which they thought advice services had contributed to their particular outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_gVdDUsv">However, we also asked interviewees about all the other sources of support that they had received about the issues in question, alongside their own actions in solving the problems, asking how much these may have contributed to the outcome.</s><s xml:id="_x8XXMru">Clients' stories were often complex, and the specific intricacies of applications and appeals could sometimes be hard to follow.</s><s
