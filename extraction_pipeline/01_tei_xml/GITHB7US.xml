there has been insufficient research to date investigating how it can be used to increase engagement and modify adherence within lifestyle intervention programs.</s><s xml:id="_yswNHvz">Our clinical trial <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref> was the first study to explore the use of telephone calls and text message as adjunctive tools to support an established community-based obesity management program.</s><s xml:id="_nsmzH3F">This eight-month randomised controlled cross over trial was conducted in conjunction with a community-based obesity management service (OMS).</s><s xml:id="_HkHNeGj">Sixty-one selfmanaging adults with class III obesity (body mass index &gt; 40 kg/m 2 ) were randomly assigned to receive 4 months of telephone and text message support in addition to standard OMS care, or standard OMS care alone.</s><s xml:id="_7sbHCHj">After 4 months, the participants crossed over to the alternative sequence for four additional months.</s><s xml:id="_H2HMg4A">The intervention was grounded in behaviour theory, with a range of behavioural treatment strategies targeted, including goal setting, self-monitoring, motivational interviewing, problem solving, relapse prevention, stimulus control, cognitive restructuring, and self-reinforcement.</s><s xml:id="_XXPfCGF">Telephone calls were provided monthly throughout the intervention period, where participants were guided to set goals to work toward over the following month.</s><s xml:id="_UAwNZY9">The monthly telephone calls were made via Skype, scheduled at a time convenient for the participant.</s><s xml:id="_dy38pbA">The information gathered during these telephone calls was then used to tailor and individualise the subsequent month of text messages.</s><s xml:id="_Fu2UEhS">Three text messages were sent each week, aimed to remind or prompt participants to strive toward their goals, as well as foster a sense of support and accountability.</s><s xml:id="_VXPkUDQ">This level of contact was chosen based on the level of contact seen in previous research, including a paper finding that high or low intensity text-messaging combined with group treatment equally promote weight loss maintenance in obese adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_PrjtN9j">The study design involved one-way communication, so participants were unable to reply to the text messages.</s><s xml:id="_UXwGqcg">Instead, they were encouraged to keep notes over the month to discuss at their monthly telephone calls.</s><s xml:id="_zwsbF7g">One-way communication was a carefully selected component of the study design, influenced by prior research finding that low intensity single direction text message is an effective option for assisting adults involved in face-to-face obesity treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_YdExjKQ">There was not a protocol surrounding telephone call duration, with the call length varying month to month based on the number of goals being discussed, the time participants had available to talk and the general flow of conversation.</s><s xml:id="_kfsXzjY">The average call duration was ~20 min.</s><s xml:id="_zcQ4CVv">Dietary adherence, physical activity adherence, anthropometry, self-efficacy and self-regulation were measured at baseline, 4 and 8 months.</s><s xml:id="_HYnrrCe">A total of 80 adults with class III obesity were approached during the recruitment phase of the trial and of these 80, 61 people posed interest in the trial and were assessed for eligibility.</s><s

xml:id="_3SBmZDN">Of the 61 adults who began the trial, 93% (n = 57) completed the 4-month outcome measures, and 84% (n = 51) completed the 8-month outcome measures.</s><s xml:id="_Y3hpJVA">There was an equal drop-out rate between the two cross-over groups.</s><s xml:id="_5hjYjR3">The study revealed that the addition of telephone and text message support to a community-based obesity management program improved behavioural adherence and clinical outcomes when compared with standard care.</s><s xml:id="_s3xvF2g">Within both groups, participants achieved greater improvements in their diet, physical activity, self-efficacy and lost more weight while receiving the telephone and text support <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_2akFeTS"><s xml:id="_J8ksjFv">Another pertinent aspect of the program's effectiveness lies in identifying participant perspectives and opinions of the trial.</s><s xml:id="_f78kXg5">Evaluating a clinical trial using qualitative

intervention acceptability and possible program improvements.</s><s xml:id="_cj9ShsA">Similar to all qualitative research, a broad variety of methodologies may be suitable for conducting qualitative

methodologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_PEhHPgw">Among the more common qualitative methods of obtaining participant perspectives

xml:id="_SF3yynS">A randomised controlled cross over trial.</s><s xml:id="_2cEhFrU">This qualitative evaluation reveals that the telehealth trial was well received, with participants reporting positive experiences and outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_2zMPeVH">Participants found the telephone calls and text messages highly beneficial, providing encouragement, support, motivation and accountability via a simple and convenient mode of communication.</s><s xml:id="_3gZ8JMS">They did not feel that other modes of technology, such as websites, email, phone application or video-chat would be sought after, preferring the simplicity of telephone and text.</s><s xml:id="_tZbPefw">Genuine, nonjudgmental care; individually tailoring the text messages; and flexibility regarding scheduling of the telephone calls were all considered to be crucial aspects of the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_gF47vc9">Participants appreciated the individualisation of the text messages in regard to both content and time of delivery, noting the power and impact may have been lost if a standard template was used.</s><s xml:id="_38SErAn">A monthly telephone call and three text messages per week was considered to be an appropriate amount of contact, with only a few participants suggesting more frequent communication.</s><s xml:id="_6j4JU6N">The majority of participants would have liked the telephone and text support to be offered for a longer duration, ideally ongoing.</s><s xml:id="_6NccqQS">In regard to the optimal timing of the intervention, participants preferred to receive the telephone and text support a few months into the OMS program.</s><s xml:id="_tZgNK7h">This delay allows time to complete the initial education groups run by the OMS, and to evenly distribute the degree of support on offer throughout their OMS journey.</s><s xml:id="_FQRSeKz">There were no issues encountered through the use of Skype, and only minor comments regarding the outcome assessments and assessment tools used within the clinical trial.</s></p><p xml:id="_ZUVa6uv"><s xml:id="_3neSDpR">Participants in this qualitative evaluation expressed their desire for frequent patient-provider contact and regular, ongoing support.</s><s xml:id="_3Qm3AjR">Previous research in obesity management has shown that intensive patient-provider contact is an important component of a programs popularity and effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_YepHm8D">This approach is typically seen within academic lifestyle intervention programs, but often deemed too burdensome and expensive to be sustainable in community environments.</s><s xml:id="_degxpSv">Intensive patient-provider contact requires considerable resources including time, money and the availability of multiple health professionals with expertise in the behavioural treatment of obesity.</s><s xml:id="_J26GFBc">One potential way to alleviate pressure, resources and the demand on face-toface contact is through the use of technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NtgS4vP">The use of telephone calls and text message offers a unique opportunity for obesity management programs, and a range of similar health care services, to provide frequent patient-provider contact, prompting and reminders via a cost and time-effective platform, while reducing the reliance on face-to-face treatment.</s><s xml:id="_pzxqAQt">The telehealth trial revealed that telephone and text support improves adherence and clinical outcomes in obesity management, and this qualitative evaluation offered strong validation that participants believe telephone and text support is an invaluable addition to a community-based obesity management program.</s></p><p xml:id="_9qzaCFX"><s xml:id="_FSFuKpX">The findings of the current study are in line with previous qualitative evaluations investigating participant perceptions of telehealth and mHealth interventions

reporting positive experiences and offering promising feedback.</s><s xml:id="_PuUYh5q">Previous evaluations have also found participants have a clear preference for telephone calls over other forms of technological support (e.g., email, video chat, website or phone application).</s><s xml:id="_ezBEEQs">This preference appears to be a result of the simplicity, ease and individualisation that telephone calls are able to offer.</s><s xml:id="_74QkEZM">A qualitative evaluation looking at postpartum women's perspectives of receiving nutrition and physical activity support via video consultation noted convenience and improvements in knowledge and confidence as primary benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_84JSBSM">They concluded that offering tailored support via video consultation was a feasible and acceptable method of delivering care, and a viable alternative to in-person care.</s><s xml:id="_KMZnfTn">In another example, a process evaluation was completed to investigate participant perceptions of and engagement with TXT2BFIT: a multicomponent mHealth randomised controlled trial to prevent weight gain in young adults <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hFhFDP4">This paper reported positive feedback overall, with the personalised coaching calls being the most valued component of the intervention, offering motivation and accountability.</s></p><p xml:id="_cXNH3MT"><s xml:id="_hVFSgvk">Participants viewed the other components of the intervention, such as phone applications and websites, to act as supplements to the coaching calls, as opposed to core components.</s><s xml:id="_Bx6uRHu">The participants expressed their preference for personalised intervention, which is why the telephone coaching calls were deemed to be the preferred component of the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_FHAn2Ys">The text messages were enjoyed and offered helpful reminders, although participants would have preferred for the texts to be individualised <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EjTywQq">Participants preferred behaviour-based messages as opposed to knowledge-based messages, and were more likely to implement the behaviour if it was related to a goal discussed in the coaching call.</s><s xml:id="_FAt34zd">This strengthens the view that personalised support is integral, and is in line with evidence suggesting that selfmonitoring, goal checking, prompting and behavioural cues are important for behaviour maintenance <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_bfthYpd">Participants of this study also suggested a more gradual decline in contact frequency would have been helpful, which is line with the tapering of support suggested by participants of the current study.</s><s xml:id="_XFtes6e">Neither of the above examples involved concurrent face-to-face intervention, and participants within both of these examples would have preferred more frequent contact and support.</s></p><p xml:id="_fMDsCfW"><s xml:id="_aSadzM7">Focus groups were the chosen methodology to gain participant perspectives and experiences within this qualitative evaluation.</s><s xml:id="_QSsp7Zx">The focus groups proved to be a successful tool, yielding rich information, feedback, opinions and experiences.</s><s xml:id="_fjfSNYy">The insights gained through the focus groups were not obtained using quantitative methods and would have been otherwise unexplored without this qualitative evaluation.</s><s xml:id="_ETecR3Q">Participants appreciated the opportunity to offer their feedback and further contribute to the body of research being conducted at the OMS.</s><s xml:id="_qmYZ4Yt">The research team also found the focus groups to be highly beneficial, allowing a years worth of anecdotal feedback to be formally collated, analysed and presented.</s><s xml:id="_Z6JS2KR">Gaining interest in the focus groups was not a difficult task, with a large number of participants posing interest in attending.</s><s xml:id="_DgDXRJf">Unfortunately, only a small proportion of those who wanted to attend were able to, as the focus groups needed to be conducted during the working day due to room availability and health centre open hours.</s><s xml:id="_GqKG9cc">This was interesting, supporting the notion that for many individual's telehealth is a convenient and preferable option of health care consumerism, whether that be for traditional health care or for research purposes.</s><s xml:id="_hsYcwyf">In hindsight, mixed methodologies including surveys and telephone interviews may have been a more valuable and robust option, allowing everyone who wished to offer their feedback the opportunity to do so.</s><s xml:id="_bCFpzdr">Especially given the qualitative evaluation was seeking feedback from people who had agreed to participate in a telehealth trial, continuing to offer online forms of communication may have resulted in higher participation rates.</s></p><p xml:id="_zejUgGK"><s xml:id="_nENYX2t">There are a number of limitations of the study to consider.</s><s xml:id="_zj8jq2s">Participants who agreed to participate in the focus groups achieved higher percentage weight losses than the average seen within the telehealth trial.</s><s xml:id="_22xgFaz">Their experiences may therefore be biased toward a positive experience.</s><s xml:id="_ynyFrmU">The sample of participants may have been small, however data saturation was achieved quickly.</s><s xml:id="_tgheHn8">The primary investigator leading the telehealth trial co-facilitated the focus groups.</s><s xml:id="_3296QWM">It is difficult to ascertain whether this pre-existing relationship affected the responses provided and the overall outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_vehvpK7">Likewise, the primary investigator of the telehealth trial was heavily involved in analysing the transcribed focus group data, including the creation of the coding framework and the organisation of themes within the thematic network.</s><s xml:id="_sxkuCt6">There is therefore a risk of researcher bias due to the primary investigator's key role within both the telehealth trial the qualitative evaluation.</s><s xml:id="_8BXje5t">One strategy used to address this potential bias was having two coinvestigators with no prior relationship with the participants involved in the interpretation and analysis of the data.</s><s xml:id="_wCCSHj6">A reflexive approach was also inherent in our data analysis, factoring in the influence of researcher bias on the resulting findings.</s><s xml:id="_dVjrWhS">The qualitative evaluation may have been strengthened if further strategies were implemented to account for this potential bias.</s><s xml:id="_6TQKX4k">The focus groups included a mix of participants and were not specifically designed by subgroups (i.e., age, gender, sex etc).</s><s xml:id="_DXKnXsw">Furthermore, all participant voices were considered together during the analysis and interpretation of the focus group data.</s><s xml:id="_cCjTGCG">Accounting for differences in how different types of participants felt about the intervention may have proven interesting and offered a richer insight into the participant perspectives.</s><s xml:id="_taQyw4J">Flexibility around scheduling the telephone calls was deemed a critical component of the trial.</s><s xml:id="_4DRPZ74">If this type of technologybased support were to be implemented, services would need to balance this need for flexibility with what is feasible and practical for service delivery.</s></p><p xml:id="_ukPJhuK"><s xml:id="_zcyyFQd">The telehealth trial and this qualitative evaluation have been successful in demonstrating the benefits of using telephone calls and text messaging in obesity management.</s><s xml:id="_agaaYWC">However, it is important to highlight that this research has investigated the use of telehealth as an adjunctive tool alongside traditional face-to-face intervention delivery.</s><s xml:id="_9FDcjh5">In this context, for individuals who do not have access to a mobile phone, or the technological literacy required to benefit from text message support, face-to-face service delivery remains.</s><s xml:id="_2E5Egf2">Telehealth offers additional patient-provider contact, accountability and prompting, however standard health care is still on offer for those who do not wish to partake.</s><s xml:id="_P525ZUY">This is important in the context of digital equity.</s><s xml:id="_mJ3kS8e">While evidence suggests that the vast majority of the population has a cell phone <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>, it is crucial that health care is still provided to those who do not (or for those who are simply not interested in receiving health care via this mode of delivery).</s><s xml:id="_JjbJqzc">That being said, mobile phones have had a considerable impact on health care availability around the world, especially in developing countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2ZU686u">The use of mobile technology to promote health and prevent disease is growing at a rapid rate <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_4gJ5Jhu">Communication by mobile phone is generally less expensive than landline telephones or standard internet and offers the ability to provide health care to vulnerable groups, rural

change interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_Dh9dNTS"><s xml:id="_zREBPmC">While telehealth has long been touted as a useful tool in the health service model, the pandemic has led to a rapid change in the way services can be delivered.</s><s xml:id="_sPAWPPB">Consumer expectations have shifted and there is now demand for convenience in a safe and socially distant manner, supported by readily available existing technology.</s><s xml:id="_VCeQkqj">Telehealth is therefore likely to become embedded as an adjunct to
