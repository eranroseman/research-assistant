<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_vgpsySd">Introduction</head><p xml:id="_FuUpSkA"><s xml:id="_YNrxuMs">Globally, a plethora of digital health solutions has been suggested, designed and/or deployed.</s><s xml:id="_9svzf64">During COVID-19, many countries adopted social distancing measures, and the availability of and access to digital health solutions for all are therefore highly pertinent to ensure good public health.</s><s xml:id="_6mA8g4B">Digital health is a broad term that includes the use of information and communication technology, such as software applications, mobile phones and wearable devices, to support peoples' health and their quality of life.</s><s xml:id="_ttXdJRF">The World Health Organization (WHO) emphasises that digital health is essential in achieving universal health coverage as "it extends the scope, transparency and accessibility of health services and health information, widening the population base capable of accessing the available health services and offering innovation and efficiency gains in the provision of health care" <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_eQDSkGd">In this paper we focus on digital health solutions and services intended for personal use.</s><s xml:id="_enH9X65">Examples are apps and devices for self-management and monitoring of health conditions and contact with health professionals.</s></p><p xml:id="_XvRvbrN"><s xml:id="_bSR5EWa">People with impairments (loss or abnormality of body functions, sensory and cognitive capacities, and structures) can often experience barriers leading to de-facto disabilities due to the structure of society [2], and digital health solutions are part of such an exclusive structure if they are not designed to be accessible to people with impairments.</s><s xml:id="_skBrEjC">According to WHO and the World Bank, people who experience disabilities make up 15% of the world's population <ref type="bibr">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_emfkAeS">The term disability has had different meanings throughout the ages due to public policy <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xscCgtp">Disability is in this article defined according to the International Classification of Functioning, Disability and Health (ICF) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_53zKcCQ">The ICF is structured around three components: 1) body functions and structures (physiological, psychological and anatomical), 2) activities (the execution of a task or action by an individual) and participation (involvement in a life situation), and 3) environmental (the specific context) and personal factors (lifestyle, social background) that may have an impact on the individual's health and health-related states.</s><s xml:id="_UFv8nVf">According to ICF, a disability occurs when there is a limitation in activity and participation because of a gap between an individual's body function and structure, and personal experiences and knowledge on the one side, and the requirements from the environment on the other side.</s><s xml:id="_EUGT2xA">The ICF definition indicates that there is a correlation between disability and disadvantage and that the level of disadvantage depends on the gap between the factors described above.</s></p><p xml:id="_dkBvV42"><s xml:id="_tDCxMcT">In this article, we have chosen to use the term impairment for the population group we study, as impairment does not lead to or justify disability.</s><s xml:id="_BrJvgYb">It is rather society's lack of consideration of the needs of people with impairments that leads to disability.</s><s xml:id="_4uQU8zQ">People can be born with an impairment, acquire an impairment as a result of an accident or injury, or develop an impairment because of chronic conditions or harsh environmental conditions.</s><s xml:id="_mtgyTpQ">We adopted a disease-agnostic perspective, which means that we will focus on functional impairments (cognitive, mental, motor, visual and hearing) regardless of what circumstance caused the impairment or disease.</s><s xml:id="_3TSS6F4">The decision to apply this perspective reflects our assumption that people with similar functional impairments may have similar experiences independent of the cause of their impairments.</s><s xml:id="_338dADp">Furthermore, a disease-agnostic perspective for this scoping review may provide insights that will be valuable for the design for and collaboration with people with different types of impairments independent of the cause of impairment.</s></p><p xml:id="_Db2dNTK"><s xml:id="_KzANpgt">Accessibility problems of digital health occur in the intersection between the user, their context and the product or service in question.</s><s xml:id="_8ZTDrv3">People with impairments have challenges related to digital health solutions, if development processes fail to consider the diversity of the human body function and structure, their abilities and their context.</s><s xml:id="_b3Ds88X">For example, visually impaired people need descriptions of images, while people with hearing impairment need captioning of videos, people with loss of hand dexterity may need to give input through voice recognition, people with motor impairments may need their health applications to be able to measure activity when using a mobility aid, and people with cognitive impairments may need an interface with easily recognisable and familiar icons and text to speech functionality <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xhhfstN">Developers of digital health solutions should therefore strive to develop solutions that are universally designed, which means that they are accessible and usable for everyone, including development, developers can design solutions with better accessibility.</s><s xml:id="_BGg4Wm4">Digital health solutions that are accessible and usable have a tremendous opportunity to foster health equity and achieve health promotion, prevention and self-care.</s><s xml:id="_54n8Da5">This in turn can contribute to closing the gap between different population groups, reduce disparities and get the most from available healthcare services.</s><s xml:id="_QZPdjtN">people with impairments.</s><s xml:id="_Vcv8zNF">For example, an app for measuring blood sugar for people with diabetes should be designed so that it can be used by people with visual impairments or other types of impairments, as people needing to measure their blood-sugar may have different impairments independent of their diabetes.</s></p><p xml:id="_B3MCfnK"><s xml:id="_GB8UqZD">To make digital health solutions more accessible and usable to people with a diversity of body function and structure, developers of digital health solutions should conform to the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Q5cUD7K">These guidelines have been specially developed with the aim of making web content more accessible to people with impairments, but also for people in diverse contexts and with a range of user devices, including smart phones.</s><s xml:id="_vQ8htxP">The WCAG guidelines are widely accepted and referred to in legislation, such as the EU Directive on the accessibility of websites and mobile applications.</s><s xml:id="_B362K34">They are also integrated into the US Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973.</s><s xml:id="_n7KuYjW">However, technical reviews show that health websites and applications in general do not conform to these guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_z5EkVnd">This is also confirmed by people with impairments who report difficulties with accessibility and usability of digital health solutions <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_gynXVDV"><s xml:id="_BBDwkcH">People with impairments often experience disability when they are exposed to inequality, disparity, discrimination and systemic exclusion.</s><s xml:id="_kcuH3qR"><ref type="bibr">David ( [15]</ref> , p. 253) explains that when it comes to "race it is not the skin that matters, but rather the meanings ascribed to that skin by ideology, and the consequent jaundiced ways in which society responds to its 'inhabitants' .</s><s xml:id="_2KydXxy">So, too, in disability".</s><s xml:id="_cvecGAN">For example, women with different types of impairments are systematically excluded from traditional preventive health screenings like mammography <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref>, and university students who use wheelchairs can have problems pursuing higher education due to lack of access to auditoriums, toilets, libraries and transport facilities <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_PF5ShCB">Discrimination and systemic exclusion of people with impairments has resulted in the establishment of the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) in 2007 <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_XMnz9Ra">The purpose of the Convention is to ensure human rights for people with impairments who experience disabilities.</s><s xml:id="_XWNahHX">Both the right to the highest attainable standard of health (Article 25) and information technology (Article <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">19</ref>) is specified in the Convention.</s><s xml:id="_99TrZtj">According to the articles, digital health solutions should be accessible and usable for people with impairments, and universal design is the recommended strategy to achieve this goal.</s></p><p xml:id="_XdnprgJ"><s xml:id="_zSdjwGy">Inclusion of people with different types of impairments in the development cycle of digital health solutions may lead to design of solutions with better accessibility experiences for the end users.</s><s xml:id="_spDPqkS">Ideal participation would be to involve people with different types of impairments early in the idea creation phase of digital health solutions and throughout the development <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_dYwaFDR">However, there is lack of active inclusion of the voice and requirements by people with impairments in health research in general, despite several published studies for how to include people with impairments in research <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[20]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[24]</ref> and the guidance of CRPD <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_G8ASErv">Limited inclusion of people with impairments in the development of digital health solutions easily lead to continuation and reinforcement of inequalities in health services provision for people with impairments.</s><s xml:id="_xH75wbJ">A preliminary search for literature on digital health solutions and people with impairments in PubMed, CINAHL, EMBASE and Cochrane showed that people with impairments are rarely included in research about digital health solutions, not even when the solution is specifically designed to be used by people with impairments.</s><s xml:id="_DnYaTtg">This contrasts with the clearly stated need for digital health solutions that are suitable, accessible and usable for people with impairments <ref type="bibr"
