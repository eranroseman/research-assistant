<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_sMTBdtj">Background</head><p xml:id="_qRDTgfh"><s xml:id="_K4wWVXw">Improving the implementation of evidence-based practice and public health depends on behaviour change.</s><s xml:id="_bmNfqWt">Thus, behaviour change interventions are fundamental to the effective practice of clinical medicine and public health, as indeed they are to many pressing issues facing society.</s><s xml:id="_sEQpuhw">'Behaviour change interventions' can be defined as coordinated sets of activities designed to change specified behaviour patterns.</s><s xml:id="_rz8NdPN">In general, these behaviour patterns are measured in terms of the prevalence or incidence of particular behaviours in specified populations (e.g., delivery of smoking cessation advice by general practitioners).</s><s xml:id="_njbe5pv">Interventions are used to promote uptake and optimal use of effective clinical services, and to promote healthy lifestyles.</s><s xml:id="_WgGSMXa">Evidence of intervention effectiveness serves to guide health providers to implement what is considered to be best practice (for example, Cochrane reviews, NICE guidance).</s><s xml:id="_upUtutf">While there are many examples of successful interventions, there are also countless examples of ones that it was hoped would be effective but were not [ <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, e.g.</s><s xml:id="_vJW4YWG"><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3]</ref>].</s><s xml:id="_WNSyqym">To improve this situation, and to improve the translation of research into practice, we need to develop the science and technology of behaviour change and make this useful to those designing interventions and planning policy.</s></p><p xml:id="_tQaeSBg"><s xml:id="_T4XWUr6">The process of designing behaviour change interventions usually involves first of all determining the broad approach that will be adopted and then working on the specifics of the intervention design.</s><s xml:id="_DvPEEXJ">For example, when attempting to reduce excessive antibiotic prescribing one may decide that an educational intervention is the appropriate approach.</s><s xml:id="_6TKECtz">Alternatively, one may seek to incentivise appropriate prescribing or in some way penalise inappropriate prescribing.</s><s xml:id="_8bW2kc4">Once one has done this, one would decide on the specific intervention components.</s><s xml:id="_jhP6cN3">This paper examines this first part of this process.</s><s xml:id="_mtrAf4H">We and others are also working on how one identifies specific component 'behaviour change techniques' <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_yVmHh3f"><s xml:id="_ynDunEp">In order to identify the type or types of intervention that are likely to be effective, it is important to canvass the full range of options available and use a rational system for selecting from among them.</s><s xml:id="_x6jHPuD">This requires a system for characterising interventions that covers all possible intervention types together with a system for matching these features to the behavioural target, the target population, and the context in which the intervention will be delivered.</s><s xml:id="_G9VaSAM">This should be underpinned by a model of behaviour and the factors that influence it.</s></p><p xml:id="_MzDcfRF"><s xml:id="_e5JANrn">Interventions are commonly designed without evidence of having gone through this kind of process, with no formal analysis of either the target behaviour or the theoretically predicted mechanisms of action.</s><s xml:id="_EUZEgf5">They are based on implicit commonsense models of behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gxfQEBY">Even when one or more models or theories are chosen to guide the intervention, they do not cover the full range of possible influences so exclude potentially important variables.</s><s xml:id="_YaUANtF">For example, the often used Theory of Planned Behaviour and Health Belief Model do not address the important roles of impulsivity, habit, self-control, associative learning, and emotional processing <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_G3BxZAJ"><s xml:id="_4A9xBAx">In addition, often no analysis is undertaken to guide the choice of theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mBA8xve">Useful guidance from the UK Medical Research Council for developing and evaluating complex interventions advocates drawing on theory in intervention design but does not specify how to select and apply theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_nCXkuTg">It should also be noted that even when interventions are said to be guided by theory, in practice they are often not or are only minimally <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_5FFHcUz"><s xml:id="_vF9MkF5">Thus, in order to improve intervention design, we need a systematic method that incorporates an understanding of the nature of the behaviour to be changed, and an appropriate system for characterising interventions and their components that can make use of this understanding.</s><s xml:id="_qNeXWKA">These constitute a starting point for assessing in what circumstances different types of intervention are likely to be effective which can then form the basis for intervention design.</s></p><p xml:id="_JZDyesZ"><s xml:id="_pCAssKa">There exists a plethora of frameworks for classifying behaviour change interventions but an informal analysis suggests that none are comprehensive and conceptually coherent.</s><s xml:id="_JjT3a5K">For example, 'MINDSPACE' an influential report from the UK's Institute of Government, is intended as a checklist for policymakers of the most important influences on behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_u6PazEC">These influences provide initial letters for the acronym MIND-SPACE: messenger, incentives, norms, defaults, salience, priming, affect, commitment, and ego.</s><s xml:id="_BfYVfZg">The framework does not appear to encompass all the important intervention types.</s><s xml:id="_eyuY6tT">Moreover, the list is a mixture of modes of delivery (e.g., messenger), stimulus attributes (e.g., salience), characteristics of the recipient (e.g., ego), policy strategies (e.g., defaults), mechanisms of action (e.g., priming), and related psychological constructs (e.g., affect).</s><s xml:id="_D5MyHVe">In that sense it lacks coherence.</s><s xml:id="_jMG9N2e">The report recognises two systems by which human behaviour can be influencedthe reflective and the automaticbut it focuses on the latter and does not attempt to link influences on behaviour with these two systems.</s></p><p xml:id="_qjuGAg7"><s xml:id="_HxrbTJJ">A second example comes from the Cochrane Effective Practice and Organisation of Care Review Group (EPOC)'s 2010 taxonomy <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_4vEWv8A">This categorises interventions to change health professional behaviour into professional, financial, organisational, or regulatory, covering many of the key intervention types.</s><s xml:id="_2jmRET3">However, the categories are very broad and within each is a mixture of different types of interventions at different conceptual levels.</s><s xml:id="_YxwYRZx">For example, 'professional' includes individual behaviour (distributing educational materials) and organisational interventions (local consensus processes); 'financial' includes individual and organisational incentives and environmental restructuring (changing the available products); 'organisational' includes input (changing skill mix), processes (communication) and effects (satisfaction of providers); and 'regulatory' includes legal (changes in patient liability) and social influence (peer review).</s><s xml:id="_hzU4Xbb">Professional, financial, and organisational interventions are found across all categories.</s></p><p xml:id="_E9AkFvF"><s xml:id="_8k6rkcB">Aside from specific frameworks, there are some broad distinctions that have been widely adopted.</s><s xml:id="_RGyNuVv">One such distinction is between population-level and individuallevel interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qhTqDSq">While superficially appealing, there are many interventions that this distinction cannot readily classify and it has not been possible to arrive at a satisfactory definition of the distinction that does not contain inconsistencies.</s><s xml:id="_vNWnB4J">For example, if wide reach is a feature of population level interventions, routine general practitioner (GP) smoking assessment and advice (given to all patients) should fall into that category; yet it is delivered specifically to individuals and can be tailored to those individuals.</s><s xml:id="_Xu2tG6a">Indeed, the NHS Stop Smoking Services might be considered a typical case of individual-level interventions, but they reach more than 600,000 smokers each year <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tvJFwdk">We do not consider these broad distinctions further in this paper.</s></p><p xml:id="_6ABYSfQ"><s xml:id="_gUC5hMt">It appears that most intervention designers do not use existing frameworks as a basis for developing new interventions or for analysing why some interventions have failed while others have succeeded.</s><s xml:id="_qrmFurS">One reason for this may be that these frameworks do not meet their needs.</s><s xml:id="_FpsEWgJ">In order to choose the interventions likely to be most effective, it makes sense to start with a model of behaviour.</s><s xml:id="_cQJsCpN">This model should capture the range of mechanisms that may be involved in change, including those that are internal (psychological and physical) and those that involve changes to the external environment.</s><s xml:id="_jWSvTEA">In general, insufficient attention appears to be given to analysing the nature of behaviour as the starting point of behaviour change interventions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>, a notable exception being intervention mapping <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_JkpEhM7">'Nature of the behaviour' was identified as one of 12 theoretical domains of influence on implementation-relevant behaviours <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_sQx3MSj">Whilst this framework of 12 theoretical domains has proved useful in assessing and intervening with implementation problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>, the domain of behaviour has remained under-theorised and therefore underused in its application.</s></p><p xml:id="_6KdBu5C"><s xml:id="_hrppV4J">There are a number of possible objections to attempting to construct the kind of behavioural model described and link this to intervention types.</s><s xml:id="_xCzgwQQ">The most obvious criticism is that the area is too complex and that the constructs too ill-defined to be able to establish a useful, scientifically-based framework.</s><s xml:id="_Scx64zr">Another is that no framework can address the level of detail required to determine what will or will not be an effective intervention.</s><s xml:id="_Kb4HurC">The response to this is twofold: these are empirical questions and there is already evidence that characterising interventions by behaviour change techniques (BCTs) can be helpful in understanding which interventions are more or less effective <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref>; and not to embark on this enterprise is to give up on achieving a science of behaviour change before the first hurdle and condemn this field to opinion and fashion.</s></p><p xml:id="_w5qnRH9"><s xml:id="_bJXamNe">To achieve its goal, a framework for characterising interventions should be comprehensive: it should apply to every intervention that has been or could be developed.</s><s xml:id="_uXXYFka">Failure to do this limits the scope of the system to offer options for intervention designers that may be effective.</s></p><p xml:id="_4HUYm9S"><s xml:id="_XKmZ32z">Second, the framework needs to be coherent in that its categories are all exemplars of the same type of entity and have a broadly similar level of specificity.</s><s xml:id="_u9YjKZt">Thus, categories should be from a super-ordinate entity (e.g., function of the intervention), and the framework should not include some categories that are very broad and others very specific.</s><s xml:id="_vvKaq95">A beautiful example of an incoherent classification system is the Ancient Chinese Classification of Animals: 'those that belong to the Emperor, embalmed ones, those that are trained, suckling pigs, mermaids, fabulous ones, stray dogs, those that are included in this classification, those that tremble as if they were mad, innumerable ones, those drawn with a very fine camel's hair brush, others, those that have just broken a flower vase, and those that resemble flies from a distance' (Luis Borges 'Other Inquisitions: 1937-1952').</s></p><p xml:id="_4QTNKGW"><s xml:id="_KHqP9cr">In addition, the categories should be able to be linked to specific behaviour change mechanisms that in turn can be linked to the model of behaviour.</s><s xml:id="_qdShgf5">These requirements constitute three criteria of usefulness that can be used to evaluate the framework: comprehensiveness, coherence, and links to an overarching model of behaviour.</s><s xml:id="_Uy8mGuu">We limited the criteria to those we considered to form a basis for judging adequacy.</s><s xml:id="_YpfATjB">There are others, e.g., parsimony, that are desirable features but do not lend themselves to thresholds.</s><s xml:id="_gQDgBF8">Other criteria can be used to evaluate its applicability, e.g., reliability, ease of use, ease of communication, ability to explain outcomes, usefulness for generating new interventions, and ability to predict effectiveness of interventions</s></p><p xml:id="_CvDhEEW"><s xml:id="_YQE4Ekx">In light of the above, this paper aims to: 1. Review existing frameworks of behavioural interventions to establish how far each meets the criteria of usefulness, and to identify a comprehensive list of intervention descriptors at a level of generality that is usable by intervention designers and policy makers.</s></p><p xml:id="_pFveD4u"><s xml:id="_zMJJARx">2. Use this list to construct a framework of behaviour change interventions that meets the usefulness criteria listed above.</s></p><p xml:id="_gdFdHzH"><s xml:id="_mYkN764">3. Establish the reliability with which the new framework can be used to characterise interventions in two public health domains.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_SdB2RYW">Methods</head><p xml:id="_V2wHbxs"><s xml:id="_7Ard3A5">Prior to reviewing the literature on intervention frameworks, we needed to establish a set of criteria for evaluating their usefulness.</s><s xml:id="_BTW3CuU">Following this, our method involved three steps: a systematic literature review and evaluation of existing behaviour change intervention frameworks, development of a new framework, and a test of the reliability of the new framework.</s></p></div>

necessary to define terms describing categories of intervention more precisely than is done in everyday language in order to achieve coherence.</s><s xml:id="_m6uMXkU">For example, in everyday language 'education' can include 'training,' but for our purposes it was necessary to distinguish between 'education' and 'training' with the former focusing on imparting knowledge and developing understanding and the latter focusing on development of skills.</s><s xml:id="_DttCSnd">Similarly we had to differentiate 'training' from 'modelling.'</s><s xml:id="_MRn2dsE">In common parlance, modelling could be a method used in training, but we use the term more specifically to refer to using our propensity to imitate as a motivational device.</s><s xml:id="_8gmEz85">A third example is the use of the term 'enablement.'</s><s xml:id="_t8tBXMD">In everyday use, this could include most of the other intervention categories, but here refers to forms of enablement that are either more encompassing (as in, for example, 'behavioural support' for smoking cessation) or work through other mechanisms (as in, for example, pharmacological interventions to aid smoking cessation or surgery to enable control of calorie intake).</s><s xml:id="_9Tx8nYS">There is not a term in the English language to describe that we intend, so rather than invent a new term we have stayed with 'enablement.'</s></p><p xml:id="_mFTY2sS"><s xml:id="_wUtpST3">Second, it became apparent that a distinction needed to be made between interventions (activities aimed at changing behaviour) and policies (actions on the part of responsible authorities that enable or support interventions).</s><s xml:id="_5egFnF5">For example, an intervention that involved incentivising primary care organisations to prioritise public health interventions could be implemented through different policies such as producing guidelines and/or legislation.</s><s xml:id="_GuFswKv">A second example is that raising the financial cost of a behaviour whose incidence one wishes to reduce (an example of coercion) could be enabled and supported by different policies, from fiscal measures (taxation) to legislation (fines).</s><s xml:id="_Cp7deU4">We therefore had to divide the categories that emerged into 'interventions' and 'policies.'</s></p><p xml:id="_9McunQH"><s xml:id="_J8CwgRn">Third, any given intervention could in principle perform more than one behaviour change function.</s><s xml:id="_5dGb6y8">Thus the intervention categories identified from the 19 existing frameworks were better conceived of as non-overlapping functions: a given intervention may involve more than one of these.</s><s xml:id="_ay2EXep">For example, a specific instance of brief physician advice to reduce alcohol consumption may involve the three different functions of education, persuasion, and enablement, whereas another may involve only one or two of these.</s><s xml:id="_T2XRE3P">With regard to the policies, it was possible to treat them as non-overlapping categories.</s></p><p xml:id="_wMJUYuP"><s xml:id="_mHc2wcv">With this in mind, scrutiny of the frameworks yielded a set of nine intervention

these BCTs serve five of the intervention functions: education, persuasion, incentivisation, training, and enablement.</s><s xml:id="_VhgZ3Qy">The other four intervention functions (coercion,

intervention functions have yet to be developed.</s></p><p xml:id="_6Y4MeXF"><s xml:id="_hmG9bEq">One of the strengths of this framework is that it incorporates context very naturally.</s><s xml:id="_SDGsVmQ">There is a general recognition that context is key to the effective design and implementation of interventions, but it remains under-theorised and under-investigated.</s><s xml:id="_4BxMPNf">The 'opportunity' component of the behavioural model is the context, so that behaviour can only be understood in relation to  context.</s><s xml:id="_YNuTc8H">Behaviour in context is thus the starting point of intervention design.</s><s xml:id="_B8J4mEd">The behaviour system also has automatic processing at its heart, broadening the understanding of behaviour beyond the more reflective, systematic cognitive processes that have been the focus of much behavioural research in implementation science and health psychology (for example, social cognition models such as the Theory of Planned Behaviour).</s><s xml:id="_cdVnHYU">An existing framework that has made an important contribution to making intervention design more systematic is 'intervention mapping' <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_GRmSSsv">A key difference between this and the BCW approach is that intervention mapping aims to map behaviour on to its 'theoretical determinants' in order to identify potential levers for change, whereas the BCW approach recognises that the target behaviour can in principle arise from combinations of any of the components of the behaviour system.</s><s xml:id="_YFfe7AH">It may appear that some components are more important than others because of a lack of variance in (including absence or universal presence of) the variables concerned in the population under study.</s><s xml:id="_ewcjFhV">This can be illustrated by a study of GP advice to smokers, which found that a single variabledegree of concern that it would harm the doctor-patient relationshipaccounted for significant variance in the rate of advice-giving <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_FRzRhQW">'Intervention mapping' would suggest that concern be the target for an intervention (as long as a judgement were made that this could be modified using interventions that were realistically applicable).</s><s xml:id="_CAKtx8c">The BCW would analyse the target behaviour in context and note that, regardless of what covariation might currently exist, the target behaviour consists of an activity in which capability is not at issue, and the reflective motivation is broadly positive.</s><s xml:id="_nbXDAY4">The problem arises because automatic motivational factors are currently working against the behaviour (e.g., lack of emotional reward for giving advice or punishment for not giving it and lack of cues to action).</s><s xml:id="_fbrzyP8">Moreover, the physical opportunity is limited (lack of time) and the social opportunities are also somewhat limited.</s><s xml:id="_P74fNZC">It would then consider the full range of ways in which the frequency of advice-giving could be increased.</s><s xml:id="_996TDpX">Because the target behaviour is part of a 'system,' a single intervention may have consequences for other parts of the system -these might work against sustainable change or in favour of it.</s></p><p xml:id="_DYHDUa4"><s xml:id="_9QEb3mT">Thus, the BCW approach is based on a comprehensive causal analysis of behaviour and starts with the question: 'What conditions internal to individuals and in

analysis of co-variation within the behavioural domain and starts with the question: 'What factors in the present population at the present time underlie variation in the behavioural parameter?'</s><s xml:id="_XaECU7E">When it comes to theoretical underpinnings, the BCW approach draws from a single unifying theory of motivation in context that predicts what aspects of the motivational system will need to be influenced in what ways to achieve a behavioural target, whereas the 'intervention mapping' approach draws on a range of theoretical approaches each of which independently addresses different aspects of the behaviour in question.</s></p><p xml:id="_wjRjCkf"><s xml:id="_NYYv8cM">The BCW is being developed into a theory-and evidence-based tool allowing a range of users to design

and policies required to change those mechanisms.</s><s xml:id="_TJPN5hd">An ongoing programme of research is developing an 'intervention design tool' based on the BCW.</s><s xml:id="_WK33t9g">It
