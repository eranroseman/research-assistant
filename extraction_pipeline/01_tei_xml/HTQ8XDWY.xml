for the purpose of self-reflection and gaining self-knowledge" <ref type="bibr">(Li et al., 2010, 558)</ref>, are gradually permeating the sports context: athletes have been monitoring themselves since a long time <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">(Currell and Jeukendrup, 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr">Saw et al., 2015b)</ref>, by using tests, self-reports and questionnaires, and tracking technologies may improve this activity by providing continuous measures of their performance and physical condition.</s></p><p xml:id="_5MtMKc4"><s xml:id="_ry5wcPR">Building upon Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) interest in the use of technology in the sports domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Ishii et al., 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Pijnappel and Mueller 2013;</ref><ref

amateur and elite athletes use self-tracking instruments to manage their sports practices.</s></p><p xml:id="_Tew7q33"><s xml:id="_pXdRXG8">The study contributes to research in PI that examines how people track themselves.</s><s xml:id="_2Ewzntz">Most of such research focuses on "generic" kinds of users, exploring differences in usage patterns on the basis of their level of previous experience (i.e., experienced vs. inexperienced) in selftracking (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">Li et al., 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">Fritz et al., 2014;</ref><ref type="bibr"

2016;</ref><ref type="bibr">Rapp et al., 2018)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5jfPQTe">This focus on generic users, however, overlooked the situated use of PI technologies, undermining the opportunities for designing tools within specific practices <ref type="bibr">(Rapp et al., 2017)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7J46vXY">Moreover, by paying attention mainly to "experienced" and "inexperienced" trackers HCI research clouded the exploration of other, potentially relevant, factors that may affect the usage of PI devices.</s></p><p xml:id="_ATVpq5B"><s xml:id="_gBW2wYG">This article fills an important gap in current PI research, by exploring how athletes intertwine the use of PI tools with the activities and challenges they face within their sports practices: going beyond the idea of "generic PI users", it describes how a specific population like the athletes use PI technology to achieve their situated goals.</s><s xml:id="_DhSeEbB">In so doing, the study also explores the different usage patterns and conceptualizations of PI devices among athletes, by comparing the tracking activities of amateurs and elites.</s><s xml:id="_487Z34C">Research in disciplines spanning from sports psychology to neuroscience show that expert athletes differ consistently from amateurs with regard to a variety of perceptual, cognitive and strategic aspects of behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Swann et al., 2015)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KBQzNMg">They carry out different activities, are embedded in different social contexts, and have different levels of knowledge of the sport they perform <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">(Swann et al., 2015)</ref>: in sum, they are engaged in different practices.</s><s xml:id="_uYkEszx">It seems thus reasonable to ask ourselves whether these differences may lead to different usages of PI tools.</s></p><p xml:id="_Q8rFkfB"><s xml:id="_vUJhx6b">Understanding how amateur and elite athletes differently use PI instruments may not only shed light on how their usage patterns may vary on the basis of the practices in which the user is engaged, but also provide suggestions on how we can design better PI tools not only to fulfill athletes' unmet desires (e.g., the elites' search for more comfort), but also to support amateur athletes.</s><s xml:id="_FZbzeMw">At present, amateurs might find it difficult to pursue their situated goals, such as changing their behavior through their tracker to improve their sports performance or using the device to fulfill their contextual needs: this might be due to their lack of knowledge about their sports practice.</s><s xml:id="_zf6DwwX">Instead, elites might not encounter the same issues, as they may well know how to behave and achieve their objectives.</s><s xml:id="_jUCKvV6">Therefore, the insights collected among the elites may be useful to design devices addressed to the amateurs, when the aim is to increase their knowledge about the sport they perform (which may make the use of their trackers more effective).</s></p><p xml:id="_hz9BHsz"><s xml:id="_hjwAukQ">Building on top of our recent work investigating how athletes interpret their performance and physiological data <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Rapp and Tirabeni, 2018)</ref>, in this article we aim to widen our perspective on the use of PI instruments in sport, moving beyond the focus on sensemaking and sports data.</s><s xml:id="_v2gRzzt">First, we will explore the situated use of trackers in sports practices.</s><s xml:id="_hwgUC6e">Second, we will deepen themes that could be inspiring for the design of PI instruments also outside the sports context.</s><s xml:id="_ExF7cQc">Third, we will outline a series of design implications that can inspire the design of novel PI tools addressed to the sports domain.</s></p><p xml:id="_DHj5jD4"><s xml:id="_sMYaJ5a">The article is structured as follows.</s><s xml:id="_Ty44aDC">Section 2 provides a picture of previous research related to PI tools usage.</s><s xml:id="_Tg54DQB">Section 3 outlines the method we used, whereas Section 4 describes the findings of our study.</s><s xml:id="_9kGfzqf">Section 5 discusses the results introducing themes

twenty semistructured interviews with amateur and elite athletes, focusing on how they make sense of sports data (i.e., physiological and performance measures) collected by PI devices: the former believe that the objective measures gathered through self-tracking are the most important thing to be considered to evaluate the sports performance, whereas the latter know when it is necessary to trust in subjective sensations more than in PI "numbers" <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">(Rapp and Tirabeni, 2018)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_66aVY2R">In that study, we stressed the notion of "sensation": elites use mostly this term to refer to a world of subjective feelings that cannot be reduced to quantitative measures.</s><s xml:id="_vYKAHBa">Another element we found is related to the use of the devices' social features, since as long as the level of eliteness raises, athletes show to be more interested in using data sharing for strategic aims, whereas amateurs share their data for
