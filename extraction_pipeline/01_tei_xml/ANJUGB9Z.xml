financial incentives, typically greater than a hundred dollars, for employees to adopt healthier behaviors.</s><s xml:id="_Q3Phdjz">This study evaluated if an enhanced active choice prompt with or without patient financial incentives increased participation in screening colonoscopy.</s></p><p xml:id="_wNaq8A5"><s xml:id="_r5Vv2bJ">A total of 2,250 employees between the ages of 50-64 were randomly allocated to receive an email containing a phone number to schedule screening colonoscopy (control), an email with the active choice to opt in or opt out of scheduling (active choice), or the active choice email plus an offer of a $100 conditional incentive to participate (financial incentive); 2,245 were included in the analyses because 5 participants had undeliverable emails (Table <ref

xml:id="_SNBQjFf">respectively).</s><s xml:id="_ckWUuQb">Appointment scheduling had comparable rates for the control (2.1%), active choice (2.0%), and financial incentive (4.8%) arms.</s><s xml:id="_xFtzVuw">There was a greater proportion of participants who said 'yes' to screening in the financial incentive arm (15.5%) as compared with the active choice arm (8.7%) (P &lt; .01).</s><s xml:id="_hdeDfnc">The additional 16 screened individuals in the financial incentive arm (as compared with control) cost $2800 in incentives, which translates to an incremental cost of $175 each.</s></p><p xml:id="_yMY6wdv"><s xml:id="_Ap5HXHw">This study evaluated behavioral economic approaches to increasing employee participation in screening colonoscopy.</s><s xml:id="_rKNd3kv">The active choice approach did not increase participation, but the $100 conditional incentive led to a statistically significant, but small in magnitude, increase in colonoscopy completion at a cost of $175 for each additional employee screened.</s></p><p xml:id="_ATzWmqr"><s xml:id="_PJVj8fF">Active choice has been used to make decision-making more immediate to participants. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s xml:id="_AdecWPN">In this study, the choice of selecting 'no' required endorsing a statement emphasizing the harms of that choice, which is called enhanced active choice. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s xml:id="_32Npc8X">We found greater initial response rates in the active choice arm than the control arm, but the rate of scheduling was the same because it was often difficult for the scheduling representatives to reach the participant on the phone.</s><s xml:id="_HSBJDNF">The benefits of active choice may have been offset by the requirement for two separate touchpoints, increasing the friction of scheduling for what is already a complex event.</s></p><p xml:id="_JcgW38H"><s xml:id="_frAtCWm">Financial incentives have been shown to increase participation in health-promoting behaviors such as smoking cessation, medication adherence, and weight loss. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref></s><s xml:id="_nDsySD6">4]<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> In the case of stool testing for CRC screening, $5 and $10 incentives did not increase rates, but a lottery with a 1 in 5 chance of winning

which in some populations included a reduction of $500. <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref> However, no increase in CRC screening followed the elimination of cost-sharing. <ref type="bibr"

incentive.</s></p><p xml:id="_VgT2FJm"><s xml:id="_EApjtUU">Colonoscopy is challenging for patients, requiring a day off from work, a bowel cleansing preparation, and transportation, in addition to the non-financial costs of anxiety and discomfort.</s><s xml:id="_CQcUxZT">Smaller incentives may be insufficient to overcome those challenges.</s><s xml:id="_B5dTFvP">Although a $100 incentive seems relatively large, this amount is comparable to what employers offer for completion of health risk assessments or biometric screening activities, which in the absence of behavior change interventions, arguably have smaller health benefits.</s><s xml:id="_ywcWv7j">Colonoscopy navigator programs can range in cost from $50 to $500 per patient. <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s xml:id="_pPZt6ky">Screening colonoscopy is also widely considered cost-effective as compared with other screening activities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref></s><s xml:id="_HSbVjmG">Because the intervention used email communication and existing call center operations, it would require minimal additional staff resources.</s><s xml:id="_25cW4ny">Finally, this incentive was offered through the employer (who was also the health care provider) and was situated in the context of scheduling, which increased the trust and convenience of the activity, but may limit generalizability to other settings.</s></p><p xml:id="_UyZHrkw"><s xml:id="_rSuFump">This study has limitations.</s><s xml:id="_KqK5UDM">First, it was conducted in an employee population, so we did not have access to clinical or claims data, and could not target only those who were not up-to-date with screening.</s><s xml:id="_9WG3vYa">This dilutes the impact of the intervention, but this applies to all arms in the randomization, and the call center asked screening questions before scheduling the procedure.</s><s xml:id="_3XNztbf">Second, the intervention was less of a true active choice where participants cannot progress until they make a selection, so they could still choose not to respond at all.</s><s xml:id="_x4QahZH">Third, the effect of the financial incentive was modest in impact, but because the target population included a significant portion who had already been screened, those response rates are artificially low.</s><s xml:id="_jjwrGJu">For example, 20%-22% of the target population responded to the email as being already screened, and internal analysis estimated about a 60% screening rate before this intervention, from which we could extrapolate a 9% response rate in the financial incentive arm among those that were due for screening.</s><s xml:id="_crzZFJt">Fourth, we only offered colonoscopy and not the choice of stool testing, which has been shown to increase response to colon cancer screening outreach. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s xml:id="_hYq7msB">trengths include its prospective design and patient-level randomization
