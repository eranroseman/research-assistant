type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>, a few formal models have been developed to try to capture the essence of the way we make decisions.</s><s xml:id="_Ry49gwH">Because different authors focus on different aspects of a multitude of decision-making processes, Evans has recently pointed out that there are many dual processing theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> which fall into two main groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">40]</ref> parallel competitive theories and default-interventionalist theories.</s><s xml:id="_NkJ42Aq">While the exact accounts of cognitive processes between these two groups of theories differ <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref>, as discussed above (Section The behavior of DSM-M Model), we, for the first, time provide a platform, albeit the theoretical one, for reconciling parallel competitive theories with defaultinterventionalist theories.</s></p><p xml:id="_3whaRRu"><s xml:id="_b7HUtkA">Nevertheless, our main goal is to define a theoretical model for medical decision-making; such a model may enable creation of new theoretical frameworks for future empirical research.</s><s xml:id="_CXbZtxJ">Future research, obviously, involves extension of the model described herein to more complex clinical situations beyond relatively simple twoalternative situation, even if the latter is frequently encountered in practice.</s><s xml:id="_cEydW2P">Particularly interesting will be the extension of our dual processing model to include the use of diagnostic tests as the number of new diagnostic technologies continues to explode.</s><s xml:id="_qmEqqCb">Finally, and most importantly, the model presented here needs empirical verification.</s><s xml:id="_jcFcx7n">This limitation is not unique to our model, however, and this criticism can be leveled against most current medical decision-making models, which are rarely, if ever, subjected to empirical verification.</s></p><p xml:id="_pasCFeH"><s xml:id="_PnWAKp8">Our model heavily relies on Mukherjee's model <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, and is accurate to the extent his additive dual processing model is correct (Figure <ref type="figure">1</ref>, Equations 1 &amp; 2).</s><s xml:id="_NGq6Xgd">Also, note that we have extended Mukherjee's DSM model by omitting his scaling constant k and using general utility expressions, rather than a single parameter monotonic power function.</s><s xml:id="_32f2znu">As discussed above, many factors can activate the switch of system II.</s><s xml:id="_p5FsNYP">In fact, Kahneman warns <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> that "because you have little direct knowledge what goes on in your mind, you will never know that you might have made a different judgment or reached a different decision under very slightly different circumstances".</s><s xml:id="_9arr8EX">This implies that the multiple factors affecting the gamma parameter cannot be directly modeled.</s><s xml:id="_Zc5SfQX">A possible solution -and area for future research building on the psychological "fuzzy trace theory" <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref>-would be to employ a fuzzy logic model to assess the values of Î³ (and threshold) as a function of multiple fuzzy inputs <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_ng67qQ3"><s xml:id="_9Rj2eYK">The complexity described here notwithstanding, we believe that the empirical verification of our current dual processing model is feasible.</s><s xml:id="_5aXzeTU">Even without direct modeling of all factors affecting Î³ parameter, our model generates empirically falsifiable qualitative predictions as it clearly identifies circumstances under which the decision threshold is increased or decreased as a function of activation of system I (Î³ parameter).</s><s xml:id="_dW7DSAW">Using simulation to imitate the various real-life decision-making scenarios <ref type="bibr" target="#b69">[70]</ref> offers most logical avenue toward the first empirical testing of our model.</s></p><p xml:id="_T3vvag2"><s xml:id="_2hemTdF">Our model also holds promise in medical education.</s><s xml:id="_kGYVmca">As highlighted in Introduction, modern knowledge of cognition has taught us that most people, including physicians process information using both system I (fast, intuitive) and system II (slow, deliberative) reasoning at different times but few investigators have examined how to teach physicians to integrate both modes of reasoning in arriving at therapeutic strategies.</s><s xml:id="_9v4mYWx">On the diagnostic side, many investigators <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b70">71]</ref> have examined clinical reasoning and proposed how experienced physicians move between system I and system II, although most early papers used different terminology.</s><s xml:id="_d3MQnHK">The integration of system I and system II in therapeutic decision making in medicine has been less well examined.</s><s xml:id="_m6NRCnY">A number of investigators have proposed approaches to using and teaching system II reasoning, including the use of decision models <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mrWh65C">Although this is taught in some schools it has not yet taken medical education by storm <ref type="bibr" target="#b70">[71]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_BWHRjCT">In the field of economic analysis Mukerjee has proposed a theoretical means of combining system I and system II reasoning.</s><s xml:id="_Q3pf6Jk">In this paper, we build on Mukurjee's work and show how the integration of system I and system II therapeutic reasoning can form a basis for teaching students and experienced physicians to recognize and integrate system I and system II reasoning.</s><s xml:id="_FfxdzKC">Our model uniquely captures most salient features of (medical) decision-making, which can be effectively employed for didactic purposes.</s><s xml:id="_GaEZUVF">It is believed that by recognizing separate roles of system II and the influence of system I mechanisms on the way we make decisions, we can be in a better position to harness both types of processes toward better practice of making clinical decisions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr"
