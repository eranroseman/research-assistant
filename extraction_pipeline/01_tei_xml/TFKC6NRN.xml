<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_tQM8Pt6">Introduction</head><p xml:id="_ky5Wkha"><s xml:id="_n8GJVw3">More than three decades ago, Guyatt and colleagues proposed an exciting, personalized method to solve the discrepancy between the results provided by large, conventional (between-subject) randomized clinical trials (RCTs) and the needs of individual patients or participants-the N-of-1 (single subject) study design <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_kFAK3Bh">With the advent of comparative effectiveness research <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> and patient-centered outcomes research <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, there is a renewed interest in N-of-1 trials as an important research method for generating scientific evidence for what is best for the single patient or participant <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_E8wXXJY">Ironically, psychologists were performing this type of single-subject experimental design on psychological and behavioral phenomena for many decades before that <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_AE9rPka"><s xml:id="_TSpGHth">In an N-of-1 or patient-centered trial, the effect of one treatment is compared with one or more other treatments or a placebo condition, and the differences are calculated within-person.</s><s xml:id="_uqWWBjX">Thus, these designs are essentially multiple cross-over trials conducted on single persons <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_XRtuSCS">Whereas conventional two-arm RCTs aim to estimate the average effect of an intervention in a population, an N-of-1 trial strives to identify the optimal treatment for a single patient or participant <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qUneYMT">These trials may include observational and nonrandomized studies, such as ABAB designs, multiple baseline designs, and regression discontinuity designs.</s><s xml:id="_uKUQJn4">In the ideal version of this type of trial, a single person receives one or more reversible interventions and a credible control or comparator condition in a random order and with suitable consideration of a washout period.</s><s xml:id="_tx5DATU">For example, a patient with chronic pain might compare acetaminophen versus ibuprofen, by taking each of them for 1 week at a time in a blinded fashion, and then repeating the treatments two more times, while self rating pain and side effects on a daily basis over the course of the 6-week trial.</s><s xml:id="_HMnAt2F">At the end of the trial, the patient would review the unblinded results with their clinician and help choose which medication to continue to treat his or her pain.</s><s xml:id="_dY9TMBQ">N-of-1 trials that involve randomization of the order of sequencing treatments are referred to here as N-of-1 RCTs.</s></p><p xml:id="_peVXvHh"><s xml:id="_t6fAMk2">N-of-1 RCTs are best suited to clinical problems for which there is substantial uncertainty or clinical equipoise about the optimal treatment.</s><s xml:id="_rUaApCC">In addition, a number of characteristics ideally or necessarily need to be present to be able to conduct an N-of-1 RCT successfully (Table <ref type="table" target="#tab_0">1</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_nu78czX">Specifically, the treatment target in N-of-1 trials must exhibit some variation and must be measurable over time; thus, rapidly progressive conditions are not well suited to N-of-1 trials.</s><s xml:id="_Q5HauU7">The intervention to be tested must be able to be withdrawn, and its effects must be reversible-something that limits the behavior change techniques (BCTs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref> that can be tested within this design; the washout period between exposures to the intervention must be able to be estimated; and, at least in early comparative tests of an intervention, a credible placebo with similar expectancy effects or comparator intervention should ideally exist <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5WGWEJs">There should be a priori decisions about when and how outcomes will be measured; preferably, outcomes are measured objectively, and at minimum the assessors of the outcome are kept masked to the intervention assignment for that particular period.</s><s xml:id="_TXFQBhW">Ideally, participants and researchers are also kept masked to the condition that is offered during each of these periods; however, masking of those providing and receiving the intervention is often not possible for many trials that involve behavior or emotion change interventions.</s><s xml:id="_PXM9nkx">Finally, there should be a statistical approach, a power analysis, and a consideration of the data that would result in rejecting the null hypothesis articulated a priori.</s><s xml:id="_gkke79j">Of note, the sample size in an N-of-1 trial does not refer to the number of patients, but rather the number of measurements conducted by each patient as well as the number of periods in which each treatment is tested.</s><s xml:id="_gaR7jQr">The primary advantage of the N-of-1 design is that it offers direct, objective evidence about the dose and/or efficacy of a particular intervention for a particular participant or patient <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_FBSxKy7">These results can then be used to inform the treatment decision for that patient or participant.</s><s xml:id="_ueAuyq3">Engaging patients in data collection and interpretation can also enhance shared decision making during treatment selection, which may enhance patient satisfaction with care and may increase subsequent adherence with treatment.</s><s xml:id="_K2K95vA">This differs from usual clinical practice in which information is extrapolated from a conventional randomized design involving other patients and not always generalizable to specific patients, and hence not useful to helping a specific participant and investigator make a decision about the best treatment or experimental option for her or him <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_6mpFuxM"><s xml:id="_24yRUAx">In a series of demonstration trials, N-of-1 trials have been confirmed to have the potential to lead to valuable changes in treatment, cessation of treatment, or confirmation of the original treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_RVsACxt">For example, in one series of 71 completed N-of-1 trials for patients with chronic pain or osteoarthritis, 46 patients (65%) decided to change their pain medication as a result of the information from the trials, and of the 37 patients using a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug or cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitor drug for pain management before their trials, 12 (32%) decided that the medication was not helping and stopped using it as a result of their trial results.</s><s xml:id="_HfWmEdc">Thus, N-of-1 trials can help individuals and their physicians empirically evaluate what is the best treatment for that patient.</s></p><p xml:id="_7jsNVSR"><s xml:id="_Ckpj6H4">N-of-1 trials might be especially well suited to helping patients find treatments that work to improve their health behaviors, ranging from low physical activity to medication adherence.</s><s xml:id="_AmnP98y">First, there are likely to be substantial differences in the underlying mechanisms for why different patients are nonadherent to recommended health behaviors.</s><s xml:id="_FnBwVGD">Given the challenges of identifying the specific mechanism in advance and then selecting the treatment, simply allowing a patient to test various promising treatments at the outset may be more helpful for finding the treatment that works for them.</s><s xml:id="_XvZH7H8">Second, the advent of mobile health devices such as actigraphers and electronic medication monitors can now facilitate the continuous and objective measurement of health behaviors.</s><s xml:id="_yMPv5Gw">This has substantially reduced participant burden and increased feasibility and rigor of behavioral N-of-1 trials.</s></p><p xml:id="_7FQW5j9"><s xml:id="_xu5zmUM">N-of-1 trials require the ability to collect sufficient outcomes data within a single patient to have enough power within-subject to compare differences in effect between treatments.</s><s xml:id="_9kNZKfC">Thus, N-of-1 trials are not well suited to prevention efforts relevant to health outcomes that infrequently occur, for example preventing migraine headaches that occur on, at most, a monthly basis.</s><s xml:id="_UE7anRW">They are, however, well suited to comparing interventions for preventive health behaviors that can be continuously measured such as physical activity.</s><s xml:id="_tFaWr6Y">Similarly, N-of-1 trials might be well suited to comparing interventions, at the individual level, that have the goal of maintaining health behaviors that are otherwise expected to rapidly decline over time.</s><s xml:id="_NgafUYv">Interestingly, N-of-1 trials can also be useful for determining whether to discontinue a treatment.</s><s xml:id="_MuYUeHb">In our era of polypharmacy with many treatments having unclear benefit, N-of-1 trials that are designed to help dismantle a regimen may be a particularly promising use case.</s></p><p xml:id="_qUzZWg3"><s xml:id="_QunuCYe">A secondary benefit of N-of-1 trials is that they have the potential to provide different treatment estimates than those derived from between-subject trial designs or conventional parallel-arm RCTs.</s><s xml:id="_X4aTNw4">Evidence from conventional between-subject RCTs can conclude that the intervention tested was safe and effective on average but that particular intervention may have had an uneven mix of risks and benefits to individual patients, a problem quantified as heterogeneity of treatment effect (HTE) for those participants randomized to receive the intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref> and defined by Kravitz and colleagues as the "magnitude of the variation of individual treatment effects across a population" <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_PBpuVC9">This broad definition also contains a more operational definition of HTE as the interaction of the treatment condition with individual participant characteristics.</s><s xml:id="_AMXppeQ">However, in conventional RCTs, there is limited power to detect such interactions, even in a meta-analysis combining the results from several studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WASxWG4">There are exciting possibilities about the ways to calculate HTE from a series of N-of-1 trials pooled together that might yield a substantially different estimate than one calculated from a between-subject design or meta-analysis.</s><s xml:id="_3hBnVmP">One participant, for example, could have a medium-sized treatment effect that is positive, but if that participant also had a medium-sized positive effect response to the placebo, there would be a different result from averaging this type of net treatment effect than what would be found in a between-subject trial design (although between-person trials do indeed have a similar problem in variation in control group and treatment as usual effects) <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EBZbMXt">Importantly, understanding when HTE is occurring with our health psychology interventions will help health psychology researchers, clinicians, and policymakers identify those interventions or treatments that might best be studied by N-of-1 trials, rather than continuing to be tested with a between-subject RCTs.</s></p><p xml:id="_FtKW7YF"><s xml:id="_MHfu4Ra">In contrast to conventional between-subject RCTs, the N-of-1 approach assumes that each person is sufficiently unique to warrant his/her own test of the usefulness of an intervention.</s><s xml:id="_ykxdkuY">However, one cannot determine whether this approach is generalizable for specific outcomes, interventions, or individuals unless multiple N-of-1 trials are conducted and their results pooled.</s><s xml:id="_HJwzsUv">Such a pooling would allow one to test whether the treatment effect is homogeneous or heterogeneous, and whether an N-of-1 RCT is necessary to identify which participants will predominantly benefit from this particular intervention or experimental condition.</s><s xml:id="_2HaYPGW">Thus, N-of-1 designs may allow for a more accurate translation of research findings and higher probability of increasing our understanding of who may benefit from many of our health behavior interventions.</s></p><p xml:id="_D4vUapd"><s xml:id="_SUqu64Z">All these N-of-1 trial considerations present a challenge for health psychology researchers, clinicians, and theorists.</s><s xml:id="_Jc2n6ex">Medicine, particularly with pharmaceutical interventions, has data on most of these aspects before trials of any type are conducted.</s><s xml:id="_XSJ6F2X">Health psychologists need to further their empirical research in this area to better specify which BCTs, theories, and other health psychology interventions can be appropriately tested in a N-of-1 RCT.</s><s xml:id="_MZeMF75">To aid in the progress toward this goal, we conducted a systematic review to assess the quality of the methods and statistics used in N-of-1 trials, to describe the interventions and outcomes in N-of-1 trials for health

xml:id="_6vXryfC">Indications include substantial clinical uncertainty, chronic or frequently recurring symptomatic conditions, and treatments with rapid onset and minimal carryover.</s><s xml:id="_xtQWp7u">Contraindications include rapidly progressive condition, treatment with slow onset or prolonged carryover, and participant or investigator insufficiently interested in reducing therapeutic uncertainty to justify effort.</s></p><p xml:id="_rWxBhMM"><s xml:id="_8EtR7UM">Second, after establishing the applicability of the N-of-1 method to the clinical question, one must select trial duration, treatment period length, and a sequencing scheme.</s><s xml:id="_5qJF6xJ">In so doing, one might consider that longer trial duration offers greater precision but may be difficult or tedious to complete with the potential for dropout during the trial.</s><s xml:id="_RqUGZK5">Furthermore, treatment period length should be adjusted to fit the therapeutic half-life (of drug treatments) or treatment onset and duration (of nondrug treatments).</s><s xml:id="_rf8yMen">Finally, although simple randomization optimizes masking, counterbalanced sequencing is generally a more reliable guarantor of validity given the limited number of repetitions that are possible within the sequence of treatments without overburdening participants conducting the N-of-1 trials.</s></p><p xml:id="_P3aARgG"><s xml:id="_VYEcNTn">Third, one should implement a washout period if indicated.</s><s xml:id="_phNafCU">Washout is sometimes more acceptable and indicated if treatment duration of action is short relative to treatment period and contraindicated if participants could be harmed by cessation of active treatment.</s><s xml:id="_mkJS9rB">For instances in which withholding treatment is unethical, one can use an analytic approach that down weights, disregards, or does not collect outcomes at the beginning of a treatment period <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xnnfeNc">Other modeling approaches are possible.</s><s xml:id="_NcyX7SQ">Researchers should also consider data trends in N-of-1 trials (e.g., increases in step counts) attributable to increased intervention exposure and learning over time.</s><s xml:id="_Sv4zbSR">Masking is feasible for pharmacologic interventions but challenging for most nondrug treatments (behavioral, lifestyle).</s><s xml:id="_AYJWHq6">Adequate masking allows investigators to distinguish between specific and nonspecific treatment effects, although in some circumstances, this distinction might not matter to participants and investigators.</s></p><p xml:id="_Ay9u4Aa"><s xml:id="_sYYv5rX">Fourth, one should select suitable outcome domains and measures, although one should also consider that patient-centeredness should not be trumped by psychometric considerations <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hNXHc66">Of note, outcome domains and measure must also be validated and easily repeatable in order to ensure N-of-1 trials are feasible from a participant burden and validity of results point of view.</s><s xml:id="_TpbMsUk">Finally, measures that have been used in prior N-of-1 trials may be preferred if pooling of results to understand population level HTE is desired.</s></p><p xml:id="_yfJZFHe"><s xml:id="_wKbG9uF">Fifth, one must analyze and present data to support clinical decision making by participants and investigators.</s><s xml:id="_6YgUwmJ">A reasonable approach is to select one or two primary outcome measures that best represent benefits and harms.</s><s xml:id="_e2MuDCJ">For clinician-prescribed treatments, data should be presented using a variety of both statistical and graphical methods to fully explicate the data in a participant-friendly manner that facilitates shared decision making with their clinicians while allowing for the calculation of sample sizes or number of repetitions in future N-of-1 studies.</s></p><p xml:id="_UHheWsq"><s xml:id="_jGDmXtP">Sixth, ethical considerations for N-of-1 trials are also important.</s><s xml:id="_DkbMhQe">There should not be a clear clinical preference for or against one of the treatments based on known health outcomes (equipoise) <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_PkBDNrG">In addition, one must consider whether informed consent and institutional review board (IRB) approval are required.</s><s xml:id="_XTuf4gJ">In practice, clinicians often test treatments, measure outcomes, and determine whether to continue or change treatment, in what has been referred to as a "trial and error" approach.</s><s xml:id="_aGmpu4W">Clinicians do not obtain IRB approval for every clinical decision.</s><s xml:id="_jmv95uN">If clinicians were to incorporate the more scientific N-of-1 method into this process, purely for the purpose of guiding treatment decisions for that individual patients (and not for publication), then many would argue that it would be ethical to pursue the N-of-1 approach to patient care without IRB involvement.</s><s xml:id="_rXjCaPS">We envision a future in which N-of-1 trials become more routinely incorporated into care pathways, without the burdensome requirements of IRB approval.</s><s xml:id="_WJa2Uca">Of course, if N-of-1 trials are designed to aggregate and disseminate the results, then IRB involvement may be necessary.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_Q5eDRFE">Limitations of the Current Review</head><p xml:id="_TEwWgDZ"><s xml:id="_jFTwubX">Notwithstanding the timely nature of this comprehensive review, some limitations deserve mention.</s><s xml:id="_QK2XmYB">First, our search strategy did not include questionnaires or scales, which commonly are specifically developed and validated for self-report outcomes for outcome evaluations for specific conditions (e.g., depression scales).</s><s xml:id="_NZJVk8N">Second, we have not provided detailed information on how to statistically analyze N-of-1 trials (e.g., by discussing which intraclass correlations are necessary and how to conduct time-series analyses).</s><s xml:id="_NJ8epRn">We believe this discussion is beyond the scope of the current paper, and we refer the reader to other literature (e.g., Duan et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[38]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_Ab7erJP">Third, our initial search strategy did not include the term single case or single patient.</s><s xml:id="_buYBBys">We corrected for this oversight by conducting an additional search strategy with these terms and found that none of the articles recovered were eligible for inclusion in this review.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_qGRnDht">Conclusions</head><p xml:id="_7byqgR7"><s xml:id="_BXRNFbm">Increasing recognition, based on statistical, methodological, and empirical grounds, points to serious problems with between-subject designs to test health psychologyrelevant interventions and outcomes, particularly when HTE is large.</s><s xml:id="_QnuZYEb">These issues are particularly pernicious for the investigation of areas of interest to health psychology because universal laws are unlikely to operate for many of the behaviors or processes we wish to change.</s><s xml:id="_eVFhWcX">Furthermore, even if exemplar universal behaviors exist, they are more likely at the level of reflexes, operating before exposure to environmental, learning, and other idiographic influences.</s><s xml:id="_6hXMM86">Aggregating well-designed N-of-1 trials may help us more definitively answer the question as to whether certain behavioral treatments are broadly useful or whether ideographic approaches are essential to achieving large treatment effects in health psychology-relevant problems.</s><s xml:id="_9pUPvpB">Efforts to compare the N-of-1 approach to usual practice will help us learn which areas of health psychology can best avail themselves of this personalized approach.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Fig. 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p xml:id="_Gbm8bg4"><s xml:id="_xgRftj6">Fig. 1 Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses flow diagram for N-of-1 health psychology trials</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="5,117.64,333.43,360.00,370.44" type="bitmap" /></figure>
