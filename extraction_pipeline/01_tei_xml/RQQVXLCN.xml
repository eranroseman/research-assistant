others were experimental interventions designed to increase the rate of testing.</s><s xml:id="_fv6PFsx">Because radon is a new and evolving public issue, the year in which each study was conducted is another relevant variable.</s><s xml:id="_awrqW2p">For example, in 1986, 50% of our respondents said they had never thought about testing <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Weinstein et al., 1987)</ref>, compared with only 14% of respondents from approximately the same region in 1988-1989 <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">(Weinstein et al., 1989)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_dEQg2vs">Due to these differences among the data sets, we focus on those findings that have proved most consistent and do not try to explain why a particular relation might be stronger in one data set than in another.</s></p><p xml:id="_6YKRYwB"><s xml:id="_VGhaYYt">To examine the stage notions introduced earlier, we define six stages of radon testing (maintenance has limited relevance to radon testing because follow-up tests are often unnecessary): "never having heard about radon" "having heard about radon but never having thought about testing one's own home," "trying to decide whether to test," "having decided not to test," "having decided to test but not having carried out any testing," and "testing or having already tested" (see Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>).</s></p><p xml:id="_DrFQSU8"><s xml:id="_x5AnHyP">Because testing one's home takes some time, it is possible to separate testers into two groups: people who have a test in progress and people who have received completed test results.</s><s xml:id="_kYPp733">This distinction is crucial because receiving a test result undoubtedly alters beliefs about the likelihood of finding a problem in one's homewith the test result, people now know whether they have a problemand, consequently, alters the emotions one feels when thinking about radon.</s><s xml:id="_7jewA2Q">In a cross-sectional survey, the differences between these two groups tell us more about the consequences of testing than about stages along the path to testing.</s><s xml:id="_snfTYyp">Thus, when we must rely on cross-sectional data and are looking for differences between intending to act and actually obtaining a test, we disregard the people who have received their test results.</s></p></div>
