2) the establishment of the chosen theoretical framework and development of content; 3) a necessary review of the created content for quality assurance, safety, and research standards, as well as a pretest to gauge initial user feedback on the messages;

target="#b39">[40]</ref>, the accessibility and enhanced generative capabilities of contemporary large-scale pretrained models like those in the GPT series have magnified their impact and broadened

LLM use lies in the art and science of prompt engineering.</s><s xml:id="_Jw5M97T">A prompt is any input given to an LLM that influences the nature of the LLM's output <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_RZwQrKr">Prompts are often given as sets of instructions or requests that establish the rules and guidelines of the conversation.</s><s xml:id="_EN7JsuZ">Through prompt engineering, the context of the conversation can be strategically structured to direct the LLM to process relevant information and shape the desired form and content of its output <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[45]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_phjb9Nh">This process is pivotal in refining and enhancing the capabilities of generative models and allows for the generation of more precise and relevant responses, which is especially imperative in complex fields like health care where the accuracy of information is essential.</s></p><p xml:id="_2skG3Bb"><s xml:id="_TKs3pEu">Prompt engineering for LLMs is appropriate for the preliminary design of health care interventions for many reasons.</s><s xml:id="_9kpv5DK">First, LLMs can rapidly generate vast amounts of content, effectively reducing both the time and costs typically required for intervention development.</s><s xml:id="_BUPNhDc">This efficiency may allow researchers to allocate resources more appropriately, diverting their energies toward other critical aspects of the project while enabling the exploration of diverse content approaches that were previously considered daunting or impractical.</s><s xml:id="_5caS3wT">Moreover, LLMs serve as a vital aid to researchers who may not have an extensive background in content design.</s><s xml:id="_c6jU748">By providing large amounts of well-written, contextually tailored content, these models offer a structured foundation that researchers can then build upon and further customize during the content review process while avoiding the overwhelm of "blank page paralysis" commonly inherent to creative tasks <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[46]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_J5nh7cc"><s xml:id="_sJ777GF">Perhaps most significantly for health care intervention research, the application of generative AI introduces a revolutionary level of transparency into the content creation process.</s><s xml:id="_GHeHCGf">By leveraging generative AI models as configurable tools, researchers gain access to a more standardized and reproducible approach for content design.</s><s xml:id="_Gx7v4jz">This is primarily enabled through the adjustment of key parameters, such as the "temperature" setting, which are essential for tailoring the models' outputs to specific needs <ref type="bibr" target="#b46">[47,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">48]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_j9PPq8c">A lower temperature results in more predictable and conservative outputs, while a higher temperature allows for increased variability and creativity in responses.</s><s xml:id="_5mes7Zz">Such configurability not only ensures reproducibility and accessibility but also allows for the establishment of standardized writing styles for health care interventions by minimizing the influence of tone, style, and other confounding variables.</s><s xml:id="_65EyFgY">With a clearer understanding of the content generation process, researchers are
