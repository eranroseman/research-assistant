Health systems should insist on user-friendly design for all products purchased or developed.</s><s xml:id="_9c723Hm">Because of the limited number of EHR options available, each health care system may not feel that it can base its purchasing decisions on the usefulness of the product for its patient population (or even the capacity to make changes to the existing product).</s><s xml:id="_hRCpJhF">However, the collective purchasing power of many health care systems demanding accessibility could make an impact on this issue given the relatively small number of EHR vendors in this space.</s></p><p xml:id="_BKarZ6z"><s xml:id="_9FQDRSX">2. Following standard practices for other printed educational materials, health care leaders should advocate for availability of portal content in the languages commonly spoken by the system's target population (often defined as 5% of the population, or 1000 or more patients served 28</s></p><p xml:id="_7B4VYkk"><s xml:id="_J5WMFCT">). Word-for-word or automated translations are often inadequate, as materials need to be adapted for cultural and linguistic differences to retain meaning.</s><s xml:id="_zbPmb8p">3. Systems should plan for in-person and online training programs that can enhance skills, patient activation, and ultimately rates of portal use among those with communication barriers, even through partnerships with libraries and other communitybased organizations with experience in digital literacy promotion.</s><s xml:id="_QjPsyCH">Online educational and self-management support materials should be considered a supplement to, not a substitute for, in-person education.</s><s xml:id="_JTcDgbp">4. Health care systems should promote more active outreach and engagement in portal use from family members and other caregivers and proxies, 29 who are critical for health care access for a growing proportion of the US population.</s><s xml:id="_ZMxevMD">This would include formalizing procedures to enable family engagement in portal use. 5. Health systems as well as academic institutions should support additional basic research and implementation of existing technologies to overcome communication barriers, such as integrating digital tools to help with comprehension of complex medical terminology.</s></p><p xml:id="_maJz684"><s xml:id="_SJ35n7H">Because digital access to medical information is becoming a core domain of medicine, the public health and medical communities should be spearheading efforts to address this digital divide.</s><s xml:id="_pECWATN">Although health care systems continue to offer alternate ways of communication (e.g., phone, in-person) to access pieces of the EHR, digital communication is rapidly evolving as a primary means of care.</s><s xml:id="_2ys96Cz">The future centrality of digital health, combined with the legal and ethical frameworks on which health care is constructed, create an imperative for implementing portal accessibility strategies now.</s></p></div>
