showing the estimates of staff time separately makes it easy for potential adopters to apply their wage and fringe rates.</s><s xml:id="_kqZUvKp">Although staff might be asked to work overtime for a while, thus increasing costs initially, it seems unlikely that that solution would be used for an intervention that lasts several years.</s><s xml:id="_6t9td4Y">Costs may also vary with the demographic composition of the eligible population.</s><s xml:id="_7sm4g7U">Researchers can only provide estimates for populations reasonably close in size and composition to the ones from which the trial participants were drawn.</s></p><p xml:id="_SnptFXy"><s xml:id="_TZacy3x">If, however, the intervention was offered through one of the growing number of companies that specialize in providing behavioral interventions, the size of the adopting organization, an employer or a health plan, and the expected number of participants, might not matter.</s><s xml:id="_ztCMzZ9">The adopter would be only one of many customers, and the specialist company would be able to spread costs over all of them.</s></p><p xml:id="_kNJ7Rmh"><s xml:id="_CQjjcG3">Although validation is beyond the scope of this article, a useful next step would be to study the costs incurred by organizations that adopt behavioral interventions to determine whether estimates based on trial data accurately predict adopters' costs.</s></p><p xml:id="_nBqeeCd"><s xml:id="_t5HWR59">Our primary purpose in this article has been to describe how to estimate the costs that would be incurred by potential adopters of an intervention.</s><s xml:id="_yEyNeMJ">The same costs and methods could provide some of the information needed for the cost-effectiveness analyses used by policy makers to decide whether to approve new medical services for coverage.</s><s xml:id="_vtsb2Zz">Micro-costing is often used to cost interventions, so the detailed enumeration of resources and estimates of staff time would be particularly useful.</s><s xml:id="_zzrhbwE">The final cost estimates would, however, need to reflect the circumstances and perspective of the decision maker.</s><s xml:id="_b3BkWbH">For example, insurers would want to adjust for any costsharing by participants, while analyses from the perspective of the health care system as a whole, recommended by the Second Panel on Cost-Effectiveness in Health and Medicine, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">14</ref> would need to include the full costs of the intervention, regardless of payer, including any additional costs incurred by participants not measured in the trial.</s></p><p xml:id="_69hMM5C"><s xml:id="_FBgRF2q">In summary, behavioral health interventions are increasingly prevalent but are not easily costed using standard administrative and billing data sources.</s><s xml:id="_RfqMjHS">Employers and health plans may be interested in offering behavioral interventions but want to know more about the likely costs of implementing them.</s><s xml:id="_bz2NfZn">Clinical researchers can help prospective adopters understand these costs, increasing the potential for translation of their research into practice, by undertaking a few special efforts during the trial to cost implementation tasks and publishing their cost estimates.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p xml:id="_WU6PgC9"><s xml:id="_mUAuBSe">Figure 1 Flow chart of steps and methods.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="5,55.79,82.21,480.19,246.33" type="bitmap" /></figure>
