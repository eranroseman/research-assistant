constructs, and they may not be as effective as those that involve end users in the design process <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_22XEZDR">In recent times, user-centered design-based approaches have been reportedly used for building mHealth apps, most of which are focused on chronic diseases <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr"

design, and social marketing) framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_293Xx3f"><s xml:id="_jXayNGe">Despite the growth of user-centered design-based mHealth apps built for patients and the general public, there has been little exploration of how to use them for health professionals as end users.</s><s xml:id="_ZBebDHJ">Hence, little is known about the unique challenges and opportunities for applying user-centered design to build apps for health professionals.</s></p><p xml:id="_F5b6Z2T"><s xml:id="_y3uXdBF">Our findings are drawn upon a real-world design process where the authors have employed a participatory design-based user-centered design approach to build an mHealth app targeting health professionals.</s><s xml:id="_fVKTSef">Traditionally, laboratory-related information is made available to the staff through a laboratory service manual, which is a 217-page document accessed via the hospital intranet, describing over 525 laboratory investigations and procedures available at the hospital.</s><s xml:id="_qJYBTka">The idea of delivering this information through an mHealth app was conceived as a result of an audit conducted to describe the phone call patterns received at the laboratory and a follow-up survey conducted among health professionals that revealed the towering demand for laboratory-related information and the infrequent use of the laboratory service manual by end users who were inclined toward an mHealth intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_CfGxrby">Combined, these findings set out the primary objective of this app, which is to replace the existing laboratory service manual and to create an efficient, convenient platform to deliver medical laboratory-related information to health professionals at Ng Teng Fong General Hospital, Singapore, on a daily basis.</s></p><p xml:id="_sWdey9b"><s xml:id="_BX5xmtY">Health professionals' frequent dilemmas related to laboratory tests in clinical practice take many forms: deciding the adequacy of the size of a specimen according to laboratory's rejection criteria, clarifying the correct method of collection and specimen container, decisions related to the urgency of investigations and results, etc.</s><s xml:id="_mEbrxqS">In these scenarios, laboratory-related information such as specimen type, minimum sample size, appropriate specimen container or tube, method of collection, special instructions (eg, fasting blood sample), turnaround time, price, etc, play an important role in decision making.</s></p><p xml:id="_dsSkVtA"><s xml:id="_VCJjdph">The contribution of this paper is twofold: first, we describe our methods, materials, results, and outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_Ef2wp95">Then, by
