Superb access to care: ease of making an appointment; ability of patients to select the day and time of their appointment themselves; timely appointments; short waiting time in office; timely response to e-mails and telephone calls; efficient use of physician and patient time; e-mail and telephone visits when they are an appropriate substitute for in-person care; electronic prescription refills; and an offhours service that makes primary care readily accessible on nights, weekends, and holidays.</s><s xml:id="_8GU8zG6">2. Patient engagement in care: option for patients to be informed and engaged partners in their care, including a recasting of clinician roles as advisers, with patients or designated surrogates for incapacitated patients serving as the locus of decision making (when desired by patients); information for patients on condition/treatment options/treatment plan; clear delineation of roles and responsibilities for patients, caretakers, and clinicians; patient reminders/alerts for routine preventive care or when special follow-up is necessary (e.g., abnormal test results, or changes needed in dosage of a medication); patient access to their medical records and their ability to add or clarify information in the record; assistance with self-care; assistance with behavior change; patient education; and anticipatory guidance and counseling for parents on child health and development issues.</s><s xml:id="_7HC7Zp8">3. Clinical information systems that support high-quality care, practice-based learning, and quality improvement: registries; monitoring adherence; ease of access to laboratory and diagnostic test results; physician and patient reminders/alerts; decision support for physicians and patients; information on recommended treatment plans; and longitudinal charts on risk factors/use of services/outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_QSxrVSw">4. Care coordination: coordination of specialist care, including systems that monitor whether recommended referrals take place; prompt feedback of specialist consultation reports to primary care physicians and patients; information about the availability and quality of specialty services and community resources; systems to prevent errors that occur when multiple physicians or sites are involved in care; posthospital follow-up and support; tracking of tests, test results, procedures, and the filling of prescriptions to monitor patient adherence to mutually agreed-upon diagnostic and treatment plans; and communication among health care providers who care for a patient but do so in different geographic locations or at different times.</s><s xml:id="_4a7BYgm">5. Integrated, comprehensive care and smooth information transfer across a fixed or virtual team of providers: including physicians, advanced practice nurses, nurses, and others, as needed (e.g., social workers, nutritionists, health educators, exercise physiologists, and behavioral health specialists), and elimination of duplication of information and testing.</s></p><p xml:id="_k354uZV"><s xml:id="_KNMwHUt">6. Ongoing, routine patient feedback to a practice: using, for example, low-cost, internet-based, patient-centered care surveys, leading to targeted plans for practice improvement.</s><s xml:id="_C3zze6w">Such surveys following a patient encounter or episode of care could be used by the physician or practice to understand what went right or wrong from the perspective of the patient and suggest opportunities for improvement.</s><s xml:id="_k3wWfqq">An engaged patient is more likely to be compliant, to understand his or her condition, and thus more likely to have a better quality of life and satisfaction with the health care system. 9</s><s xml:id="_pXVwD7A">7. Publicly available information on practices: information by which a patient could choose a physician or a practice most likely to meet the patient's needs, and physician directories meeting National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA)recommended standards (e.g., information about credentials, office locations, hours of practice, age, gender, race, quality of care, patient experiences with clinician, and peer assessment of practices). <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s xml:id="_5jUpUKx">rtainly, these concepts are not revolutionary, but consistent with recommendations by experts and primary care professional organizations over the last 25 years.</s><s xml:id="_57NK7A4">Twenty-five years ago, Malcolm L. Peterson, on behalf of the American College of Physicians, ascribed 4 unique attributes to primary care: accessible, comprehensive, coordinated, and continuous. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11</ref></s><s xml:id="_jXE3WHm">This has been elaborated slightly over time, but still remains at the heart of professional recommendations.</s><s xml:id="_dawfkm9">For example, the IOM defines primary care as: ''the provision of integrated, accessible health care services by clinicians who are accountable for addressing the large majority of personal health care needs, developing a sustained partnership with patients, and practicing in the context of family and community.'' <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">12</ref></s><s xml:id="_Y2EB7ak">Starfield advanced the measurement of primary care by setting forth 4 structural elements of the health services system (accessibility, range of services, eligible population, and continuity) and 2 process features (utilization of services by the population and recognition of problems by health service practitioners). <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s xml:id="_HeuC3hj">More recently, Showstack et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> set out 7 core principles to guide the renaissance of primary care: health care organized to serve the needs of patients; the delivery of the highest quality care as documented by measurable outcomes; information and information systems; redesign of health care systems; redesign of the health care financing system to support excellent primary care practice; revitalization of primary care education; and the continual improvement of primary care.</s><s xml:id="_AZf5WJG">Safran <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> in particular has called for creating sustained clinician-patient partnerships and providing care that is oriented to the whole person.</s><s xml:id="_D7aCxAC">She has stressed the importance of teams, primary care as a contract with patients, and integration of care.</s></p><p xml:id="_JpXU5mk"><s xml:id="_ZN9kXFh">The Society of General Internal Medicine Task Force on the Domain of General Internal Medicine stressed teams, information systems, and financial incentives to improve quality and efficiency in the provision of comprehensive, ongoing care. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s xml:id="_C4rf4tz">The Future of Family Medicine Project Leadership Committee developed similar themes, calling for a new model of practice that provides patients with a medical home and an expected basket of services, including a patient-centered team approach, elimination of barriers to access, advanced information systems including an electronic health record, redesigned, more functional offices, a focus on quality and outcomes, and enhanced practice finance. <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s xml:id="_epKcmYF">The American Academy of Pediatrics was an early leader in calling for the medical home concept. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref></s></p></div>

So it is important to provide solutions that are realistic and do not create a new layer of problems.</s><s xml:id="_NmZwE25">First, financial issues must be addressed head-on, and physicians must be given easy access to resources and tools that they can implement easily in their practice.</s><s xml:id="_B4ttUst">The UK had the advantage of setting new expectations for primary care physicians at the same time it increased resources to finance health carethrough a tax increase enacted specifically to improve access in the National Health Service.</s><s xml:id="_xANKkUG">In the U.S., it may be necessary to achieve offsetting savings, either in specialty care or in reduced use of hospital and emergency room care to finance improved primary care.</s><s xml:id="_nWujKnH">One way to begin would be to ensure that all Americanswhether insured by public programs or private insurance, or uninsured-have a ''medical home.''</s><s xml:id="_xyreSpt">Indeed, patient-centered care ought to begin in the medical home.</s><s xml:id="_rqXPWtM">Adoption of a Danishstyle medical home would have many advantages, including improved continuity of care and a clear set of rights and responsibilities for both physicians and patients.</s></p><p xml:id="_83rzMrf"><s xml:id="_9gPQUJJ">To support the development of medical homes within primary care practices, there would need to be new incentives for primary care physicians.</s><s xml:id="_3tkAtbf">A new system of payment for primary care could include both a medical home monthly fee to encourage better physician-patient communication and coordination of care, combined with the current fee-for-service payment system.</s><s xml:id="_97ag4Ne">The medical home fee component would need to be sufficient to cover the cost of nonreimbursable services such as information technology and other practice systems to ensure patient-centered care, such as patient surveys and patient reminder systems.</s><s xml:id="_wudxXa3">A model for this could be the blended per-patient fee and fee-for-service system in use in Denmark. <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref></s><s xml:id="_ACyfdUC">In the U.S., Newhouse has advocated a blended payment

incentive payments for reaching quality targets to this payment system would be an interesting innovation.</s><s xml:id="_wPECNXM">Paying for performance would focus primary care practices on the importance of measuring and improving quality of care, including conducting patient surveys of patient experiences with care.</s><s xml:id="_qSkQgzn">In the UK system, major ''points'' are awarded simply for conducting such surveys, informing a supervising physician if there is one (for example, head of a primary care trust), and indicating that they have taken steps to address the concerns.</s><s xml:id="_X4nAaB3">For example, if patients complain that it takes too long to get an appointment, physicians could indicate that they have instituted a system of same-day appointments.</s><s xml:id="_xtJqXG4">Experience with this new reward and reporting system should be followed closely.</s></p><p xml:id="_peafUQq"><s xml:id="_ufTUqQc">In the U.S., patient-centered care practices could be paid a fixed monthly fee for a package of services such as e-mail visits, reminders, access to electronic medical records, and demonstrating easy access to care when needed by the patient.</s><s xml:id="_NteyCeU">These payments would offset the additional personnel, physician time, information technology, and office system costs that would be required to deliver these services.</s></p><p xml:id="_PtGVtwb"><s xml:id="_3tuByV7">Demonstrations would be necessary to test the concept, and a business case could be developed with appropriate costing of the enhanced services.</s><s xml:id="_h6wsydP">Research would also be needed to document the impact of this patient-centered model of primary care-its impact on quality of ambulatory care, offsetting savings from reduced specialty care, emergency room use, and hospital utilization and, importantly, patient satisfaction and clinical outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_jFSDenw">Obviously, unless it is demonstrated that there are offsetting savings, this model will not be adopted widely.</s></p><p xml:id="_PpU2dht"><s xml:id="_NhtYqu2">There are potentially other primary care payment models that could stimulate
