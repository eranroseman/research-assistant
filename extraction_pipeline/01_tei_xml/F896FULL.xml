of ES, which provides a clear explanation of the rules, and the associated parameters that led to a specific conclusion.</s><s xml:id="_XFt7FeM">Since medical applications are expected to be highly transparent and accountable, clinicians favor ES, in which the system reasoning is traceable, easy to understand, and closely aligns with their own diagnostic processes, as the ES essentially imitates their decision-making.</s><s xml:id="_6jhM2Mu">Besides, most works involving ML methods for mental disorder diagnosis such as <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">(Mateo-Sotos et al., 2022)</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(Erguzel et al., 2016)</ref>, and <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">(Saghayan et al., 2023)</ref> are mostly developed using EEG, sMRI, that are essentially recorded symptoms other than behavioural.</s><s xml:id="_kJY6JTD">This can be related due to the scarcity of recorder behavioural datasets in this domain, as well as the complexity and reliability that advanced AI models must achieve before being used as DSS in this context.</s><s xml:id="_PST5FJS">Nonetheless, since behavioral symptoms are the primary focus of this study, AI works involving image and EEG samples are considered outside the scope and are not followed any further.</s></p><p xml:id="_Tdtu4MP"><s xml:id="_HqEe3Ah">A brief review of the most successful ES frameworks alongside the

diagnosis of physical illnesses such as heart disease <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">(Serkova et al., 2017)</ref>, Asthma problems <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">(Prasad et al., 2011)</ref>, Diabetes <ref type="bibr" target="#b54">(Sevani et al., 2020)</ref>, lower back pain (Abu Naser &amp; AlDahdooh, 2016), Hypertension <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">(Kaur &amp; Kaur, 2015)</ref>, breast cancer

target="#b40">(Oyedeji et al., 2019)</ref> have targeted mental disorders.</s><s xml:id="_k7eRkjd">The reason that these illnesses has progressed can be categorized into three main reasons.</s><s xml:id="_XNh3WYq">First, illnesses such as Diabetes, Asthma, and lower back pain are found to have straight-forward rule development, which can be identified from standard medical transcripts.</s><s xml:id="_TmENQeH">For this reason, the related works in this regard are often emphasized on semi-automating the diagnosing procedure, rather than developing DSS for consulting with practitioners.</s><s xml:id="_CrrsR3W">Second, the noted studies are mostly competing on fine-tunning the prediction accuracy: thus, the original set of rules are established, and they are less likely to undergo significant changes.</s><s xml:id="_SUKkbNV">Instead, the focus is on improving precision and reliability using various technoques.</s><s xml:id="_EqjHBTU">Last but not least, works involving physical illnesses are generally more transparent in terms of diagnosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b57">(Tse et al., 2019)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9wMrFNs">This issue is even more highlightened for mental illnesses in which a wide range of symptoms are similar.</s><s xml:id="_etUX6ND">Consequently, there are very few works available for diagnosing metal illnesses.</s></p><p xml:id="_7TXRTcr"><s xml:id="_J7y4X6h">To name a few, the study carried out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">(Nunes et al., 2009)</ref> developed an ES capable of diagnosing early symptoms of psychological disorders dedicatd for students.</s><s xml:id="_a2WqbBb">While their methodology included a wide range of behavioural symptoms for students, the study did not conclude any specific illness label and served as an early alert of psychological disorders for students.</s><s xml:id="_AwqTvBm">Furthermore, the rules were not general to be adopted for individuals other than students.</s></p><p xml:id="_3a5hnZe"><s xml:id="_UeakXYn">A broader study on mental disorders is carried out in <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">(Hossain et al., 2016)</ref>, focusing on addressing uncertainties in the assessment of mental disorders.</s><s xml:id="_cxqMWX3">To do so, they addressed the challenges due to the inherent uncertainties associated with signs, symptoms, and linguistic terms such as ambiguity, imprecision, and vagueness that traditional methods in psychopathology face by developing a belief rule-based ES (BRBES).</s><s xml:id="_5PxgabQ">The study demonstrates that BRBES provides more reliable results compared to both fuzzy rule-based ES and human experts, by simply providing evidential reasoning as the inference engine and a belief rule base as the knowledge representation schema.</s><s xml:id="_MjHHUGw">The proposed ES found to have 86% accuracy on average compared with the expert results.</s></p><p xml:id="_UAxUGP6"><s xml:id="_5Q5ycJu">In another study carried out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">(Muhammad et al., 2019)</ref>, the authors developed an ES capable of diagnosing BD using 24 symptoms.</s><s xml:id="_5AeVeCA">They also provided an android application for intracting with the users, and a databse to keep track of their patiants.</s><s xml:id="_QuKyqSC">Similar to current study, they also utilized Certanaty Factor (CF) for rule evaluation: however, their work is different from the current study since their rules did not include any differenciation between BD, MDD, and normal individuals.</s><s xml:id="_vfFvS9f">As a result, the application only included diagnosis of BD.</s><s xml:id="_MxRXTkG">Also, no clinical validation was observed in their work.</s><s xml:id="_Zrh2tDk">Despite that, their ES showcased the potential of rule-based frameworks in diagnosing mental disorders.</s></p><p xml:id="_wzUT9Qe"><s xml:id="_QeR78D8">Similar with previous study, the work carried out by <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(Eiring et al., 2017)</ref> also involved development of an ES using C#, JS, for diagnosing BD.</s><s xml:id="_G4a2xqs">Unlike prior studies, their work include extensive collaboration with individuals from from Norway, the UK, and Ukraine for fine-tunning the developed rules.</s><s xml:id="_Ykz6QZ9">After three subsequent updates, the system usability score was improved to be 78%, that was reported 10% above the norm.</s><s xml:id="_AEwVJgj">Unfortunately, the rules and the datasets are not publicly accessible and only useable upon request.</s></p><p xml:id="_CrYtXyC"><s xml:id="_57SFQs8">Based on the reviewed studies, it is evident that there is limited research on diagnosing mental disorders.</s><s xml:id="_FsVEBRQ">Furthermore, existing works often lack crucial details such as the publication of datasets used for replication, the specific rules employed in developing the ES, and their associated reasoning, as well as clinical validation.</s></p><p xml:id="_dHy4vgY"><s xml:id="_DsvDNuS">Regarding research objectives, the authors found that no prior studies have specifically addressed the categorization of Mania BD, Depressive BD, and MDD from ordinary individuals.</s><s xml:id="_j6bNQpp">Previous research has primarily focused on developing diagnostic rules for only one of these conditions at a time.</s><s xml:id="_zGUcvUt">By considering the noted gaps, this study is formed to address all the described issues; thus, studies such as the proposed work can be a turning point for developing rule-based systems for mental disorder applications.</s></p><p xml:id="_U86e56y"><s xml:id="_tuSpTV3">In terms of future applicaton, it is also worth noting that as shown in Table <ref type="table">(1)</ref>, models based on ES can effectively manage simultaneous requests of numerous patients, prioritize appointments based on the severity of the symptoms, prescribe proper medicine with appropriate dosage, obtain a more decisive diagnosis, provide an oriented treatment, monitor the treatment phase of each patient <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(Marlinda et al., 2020)</ref>, follow up with patients during the recovery phase <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(Dai et al., 2021)</ref>, and provide regular updates for practitioners regarding their patients.</s><s xml:id="_gxhw9Uk">Therefore, it can be concluded that rule-based frameworks are suitable means for mental applications <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(Mgbeafulike &amp; Chidinma Nelly, 2021)</ref>.</s></p></div>
