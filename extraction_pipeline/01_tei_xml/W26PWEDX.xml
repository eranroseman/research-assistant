health.</s><s xml:id="_NrJnnqC">NCDs, such as cardiovascular diseases, cancers, and diabetes, are the leading causes of death worldwide, causing 41 million deaths each year, equivalent to 71% of all deaths globally <ref type="bibr">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7QN24cB">Furthermore, NCD-related medical costs significantly contribute to health care expenditure in many areas around the world <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">3]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_kquyMAV"><s xml:id="_wJASDQS">For people with NCDs, in addition to obtaining traditional medical treatment, it is essential to adopt a healthy lifestyle through health care intervention in order to avoid further progression and relapse of NCDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_QVdaqCe">In the recent 15 years, multiple health behavior change (MHBC, namely addressing no less than 2 health behaviors within a limited time period) has demonstrated early success in facilitating a healthy lifestyle among people with NCDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_T38EuYC">A statement in the Lancet pointed out that weight-related healthy behaviors including regular physical activity (PA) and healthy diet are promising interventions to control the NCD crisis globally <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[8]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_MXNvKjC"><s xml:id="_DF3Vw8w">The rationale of applying MHBC to weight-related behavior change is that most of the weight-related unhealthy behaviors (ie, physical inactivity, unhealthy diet) co-occur and are modifiable <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_g58jwTW">This assumption was empirically supported by a longitudinal study in which an unhealthy diet and physical inactivity strongly contributed to the onset of NCDs and a chain of negative effects including mortality and increasing health care costs <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_yw8NxXm">Moreover, it was proposed that "the effect of a small step leading to a big leap forward" also applied to MHBC.</s><s xml:id="_vFYrecm">A relatively easy health behavior change may serve as a gateway to an overall healthy lifestyle transition, as positive psychological factors such as self-efficacy and motivation can be boosted along with the initial behavior change, which in turn positively affects the subsequent one <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_zqdgj3n"><s xml:id="_vkrJnmu">In applying MHBC among people with NCDs, a cost-effective mode is to employ up-to-date eHealth approaches by using information and communication technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_X6utMCY">With the increasing number of people with NCDs, the traditional face-to-face intervention paradigm can hardly meet the needs of the population with NCDs.</s><s xml:id="_3mQCxDx">Thus eHealth, as an emerging delivery channel for health services and information using the internet and related technologies and media (eg, computers, smartphones), can be a potentially useful supplement for traditional interventions for the population with NCDs in aftercare family settings after discharge <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Auh7gkG">eHealth interventions also break the distance limitation and thus are highly recommended for their low cost, high efficiency, and easy data collection <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_h4Qcf6P">Many reviews have already shown substantial effects of employing eHealth approaches in addressing a single behavioral domain of either PA or healthy diet among people with NCDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_YVD33sq">For example, Haberlin et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[16]</ref> reviewed the use of eHealth to promote PA in cancer survivors and found that all the 10 included studies reported improvements in PA, with 8 of 10 studies reporting statistically significant changes.</s></p><p xml:id="_dBgQvkM"><s xml:id="_47zCusJ">There is an increasing number of studies combining the MHBC intervention paradigm with eHealth approaches to jointly promote weight-related health behaviors (PA and healthy diet) among people with NCDs <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Jaz42fR">However, a comprehensive summary of these relevant studies regarding the overall effects and study characteristics is still lacking.</s><s xml:id="_AVF8ZEe">To fill this gap, this review mainly aimed to systematically summarize the characteristics of the relevant intervention studies and then pool the effect sizes from the relevant studies to accurately quantify the effects of those interventions on PA, healthy diet, and weight.</s><s xml:id="_rKJzXpq">Findings of this review can provide recommendations for researchers and clinicians to develop effective eHealth intervention programs to promote PA and healthy diet among people with NCDs.</s></p></div>
