as long as individuals are presented with data collected about their activity or behavior, PI systems have often been presumed to enable individuals to "gain insights" about their activity or behavior and to facilitate (potential) behavior change.</s><s xml:id="_cPJJnxQ">Kersten-van Dijk et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref> called this assumption the self-improvement hypothesis, viewing a user as a self-motivated person who automatically reflects on their behavior by examining their data and subsequently changing their behavior based on what they've learned <ref type="bibr" target="#b118">[119]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_B9xCXnE">Without an explicit understanding of the definition and process of reflection, it is difficult to design technological interventions to scaffold effective reflective practices <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14,</ref><ref type="bibr">155]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rDQ4aKP">Thus, a better understanding of how reflection can be stimulated to support a meaningful interaction with tracking tools is required.</s></p><p xml:id="_JtEaEgh"><s xml:id="_YZVkCzv">While previous research provides conceptual frameworks of reflection as a resource for designing technologies <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b58">59</ref>, 155], little work has been done to characterize how these conceptual definitions can effectively be instantiated in system designs.</s><s xml:id="_3Fja8JV">Therefore, in this study, we propose a series of operational definitions of reflection by applying Fleck and Fitzpatrick's <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref> conceptual definition of reflection to the domain of personal informatics, in order to ask the following research question: how does the design of commercial PI apps support reflection?</s><s xml:id="_bZ4SATD">To answer this question, we surveyed 123 commercially available PI apps, coding their interaction features as they relate to Fleck and Fitzpatrick's levels of reflection <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_PES93XG">The ultimate objective of this research is to identify blind spots <ref type="bibr" target="#b151">[152]</ref> (after) in existing implementations of personal informatics and expand the possible design space of these systems to more effectively bridge between a broader theoretical spectrum of reflection types and the practical issues involved in designing PI experiences.</s></p><p xml:id="_eG6qye9"><s xml:id="_C7Hk4bB">Through this survey, we find that reflective practices in PI apps are unevenly supported.</s><s xml:id="_DmvmUjF">The lack of features that encourage userdriven reflection, scaffolding for setting goals and configuring data collection and presentation, and consideration of wider implications stand to limit meaning-making and frustrate nuanced insight generation based on lived experiences.</s><s xml:id="_qEKbTgs">Our research provides three main contributions.</s><s xml:id="_WqgmF8W">First, we extend Fleck and Fitzpatrick's theoretical framework of reflection to further operationalize each level of reflection in design features relevant to PI systems.</s><s xml:id="_9PAe3ND">Second, we discuss the ways in which reflective practices are-and are notsupported in current PI apps.</s><s xml:id="_5A6qX6z">Third, we provide implications about how reflection could be better supported in PI systems.</s></p></div>

longitudinal data and support reflection in generating insights for self-improvement and facilitating behavior change.</s><s xml:id="_dsY9Y8k">Li et al. introduced a stage-based model of PI systems with an emphasis on the collection and reflection aspects of the systems that aid people in gaining self-knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_d7XAVwJ">Li and colleagues' model consists of a series of five stages-Preparation, Collection, Integration, Reflection, and Action-based on a goal-oriented perspective.</s><s xml:id="_CD4ZU4f">Individuals move through each stage to obtain self-knowledge by looking at their data and subsequently changing their behavior based on what they learn from the interaction with the PI system <ref type="bibr" target="#b83">[84]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8KxGRW9">Li et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[96]</ref> note that each of these stages can be user-driven, system-driven, or a combination of the two, depending on whether a user or a system has a responsibility to perform each activity.</s><s xml:id="_SSckF4k">They argued that designers should consider the tradeoffs between having the user and/or system be in control at each of these stages.</s></p><p xml:id="_66vJzNu"><s xml:id="_MmFFQZ2">Complementing this influential model, Choe et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> present three different ways for PI systems to collect data: (1) fully manual tracking, <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(2)</ref> fully automated tracking, and (3) semi-automated tracking.</s><s xml:id="_a9yb8Mb">Choe and colleagues point out that reflective practices are also influenced by the type of data-collecting method(s) that are employed <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_CbRKTUj">The fully-manual approach to tracking supports greater awareness of behavior because people are asked to input their data manually, and the action of entering data into the system forces users to engage with their tracked behavior.</s><s xml:id="_v9DCn8W">However, systems that employ fully manual tracking also incur a burden for users, leading to reduced convenience and increased abandonment <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[50]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_vwNYMEn">To reduce users' burden, fully automated tracking may be considered as an alternative means for collecting data in PI systems.</s><s xml:id="_yDsy74z">However, the automatic sensing approach reduces users' awareness of what data are collected and how they change over time <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[97]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rBZVmvx">As a compromise between these two approaches, Choe et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> introduced the idea of semi-automated tracking, which they refer to as any combination of manual and automated tracking approaches.</s><s xml:id="_RbFsPXc">To successfully employ the semi-automated tracking mode in the PI tools, understanding what type of data is necessary to collect is essential <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_RHgDHvK">Building on a semi-automated tracking approach, Kim et al. presented Omnitrack, a mobile PI tool that allows people to customize their tracking items depending on their tracking needs or preferences <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[88]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_pknfwuF"><s xml:id="_hexSs43">Niess and Wozniak introduced the Tracker Goal Evolution Model to describe how users set and track their goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b124">[125]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Y7rwbR2">To better understand long-term engagement with PI, they focused on users' goal practices to complement existing PI models.</s><s xml:id="_QHvRccc">As Li et al.'s PI model ends in action, goal-setting theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b104">[105]</ref> has been considered an effective strategy for encouraging behavior change (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">67,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b119">120]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_tWJ3ACu">Setting regular goals helps individuals dedicate

target="#b72">[73]</ref> argue that asking users to reflect on their goals (i.e., "periodic reflection") is important.</s><s xml:id="_drdvmDP">They introduced two types of personalization to support the iterative refinement of goals: system-driven personalization (inferring users' goals based on collected data) and user-driven personalization (supporting the design of personal goals by the users themselves).</s><s xml:id="_EVa7mH5">For instance, machine learning methods are often applied to PI systems in order to generate system-driven recommendations that help users set their goals <ref type="bibr" target="#b61">[62,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b178">179]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_dKQ6FnV">Niess and Wozniak found that users reflect on their needs to translate their goals from

discussion about the use of PI systems by employing a "put people first then technology" approach to better understand the role of these technologies in users' everyday lives, resulting in a perspective that they refer to as lived informatics.</s><s xml:id="_P74Hwp4">Through the presentation of five styles of personal tracking (i.e., directive tracking, documentary tracking, diagnostic tracking, collecting rewards, and fetishised tracking), they argue that selftracking technologies should support the diverse personal contexts and characteristics of lived experience rather than a single, goaloriented trajectory.</s><s xml:id="_vTg7PJ8">Failure to support diverse forms of use can result in an increase in abandonment <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[51]</ref> or introduction of ethical issues (e.g., marginalizing people from certain backgrounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b156">157]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_DAtp7KW">Mols et al. also argued that incorporating people's everyday life experiences into the design of technological intervention is crucial to support reflection <ref type="bibr" target="#b116">[117]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_XajJT7Z">To incorporate different modes in tracking, the need for customizability and flexibility in designing PI tools has been discussed (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b37">38,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">87,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b106">107]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_wTWWSnM">Although customizable features allow users to deeply engage with their experiences by supporting their agency in making sense of data, people may feel burdened by deciding how to track their data by themselves <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b180">181]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_jvyycam"><s xml:id="_9AD8aZJ">Combining this lived informatics perspective with Li and colleagues' conventional PI model, Epstein et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53]</ref> proposed a new model for personal informatics.</s><s xml:id="_664V2T9">While the stage-based model focused primarily on the interaction between a PI system and its user, Epstein et al.'s lived informatics-informed model articulates a broader trajectory of self-tracking integration into everyday life by people with varied goals.</s><s xml:id="_MMWBWvP">Although the lived informatics model helps to provide a holistic view of the use of PI tools in everyday life, it is still unclear how people reflect on their experiences or behaviors when interacting with PI tools.</s></p><p xml:id="_gXXHrYR"><s xml:id="_wVbPS9s">Reflection is often taken for granted in PI systems as long as users interact with the system as imagined by its designers.</s><s xml:id="_hmuKA9D">Given the fact that reflection is viewed as a naturally sequential process in PI system models (e.g., an inevitable consequence of interaction with the information visualization, the impetus for behavior change) <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b95">96]</ref>, individuals' reflective practices were understood as a mechanism of the information processing in PI tools, isolated from personal lived experiences.</s><s xml:id="_uG3PwwP">Although reflection could occur as long as output from PIs is displayed to users, this restrictive perspective of reflection (i.e., the information-processing metaphor <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>) may fail to capture all the ways reflection can be stimulated in the interaction with PI tools.</s><s xml:id="_96QJF7K">Therefore, in this study, we focus on more closely understanding this reflection process, with the goal of better informing design

we did not explore these extra-application features in our analysis, and their impact might also be investigated in future work.</s><s xml:id="_5r86cWJ">Finally, some apps' advanced analysis and reporting features are available only to users with paid subscriptions, limiting our ability to exhaustively examine the complete feature set of some PI apps.</s></p><p xml:id="_bU8mhHv"><s xml:id="_hBJgxnF">Our findings showed that depending on an apps' domain, design features that support reflective practices are quite different.</s><s xml:id="_eXxPYjn">These findings inform further research on how reflective practices look in a particular domain and in what way design features can be utilized to support a specific user's purpose.</s><s xml:id="_Kk9qUhV">The goal of this study was to understand how reflection is supported by a number of different design features in general, rather than in a particular domain, such as physical activity tracking.</s><s xml:id="_9F5FJd8">We hope our findings can serve as a baseline or starting point for investigating domain-specific PI cases.</s></p><p xml:id="_QyHScpU"><s xml:id="_KKjgPHz">Lastly, our findings raise a fundamental question: do people need to reflect on their experience to achieve their goal (i.e., to affect a behavior change) at all?</s><s xml:id="_xtBN8zp">Our findings reveal that PI apps do not, in general, foster the full process of reflection well, but they are still very popular in the commercial marketplace.</s><s xml:id="_SH73FXD">The underlying assumption in our study is that reflection is beneficial for people to gain new knowledge, to reconstruct mental schemas, or to induce behavior changes for positive outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_KDDAZwC">Most literature in the PI domain has an embedded assumption that the PI system should always be driving users to reflect on their data.</s><s xml:id="_r8pMfUw">However, in some cases, reflection does not need to be an indispensable component in PI use.</s><s xml:id="_UuSQsT8">This is because reflection sometimes leads to an unexpected or negative outcome <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">36,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b42">43,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b117">118]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_4dSxAFd">Depending on why a PI tool is being used, the appropriate or desired mode of reflection might be different, as well.</s><s xml:id="_whenP5K">For instance, Gouveia et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b67">[68]</ref> found that most activity tracker PI users just glance at their tools ("brief, 5-sec sessions where users called the app to check their current activity levels with no further interaction") rather than meaningfully or deeply engaging with their data.</s><s xml:id="_JJxk7xd">In this case, stimulating higher levels of reflection might not be necessary; supporting the lower levels consistently and well might be sufficient.</s><s xml:id="_MUteuhy">Future research should investigate the relationship between users' goals for the use of PI tools and the varying levels of reflective practices to explore whether (and how) reflection plays different roles in service of different goals.</s></p></div>
