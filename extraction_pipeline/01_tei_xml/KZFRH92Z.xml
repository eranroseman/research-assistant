theoretical frameworks were identified as potentially contributing to the observed behavior change and the TEXT ME program.</s><s xml:id="_Meymvx2">The Information-Motivation-Behavior Skills Theoretical Model <ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> could primarily explain the observed behavior change associated with the TEXT ME program.</s><s xml:id="_YF8Cnbf">This theory states that if a person is well-informed, motivated to act, and they have the skills and confidence to take action, they are more likely to initiate and maintain health-promoting behaviors that produce positive outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_Scu8bCD"><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref> In the context of our messaging program, a theme emerged that participants felt motivated and engaged by the program when it provided credible and meaningful information with illustrative quotations links with this theory including: "So the messages prompt me to research all my medications" ("D", male, 65, FG2) "I actually researched how many calories you should eat in a day and what's in everything and I set a spreadsheet and I started calculating what you should eat and what you shouldn't eat.</s><s

FG1)</s></p><p xml:id="_CvuKyZc"><s xml:id="_5StFntk">"The messages gave me some insight into new things that I had never thought of, trying different foods" ("G", male, 58, FG2) Although the program was a one-way text message communication system, qualitative data suggest that Social-CognitiveTheory explains some of the observed behavior change.</s><s xml:id="_AwSzTDG">Social cognitive theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref> suggests that human behavior is determined by a combination of cognitive, personal and environmental influences.</s><s xml:id="_AjmAGHN">These reflect an interaction between thought, affect and action where expectations, beliefs, self-perceptions, goals and intentions give shape and direction to behavior.</s><s xml:id="_2akWJpu"><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref> Further, behaviour is modified based on whether the individual has high or low self-efficacy toward the behavior, the response a person receives after performing the behavior and aspects of the environment that improve self-efficacy including the setting of achievable goals.</s><s xml:id="_C99vtQ7">In the current text messaging program, social recognition, improved selfefficacy, the provision of achievable task-setting suggestions, practical advice and positive reinforcement were all built into the program <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and quotes illustrating their successful implementation are below.</s></p><p xml:id="_2xqrhM9"><s xml:id="_8JJzAJ4">"I found the program encouraging" ("B", female, 60, FG1)</s></p><p xml:id="_FQQsdaV"><s

already did my exercise and then got a message about it.</s><s xml:id="_YAt4YsN">And then I was like 'Yes, beat you'" ("B", female, 60, FG1) Operant and its predecessor Classical Conditioning are theoretical frameworks <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35]</ref> for explaining behavior and this concept of 'respondent condition' appeared to emerge from the focus groups where participants responded to the repeated messaging within the program as a whole rather than the immediate content of individual messages.</s><s xml:id="_2EKxu7G">This type of conditioning was first reported by Ivan Pavlov where he demonstrated that dogs learned a stimulus-response connection in response to repeated stimuli such that a previously neutral stimulus eventually elicits a response.</s><s xml:id="_sGjakfz"><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> Our qualitative data suggest that over time participants became 'conditioned' towards healthy behaviors irrespective of the specific content of the individual messages received at a certain time.</s><s xml:id="_PYXdMdM">That is, through repeated presentation of a stimulus (in this case cardiovascular health related text messages) the participants eventually learned to associate the stimulus with overall cardiovascular health behaviour and consequently messages about diet also resulting in improved physical activity and vice versa.</s><s xml:id="_8PEHFRA">The notion that the program evoked a feeling of feeling "guilty" could also contribute to conditioning where the feeling of guilt is a noxious stimuli associated with 'unhealthy' behaviour.</s><s xml:id="_kudEjGQ">Illustrative quotes highlighting this concept include; "It wasn't particularly about what the message said that day" ("C", female, 51, FG2) "They always popped up before I was about to eat something naughty" ("W", male, 68, FG1)</s></p><p xml:id="_US9EsuH"><s xml:id="_QsUVevq">"I don't actually go for context of the message, but look for the little nudge.</s><s xml:id="_J8jzMCj">The little things that nudge you to do the right things" ("D", male, 65, FG 2) "When you see the text message you might be a little bit more conscious about what you are eating" ("T", male, 62, FG4) "If I didn't walk for the past 3 or 4 nights, because it was too hot or raining, you made a bit more effort to do it, you felt a bit guilty.</s><s xml:id="_HedGFRe">And the same with checking your cholesterol and about what you are eating, think about the portions etc.</s><s xml:id="_aQ5ttbg">It is an on-going thing, a general thing.</s><s xml:id="_VJURrV8">But the reminder or the nag that was the key" ("S", male, 76, FG2) "I love chocolate and one time I was in the aisle of [shop name] thinking about getting a snack. . .</s><s xml:id="_RwJtE9k">then suddenly I received a message of TEXT ME saying: Hi [name], feeling like a snack?</s><s xml:id="_YNZw8HA">A banana or a piece of fruit!</s><s xml:id="_BkA7gqf">It really
