participants envisioned that home displays could help them to reflect on ways to better provide co-regulation with their child(ren) separate from joint use.</s><s xml:id="_y2pDAqm">While they acknowledged that some independent use could be on a personal device, like a phone, they saw value in redundant access to shared data through a situated home display.</s><s xml:id="_Q5jaURq">As P06 explained, "it would be a little bit easier because it is in a centralized location", P02 said "it is just nicer to have more room over a phoned and watch," and P08 noted it could enable coordination between caregivers because "me and my wife want to talk about his trends and patterns."</s></p><p xml:id="_9P9TpUn"><s xml:id="_BwvDc36">Parent participants also felt that situated displays could help promote accountability for monitoring their children's data.</s><s xml:id="_TunYpft">P03 explained:</s></p><p xml:id="_UUNYJvB"><s xml:id="_5azEzKe">"one of the problems with me is that her tracking [data] is sitting on the phone... and I just don't look much at it because it's not front and center, but if that was on a wall, right in front of my face...</s><s xml:id="_dtBUfrN">I would use it more, like, if it was sitting propped up on our counter, it would keep me accountable."</s></p><p xml:id="_kS53vPE"><s xml:id="_axzfMEQ">Participants described that situated in-home displays could help them in "being consistent" (P01, P03) in providing co-regulation.</s><s xml:id="_jqpkzZE">By being persistently being available in the home environment, these parents considered displays would help them remember to review the data to inform their next actions.</s></p><p xml:id="_9PfuvUQ"><s xml:id="_T63NTHV">Overall, parents had three objectives related to caregiving that they hoped a situated display could help them with, separate from joint use: First, parents wanted to reflect on their own data to evaluate their self-regulation to inform co-regulation efforts.</s><s xml:id="_7hWYAEy">Second, they wished to intricately review children's data to identify potential risks.</s><s xml:id="_3Zgg9BH">Third, they hoped to share data and collaborate with experts on caregiving strategies.</s></p><p xml:id="_mrCQSa9"><s xml:id="_ZKSAcxJ">Supporting self-reflection to aid co-regulation actions: I found that parents wished for Supporting Child's Independence and Contribution to Other Family Members My analysis revealed the need for additional scaffolding for family displays to support meaningful independent use by children.</s><s xml:id="_pQQ8ZfZ">Children may require extra guidance to comprehend personal and shared family data and identify concrete actions to help support others based on the data, which ideally does not always need to be supported by parents.</s><s xml:id="_9qJqd3k">Rather, children who are appropriately supported by technology can learn to interpret data about themselves and others directly, interact with these data, and respond to what they have learned.</s></p><p xml:id="_bHbYAdf"><s xml:id="_hg6KpaK">Helping children co-regulate others: Some of the children participants wished to help other family members and considered that in-home display systems could potentially help them independently review parents' and siblings' information to be a part of their coregulation.</s><s xml:id="_vfSw98F">For example, C03 said she wanted to review family moods so that "if they felt sad, I could help them" or "assign rewards to them" as encouragement for goals to be met.</s><s xml:id="_dp2XcZ2">P03 complemented, "she is a leader to her brothers...</s><s xml:id="_QPvfxTF">She can help the rest of us."</s><s xml:id="_EpDjQzS">Some children desired system advice on how to co-regulate, such as C02 who said "You could select a parent.</s><s xml:id="_cJgQg6P">If they have yellow or red [emotions on the display] a lot, it shows something you can do with your parents for them to feel better.</s><s xml:id="_DStd6Hg">Like this: [types in the mock-up] 'Give a hug.'</s><s xml:id="_zS2p8TG">So it should give a different suggestion every day to do something with parents to make them feel better."</s><s xml:id="_JUDWxCc">By providing a personalized review of family data and co-regulation suggestions, systems could empower children in their active role of supporting family members' wellbeing through thoughtful co-regulation strategies and bonding.</s><s xml:id="_FR9aTGX">Supporting children's independent use: We found that for children to interact with family displays by themselves, they would benefit from guidance that lines up with their data interpretation skills and presents data relevant to them.</s></p><p xml:id="_vBuDGwK"><s xml:id="_exP4A7U">Families described the need for children to be able to understand data about their regulation presented on an in-home display for it to support their independent use.</s><s xml:id="_6nJrkhN">P06 described C06 depressive periods for C02a and inform the collaboration with their new medical provider, ultimately leading to a change in treatment and medication prescription.</s><s xml:id="_WHamTuj">P02 explained:</s></p><p xml:id="_VAvYgGc"><s xml:id="_emp6pDZ">"He was blue [flowers] a lot, over and over blue all the time.</s><s xml:id="_GWNJ9Uf">I don't think we would have been aware about how often he was blue if it not for the app.</s><s xml:id="_vm2um6k">So we took it to his new doctor and, you know, with the anxiety and the problems, they ended up changing his medication.</s><s xml:id="_5r4Ajah">From all of this, our big great thing is that he got his medication changed and, since then, he's a lot happier and started getting all these greens."</s></p><p xml:id="_3j8PUMC"><s xml:id="_ktwnjzy">When it comes to sharing data with teachers, children's willingness depends on their relationship with the teacher.</s><s xml:id="_7CxaaVN">C04b mentioned, "[my teacher] she asks me how I am feeling and she helps me." but her brother, C04a, stated, "It's private...</s><s xml:id="_kZmTY6B">I wouldn't share ever <ref type="bibr">[</ref> Avoiding shared tracking can be with the intention to avoid family discussion altogether.</s><s xml:id="_zedW8rR">In the first interview, P01a and P01b explained that they had gotten into a serious disagreement, so "for those days I was really mad.</s><s xml:id="_aThewXb">I didn't put anything <ref type="bibr">[moods]</ref> for two days because I didn't want all red flowers, twenty-four hours of red for them to discuss.</s><s xml:id="_jFS5cKE">I really didn't want them to engage about it."</s><s xml:id="_w9z8svX">P07a wished to keep a higher boundary between her moods at a stressful workplace from her home environment, saying "if I had a bad day, I think I try to not bring my work home, or like the behaviors I have at work.</s><s xml:id="_TkJGZeq">I don't want to bring them home."</s><s xml:id="_Jrj6ykN">Children also expressed a desire for control over their data sharing.</s><s xml:id="_UfVGeD7">C05a noted, "sometimes people want to share, sometimes they don't...</s><s xml:id="_xY5sxQS">When I didn't [want to share], I just put a green [mood] or nothing."</s><s xml:id="_UC8cUFj">C02b said, I erased my goals....</s><s xml:id="_vdeCw5X">I don't want them telling me what to do." P01 responded jokingly, "Its fine, he is only 6, his goal is to survive <ref type="bibr">[laughs]</ref>."</s><s xml:id="_JwzPSzw">Overall, when participants wished to refrain family engagement about certain parts of their lives or discuss certain events, they opted to not track these moments at all.</s><s xml:id="_W9ZSfvP">Family and personal boundaries for sensemaking can encompass both the representation of data for personal reflection and the boundaries of sharing specific data itself.</s><s xml:id="_UgnTDa7">Some participants in the study articulated personal preferences regarding the mood data modality for personal sensemaking versus when shared.</s><s xml:id="_xnVFWS9">For example, F07 discussed these distinctions by reflecting on two "layers" (P07b): P07a: "I think it needs to allow personal customization, like for different shapes and colors.</s><s xml:id="_FtenUt6">Like, for me, blue is calming, centered.</s><s xml:id="_kPbCAJc">I am gonna choose the colors that are meaningful to me, like I love pink instead of the green.</s><s xml:id="_4DVHzm3">So that it is more personal."</s></p><p xml:id="_3EMBwNJ"><s xml:id="_7bYHSPa">P07b: "You know, like everyone has different personal concepts for that.</s><s xml:id="_ny3hnGD">So it is up to the individual to select a color for themselves."</s><s xml:id="_9vZUjGc">activities, such as while getting ready in the morning or reflections at the end of the day during dinner time.</s><s xml:id="_5W3p3Ch">Future work could explore how joint family engagement can be supported under different circumstances and with different interaction modalities.</s><s xml:id="_mqwJTVR">A challenge remains in providing integration across different platforms and individuals for such diverse family uses.</s><s xml:id="_jZscmc8">It can also be challenging to maintain more devices, although this might be diminished if accommodating the devices individuals are already attuned to when incorporating their preferred technologies for family informatics systems.</s></p></div>

unique environmental characteristics and constraints that impact self-tracking efforts.</s><s xml:id="_AAWrcxa">Perceived social norms, ongoing tasks in-the-moment, and physical location are common factors people consider as they pause to self-track.</s><s xml:id="_Ecg7me3">Multimodal multi-device systems can help individuals continue to self-track under different and often complex environments.</s></p><p xml:id="_ve7knmE"><s xml:id="_6mpz6G3">Convenience and availability of interaction options play an important role in facilitating selftracking.</s><s xml:id="_65SR9dA">When self-tracking is too difficult or impossible given device unavailability, people can skip self-tracking <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[55]</ref>, which in turn can lead to abandoning the practice before gaining any personal health benefits <ref type="bibr" target="#b62">[51,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b138">127,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">74,</ref><ref type="bibr"

flexibility indicates how users can maintain consistency in their tracking even when faced with situational constraints or challenges, such as time constraints or the availability of specific devices.</s><s xml:id="_jQhmnwD">When navigating social situations, which typically can deter people from tracking in-themoment <ref type="bibr" target="#b66">[55]</ref>, individuals can opt for less

support diverse and evolving goals.</s><s xml:id="_4gZ8xa7">Combining different data While ubiquitous systems can facilitate co-regulation through reflection, particularly when families are physically apart, it's essential to find a balance between fostering connection and providing access to shared data without creating excessive technical and social dependencies.</s></p><p xml:id="_smu9YzF"><s xml:id="_XsZnhVa">Excessive dependency, particularly between children and parents, may undermine the benefits of autonomy in tracking and reflecting.</s><s xml:id="_RgWJS84">Individual family members

xml:id="_PuGn5JN">By facilitating sharing between family members without imposing complete dependency, individuals can track more independently and reflect on how their reflection integrates with others' needs.</s><s xml:id="_B6AGtbQ">This approach not only promotes individual autonomy but can also foster collaboration and shared responsibility within the family.</s><s xml:id="_nYkAH7w">Thus, multi-device systems can encourage reflecting on each other's data as a means to facilitate co-regulation and mutual support within the family unit, but not as a requirement for individual self-regulation features to work.</s></p><p xml:id="_KMxPYYP"><s xml:id="_UGfw6tC">When reflecting on others' data individually, people can gain awareness of their health state and wellbeing needs, but interpreting and using family data practically can depend on data literacy skills and role in the family.</s><s xml:id="_kPfDKYw">For example, children might have trouble understanding some data modality representations and figuring out how they can support others, while parents may have different expectations and capabilities in terms of making sense of and acting upon family health
