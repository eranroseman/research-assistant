<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_FdVNYfT">Discussion</head><p xml:id="_HkWd6ch"><s xml:id="_UtRmttH">We found that 4 out of 5 obstetricians-gynecologists surveyed in 2012 were unaware of the ACA provision that required states to provide tobacco cessation coverage for pregnant traditional Medicaid beneficiaries.</s><s xml:id="_AYCuJmc">However, one-third of respondents reported that reimbursement would influence them to increase cessation services, and an even greater percentage was seen among respondents who saw more Medicaid-enrolled patients.</s><s xml:id="_2AM8W9u">A previous study suggests that states with more comprehensive Medicaid coverage of tobacco cessation treatments, primarily through coverage of medications, resulted in 1.6 percentage point reduction (p b .05) in smoking before pregnancy and a small increase (b1 day) in infant gestation <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">(Adams et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ZB287f4">In addition, as counseling will also be covered by the ACA mandate, a meta-analysis of 77 trials found that psychosocial interventions are effective in increasing the proportion of women who stop smoking in late pregnancy, and women who received psychosocial interventions had an 18% reduction in preterm births and infants born low birth weight <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">(Chamberlain et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Yk8S5wt">Hence, reducing barriers to cessation treatments, as such through a comprehensive tobacco cessation benefit, could potentially allow more smokers to access treatment, increase cessation and improve infant outcomes among pregnant Medicaid enrollees.</s></p><p xml:id="_G7jbpur"><s xml:id="_HRwBD8p">Comprehensive and well-publicized benefits have shown larger effects in quitting among the general population of Medicaid-enrollees in the state of Massachusetts, including among young people and women <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(Land et al., 2010)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_u6CFdRH">For providers, this promotion included the development of fact sheets, with rate and billing codes, a pharmacotherapy pocket guide, and new intake and assessment protocols that were widely disseminated to health care systems and facilities (CDC, 2014).</s><s xml:id="_QWzeMpf">In addition, the state also directed educational campaigns to consumers, tracked the use of the benefits, and provided feedback and recognition to providers who were regularly referring patients.</s><s xml:id="_VKy6ggH">Acknowledging the importance of raising awareness of the tobacco cessation benefit, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services placed information on their website (Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2014) about Medicaid tobacco-cessation benefits for pregnant women and non-pregnant enrollees <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(Singleterry et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3FNJqK3">However, broad state promotion and outreach of the Medicaid tobacco-cessation benefits, as noted earlier, for pregnant women can help to increase treatment utilization.</s></p><p xml:id="_mTnMYHU"><s xml:id="_HkvBaMe">A substantial percentage of respondents reported that reimbursement would be insufficient to address existing barriers for cessation.</s><s xml:id="_BWf2Tpw">Provider barriers that have been reported in a previous analysis of this data included time limitations to deliver cessation services in prenatal care visits and patient's resistance to intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">(Coleman-Cowger et al., 2014)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_jmjwkjQ">While reimbursement may improve service provision and broad promotion of the benefits may increase awareness, additional strategies, such as provider training <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(Tong et al., 2012)</ref> and healthcare system changes to facilitate stream-lined screening and treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(Fiore et al., 2008)</ref>, are also important to increase treatment utilization.</s><s xml:id="_VTJVCpd">Educational campaigns directed to consumers could also stress the importance and/or benefits of quitting smoking and support that prenatal care staff can provide.</s><s xml:id="_SKEVj6y">This study has limitations to note.</s><s xml:id="_5VGFacr">First, the study is limited by the low survey response rates (31-52%), which is consistent with previous ACOG surveys.</s><s xml:id="_pN7gzh9">However, nonresponse bias has been shown to be minimal among physician groups compared to other groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(Kellerman and Herold, 2001)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wnSxdbx">Second, the sample size is small.</s><s xml:id="_JfA3pBW">For our analysis of how reimbursement would influence cessation services, we had limited power to test for differences in whether reimbursement would influence cessation services by percentage of Medicaid patients seen.</s><s xml:id="_XD79MvD">Finally, these data are self-reported, and we did not verify information regarding awareness with their actual cessation or billing practices.</s></p><p xml:id="_fkgxf85"><s xml:id="_qUAbggX">In conclusion, four out of five obstetricians-gynecologists surveyed in 2012 were unaware of the ACA provision that required states to provide tobacco cessation coverage for pregnant traditional Medicaid beneficiaries, and a third of respondents serving pregnant Medicaid patients reported that reimbursement would influence them to increase their cessation services.</s><s xml:id="_Urh3rnC">Promoting awareness of the Medicaid tobacco-cessation benefit among all medical providers who see pregnant and reproductive-aged women could help to reduce treatment barriers, thereby increasing cessation and improving maternal and infant health.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" type="table" xml:id="tab_0"><head>Table 1</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p xml:id="_GZWanMq"><s
