anxiety, DFA) are major problems for a sizeable proportion of children and adolescents.</s><s xml:id="_NeUQXjP">The prevalence of DFA in children and adolescents ranges from 5-20% in various countries, with some cases being considered to be dental phobia (severe DFA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2vnumP7">Children and adolescents with DFA are often uncooperative during dental visits, thus rendering treatment difficult or impossible <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_k36PvYn">Such behavior compromises the treatment outcome, creates occupational stress among dental staff, and is often a cause of discord between dental professionals and patients or their parents <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Ww3ugxa">Fearful children and adolescents may try every possible means to avoid or delay treatment, resulting in deterioration of their oral health <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_s6wNDT4">Beyond its impacts on dental care, DFA may also cause sleep disorders, affect one's daily life <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref> and have a negative impact on one's psychosocial functioning <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xv46gCs">DFA acquired in childhood may persist to adulthood and is a significant predictor for avoidance of dental visits in adulthood <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_d2rqpuT">This pinpoints childhood as a critical stage for preventing and intercepting DFA, thereby assisting people to protect their oral health in the long term.</s></p><p xml:id="_2NvbVKU"><s xml:id="_VCBDDaQ">Previous studies into DFA draw predominantly upon quantitative instruments such as questionnaires and psychometric scales <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Ehrbebt">The development of these instruments, however, is largely based on professionals' presumptions and thus may not capture the whole spectrum of respondents' perceptions and views.</s><s xml:id="_Ey34SSU">Moreover, quantitative methods that focus on generating statistics and testing hypotheses may not be able to uncover complex mechanisms <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_w8DGdna">Qualitative research approach is therefore considered an important complement to quantitative methods, especially for gathering in-depth information on human behavior and reasons for such behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_eDVh6EU">Although qualitative studies do not aim to provide data that are statistically extrapolatable to a wide population, they can delineate a wide range of views and experiences in peoples' own words and a rich context <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_QxXvaHR"><s xml:id="_M2JTY2u">Currently, there is a paucity of research employing qualitative methodologies for understanding DFA, although a few qualitative studies have produced some enlightening findings <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Pfm4aZE">Abrahamsson and coworkers, through thematized in-depth interviews with 18 patients, showed that individual vulnerability and traumatic dental care experiences caused dental fear in adult patients, who were often caught in a vicious cycle of fear and negative expectations about treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_6mh4w79">They also found that several psychological and social factors such as self-respect, well-being, avoidance, readiness to act, and ambivalence in coping, determined how adult patients coped with their fear and how dental fear affects their daily lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Fw9QesE">Through semi-structured interviews with mothers of 14 children who were uncooperative during dental treatment, 3 themes explaining children's refusal to submit to dental treatment were identified.</s><s xml:id="_FpvUbrN">These included the origins of child behavior, caregivers' attitudes, and the culture of resistance <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_jZJvdj4">The findings of these studies suggest that qualitative analysis is a useful method to further our understanding of DFA.</s></p><p xml:id="_pu5vQCg"><s xml:id="_E7ceKqT">On the other hand, recent medical studies have illustrated the potential of utilizing public uploads on Internet social media, such as YouTube, as a valuable source of qualitative data to understand health behaviors and perceptions <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_JkhMBsb">For instance, through an analysis of 35 YouTube videos, a study has reported the personal narratives of cancer survivors and enriched our understandings on the psychological impact of cancer diagnosis on patients' personal and family lives <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hK2q54E">The findings help professionals communicate with patients and their families more effectively and provide better care to cancer patients.</s><s xml:id="_tQn3krn">The potential of Internet social media in dental research is however, hardly explored.</s><s xml:id="_RwMjSSs">Recently, Knösel and coworkers reported an interesting work, where they systematically assessed educational videos on YouTube related to dentistry <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_FZqSMet">Their analysis suggested the potential value of YouTube in dental education and its role in shaping public opinion about the dental profession.</s></p><p xml:id="_3WyEvUB"><s xml:id="_fyZdGAY">YouTube is an online video-sharing website founded in 2005.</s><s xml:id="_NcqQnvc">It records more than 3 billion views a day and 800 million users each month <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wUtJYSs">YouTube offers an unrestricted environment for the public to share their stories and express their feelings instantaneously and freely.</s><s xml:id="_JRMMyEN">It helps individuals to discuss sensitive issues easily or to venture opinions without fear of embarrassment or negative judgement, which is often a concern in face-to-face interviews <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9xB9hM7">Theoretically, the candid in-depth testimonials and reports on YouTube could be useful data sources for investigating DFA.</s><s xml:id="_B8eXMzN">The personal narratives and original sharing uploaded spontaneously by patients and the public to YouTube provide a rich context to our existing knowledge on DFA.</s><s xml:id="_epVbYnA">In addition, some novel or relatively neglected themes may emerge and thus deepen our understanding of DFA.</s><s xml:id="_MReNRsW">This study aimed to profile the manifestations, impacts, and origins of DFA in children and adolescents from the public's perspective using a qualitative research approach and YouTube as a platform.</s></p></div>

extent of the psychological impacts were striking.</s><s xml:id="_MWVZakN">Facing the challenges of a dental visit, some children demonstrate externalizing behaviors such as tantrums, whereas some internalize the fear, which may lead to psychological or behavioral withdrawal, feelings of shame or inferiority, and low self-esteem <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tehMVfV">The story of the teenage boy who would rather not turn 18 in order to avoid the possible threat of wisdom tooth removal was a vivid testimonial of the profound psychological impact of DFA.</s><s xml:id="_b7MS5Uz">It exemplifies how DFA could impair children and adolescents' outlook towards life; something dental professionals should not neglect.</s></p><p xml:id="_rhgKMRV"><s xml:id="_uqt95r8">This qualitative study has attached considerable and diverse real life stories to the heterogeneous origins of DFA through 3 pathways, namely direct conditioning via negative dental visit experience, vicarious learning from family and peers, and exposure to negative information <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2bFsB8Q">A frequently quoted reason for the initiation and persistence of DFA was the expected pain and discomfort during invasive procedures, such as injections and extractions, and some contextual stimuli, such as syringes and dental chairs.</s><s xml:id="_YF4FSfU">While some of these fear-provoking factors may be alleviated through thoughtful planning of the treatment modality <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref> and creative modifications of the physical settings of the clinic <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, some are not easy to change because there are no alternatives.</s><s xml:id="_5mwdw7v">Nonetheless, on an optimistic note, fear and anxiety is a multi-dimensional construct that consists of somatic, cognitive, and emotional elements <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_yqTmeyM">The consequences of traumatic dental procedures depend on the context in which they occur.</s><s xml:id="_K9WaTsJ">Previous research has suggested that pain inflicted by a dentist, who was perceived as caring, was likely to have less psychological impact than pain inflicted by a dentist who was cold and controlling <ref type="bibr"

procedures.</s></p><p xml:id="_X22eZX2"><s xml:id="_U8h58C7">Our analysis indeed highlights the importance of dental professionals' manner, clinical skills, and work ethics in reducing DFA of

also highlighted the necessity of adhering to the original appointment time.</s><s xml:id="_dQ7twSK">During prolonged waiting, many elements in the clinic may trigger patients' fear, which can accumulate to an unbearable level.</s><s xml:id="_uHQ5N5R">In cases the dentist is unable to treat a patient on time, dental auxiliaries should introduce the patient into the world of dentistry, build a sense of closeness with the patient, and prepare the patient for the upcoming dental procedures.</s><s xml:id="_Ujzh4Yt">Engaging patients in these activities could avoid the escalation of their DFA during the waiting period.</s></p><p xml:id="_pSNmFgQ"><s xml:id="_G6gkbKT">To assist children and adolescents to experience success in managing their DFA, a partnership between parents and professionals is highly advocated <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_4VXVJym">Nevertheless, parents often feel powerless in managing their children's DFA and blame the negative dental treatment <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>, while dentists usually have a different frame of reference and tend to put the blame on parental factors, such as upbringing <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_6TqFNPr">There is no doubt that, to children and adolescents, reactions from parents often craft their ways in manipulating their environments and regulating their behavior and are certainly one of the most proximal influences on their DFA <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3JcRU8b">A proliferation of research supports a positive correlation between children's DFA and their parents' DFA or unfavourable attitudes towards dentistry <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_q7fCBbe">Our findings unveiled another facet of parental influence on children's DFA.</s><s xml:id="_yCW5dwv">To the young girl who demonstrated a cluster of non-compliance, aggression, and destructive behaviors, her father's careless joking statement, "the dentist would pull your teeth", obviously cast a terrifying image of a dentist, petrified the child, deterred her attempt to cope, and rendered all the efforts of the dental team in vain.</s><s xml:id="_823rAQq">Information-giving is an inherent part of child-rearing and is carried out by parents in an almost unceasing fashion <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_f6vYgVk">An interesting experiment demonstrated that parents' threatening narratives about a friendly animal instilled high levels of fear in children <ref

words from a sensitive parent could be a precious resource for the child to overcome his/her excessive fear and set the right expectation for the dental visit.</s><s xml:id="_vP5MaPh">Beyond family impact, adolescents are vulnerable to peer influence, which could be a significant source of their DFA.</s><s xml:id="_qPpzpTq">Although it is impossible to isolate teenagers from negative information from their peers, professionals should make parents aware of and sensitive to the potential influence of the information peers impart, so that parents can stand a better chance of protecting their
