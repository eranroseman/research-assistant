how that group would have done if given a specific intervention compared to other interventions.</s><s xml:id="_sXGnVnf">Because of the counterfactual nature of these claims, there is no straightforward diagnostic criteria to determine whether patients received the optimal intervention.</s><s xml:id="_BybUc4P">Methods exist to determine the best subgroups for interventions, particularly when examining a large group of covariates, in what is known as "precision medicine." <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref></s><s xml:id="_vrSAUVX">These include using a composite

conclusions that are in opposition, leading to unclear inferences.</s><s xml:id="_ctkmUev">Composite prognostic scores are prone to overfitting even with large sample sizes (although this can be ameliorated with cross-validation), and they do not accurately identify the optimal treatment.</s></p><p xml:id="_gMrXNvh"><s xml:id="_GyZ7ssg">A different approach that avoids many of these issues is

conclusions, and using a single summary variable as the outcome reduces the possibility of overfitting.</s><s xml:id="_MmACFTb">Via this method, participants exhibit a phenotype, and patients with these different phenotypes may differentially respond to an intervention.</s><s xml:id="_x2EHYc9">These phenotypes are the set of values across the characteristics of interest, and patients with similar phenotypes, or sets of values, can then be grouped together due to this similarity.</s><s xml:id="_ZZNJYEV">In such a way can a suite of variables be used to identify and define subgroups,

subpopulation(s).</s><s xml:id="_XwUyvJP">Therefore, the data from this trial represent a rich source of information to understand what characteristics of people and their partners predicts increased weight loss from an intervention such as this.</s><s xml:id="_yp4EhVf">The goal of this study was to identify phenotypes based on participants' baseline characteristics, describe these phenotypes, and
