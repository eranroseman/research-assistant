<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_QuXeRES">Background</head><p xml:id="_9sRZpsU"><s xml:id="_UqwSYa2">Up to 3% of children and adolescents suffer from obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>, which is characterized by repetitive, intrusive thoughts about threats of contamination, harm to self or others, loss of esteem, and committing moral transgressions, accompanied by repetitive or ritualized behaviors that can be time consuming, such as cleaning, checking, and ordering <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_M8zJMFQ">These obsessive thoughts and compulsive behaviors lead to marked distress, avoidance, and negative emotion (eg, anxiety and disgust) <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7Huh7GD">To regulate OCD-related distress, youths (individuals below the age of 18 years) may avoid situations that trigger obsessions and compulsions, perform rituals to neutralize feelings of incompleteness or magically remove the threat, or seek reassurance and help from others such as parents <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_r2rx5B2">Parents are biologically primed to be sensitive to distress signals from their children <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7E9N9ws">Thus, parents may become distressed when their children are distressed.</s><s xml:id="_633fkVD">Interactions between parents and youths with OCD can be conflictual when parents refuse to accommodate their children's symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_RqUn8Vg">Youths may coerce or use verbal and physical aggression to elicit accommodation or parents may voluntarily provide family accommodation to regulate their own or their children's distress <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9xF3k7N">Family accommodation refers to ways in which parents help their children with OCD perform rituals, avoid stimuli that trigger symptoms, and change their own routines because of their children's OCD symptoms <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Rq29FJE">This reciprocal coordination of parent-child behavior is reflected in the parent's and child's physiology and may in part be facilitated by the oxytocin system <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Q3hBvet">In short, OCD is characterized by distress, negative emotions, and behavioral repertoires in individual youths and their parents that can be directly observed or indirectly detected in behavior, facial expressions, speech patterns, and physiological signals.</s></p><p xml:id="_36n8874"><s xml:id="_69ybbJa">Automatic, continuous detection of these OCD signals would facilitate close monitoring of patient treatment progress and allow for more targeted interventions.</s><s xml:id="_VSgdQPJ">The first-line treatment for OCD is cognitive behavioral therapy with exposure and response prevention (ERP) <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Cmrwe8d">Continuous monitoring of distress levels and the function of distress during the treatment is essential for optimizing ERP <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_735Uqtv">Currently, patients are asked to rate their level of distress throughout an ERP task.</s><s xml:id="_vBrZx3y">Machine learning (ML) models that detect distress levels would automate distress monitoring and enable passive collection of objective measures allowing therapists to adjust exposures accordingly.</s><s xml:id="_7gANW4c">Automatic, continuous distress detection may also facilitate the monitoring of treatment response across therapy sessions as well as monitoring disorder progression in individuals with subclinical symptoms.</s><s xml:id="_ZwkKX6X">Finally, an important part of therapy is increasing awareness of the connections between thoughts, emotions, behaviors, and bodily sensations <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_KgF4kgP">ML models that detect changes in mental states would facilitate increasing awareness of these connections.</s></p><p xml:id="_BADHX6x"><s xml:id="_4KKZgUY">Previous studies have demonstrated that ML models can detect physiological, behavioral, and speech signals that may be relevant to youth with OCD and thus aid in developing objective, intelligent monitoring tools that will enable timely actionable insights and interventions supporting psychotherapy in and outside of the clinic.</s><s xml:id="_KQvKXXx">A previous study demonstrated that ML models using 3 minutes of physiological data from a wearable biosensor worn by 20 youths could predict aggressive behaviors in youths with autism spectrum disorders 1 minute prior to their occurrence with relatively high accuracy <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gsmBRq7">Another study linked behavioral synchrony between 15 fathers and their 2-5-year-old children with Down syndrome to synchrony in the dyads' electrodermal activity (EDA) measured with wearable biosensors during a play session <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_qmP6qhC">Using speech features as input, ML models have classified the severity of depression <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref> and differentiated between children with and without internalizing disorders <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Nwj47yJ">ML models that use speech features as input have also been utilized to gauge the quality of interpersonal interactions in a psychotherapy setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_XGMZzzM">Finally, ML models (ie, computer vision models) are also capable of analyzing data from videos to track movement; infer emotion from facial expressions; and estimate visual attention, engagement, and interpersonal interaction from gaze-tracking information <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_j5U9zZ5">A systematic review showed that computer vision studies have sample sizes as low as 2 participants, often in the range of 10-20 and with more than 50 participants in rare cases, to demonstrate the capabilities of computer vision as a clinical tool <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DpW6D2J">To date, no artificial intelligence (AI) tools for monitoring clinically relevant parameters of OCD in youth are available and validated.</s><s xml:id="_wDsM59W">Thus, Wrist Angel aims to develop AI tools capable of predicting OCD episodes, related (mal)adaptive parent behavior, and continuously monitoring OCD-related distress in youths and parents.</s></p></div>
