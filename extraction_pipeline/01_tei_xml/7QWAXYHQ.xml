<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_6uGQ8v7">The Purpose of a Randomized Controlled Trial</head><p xml:id="_wbbTbru"><s xml:id="_8bE3dyg">Modern RCT methodologies in medicine were developed to evaluate pharmacological agents that are not intended or expected to be modified frequently.</s><s xml:id="_tPTjXnm">To respond to early critiques that psychological interventions have little effect <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>, rigorous methodology was developed, often using principles from pharmacological trial design, to evaluate psychological and behavioral interventions.</s><s xml:id="_NFBARZc">Among the many innovations and adaptations, psychological treatments were standardized through manualization, therapist training, supervision, and fidelity monitoring to maximize internal validity <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gRsqnG9">These rigorous methods of "locking down" a psychological treatment contributed to a vast literature supporting the efficacy of psychological and behavioral interventions, as well as broad acceptance of their clinical value.</s><s xml:id="_qs8uXmY">However, it is doubtful that even with these methodologies, behavioral interventions are truly locked down to the degree a pharmacological agent is during a trial.</s><s xml:id="_28uDs3y">And once moved to real-world clinical practice, they are rarely implemented in the same manner as in the RCT <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_6sq7JRu">The application of RCT methodology developed for pharmacotherapies, translated for behavioral and psychological interventions, to BITs is even less appropriate.</s></p><p xml:id="_qGG4cVw"><s xml:id="_ez75K7D">There are two primary problems with locking down a BIT in an RCT.</s><s xml:id="_3dGgYk5">First, the length of time required to conduct an RCT is often not consistent with the rapidly changing technological environment <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and user expectations.</s><s xml:id="_Tnvrvkk">In some cases, trials of BITs can be conducted rapidly, however, many times trials must extend over longer periods of time.</s><s xml:id="_8EZvKYf">This is especially true when adequately powering a trial necessitates extended participant recruitment.</s><s xml:id="_vjPdUEP">The number of participants required to power a traditional RCT makes sense when the resulting intervention (if found successful) will have a long shelf life and benefit many users over time.</s><s xml:id="_9XJ38eK">In RCTs for BITs, however, this is rarely the case.</s><s xml:id="_mADrtTu">RCTs often test early versions of BITs that often have to undergo revisions prior to implementation due to factors not under the developers' or researchers' control, such as changes in technological environment and contextual factors (eg, perceived attractiveness and usefulness of a BIT), which can impact use patterns or outcomes if not addressed <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tMPAzs3">Thus, locking down a BIT means that the information gained from a trial might not be useful for the implementation, even if this takes place shortly after the trial period.</s></p><p xml:id="_yU7pjab"><s xml:id="_VgCXn4y">Second, and perhaps more importantly, new information is gained within the trial that can be used for quality improvement <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_vcfzmP6">Even with careful user-centered design and pilot testing, problems in the BIT design that impact the user's ability or willingness to perform tasks are often uncovered when it is deployed at scale for the full trial.</s><s xml:id="_Y48NmcN">As these deficiencies are discovered, locking down the BIT and refusing to improve it may undermine the chances of success, waste effort and resources, and compromise the relevance in the knowledge gained, if any.</s><s xml:id="_n4sPQ6y">Thus, BIT researchers are left with a difficult choice.</s><s xml:id="_WQgU9Qg">They can (1) continue to investigate the locked-down version to maintain internal validity (with increasing understanding of the problems in the BIT and its growing irrelevance), (2) make changes to the BIT but not report them (reducing the reliability of the scientific literature and limiting the ability of other researchers to build on the work appropriately), or (3) make changes to the BIT and report them (raising the question "What is being tested?").</s></p><p xml:id="_nA7YkEp"><s xml:id="_KCDGa8K">Current RCT methodology is based on the lock-down model, well suited to determining if a fixed intervention is more efficacious than a control condition.</s><s xml:id="_jETkHSt">However, given the rate of technological advancement and changes in user expectations, we argue that testing a fixed BIT often has very little public health value because the shelf life of that fixed BIT is often relatively short.</s><s xml:id="_zZHsc4h">We argue instead for allowing modification to BITs if these changes are reported.</s><s xml:id="_kQBtrPj">The question of what is being tested can be addressed by specifying the principles (model or rules) underlying the BIT and conceptualizing the trial as testing those principles, and not the BIT itself.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_E9wn2RX">Trials of Intervention Principles</head><p xml:id="_Q3uqdRB"><s xml:id="_ppxsHVR">We argue that trials of BITs should be viewed as experiments to test principles within that BIT that can then be more broadly applied by developers, designers, and researchers in the creation of BITs and the science behind technology-based behavioral intervention.</s><s xml:id="_aD45BUg">As such, we refer to these trials as "Trials of Intervention Principles" (TIPs), as they test the theoretical concepts represented within the BIT, rather than the specific technological instantiation of the BIT itself.</s><s xml:id="_prpF3sk">Similar logic has been applied in other instances of interventions to identify the elemental components contained within the interventions, to improve the ability to generalize across trials, and to guide intervention selection, creation, and evaluation <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Fq4cweW">We define a principle as a model or set of rules that defines how a group of behavioral strategies is instantiated in a BIT and how the use of that BIT leads to an outcome.</s><s xml:id="_Grp55T2">For example, a trial might evaluate an app that aims to increase exercise by including functionality that is intended to support goal setting, monitoring, and feedback.</s><s xml:id="_ZMuNXck">A TIP would allow for optimization of the BIT in the service of testing the principle.</s><s xml:id="_BcjJvVu">For example, the monitoring tools might prove less than ideal and thus evolve over time, moving from text-based free entry to selecting from a list, to passive sensing.</s><s xml:id="_WpSbg6H">Some of these evolutions might improve usability and thereby outcomes (eg, shifting from user-initiated entry to passive sensing could reduce user burden, thereby providing more feedback and increasing value to the user).</s><s xml:id="_nHqbynt">On the other hand, improving usability could be detrimental, either because the improved usability in one part of the BIT creates problems in another (eg, shifting from user-initiated entry to passive sensing might not be able to sense certain activities, like bicycling, thus frustrating the user and limiting their subsequent use of the BIT), or because improved usability interferes with behavioral aims (eg, shifting from active behavioral logging to passive sensing may reduce agency or remove opportunities for the user to notice and learn about their behaviors).</s><s xml:id="_mknJjke">A TIP would allow for these iterations to improve the usability of the BIT based on use data, while continuing to test the principle that using a mobile phone app to promote goal setting, monitoring, and feedback to increase exercise is effective, based on the primary outcome data.</s></p><p xml:id="_f9dxKvz"><s xml:id="_8cGp7Jr">In light of this, TIPs test a set of intervention principles that define an underlying rule, model, or mechanism of action on which a BIT impacts its target outcome.</s><s xml:id="_vCsvkcV">The principles being tested may be based on clinical theory and/or methods of using technology to interact with users.</s><s xml:id="_DvzfvBT">TIPs require a methodology that provides guidance on operationalizing and analyzing these principles.</s><s xml:id="_u6mQM7H">Below we describe a framework for describing and operationalizing those principles, considerations related to making changes to a BIT, and evaluation methodologies.</s></p></div>
