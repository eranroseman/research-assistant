this in turn would press for actions that potentially achieve the intention.</s><s xml:id="_9AWz2Uq">For the person who intends to post a letter a post-box entices (or at least calls or reminds one) to deposit the letter, very much like food entices the hungry person to eat.</s><s xml:id="_mFpsRp2">Since needs can be satisfied by various types of behaviors which may all substitute for each other in terms of reducing need tension (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_sSBpAU8">eating apples, cake, bread, and so forth), many different intention-related behaviors are assumed to qualify for satisfying the quasi-need associated with an intention.</s><s xml:id="_K3asgD9">As a consequence, many different items and events in a person's surroundings may acquire a valence.</s></p><p xml:id="_2qJn44k"><s xml:id="_mVZ9AZb">The intensity of the tension associated with the quasi-need was expected to affect a person's attempts to execute intention-related behaviors in the sense that higher intensity leads to more relevant efforts.</s><s xml:id="_nUKYdzx">The amount of tension may vary, however.</s><s xml:id="_FZKHuwd">It is primarily a consequence of quasi-need fulfilment, but it is also thought to depend on the strength of relevant real needs (i.e.</s><s xml:id="_TPcGdus">superordinate drives and general life goals) and how strongly these are related to the quasi-need.</s><s xml:id="_bmArwPg">Keeping to the post-box example: if the individual's real need to post the letter is low (i.e. a simple greeting card as compared to a job application), the intention to post the letter should be associated with a weak tension system.</s><s xml:id="_sSpYnbg">Therefore, the post-box should not acquire much valence and in turn fail to press for action (i.e. for depositing the letter).</s></p><p xml:id="_m54jurp"><s xml:id="_vFUr3G7">In numerous experiments, Lewin's students <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">(Lissner, 1933;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">Mahler, 1933;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b109">Ovsiankina, 1928;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b122">Sliosberg, 1934;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b146">Zeigarnik, 1927)</ref> tried to show that the intention-as-need notion was superior to Ach's linkage theory of intention.</s><s xml:id="_uRSxF5P">The most prominent experimental paradigm was that of the resumption of an interrupted action.</s><s xml:id="_GMrC4zA">Subjects were interrupted while working on a task and subsequent spontaneous resumption was observed unobtrusively.</s><s xml:id="_aJMSB5F">No matter which type of interruption was employed or how long it lasted, resumption rates were generally very high <ref type="bibr" target="#b109">(Ovsiankina, 1928)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_z6Ebh3s">This was interpreted as contradictory to Ach's ideas, because an interrupted task no longer represents the very situation (i.e. the untouched task) to which the intended action (i.e.</s><s xml:id="_ANdhwwR">solving the task) had been linked by the individual's act of will.</s><s xml:id="_j7gsX5T">Following Ach's ideas, the interrupted task should therefore fail to instigate the intended behavior.</s><s xml:id="_dv3vtcC">However, resumption rates were observed to be low only when the time period that immediately followed the interruption was filled with a substitute task that served the same goal as the original, interrupted task <ref type="bibr" target="#b96">(Mahler, 1933</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b90">, Lissner, 1933)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DeuNSrB">This was interpreted as strong support for the intention-as-need notion, because it was assumed that the substitute task had reduced the tension of the quasi-need associated with a subject's intention to solve the original task.</s></p><p xml:id="_pTQSYqB"><s xml:id="_c7Mb9nS">A critical analysis of Lewin's theory of intentions (see Gollwitzer &amp; Liu, in press) quickly reveals, however, that it is not concerned with the processes that translate intentions into action.</s><s xml:id="_gsS5hYR">Rather, Lewin presents an easy-to-grasp metaphor that helps isolate conditions under which we can expect intentions to lead to behavior (e.g. the intended behavior still has to be important to the person and proper means to achieve the intention have to be available).</s><s xml:id="_6sss3n5">Although the objective of Lewin's theorizing was to offer a model that speaks to the question of how intentions work, the type of theorizing adopted specifies moderators but does not point to potential mediators; accordingly, it is mute to the psychological processes that translate intentions into action.</s></p></div>
