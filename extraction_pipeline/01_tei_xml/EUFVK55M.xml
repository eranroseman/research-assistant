in Peru, which used a real-time medication event reminder monitor showed, in the perprotocol population, higher treatment success (cured or completed treatment) in the intervention group than in the control group (48 [98%] of 49 vs 45 [85%] of 53; RR 1•15, 95% CI 1•02-1•30).</s><s xml:id="_Kt8MaNQ">However, this effect was not observed in the intention-to-treat population (RR 1•09, 95% CI 0•94-1•27), which included four patients in the intervention group who withdrew (two voluntarily [one switched to a different regimen], and two due to suspected misuse of the monitor). <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10</ref></s><s xml:id="_e6WYFEh">There was a failure to change patient management following identification of non-adherence at monthly reviews by doctors at the tuberculosis centres, despite regular visits to clusters by the national or county-level CDC to review intervention fidelity.</s></p><p xml:id="_Ge8xMmT"><s xml:id="_65xCMkD">In our trial, despite non-adherence being higher in the control group than in the intervention group, there was no apparent intervention effect on treatment outcomes or tuberculosis recurrence, which contradicts the findings from some other studies.</s><s xml:id="_8D9FykH">An analysis of the fluoroquinolone treatment trials, albeit a non-randomised comparison, showed a strong relationship between lower adherence and increased risk of unfavourable tuberculosis treatment outcomes. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref></s><s xml:id="_DsyVKFF">This might mean that, in the control group, treatment adherence was still high enough to result in the majority of patients being effectively treated and having no increased risk of recurrence. <ref type="bibr">18</ref></s><s xml:id="_y9FqyCJ">With the granular adherence data generated by this trial, it will be important to identify whether certain patterns of non-adherence are associated with increased risk of poor treatment outcomes or treatment recurrence.</s><s xml:id="_DReJHdZ">In a descriptive analysis, our data showed a pattern of increased risk of unfavourable outcomes with lower adherence, in both groups, although confounding might partly explain this relationship.</s><s xml:id="_aCPXBCH">Alternatively, there might be differential measurement (between groups) of adherence using box-opening, resulting in adherence being similar in the two study groups.</s><s xml:id="_3rCTJEE">This would mean that box-opening is a poor proxy for treatment adherence.</s><s xml:id="_G3wQEz8">In a substudy of our previous trial, however, we did validate box-opening as a proxy using a urine test for rifampicin, and found high sensitivity and specificity. <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref></s><s xml:id="_FWV5C6N">uture studies could include a validation of box-opening as a proxy of dose taken using urine testing to detect drug metabolites.</s><s xml:id="_y5AMtbA">We also cannot discount the Hawthorne effect of the silent-mode medication event reminder monitor box in the control group improving treatment adherence, compared with usual care.</s></p><p xml:id="_Hu2JKnJ"><s xml:id="_JtasScR">Alternatively, we might have underestimated tuberculosis recurrence, although underestimation was unlikely to be differential by study group.</s><s xml:id="_zavjJF5">We followed up patients for 12 months after the end of treatment, which would be likely to capture the vast majority of recurrences. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s xml:id="_ZpnPgaF">Recurrence in this trial, however, was very low (1•9% over 12 months), in particular compared with the fluoroquinolone trials, where 12-month recurrence was two to three times higher than in this trial.</s><s xml:id="_mGMknQG">We used solid culture in laboratories that had quality control assessed before, although not during, the study.</s><s xml:id="_fXZTnEb">Sputum specimens were only collected at two timepoints after end of treatment, limiting the measurement of recurrence, and specimens might have been of lower quality compared with those collected as part of a treatment trial.</s><s xml:id="_qsDdyxz">Our approach for documenting recurrence, therefore, might not have been sufficiently sensitive, although we did supplement sputum specimens with chest radiographs.</s></p><p xml:id="_9j26qBh"><s xml:id="_Wm57Gd4">This trial did show a reduction in non-adherence, measured by box-opening, in the intervention group compared with the control group, similar to in our previous study, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> indicating improved quality of treatment with the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_jYTD5BM">Based on adherence data from these two pragmatic trials and programmatic experience of medication event reminder monitors in 138 counties in China, <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref> the China national tuberculosis programme has planned to expand the utilisation of the monitors, albeit with real-time functions, nationwide, in their 14th 5-year plan (for 2021-25).</s></p><p xml:id="_52eex52"><s xml:id="_3mKV9pZ">Other digital adherence technologies have been assessed in upper-middle-income and high-income settings, including video-supported therapy, to improve treatment outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_5D392ZN">These studies have shown similar or increased rates of favourable treatment outcomes with video supported therapy compared with control groups (often directly observed therapy); although, individually, all 95% CIs for the ratio effect estimate overlap 1, so are not significant. <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref></s><s xml:id="_ctySDaQ">3]<ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> A study in China showed similar rates of successful treatment outcomes (cured and completed treatment) in the intervention group (video supported therapy; 109 [96%] of 203 patients) compared with the control group (directly observed therapy; 191 [95%] of 202). <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref></s><s xml:id="_wy7zqCA">The observation in the intervention group was done using live video and directly observed therapy required observation of treatment by a health-care worker or lay worker once every 2 days.</s><s xml:id="_Ry9Mtwh">Further evaluation of this technology in China, where directly observed therapy is not a requirement, is warranted.</s></p><p xml:id="_aE5498H"><s xml:id="_X5e755h">This trial has many strengths, including a large sample size and an intervention that was implemented by the national tuberculosis programme rather than a research team in parallel, it was conducted across varied settings, and follow-up continued for 12 months after the end of treatment.</s><s xml:id="_3qF5WJF">The study does, however, have several limitations: more intensive management activities, such as home visits to patients identified as having adherence problems, did not always happen as planned; after randomisation, two intervention clusters were combined, although this had minimal impact on power; solid culture rather than the more sensitive liquid culture was used to measure recurrence; and adherence outcomes were defined using a box-opening as a proxy for doses taken.</s></p><p xml:id="_FCEt9rP"><s xml:id="_QhcSt94">In conclusion, the digital adherence technology intervention, involving a daily reminder medication monitor, monthly review of adherence data, and differentiated care for patients with adherence issues, was inadequate to influence unfavourable outcomes, which included loss to follow-up during treatment, tuberculosis recurrence, death, and treatment failure.</s><s xml:id="_Jx3FgFr">Poor implementation of targeted adherence support might have contributed to no effect of the intervention on outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_r9thXHG">Other trials have shown that digital adherence technologies (SMS-based and those based on medication event reminder monitors), implemented in real-time, can improve successful treatment outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_mZTX2wR">It is important, though, to understand the cost of delivering such interventions and also how these can be implemented in routine practice.</s><s xml:id="_spkE62Y">Programmatically, treatment adherence might be sub standard and clinicians do not have adequate methods to measure dose-taking.</s><s xml:id="_yVmeM7r">WHO uses treatment success (cured or completed treatment) as an indicator for performance of tuberculosis programmes, although it is a poor indicator of care as treatment completion is often not based on robust measures of adherence.</s><s xml:id="_JFQVC4j">For evaluating digital adherence technologies, rather than relying solely on outcomes at the end of treatment, a combined endpoint of adherence and treatment outcome could be used, with adherence measured in all trial participants using digital technologies with excellent accuracy characteristics.</s><s xml:id="_K58kxTq">It is important that future trials do measure end of treatment outcomes, ideally incorporating quality treat ment completion and possibly recurrence, if measured robustly, to generate strong evidence to influence policy.</s></p></div>
