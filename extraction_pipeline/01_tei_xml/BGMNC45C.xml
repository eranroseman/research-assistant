accuracy of information in apps is related to limitations in the methods available and inconsistencies in the approach to research in this area.</s><s xml:id="_bTRJQk7">Using smartphone apps for healthy behavior change is an emerging area of investigation, and as a result, much of the current research is focused on the evaluation of single apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and apps that have been purposely designed for a research project <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>, or a small number of top-rated apps <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16]</ref>, rather than focusing on a thorough large-scale investigation of the potential of apps that already exist on the market to promote behavior change <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_vkzB2x8"><s xml:id="_SmtQcUp">A recent systematic review investigated approaches to the evaluation of health apps with the aim of identifying current best practice approaches <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_74WJP4j">The review of 38 papers found no single best practice method of evaluating mobile health and well-being apps.</s><s xml:id="_ubqVK2e">Most approaches did not include sufficient information or evaluation, potentially meaning consumers are provided with incomplete and inaccurate information about the apps.</s><s xml:id="_37AnVgw">The review suggested that the evaluation of apps should include a review of the functionality and usability of the app, as well as an assessment of the apps' potential to promote behavior change.</s><s xml:id="_F5PyVCS">It found that although not specific for smartphone apps, the Coventry, Aberdeen, and London-Refined taxonomy, developed by Michie et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>, was the most commonly used instrument for assessing behavior change techniques in interventions and the Mobile Apps Rating Scale (MARS), developed by Stoyanov et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref> was the most commonly used tool for assessing the quality and functionality of mobile health apps.</s></p><p xml:id="_hmFamYK"><s xml:id="_rTkVqhw">On the basis of this review, McKay et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> developed a scale specifically designed to determine the behavior change potential of smartphone apps.</s><s xml:id="_xCgHZxF">This tool, the App Behavior Change Scale (ABACUS), based off the health behavior change intervention literature, is a 21-item instrument that reports high percentage agreement, Krippendorff alpha, interrater reliability, and high internal consistency.</s></p><p xml:id="_Z7b4rjP"><s xml:id="_2hPfrbe">This study aims to rate the potential effectiveness of the apps using a scale that assesses the inclusion of features that are known to assist individuals with behavior change, designed to reduce alcohol consumption or smoking, improve nutrition or mental well-being, or increase physical activity to provide potential app users information on the content of apps and their likely effectiveness in supporting the user's lifestyle behavior change goals.</s></p><p xml:id="_wRZ4jDT"><s xml:id="_GyHGYT4">The ratings are housed on a website developed by the Victorian Health Promotion Foundation (VicHealth) to assist the public in making informed choices about effective healthy lifestyle apps.</s><s xml:id="_dhDhtjD">VicHealth is a public health agency based in the Australian state of Victoria that is focused on promoting good health and preventing chronic disease.</s><s xml:id="_9hBN6AN">The previously mentioned 5 healthy lifestyle areas were selected as these were the focus of VicHealth's programs and reflected major lifestyle risk factors that contributed to the burden of disease in Australia <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_5Y6KrqF"><s xml:id="_fBtBCvq">In addition, this study also sought to describe the method used in the rating of apps for health-related behavior change with a view to enabling application of the method to regular review and public update about the effectiveness of health apps.</s><s xml:id="_A8qWkas">This approach has a broad application in other health areas where the assessment of an app's potential to support effective adoption of healthy behaviors is required and where health agencies or government health departments have a mandate to support the public in making effective choices for health.</s><s xml:id="_4XySYmc">This is particularly critical for app consumers as there is a proliferation of health apps on the market with claims regarding their effectiveness in supporting health behaviors, including behaviors related to a healthy lifestyle and illness self-management.</s><s xml:id="_ASsZbYV">Application of a consistent app review method can simplify the process of regularly reviewing apps on the market to keep the public informed of their potential effectiveness.</s></p></div>

therefore, search terms that would identify a specific condition were not included.</s><s xml:id="_tyetd55">The search terms used were as follows: health, lifestyle, alcohol, alcoholic, drinks, drinking, booze, sober, blood alcohol, BAC, smoking, smoke, cigarette, tobacco, fitness, exercise, running, exercising, physical activity, active, steps, walking, training plan, nutrition, social isolation, healthy eating, diet, healthy eating, healthy food, health food, healthy drink, health drink, water, hydration, junk food, salt, sodium, social connection, anxiety, well-being, relaxation, mindfulness, stress, mood, meditate, meditation, emotional intelligence, empathy, gratitude, loneliness, friendship, resilience, and resilient.</s><s xml:id="_VdDaRyv">Apps were filtered according to the following inclusion criteria: average user rating of greater than or equal to 3 and at least 10 user reviews (all versions), updated in the last 18 months, and in the English language.</s><s xml:id="_p3GVsxE">Apps were then categorized into 5 key healthy living categories: promoting healthy eating, encouraging regular physical activity, preventing tobacco use, reducing alcohol consumption, and improving mental well-being.</s></p><p xml:id="_qMPH2GX"><s xml:id="_NzK6kf7">Apps were further filtered and excluded if conflicts of interest were identified, for example, apps promoting negative behavior such as prosmoking in tobacco apps; the app targeted a specific clinical population such as people living with diabetes, or the treatment of psychological disorders, as this review sought to evaluate apps that encourage health behavior change through health promotion and not clinical management of a disease or condition; or the app was not relevant to Australia, including those where a currency other than Australian dollars was only used, nonmetric measures, or a gym franchise in countries other than Australia.</s><s xml:id="_jh2CCDe">Following this, app descriptions were reviewed independently by 2 reviewers to determine if they could be classified as promoting behavior change.</s><s xml:id="_upuCurr">Behavior change, in this instance, refers to the new activities or actions one needs to do regularly to achieve a healthier lifestyle, for example, exercising, eating healthier food, or managing stress.</s><s xml:id="_w4gvYs6">To investigate the potential for behavior change, app descriptions were reviewed against 4 criteria: (1) the ability to set goals for the actions the user would like to achieve, (2) the ability to tailor the app, (3) the ability to share progress with others (for example, through connections on social media), and (4) the ability to receive rewards or acknowledgments when activities are completed or progress toward a goal is made.</s><s xml:id="_HbVnmpy">These criteria are based on previous health promotion and behavior change research <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gSVxPmS">As this review was interested in apps that had the potential to change behavior, apps that only provided information or connected users to a service or facility and did not meet at least 2 of the 4 behavior change elements listed above were excluded.</s></p><p xml:id="_4VQpgHF"><s xml:id="_bZQs6pN">All behavior change apps were downloaded for use on an iPhone.</s><s xml:id="_7gmnNm9">If an app was not available for one of those platforms (or was incompatible with the device used), reviewers identified and used a compatible device.</s><s xml:id="_5VSV2AS">Where an app was available on both Google Play and Apple iTunes, for ease, the apps were downloaded for review on an Apple device.</s><s xml:id="_KaUXAQ3">When data were collected, the description for apps on Google Play and Apple iTunes were compared.</s><s xml:id="_Hq4XHBb">Similarities and differences in app description were noted at this point;
