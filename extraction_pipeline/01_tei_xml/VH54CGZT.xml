(CHD) and stroke, is the leading cause of death and disease burden globally <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_uR8SadB">CVD was responsible for approximately 32% of deaths in 2019 and the Global Burden of Disease data revealed that ischaemic heart disease affects approximately 126 million people <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_4pQsRvA">Importantly, approximately a third of these occur in people who have prior disease and are therefore largely preventable <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WUEP7kr">The recent data from the SNAPSHOT ACS follow-up study (Australian patients) found that almost 20% of patients admitted to hospital with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) die within three years of discharge and 40% experience another hospitalisation for CVD in the same period <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8W7jy3F">With an aging population, more people surviving initial heart events, and an epidemic of lifestyle-related risk factors, the health burden is escalating globally <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_X6JX85C">Thus, improving post-discharge care through adherence to best practice secondary prevention strategies (healthy living, medicines and psychosocial support) is a current international priority <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_N2X92jy"><s xml:id="_pMWby28">Cardiac rehabilitation offers a traditional approach for providing structured secondary prevention.</s><s xml:id="_dmAv7hy">It is defined by the World Health Organisation as "the coordinated sum of activities required to influence favourably the underlying cause of CVD, as well as to provide the best possible physical, mental and social conditions, so that the patients 2 of 16 may, by their own efforts, preserve or resume optimal functioning in their community and through improved health behaviour, slow or reverse progression of disease" <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Pg4444q">Traditionally, programs have been conducted as a 6-10-week program of group-based exercise and education that is commenced within the initial six weeks of an event <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gytwfJF">Cardiac rehabilitation has been shown to reduce morbidity and improve quality of life <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref> and therefore, referral, participation and completion are recommended in Australian <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> and international <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13]</ref> guidelines.</s><s xml:id="_5MKuctd">However, research consistently shows unacceptably poor rates of referral (30% of those eligible), attendance (9% of eligible) and completion (&lt;5% of eligible) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fhbCrEZ">Reasons are well documented and include transport, work/social commitments and lack of perceived need <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_bTW9azp">Further, adherence to evidence-based medications and lifestyle change typically start to decline within the first six months <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17]</ref> and certain groups are less likely to attend structured programs, including women, those from culturally/linguistically diverse or low socioeconomic backgrounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_JRTF2m5"><s xml:id="_7wJK6hF">From a systems perspective, the practicality and cost of providing traditional programs to all who are eligible (&gt;60,000 new patients annually) across diverse geographical areas with cultural and linguistic diversity is a major barrier <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Z7sbn4M">Therefore, there is increasing support for programs to be more flexible, culturally appropriate, multifaceted and integrated with patients' primary health care providers to achieve optimal and sustainable benefits for most patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_BqhNFCg">Recent advancements in technology and digitalisation of healthcare now provide opportunities to support patients in different ways.</s><s xml:id="_dQENWZp">Digital health has the potential to close the gap of access inequities by improving the reach and strength of health systems <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_bgHaWmH">This has become particularly relevant during the current COVID-19 pandemic in which social isolation has propelled the need for rapid proliferation of remote healthcare delivery.</s></p><p xml:id="_89X8wkD"><s xml:id="_6w3e7Yy">A critical aspect of recovery and secondary prevention is ensuring patients have access to evidence-based information and acquire knowledge related to their condition.</s><s xml:id="_cCnrPwQ">With adequate and appropriate information, patients and relevant carers are better placed to make decisions and implement optimal behavioural changes <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_76v4eJP">Ideally, informationsharing, decision-making and goal-setting should be patient-centred and evidenced based with consideration of patient need and preference <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EfZ3qsE">There is a plethora of evidence highlighting the importance of information and education throughout the entire health journey, whether it be in the preventive stage, during treatment, in early convalescence, or longer-term rehabilitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_jpvb7Fn">However, the provision of information should ideally commence early after an acute event to increase confidence in managing symptoms and to improve the likelihood of attendance in cardiac rehabilitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref>, although overloading with too much detail in the acute stage can be counter-productive <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_E3WgmTS">Importantly, with reducing length of hospital stays, there are diminishing opportunities for education and hence a variety of communication opportunities are important for sustained secondary prevention.</s><s xml:id="_bkPA66A">The transition of care into general practice post discharge also represents an opportune time to sustain health education and support.</s></p><p xml:id="_jXpY6W6"><s xml:id="_U7Jc4YZ">For secondary prevention of CHD, information exchange should be flexible and individually tailored based on patient risk factor profile, health needs and individual circumstances, such as socioeconomic background, gender, employment status, and geographical location <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_PHnVbrV">Further, offering patients choice and actively engaging them in treatment decisions and giving choices have been shown to improve health outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_UZuPkaB">An example is CHOICE, a brief, patient-centred intervention for ACS survivors not participating in cardiac rehabilitation <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DbH68vA">Additionally, setting mutually agreed goals and offering individual choice enhance relevance and independence to change behaviour <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zYrGuQT">CHOICE patients participated in a modular program of an in-person clinic visit (1 h) followed by telephone support (for over 3 months), encompassing mandatory cholesterol lowering and tailored preferential risk modification.</s><s xml:id="_sbUUK9A">A significant improvement in modifiable risk profiles and risk factor knowledge of ACS survivors over 12 months was observed in the CHOICE participants.</s><s xml:id="_zYPADJS">A modular concept is central to the patient-centred approach and allows patients to focus on problem areas <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ybdgxBg">The patient is therefore focused on addressing risk factors that are directly relevant to them, rather than expending time and effort increasing knowledge about all information needs perceived to be relevant for this population.</s></p><p xml:id="_74nWx5d"><s xml:id="_bpd7s8z">Another example of achieving coordinated secondary prevention of CHD for all in need is the Secondary Prevention for All in Need (SPAN) published framework <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gKrcPFa">SPAN enables a flexible but standardised approach and includes four core elements: (i) assessment, (ii) information sharing, (iii) individualised risk factor management, and (iv) ongoing support with follow-up.</s><s xml:id="_9SfcAjY">Each element provides flexible alternatives in terms of contact, setting, duration and format.</s><s xml:id="_bFCS2nX">For the information-sharing element, SPAN proposes that patients receive education about the pathophysiology of CHD, symptom management plan, importance of medication adherence, staying active, healthy eating and when to return to work.</s><s xml:id="_5xsASkz">The information is ideally delivered using a range of resources including multi-media (e.g., slides, video) and other resources (e.g., flipcharts, leaflets and verified websites).</s><s xml:id="_62JXqEd">The suggested educational content proposed by SPAN closely aligns with the evidence based Six Steps to Cardiac Recovery conversation guide (Six Steps guide) by the National Heart Foundation of Australia (NHFA) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_4BnbXqU">The Six Steps guide assists health professionals to facilitate information delivery at the patient's bedside.</s><s xml:id="_uynGjRU">This includes explaining the diagnosis, highlighting risk factors, encouraging patients to attend cardiac rehab, medication adherence, warning signs of heart attack, and the importance of following up with a GP and cardiologist <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_TxapWJY"><s xml:id="_3EqNxU7">This review was commissioned by the NHFA to assist with the iterative redesign of their patient support program offering assistance for people living with CHD.</s><s xml:id="_sR5grGu">Specifically, given the importance of education
