prevention and treatment benefits for many different physical and psychological conditions <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5GAtV6P">Nevertheless, according to a global survey of 1.9 million individuals in 168 countries, over one-quarter of people engage in minimum or no PA (150 min of moderate exercise per week or comparable) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Ugx3spH">Globally, 81% of teenagers aged 11-17 years are insufficiently physically active <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref>, and older adults engage in the least amount of physical activity of all age groups <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_sWRGmkF">In Canada, only 9% of children meet PA recommendations <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_x6vMhKT">Thus, it is critical for public health practitioners to encourage regular PA by developing more effective interventions.</s></p><p xml:id="_EqZ2nbn"><s xml:id="_HRtCBBJ">Despite persistent efforts to enhance physical activity (PA) through public health policies and behavior change techniques (BCTs) <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref>, interventions aimed at increasing public involvement in and adherence to PA have generated limited outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_zbYarch">For instance, a comprehensive meta-analysis of 27 PA intervention studies found that the overall effectiveness of PA behavior change is d = 0.27 (95% CI = 0.17 to 0.37) <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>, indicating that the effect size is small but significant <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_DpeSF5k">More recently, Whatnall et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> conducted a systematic review of 66 RCT studies that examined the effects of behavioral change interventions on step-, moderate-, vigorous-intensity PA and total PA, which identified between-group differences in only 52% of the studies.</s><s xml:id="_pASrTVh">Additionally, there is currently no consensus regarding which BCTs, including web-based and mobile interventions, are more effective for promoting PA <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_n5zJVSd">To promote PA effectively, theory-based interventions that address behavioral determinants are required.</s></p><p xml:id="_PNfHrCF"><s xml:id="_RvjbcmV">Intention, an antecedent variable of behavior in the theory of planned behavior (TPB) <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, which has been taken as a crucial factor, plays a positive role in the domain of PA promotion.</s><s xml:id="_m4vQZsf">However, empirical studies have confirmed that there is still a gap between the formation of goal intention and PA behavior initiation <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_rRbV9Xb">Based on existed theories <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20]</ref>, Gollwitzer identified that implementation intentions, which are self-regulatory strategies, can help bridge the intention-behavior gap <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_URjx8EC">Health practitioners typically prefer the operational approaches of action planning (AP) and coping planning (CP) when applying implementation intention interventions, that is, to specify when, where, and how to perform behaviors and determine corresponding responses to obstacles <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[22]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_byk3d3h"><s xml:id="_cUj5B8u">Up to now, three systematic

target="#b23">[24]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref>, but these studies had some limitations regarding the inclusion of high-quality literature and outcome analyses.</s><s xml:id="_53WutaF">Bélanger-Gravel et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b22">[23]</ref> observed a small-to-moderate overall effect size of implementation intention in several conditions through subgroup analyses.</s><s xml:id="_p8Tn9UT">Carraro and Gaudreau <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref> conducted a meta-analysis of 23 correlational and 21 experimental studies for both spontaneous and experimentally induced interventions in the form of AP and CP.</s><s xml:id="_x2wfa6Z">This review also confirmed small-to-moderate effect sizes for planning interventions.</s><s xml:id="_xJzF743">Neither of these reviews used data entirely from RCTs as the gold standard, nor did they probe deeply into the sources of heterogeneity among studies.</s><s xml:id="_Z5rGjTu">A recent meta-analysis <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref> found significant effectiveness only in the reinforcement condition by analyzing 13 RCTs; however, its findings were limited by the number and quality of the included studies.</s></p><p xml:id="_4kDMdg6"><s xml:id="_XEXykYG">Therefore, the main purpose of this study is to collect relevant, high-quality evidence to investigate the effectiveness of planning interventions in promoting physical activity using the method of systematic review and meta-analysis.</s><s xml:id="_6q7TMsz">The second purpose is to explore the sources of heterogeneity across studies through subgroup analyses and to analyze the differences in effect sizes of planning interventions across different interest variables.</s></p></div>
