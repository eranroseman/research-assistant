frequently addressed is the problem of non-adherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref>, which refers to the fact that not all participants use or keep using the intervention in the

target="#b18">19]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_GRAVM5E">Gaining an insight into the factors that influence adherence should therefore be one of the main focus areas in any research study into web-based interventions.</s><s xml:id="_q6Xv4PP">In this context, it is important to stress the difference between the terms "adherence" or "non-usage attrition" and "dropout."</s><s xml:id="_BQsXcYj">Dropout, or dropout attrition, refers to participants in a study who do not fulfill the research protocol (eg, filling out questionnaires).</s><s xml:id="_y9evFB5">This is not a focus area of this study.</s><s xml:id="_MZbcMBx">Adherence, or non-usage attrition, refers to the extent to which individuals experience the content of an intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_w3wxSd2">This is the focus of our study.</s></p><p xml:id="_V9Yjaz9"><s xml:id="_xJ3vkXY">When looking at literature about adherence to a therapeutic regimen <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[20,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21]</ref>, adherence is seen as the extent to which the patient's behavior matches the recommendations that have been agreed upon with the prescriber.</s><s xml:id="_tjn9uHv">The term is often seen as a reaction to the term "compliance," which has a more coercive connotation.</s><s xml:id="_D68G2QJ">Consequently, in adherence, the patient plays an active role in achieving this behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_52CqJbZ">At the same time, there is also a norm or recommendation from a prescriber, which the patient tries to match.</s><s xml:id="_EyZxD6k">This recommendation is missing from the definitions of both adherence and non-usage attrition <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_QVaUN5G">In this study, we elaborate on the definition by introducing the concept of "intended usage."</s><s xml:id="_7dEmrx6">Intended usage is the extent to which individuals should experience the content (of the intervention) to derive maximum benefit from the intervention, as defined or implied by its creators.</s><s xml:id="_ykcB3Qj">This matches the norm or recommendation from the definition of adherence to a therapeutic regimen.</s><s xml:id="_5q5tdzG">By comparing the observed usage of an individual to the intended usage of a web-based intervention, we can establish whether or not this individual adheres to the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_8YpaaCR">In this context, adherence is a process that cannot be assessed solely by measuring usage at the beginning and end of the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_fK3xrzz">Rather, it has to be assessed throughout the entire process to establish whether or not an individual adheres to the intervention at each and every step of the way.</s><s xml:id="_CGx9KJj">Finally, by comparing the observed usage of each individual to the intended usage of the web-based intervention, the percentage of individuals that adhere to the intervention can be calculated.</s><s xml:id="_AJRww67">This results in a more objective measurement of adherence, which can then be compared to other interventions, even if the intended usage is different.</s></p><p xml:id="_X6jrknD"><s xml:id="_Jfg3Fz9">Adherence to web-based interventions has been the subject of research for some time.</s><s xml:id="_BaXmnpz">Many studies focus on whether and which respondents' characteristics can explain variations in adherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_NvWFjAR">Although this is a very important line of study, it seems to take the technology of web-based interventions for granted.</s><s xml:id="_Taeguq4">Technology as a means to communicate the content has been neglected in research.</s><s xml:id="_R2a5T7k">Indeed, this technology is often seen as a black box: a mere tool that has no effect or value and serves only as a vehicle for the delivery of intervention content.</s><s xml:id="_Uvddfjx">In line with a recent viewpoint paper, we propose to examine the technology from a holistic perspective and see it as a vital and inseparable aspect of the web-based intervention <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_M4SrAAc">This approach has been recommended in recent literature <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23]</ref> and has been the key point in the field of persuasive technology <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>, where there are examples of studies on the persuasive capacities of technology to support web-based interventions in the health care domain <ref type="bibr" target="#b24">[25]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_NgRChVx"><s xml:id="_m8pVMFm">Recently, two systematic reviews on the influence of intervention factors on adherence to web-based interventions were published <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">30]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_847bedq">Although both reviews provide valuable insights, we feel that there are shortcomings that limit the applicability of these results for our objectives.</s><s xml:id="_qMvJbNE">First, with regard to adherence, the study of Brouwer <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref> takes exposure to interventions delivered via the internet as the outcome measure.</s><s xml:id="_2rPaDqX">Exposure is seen as the number of times the user or patient logged on, the time spent on site, page views, etc, but these are static measurements unrelated to the usage intended by these interventions.</s><s xml:id="_7UCWuNX">This gives limited insights into the process of usage and adherence, which makes it difficult to compare different interventions and specify how well certain interventions are doing.</s><s xml:id="_K35Yqqz">A review by Schubart <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> fails to distinguish between dropout and adherence.</s><s xml:id="_3XABvDh">This approach limits the applicability of the results because, in real-life implementation of web-based interventions, there is no research protocol to adhere to, only the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_8eZahux">The results of Schubart's review <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> cannot be generalized to these situations because we do not know whether engagement is due to the research or the intervention.</s><s xml:id="_GDr6GjC">Furthermore, regarding the intervention factors, both studies use an ad hoc classification of these factors without a theoretical foundation, which makes it difficult to generalize and explain the results.</s><s xml:id="_y8ZwnHY">We consider a web-based intervention as consisting of content, interaction, and technology.</s><s xml:id="_TqrprEa">And, although these aspects are inseparable, they can be looked at in a structured manner.</s><s xml:id="_Ty76uD4">Both earlier reviews use a classification that, in our opinion, has substantial overlap in the goals to be achieved with these aspects.</s><s xml:id="_TZrxN4y">For example, in the review by Brouwer <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>, a distinction is made between interactive behavior change strategies and interactive elements.</s><s xml:id="_xCswYmn">It is stated that the goal of interactive elements is to "improve the attractiveness of the intervention or to provide the option for more information," but this is not mutually exclusive with interactive behavior change strategies.</s><s xml:id="_NZV5tNe">For example, a quiz is seen as an interactive element, but in our opinion it can also be used as a means of receiving tailored feedback or as a way to self-monitor your knowledge or behavior.</s><s xml:id="_n4TYpnn">Allocating a quiz to one of these categories is therefore problematic.</s><s xml:id="_8WdxZUA">The categorization of intervention factors in the review by Schubart <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> lacks depth and tries to encompass in one single categorization both modality (ie, the channel through which content is delivered; for example, email or telephone) and strategy (eg, feedback).</s></p><p xml:id="_EwQfMqP"><s xml:id="_6y2s7JK">The current study attempts to overcome these shortcomings by employing a more objective and comparable measurement of adherence to web-based interventions and a classification of technology based on persuasive technology literature.</s></p><p xml:id="_pdfzZA8"><s xml:id="_4jMXzvj">From the field of persuasive technology we learn that technology has the capacity to be persuasive through its role as a tool, a medium, and a creator of experiences <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">[24]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_kZcHyRw">Fogg's definition of persuasive technology limits this field to human-computer interaction and does not include computer-mediated communication (ie, including interaction with a person).</s><s xml:id="_Cgy3heT">However, we feel that it is unnecessary and undesirable to separate these two aspects of technology, particularly in the area of health care, because a web-based intervention is made up of different, inseparable aspects.</s><s xml:id="_aud5By7">We therefore propose a broader application of the term "persuasive technology" to include both human-computer interaction and computer-mediated communication.</s><s xml:id="_nRmWeVC">Accordingly, regarding the aspects of a
