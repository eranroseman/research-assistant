donors.</s><s xml:id="_dmxXQ7d">Donors, such as PEPFAR, provide most HIV drugs in Kenya, and other clinical services, like psychosocial support, are seldom paid for by clinics and hospitals, especially in poorer regions like NALs.</s><s xml:id="_848R6wZ">Rather, they are provided through grants to NGOs like Amref, which are intermittent and dependent on shifting donor priorities.</s><s xml:id="_26FhxWD">Generating major donor or government support would require, as one informant stated, "high-level commitments and a system ready to deploy massively [at scale]" (Interview, Isiolo).</s></p><p xml:id="_TekFxsz"><s xml:id="_bDgeaKb">Hence discussions around financing led to concerns about the need to "package" the WelTel service for policy uptake.</s><s xml:id="_MFrDFfb">Ambitions were aimed at scaling WelTel across Africa as part of HIV, TB and ANC services, and in some other form of commercialization for the North American market.</s><s xml:id="_8HXSHbr">Various business consultants had been brought in, often on a gratis basis, to explore this.</s><s xml:id="_hRvQpZc">A free licensing model for resource-limited settings supported by technical support contracts had been adopted, which would model Socially Responsible Licensing (SRL) principles.</s><s xml:id="_cYrQyRu">However as a new field, mHealth applications and supportive policies were noted to be still nascent and fragmented, and willing-to-pay rather uncertain.</s><s xml:id="_rdmj8Vq">As a WelTel-associated researcher discussed:</s></p><p xml:id="_f7VT29v"><s xml:id="_UJzgAvT">"People expect mHealth to be based on tiny budgets, or that it should all be provided for free, open source.</s><s xml:id="_2cYgp6U">Everyone wants to do their own thing.</s><s xml:id="_VYUPgtK">But ARVs are not open source!</s><s xml:id="_P2AKnJ6">It's an innovation that needs to be provided, like a business…like a social business."</s></p><p xml:id="_KcRAWmb"><s xml:id="_mgzDe6M">The WelTel software was provided for a licensing fee to each of the individual research projects, but some clinicians stressed that this expense would be hard to justify year-after-year at the facility-level: "It would be better if it was something like Microsoft Word where you buy it and you can just use it…you can even modify it with upgrades as you go along."</s><s xml:id="_Meqh2nt">(Interview, Clinician, Canada) Interviewees also highlighted some challenges in "selling" the service to policymakers.</s><s xml:id="_QFHRhDj">In Canada, perhaps one of the most challenging questions was related to the ability to convince policymakers that vulnerable HIVpositive clients should be given a cell-phone (which had been the case with the two HIV projects):</s></p><p xml:id="_muGdV3X"><s xml:id="_qQRDG4B">"You can clearly see the impact [of the WelTel intervention and phone provision] but how do you convince people to give money to give a drug user a phone?</s><s xml:id="_g9p5QYm">It is a hard sell!"</s><s xml:id="_phKT23A">Some believed that engaging in auxiliary technology features (such as the provision of phones) could distract from the aims of rapid scalability.</s><s xml:id="_SAsCdJ4">To others, however, it was essential to target the most vulnerable patients.</s><s xml:id="_eCJkNcP">Hence, there was still a sense that the organization was wresting with the proverbial question: what type of service should Wel-Tel be offering and to whom?</s><s xml:id="_VYC9u8n">There was also an ongoing debate about how to link public health impact with business interests and organizational growth.</s></p></div>

for example, each implementing clinic will still require a local champion to ensure effective implementation.</s><s xml:id="_2kshREq">Hence, harnessing mHealth to impact population-based health outcomes will require thinking carefully about how interventions interact with, and influence, their social milieu.</s><s xml:id="_nEbwGRk">As we have shown in this paper, this includes diverse stakeholder interests, clinic work routines, local organizational cultures and broader health systems context.</s></p></div>
