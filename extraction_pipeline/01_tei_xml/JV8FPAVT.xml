ADHD <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_GV7hFcw">ADHD has a significant impact on academic performance, social relationships, emotional well-being, behavior, and family dynamics

xml:id="_MJX9TSP">Because ADHD challenges are, for most individuals, persistent and lifelong, substantial self-regulation is needed to support initial treatment gains <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_URrBpaK">Moreover, as children with ADHD become adolescents, they often receive less frequent treatment and support for their difficulties despite facing increasingly challenging situations in academic (high school or college curriculum) <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[13]</ref>, social settings (exposure to illicit drugs, alcohol), and interpersonal relationships (e.g., family, romantic, friendship) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_fR6JMQN">Research has shown that adolescents with persistent ADHD are more likely to engage in serious risk behaviors (e.g., underage drinking, reckless driving, and illegal drug use) <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[15,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">16]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_cng4uHY">Self-regulation is a robust predictor of positive outcomes, and late childhood to early adolescence is a critical period for promoting self-regulation
