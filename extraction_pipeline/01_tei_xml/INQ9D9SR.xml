our definition of PV&amp;PVA is inclusive enough to encompass this type of application.</s></p><p xml:id="_jqKkGxB"><s xml:id="_H4HyZ6X">Our focus on personal context leads to some differences from traditional Vis &amp; VA and some new and interesting research challenges.</s><s xml:id="_MxhMZSB">Most traditional visualization applications focus on supporting expert analysts with respect to their occupational roles, which means typical systems (except perhaps those for situational awareness) presume that analysts will have long periods of time to do deep analysis of the data, using workstations with substantial computing power and large screens.</s></p><p xml:id="_sbU63R2"><s xml:id="_rvaSnf2">In a personal context, by contrast, people may look into their data with different goals, backgrounds, and expectations (i.e., internal context).</s><s xml:id="_n6PJj3p">While these differences may not exist in every case, our point is that they very often exist and are therefore worthy of design and research attention.</s><s xml:id="_asRSMkQ">People may have a lower priority and time budget for performing analytical tasks when they are not part of a work-role expectation, and their motivations may differ from those of people in professional contexts, as discussed by Sprague and Tory <ref type="bibr" target="#b75">[76]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_kunJ9DG">The vast majority of people are not visualization or data analytics experts, so analytic tools will need to be accessible.</s><s xml:id="_7CFHaUp">Memories, skills, knowledge, values, and culture impact how people perceive visualizations and interpret data, and this may be particularly true when people perceive the world from a self-centered perspective (i.e., reasoning about things with respect to oneself).</s><s xml:id="_DGuvv5U">In some cases, data may be meaningful only to the individual.</s><s xml:id="_tvtqWUP">External factors that may characterize personal context include devices, use context and social influence.</s><s xml:id="_HEhkX4T">People may use a wide variety of different devices according to the situation, such as mobile devices on the go and ambient displays in their homes.</s><s xml:id="_b7QDysv">Meanwhile, social influence may impact their behaviors and decisions (e.g., sharing information or experience, setting group goals, or comparing one's performance with peers).</s></p><p xml:id="_jkFtG5P"><s xml:id="_KuNrwwp">Interactions in a personal context could be different as well.</s><s xml:id="_xHkfSpN">While some people may actively execute deep analytical tasks indistinguishable from most traditional visualization tasks (e.g., Quantified Self or performance training for fitness activities), other tasks could involve passive attention <ref type="bibr" target="#b82">[83]</ref> (e.g., ongoing monitoring or ambient awareness facilitated by mobile devices and ambient displays).</s><s xml:id="_RVWqs5k">These passive attention activities need to fit seamlessly into other aspects of people's lives.</s><s xml:id="_X6ktzzj">The point here is not to draw a perfect boundary between PV&amp;PVA and traditional Vis &amp; VA, but rather to highlight a set of new challenges and opportunities that arise when we explicitly consider designing for a personal context.</s></p><p xml:id="_pMt5DCJ"><s xml:id="_RnDFPXB">As PV&amp;PVA research broadens the scope of visualization and visual analytics, it also subsumes many related fields, including casual InfoVis <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref>, InfoVis for the Masses <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref>, persuasive computing <ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref> and personal informatics <ref type="bibr" target="#b55">[56]</ref>, <ref type="bibr" target="#b58">[59]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_pGVvXma">Personal Informatics has become an established research area, and PI tools have been applied to a number of domains, such as health and environmental conservation.</s><s xml:id="_MJfpDJG">However, PI tools and research have largely focused on data collection rather than data presentation and interaction.</s><s xml:id="_PR68Kru">With their definition of casual infovis, Pousman et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b68">[69]</ref> brought attention to "InfoVis edge cases".</s><s xml:id="_h9feeGz">However, while their focus was to identify high-level categories of systems that were outside of traditional InfoVis, our focus here is to articulate a taxonomy of design dimensions that characterize PV&amp;PVA.</s></p><p xml:id="_qkN62jx"><s xml:id="_5EsNseK">Further, we note that we consider "traditional InfoVis systems" to be part of PV&amp;PVA when they are used in a personal context.</s><s xml:id="_ND5xTJm">Similarly, InfoVis for the Masses <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">[21]</ref> encouraged the Vis community to reach a broader audience, a philosophy we also support.</s><s xml:id="_dgrhUTH">However, they had a somewhat narrow focus, primarily on infographics and news media, that forms only a small part of PV&amp;PVA.</s></p><p xml:id="_42PYKS6"><s xml:id="_GvefF7y">The past work in these fields provides much of the foundational knowledge needed for PV&amp;PVA, and addresses many individual aspects of design, but research in these fields has been isolated.</s><s xml:id="_XsmUaFz">We are intentionally inclusive in our definitions to support our aim of uniting research that currently spans several fields.</s></p></div>
