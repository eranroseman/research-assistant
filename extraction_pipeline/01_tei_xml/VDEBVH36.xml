An outbreak of an infectious disease occurs in a specific part of the country, and the disease begins to spread.</s><s xml:id="_RmNebnJ">Once it is apparent that an outbreak has occurred, the learning system is mobilized to track the disease's spread.</s><s xml:id="_yRHphBU">As new cases are diagnosed, these data are stored in the EHRs at health care practice sites.</s><s xml:id="_gQspNNB">In response to a daily or more frequent query, electronic case reports are moved from each practice site to aggregation points in the local, state, and national public health system, making possible real-time nationwide surveillance of the spread of the disease.</s><s xml:id="_WVcZZW9">Example 3. A new drug is approved for routine use.</s><s xml:id="_M7QAbEy">The learning system is engaged to monitor the new drug's safety.</s><s xml:id="_KVraN4D">As patients begin using the new drug, any side effects anticipated from the clinical trials are captured in the EHRs as part of the health care of these patients.</s><s xml:id="_bdhbdup">In a manner that ensures individual privacy, these findings may be routinely transported in an automated manner from the EHRs in which they are collected to federal oversight agencies and to the company that is manufacturing the drug.</s><s xml:id="_PdAhg62">In addition, researchers who suspect unanticipated adverse events could send a query to the learning sys-tem to ascertain the prevalence of such events in a national sample.</s><s xml:id="_TBSTNDG">In both scenarios, the reports supplied by participating members include not only the occurrence of the event but also contextual data that aid in the interpretation of adverse event information.</s></p><p xml:id="_QV6WQvb"><s xml:id="_YtFfcsf">Example 4. In Example 3, the myriad clinical data obtained from large numbers of patients who are taking a new drug may reveal that patients who display particular physiological characteristics would benefit from a modified dosage of the drug.</s><s xml:id="_p22zzXt">These findings can lead to the rapid development of a decision-support rule, compatible with almost all deployed EHRs, that is nationally disseminated and incorporated in the decision-support components of these EHRs.</s><s xml:id="_H9AtBh6">When the drug is prescribed, the rule will generate a suggestion to modify the drug dosage in only those patients for whom the change is indicated.</s></p><p xml:id="_bCDdkpH"><s xml:id="_M5tBwtu">Each of these scenarios demonstrates how the time for disseminating new scientific achievements can be reduced from the current average of 17 years to 17 months, 17 weeks, or almost real-time through a nationally scaled and connected learning system.</s><s xml:id="_nB9XhbB">The system is currently conceived as a voluntary membership organization.</s><s xml:id="_2dsBQSr">The incentive to join rests on a principle of reciprocal benefit.</s><s xml:id="_bBFd7P7">Those who agree to make their data available to the system for response to questions from other members can place queries to the system themselves.</s><s xml:id="_AbafeJp">The greater the size of the system, the greater the validity of the inferences drawn from the studies it enables.</s><s xml:id="_DdKKzpt">In the future, a global learning health system might be achievable through agreements among individual nations or engagement of multinational organizations such as the European Union, which has outlined such a system for its member nations <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">(9)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_Cjmdzvu"><s xml:id="_vzj6Zr9">The federated approach to a learning system contrasts sharply with more centralized approaches-typically used within single organizations-that establish large, persistent repositories of clinical information.</s><s xml:id="_S2MDXUm">In a centralized approach, data are moved to a central repository in anticipation of future uses, before there is a specific need to do so.</s><s xml:id="_EC9PMhf">Large amounts of data reside in these repositories for extended periods of time.</s><s xml:id="_jVH9AUp">This approach is unlikely to be workable on a national scale.</s><s xml:id="_vREW2cJ">Organizations are understandably reluctant to move data beyond their own boundaries absent a clear and specific need to do so, and patients will be less likely to consent to allow this to happen.</s><s xml:id="_39ETAYx">While the U.S. federal government does have the authority to require reporting of limited data concerning specific conditions that affect the public health <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">(10)</ref>, we believe that a voluntary system with reciprocity of benefits is more likely to gain widespread acceptance and support among patients, care providers, academic and industry researchers, health system administrators, and other key stakeholders.</s></p><p xml:id="_S6Ud85G"><s xml:id="_RBtRstC">Several organizations have built learning systems for specific purposes aligned with their missions.</s><s xml:id="_z9VTA3c">Examples in the private sector include Kaiser-Permanente and many academic medical centers, such as the Mayo Clinic, Intermountain Health, Duke University, and the Cleveland Clinic <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_AyfktMw">Exemplary federal initiatives include the U.S. National Cancer Institute's Cancer Biomedical Informatics Grid (caBIG), a network that connects the cancer community, and the integrated health information systems of the U.S. Veterans Health Administration <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">(12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">13)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xVYTr9g">Collectively, these efforts represent an enormous base of experience on which a nationwide effort can draw.</s><s xml:id="_Mk38hyZ">These various initiatives have also demonstrated their potential benefits-such as Kaiser-Permanente's early detection of the long-term side effects of Vioxx <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">(11)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_8xjZ2n9">However, none of these efforts can scale directly to serve the entire nation.</s><s xml:id="_QNy8s6X">In general, each organization has evolved its own approach to technology, standards, and policies, all of which drive each entity's learning system and are not easily separated from the institutions' particular patient care and business practices.</s></p></div>
