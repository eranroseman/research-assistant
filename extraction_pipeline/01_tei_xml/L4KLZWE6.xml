Bishop, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b61">Painter et al., 2008;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b63">Prestwich et al., 2013)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Ub2We7f">Sixty-three per cent of the articles identified in the review related to just four theories: the TTM, TPB, SCT and the IMB Skills Model.</s><s xml:id="_9dfKbzD">While the literature we uncovered was limited by our inclusion criteria, and includes a small number cases in which authors have published more than one article applying the same theory to the same data-set or intervention, it indicates the very uneven distribution of frequency of theory use.</s><s xml:id="_QyW4GNj">This raises the question as to why many theories are so little used.</s><s xml:id="_6AzYSgQ">One explanation may be that how often a theory is used, could in part, be confounded by the year in which the theory was introduced.</s><s xml:id="_VkFQ3Tq">Knowledge of a theory in terms of how much it is discussed in the public domain is also likely to play a role.</s><s xml:id="_ZsAH7VZ">Another explanation might be that those that are used more frequently are 'better' theories and selected for use because they have a stronger evidence base or meet other quality criteria.</s><s xml:id="_KHKW8BP">However, a couple of examples suggest that frequency does not necessarily follow quality.</s><s xml:id="_SFpFfZJ">For example, the theory appearing most frequently in our review, the TTM, has been criticised on several grounds <ref type="bibr" target="#b80">(West, 2005)</ref> and its empirical support has been questioned by systematic review findings (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">Cahill, Lancaster, &amp; Green, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">Etter &amp; Perneger, 1999;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b44">Littell &amp; Girvin, 2002;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b82">Whitelaw, Baldwin, Bunton, &amp; Flynn, 2000)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_2kxaPQp">On the other hand, recent meta-regression evidence has shown good support for Control Theory <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">(Dombrowski et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b40">Ivers et al., 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">Michie et al., 2009)</ref>; however, this was identified in only one article in our review.</s><s xml:id="_s9HyHHX">Another explanation is that people are not aware of the full range of theories from which to choose and so instead opt for those most commonly applied in the literature.</s><s xml:id="_n8vQYdh">Frequency of use may not reflect perceived quality of the theory but instead, fashion, familiarity, prior training, exposure or incentivisation.</s><s xml:id="_VQZdmBx">We hope that this review will help to increase awareness among intervention designers and researchers about the range of theories available.</s><s xml:id="_qyWkNuX">We report nine criteria agreed as markers of theory quality that could aid selection of the most appropriate theory or theories.</s></p><p xml:id="_kUYFTnj"><s xml:id="_cMvXgvs">Our decision to focus on theories of behaviour change at the level of the individual and exclude theories concerned with group behaviour is likely to be part of the explanation for the preponderance of psychological theories identified in the review, although even interventions at the community level tend to be informed by psychological or social-psychological theories (e.g., <ref type="bibr">Bonell, Fletcher, et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr">Bonell, Jamal, et al., 2013;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b33">Glanz &amp; Bishop, 2010;</ref><ref type="bibr">National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, 2007)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3SrQZCm">This, and the decision not to include books where sociological and anthropological theories are more likely to be found, may go some way to explaining why these types of theory are under-represented.</s><s xml:id="_Ve7cGw3">In addition, <ref type="bibr" target="#b42">Kelly et al. (2010)</ref> found that sociological theories were missed in electronic searches, particularly if they were more than 25 years old.</s><s xml:id="_yxCCme3">Given that interventions may be improved by drawing on theories specifically targeting group behaviours, this would be a useful focus for a future literature review as we are not aware of there being such a review.</s></p><p xml:id="_ByQtTkK"><s xml:id="_e82VqEg">This review raised the issues as to what constitutes 'a theory' and 'a behaviour'.</s><s xml:id="_knCnFwD">Theories, as conceptualised here, ranged from quite specific (e.g., to a particular behavioural domain or type of intervention) to very general, including multiple levels of influence.</s><s xml:id="_2aqpDJ2">The cut-offs at either end of this spectrum were agreed by consensus but were inevitably arbitrary.</s><s xml:id="_S7geHWx">A general observation was that more general theories may have greater face validity but be less useable in guiding research than more specific theories; choice of theory will therefore be partly guided by the purpose it is to be put to.</s><s xml:id="_JZ4HEYp">Another observation was that there appeared to be no generally accepted use of terms such as theory, model, framework and orientation, with different uses by different authors.</s><s xml:id="_afZQAf8">Increasing the precision of, and consensus on, use of terminology would be helpful for the field.</s></p><p xml:id="_8MJkr8q"><s xml:id="_HM6mcab">'Behaviour' also varies in level of specificity: for example, physical activity includes sports which includes volleyball which includes running.</s><s xml:id="_XgzqPsu">Behaviours are also part of sequences, often dependent on previous behaviours (e.g., carrying gym kit) and sometimes on other people's behaviours (e.g., others turning up for a team game).</s><s xml:id="_ENqS76f">Just as the relevance of a particular theory may vary across type of behaviour, so it may vary according to the level of specificity.</s></p><p xml:id="_Hrr5Crm"><s xml:id="_g3agRjx">The review also suggests that there are a large number of theories that are of potential use in designing public health interventions.</s><s xml:id="_Smgzmvz">The cataloguing of 83 theories of behaviour change is an important resource for researchers wishing to draw on theories beyond the few that currently dominate the literature.</s><s xml:id="_frSsyb5">However, few of these theories have been subjected to wide-scale rigorous empirical evaluation.</s><s xml:id="_PfvtAF6">There have been calls for more operationalization, application, testing and refining of theories over many years (e.g., <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">Michie &amp; Johnston, 2012;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b60">Noar &amp; Zimmerman, 2005;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b66">Rothman, 2004;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b78">Weinstein, 2007;</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b79">Weinstein &amp; Rothman, 2005)</ref>, but advances are slow.</s><s xml:id="_YSUXH5k">We need more investment into methodological and substantive research in this area, for example, the use of fractionated factorial <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">(Collins et al., 2011)</ref> and n-of-1 <ref type="bibr" target="#b41">(Johnston, Jones, Charles, McCann, &amp; McKee, 2013)</ref> designs to tease apart complex interventions and the extent to which theories can be generalised across populations, behaviours and contexts.</s></p><p xml:id="_Rzx3H9k"><s xml:id="_cBt2GKb">Identifying the theories in this review is just the first step in a much larger and ongoing programme of work aimed at improving the use of appropriate theory and the scientific rigour with which it is applied.</s><s xml:id="_RNqzWQK">Future work will investigate the ways in which theories have been operationalised and the extent to which different theories share constructs and can be seen as 'families' of theory.</s><s xml:id="_kFMtjrz">Transforming the nine quality criteria into forms, such as reliable scales or response options that can be used in evaluating theories is a complex task, and a study in its own right.</s><s xml:id="_ZQxZRGH">The evolution of theories over time, including the issue of when a theory is considered a new theory, will also be examined.</s><s xml:id="_JHyXvVV">Many theories contained similar constructs or the same constructs but with slightly different names.</s><s xml:id="_2FdAtkd">Understanding these similarities and working towards a common set of terminology would facilitate the building of a cumulative understanding of mechanisms of action from both primary research and evidence syntheses.</s><s xml:id="_wrGmQfg">It would also further our understanding of the evolution of theories and how theories have been revised and/or integrated with other theories over time.</s><s xml:id="_mhSHHsQ">Having said this, it is also important to recognise that not only language varies across and within disciplines but so do epistemological and ontological assumptions and preoccupations.</s></p><p xml:id="_dAa66T2"><s xml:id="_jFMvs4c">The next phase of the current research is to (i) investigate the connectedness of theories with each other and (ii) operationalize and demonstrate the application of the agreed quality criteria.</s><s xml:id="_54mAhVt">These will both inform the understanding of theory and its development, and help guide researchers, policy-makers and interventions on the appropriate selection and application behaviour change theories to developing public health and other behaviour change interventions.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Figure 1 .</head><label>1</label><figDesc><div><p xml:id="_Dz4f42p"><s xml:id="_jPGAJ6q">Figure 1.</s><s xml:id="_NxGaEYt">Flow chart of study and theory selection.</s></p></div></figDesc><graphic coords="8,68.94,58.96,355.35,386.87" type="bitmap" /></figure>
