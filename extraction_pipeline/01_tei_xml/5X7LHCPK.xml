<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_gstTSBp">Objective:</head><p xml:id="_DfrFrXq"><s xml:id="_WKrBj7q">The aim of the overall study was to measure and understand public awareness, usage, and attitudes towards doctor rating websites as a mode to give experiential feedback about GPs in general practice in England.</s><s xml:id="_vywrhPw">This paper reports on the findings of one of the aims of the study, which was to measure public awareness, current usage and future consideration of usage of online patient feedback websites, within the context of other feedback methods, This could allow the value of online patient feedback websites to be determined from the patients' perspective.</s></p><p xml:id="_VMjmKGt"><s xml:id="_qHXhqZy">Methods: A mixed methods population questionnaire was designed, validated and implemented face-to-face using a cross-sectional design with a representative sample of the public (n=844) in England.</s><s xml:id="_JHgETgu">The results of the questionnaire were analyzed using chi-square tests, binomial logistic regressions, and content analysis.</s><s xml:id="_Q45sRuf">The qualitative results will be reported elsewhere.</s></p><p xml:id="_HUvbQzJ"><s xml:id="_pTWS7YC">Results: Public awareness of online patient feedback websites as a channel to leave experiential feedback about GPs was found to be low at 15.2% (128/844).</s><s xml:id="_vXkNzAW">However, usage and future consideration to use online patient feedback websites were found to be extremely low, with current patient usage at just 0.4% (3/844), and patient intention to use online patient feedback in the future at 17.8% (150/844).</s><s xml:id="_6BVqGaN">Furthermore, only 4.0-5.0% of those who would consider leaving feedback about a GP in the future selected doctor rating websites as their most preferred method; more than half of patients said they would consider leaving feedback about GPs using another method, but not using an online patient feedback website.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_d2fAaFC">Conclusions:</head><p xml:id="_zBtxTQK"><s xml:id="_Ggd9pDX">The findings suggest that online patient feedback websites may not be an effective channel for collecting feedback on patient experience in general practice.</s><s xml:id="_vpMPvSs">Feedback on online patient feedback websites is not likely to be representative of the patient experience in the near future, challenging the use of online patient feedback not just as a mode for collecting patient experience data, but for patient choice and monitoring too.</s><s xml:id="_sSWUBPU">We recommend the National Health Service channels its investment and resources towards providing more direct and private feedback methods in general practice (such as opportunities for face-to-face feedback, email-based feedback, and web-based private feedback forms), as these are currently much more likely to be used by the majority of patients in England.</s></p></div>

the internet around the world, including a rise in the number of people using the internet for health purposes <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tFDFsbc">There has also been a growth in the number of people giving ratings and reviews online for products and services (such as on amazon.com).</s><s xml:id="_zgPu9CY">Some argue that this has allowed for transparent information and communication to influence change and has provided opportunities for consumers to read reviews and make more informed choices <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref> The National Health Service (NHS) when founded in 1948 was paternalistic in its approach to the care of patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_w5bBurV">However, from the 1970s onwards, there has been an increasing emphasis on patient and public involvement (PPI), with the introduction of multiple measures to collect patient experience feedback, and the provision of more patient choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_w9Gzya3">There has also been a growing emphasis on public reporting of performance measures across the government, including healthcare.</s><s xml:id="_8x8Rfzx">Patients are now argued to have an equal relationship with the NHS and other healthcare providers <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_S8EsHCp"><s xml:id="_FvAZnhT">All of the above factors led to the evolution of online patient feedback (OPF) websites or doctor-rating websites.</s><s xml:id="_tHjr68q">NHS England introduced an OPF website in 2007-the NHS Choices feedback website <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_T6v7SRz">For primary care and general practice, this means that patients can use these types of websites to review their healthcare experience and use these reviews to choose a provider.</s><s xml:id="_UStfHPU">The presence of these websites has been argued to yield multiple benefits, including empowering patients, improving transparency and enhancing patient choice <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_FcbwrKG">However, there is little evidence to support these claims.</s><s xml:id="_PuxpanC">Despite this, there has been a growth in the volume of OPF, which may suggest that patients in England (and other parts of the world) are embracing the opportunity to review their health care online <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_JBYtMTa">Similarly, growth in the development of OPF can also be seen, with the development of websites where patients can review their medication and treatment plan <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_CzNCbH4"><s xml:id="_WtPBcBu">There has also been a steady increase in research into OPF websites, with studies conducted in the UK <ref type="bibr">[9,11,13,14,16--24]</ref>, Germany <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[16]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[17]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref><ref type="bibr"

type="bibr" target="#b23">[24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25]</ref> all contributing to the OPF evidence basis.</s><s xml:id="_S7wNbps">Some evidence can be found to suggest that there is an association between online ratings and the quality of care <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[12,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[26]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b26">[27]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">[28]</ref>, but the results are often conflicting <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[29]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_Ewhj9N4"><s xml:id="_wfdMskb">Studies conducted outside of England have focused on the characteristics of patients that use OPF websites <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">[30]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">[31]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[32]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b32">[33]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WZAp377">However, the findings cannot be directly applied to England due to the nature of the healthcare systems being distinctly different <ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WQmDGZp">Furthermore, the main OPF website in England is a practice-based OPF website, where patients leave reviews under a practice name, rather than the name of the general practitioner (GP).</s></p><p xml:id="_wWhKz2s"><s xml:id="_f6mzk5X">In England, 3 studies focused on OPF websites from the patients' perspective <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_7SvTy7D">The first is a qualitative study based on 3 focus groups conducted by the Nuffield Trust which explored public attitudes towards health and social care ratings.</s><s xml:id="_WnSkB3J">The findings suggested that patients relied more on the word-of-mouth to choose a GP rather than an overall score of a GP <ref type="bibr" target="#b33">[34]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_PtRUXV8"><s xml:id="_vyshuSj">The second was a small convenience survey study conducted with 200 participants in one borough of London <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[35]</ref> to explore the predictors for the usage of doctor-rating websites.</s><s xml:id="_76tvy9a">The findings suggested a low awareness of doctor-rating websites.</s><s xml:id="_rhrnuHH">Those younger, or ethnically white, or those when deciding where to receive care either give importance to the reputation of the doctor or hospital statistics, are more likely to be aware of doctor-rating websites.</s><s xml:id="_P3q5HZE">They also found that income, ethnicity, and the doctor-patient relationship were significant predictors of future intention to use doctor-rating websites.</s><s xml:id="_VrbUXR7">This latter study was small and was not representative of patients across England.</s><s xml:id="_NKvHxZS">More crucially, however, it was not evident from the study for which purpose patients were using or were aware of these websites (for feedback or choice or both).</s><s xml:id="_GBHvWWK">Furthermore, none of the studies found in the literature compared patient awareness, usage or predictors of OPF to other methods of collecting feedback that are available for patients to use.</s><s xml:id="_SGWEZzw">This means that it is difficult to truly determine usage or awareness outside of its context.</s><s xml:id="_mbcUeuJ">Hence, for example, it may be that usage of other methods is also low too, and therefore limited usage is not exclusive to OPF websites.</s><s xml:id="_jCXjq8e">It is also not clear whether OPF is filling a feedback gap".</s></p><p xml:id="_SX9Yf8M"><s xml:id="_eSNfSV6">The authors of this paper, therefore, conducted a small qualitative study (n=18) to explore patients' views towards giving online feedback and ratings to GPs in England.</s><s xml:id="_dewPj3u">This was done within the context of other feedback methods available in primary care, in particular, paper-based feedback cards, which has been published <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_X9gEvhF">This current study is a follow up to that study <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>, to explore nationwide public views towards online patient feedback or feedback on doctor-rating websites (both terms are used interchangeably in this paper) in England.</s></p><p xml:id="_v79jRVg"><s xml:id="_z6BGpdF">The aim of this study was to measure and understand public awareness, usage, and attitudes towards doctor-rating websites, within the context of other feedback methods.</s><s xml:id="_NS9eAV9">Understanding how patients perceive and use OPF websites in comparison to other feedback methods can help determine whether OPF websites are of any perceived value to patients.</s><s xml:id="_UXJEnPF">This may potentially even help increase usage of OPF websites and improve the design and user-experience of OPF websites.</s><s xml:id="_ePvsUJG">This also allows for adequate comparison and a more comprehensive understanding of public awareness and usage of doctor-rating websites, rather than an isolated one, as previous researchers in this field have conducted <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EmyhUnf">These researchers also explored the effect or association of socio-demographic variables and other health factors on the usage and awareness of doctor-rating websites and used some of the factors to explain the variation in results.</s><s xml:id="_b8GPJS8">This was also conducted in this study.</s></p><p xml:id="_TQ6YvJt"><s xml:id="_DEhSzpQ">This study was also unique in that it focused specifically on using doctor-rating websites to give feedback about GPs, whereas all of the previous studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">31,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b31">32,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b34">35,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b36">37]</ref> explored doctor-rating websites more generally (for feedback and choice), and asked respondents to comment on its overall use for all healthcare services.</s><s xml:id="_5brByER">This paper addresses the research question: Are patients aware of OPF websites as a channel for experiential feedback in general practice, and do they use them?</s><s xml:id="_NSfZu7M">(The other mainly qualitative findings of this study will be reported elsewhere).</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_fy3aAtD">Implications for Practice</head><p xml:id="_7mVVvTM"><s xml:id="_jNFbe3z">The results from this study strongly suggest that GPs, GP practices, the NHS, and feedback website providers should consider alternative mechanisms to collect patient feedback in general practice, instead of relying primarily on the NHS Family and Friends Test card and online patient feedback websites as a day-to-day feedback method.</s><s xml:id="_V5bvR4m">In particular, direct methods to give feedback to the GP or the GP practice (digital or non-digital) are most used and preferred by patients, such as face-to-face feedback, email, telephone, and private feedback forms on the GP practice website.</s><s xml:id="_f3yxTCf">Therefore, we recommend the NHS to channel its investment and resources towards providing more direct and private feedback methods in general practice (such as opportunities for face-to-face feedback, email-based feedback, and Web-based private feedback forms), as these are much more likely to be used currently by the majority of patients in England.</s><s xml:id="_WMgHrpb">We also recommend that when online feedback is presented to other patients for choice", the feedback must be part of a collection of measures including patient feedback collected using other methods, and other measures such as the clinical competency of the GP, findings from the Care Quality Commission report, and safety results.</s><s xml:id="_3zND5rs">Other recommendations for OPF providers and GPs and GP practices can be found in Multimedia Appendix 3 and Multimedia Appendix 4 respectively, where we also highlight what the NHS and other OPF providers can do to increase patient use of OPF websites.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_8MAjtN3">Conclusions</head><p xml:id="_rrvCXnE"><s xml:id="_nsHTnYX">This is the first piece of nationally representative research that has explored patients' awareness and usage of OPF websites within the context of other feedback mechanisms available in general practice in England, and to date, in our knowledge, the largest and most robust study conducted with patients about doctor-rating websites.</s></p><p xml:id="_EFzHPkF"><s xml:id="_3T85jtT">Given the popularity, acceptance, and usage of consumer rating websites such as Trip Advisor, coupled with the increasing emphasis on PPI and patient experience in the NHS, and the millions of pounds investment into OPF websites by the NHS <ref type="bibr" target="#b43">[44]</ref>, it is surprising that this study (alongside Patel et al <ref type="bibr" target="#b35">[36]</ref>), unlike previous academic work on online rating websites, questions whether patients and carers really want or need OPF to give feedback about GPs in England.</s><s xml:id="_kvaAYhx">This is because the findings indicate that although awareness is not so poor of doctor-rating websites when compared to awareness of giving feedback in general, past usage is extremely uncommon at 0.4% for feedback about GPs, and so is future consideration to use doctor-rating websites for giving feedback about GPs 82.0% of the public indicated that they will not consider using doctor-rating websites to give feedback in the future; although a further 32.9% of the population would consider using doctor-rating websites but not to leave feedback for a GP.</s><s xml:id="_MbdK53t">Furthermore, only 4.0%-5.0% of those who would consider leaving feedback in the future selected doctor-rating websites as their most preferred method to leave feedback about a GP.</s><s xml:id="_QZyRNDJ">This, as well as the different predictors found for awareness, usage, and future consideration to use OPF websites, all appear to suggest that (1) OPF websites may not be an effective channel for collecting feedback on patient experience in general practice (and hence the NHS should provide alternative methods of collecting feedback), and (2) feedback on OPF websites is not likely to be representative of the patient experience in the near future.</s><s xml:id="_gCRTaGy">Although this may not be a pertinent problem for GPs and GP providers using the patient experience data for improvement (because improvement even based on 1 piece of patient feedback could potentially be useful), fundamentally it is a huge problem for the use of OPF for selection (ie, patient choice), and for monitoring.</s><s xml:id="_KEFzMR7">This is because the results suggest that OPF is biased because it is not representative of patient experience, and therefore patients using OPF for choice of healthcare provider are basing their choice on biased and unrepresentative data, challenging strongly the popular notion that OPF is useful for patient choice, as advocated both by academics <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14]</ref> and the NHS <ref type="bibr" target="#b48">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b49">50]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_6eb9rm8">Furthermore, the findings appear to contradict Greaves et al's <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> observation of associations between NHS Choices general practice ratings and patient experience measures, thus strongly questioning the usefulness of OPF as a measure of quality in health care.</s></p><p xml:id="_pj7CMnY"><s xml:id="_FYs2TzH">Nevertheless, the findings do suggest that OPF websites fulfill a feedback gap" for a very small number of patients, and appear to support the argument that some patients, who would not normally give feedback using other methods, would leave feedback on OPF websites.</s><s xml:id="_6zDwYbg">Therefore, this may suggest that OPF websites could be used to improve patient experience, as feedback can be collected from those patients who may not give feedback using other channels, as long as GP Practices were willing to use OPF for improvement purposes.</s></p></div><figure xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" xml:id="fig_0"><head>Textbox 3 .</head><label>3</label><figDesc><div><p xml:id="_99XcxPB"><s xml:id="_c4RMbn8">The 2 significant variables.</s></p></div></figDesc></figure>
