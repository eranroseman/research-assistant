however, a more systematic approach is needed <ref type="bibr" target="#b84">[84]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b85">[85]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b86">[86]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_q6KqHRG"><s xml:id="_8vchqxY">Ideally, this could then set off a virtuous cycle in which one could, via rapid iterations, gather feedback about specific message characteristics that are associated with targeted outcomes (eg, attention, awareness, and message sharing) and thus more clearly identify the message characteristics that facilitate individual outcomes <ref type="bibr" target="#b87">[87]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_tS5Ttvq">As these characteristics become more accessible by linking objective message properties to large-scale outcomes, we might expect profound theoretical contributions from this otherwise applied system <ref type="bibr" target="#b88">[88]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_j5Bpf7S"><s xml:id="_cAaSEYM">Along these lines, the most promising research direction is to fine-tune the fine-tuning process.</s><s xml:id="_FKnfHG4">We simply used the medium-sized GPT-2 model and fine-tuned the model with a set of tweets that were minimally screened.</s><s xml:id="_z4wFWdc">However, as with any manufacturing process, the quality of the input data determines the output.</s><s xml:id="_BReTbvK">Thus, by fine-tuning the engine with often mediocre tweets, the AI-generated tweets were likely less potent than they would have been with a better training set.</s></p><p xml:id="_PmwCvSv"><s xml:id="_DrkRTT5">In the future, we envision that one could curate a pool of high-quality tweets to serve as grade-A training material.</s><s xml:id="_3ss5MUS">An option, analogous to the strategy of training the GPT-2 base model with relatively more engaging text content, is to select only those tweets about #folicacid that have been retweeted or liked.</s><s xml:id="_ArWnqjK">Another option is to bootstrap messages by having domain experts reword or craft theory-based examples.</s><s xml:id="_qHazz5s">However, a challenge for this strategy is that fine-tuning requires large amounts of text-a few hundred examples are not enough.</s><s xml:id="_zWZszmE">Overcoming this challenge is feasible with a large pool of quality input data.</s><s xml:id="_AZ66Aec">In addition, such a message pool could be used to train message engines for domains other than the narrow issue of FA.</s></p><p xml:id="_wybHcf5"><s xml:id="_XQJkBV4">We conclude this section by emphasizing again that the primary use case of such systems lies in boosting awareness for selected health problems where awareness is lacking or waning.</s><s xml:id="_j7sm6Ka">At this point, a message engine system does not yet solve trickier health communication problems, such as the habitual nature of many negative health behaviors, addressing the socioecological embeddedness of such behaviors, or how to change health-related attitudes <ref type="bibr" target="#b89">[89]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_MscRyFE">In principle, we see no reason why such systems could not be expanded to contexts beyond social media, especially as reliance on voice assistants such as Amazon's Alexa, Alibaba's AliGenie, or Apple's Siri for information increases.</s><s xml:id="_HPB62cm">However, the message engine presented here is primarily intended for mass communication about public health issues that are affected by low awareness.</s><s xml:id="_HS6Vf7M">For such health issues, we envision that this system can improve the cost/benefit ratio and overcome the message-creation bottleneck to avoid web-based content from being algorithmically downvoted as it is considered not fresh, dull, or unengaging.</s></p></div>
<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_AwB2SGz">Limitations, Risks, and Avenues for Future Research</head><p xml:id="_wdCzm6v"><s xml:id="_s2b6YSa">This study demonstrates a positive application of NLG technology; however, some risks and limitations are worth mentioning.</s></p><p xml:id="_dBqj7D4"><s xml:id="_fb9g7r7">A very basic limitation is that our focus was on demonstrating the feasibility of a message engine to generate messages that could potentially become part of a campaign; however, we did not actually conduct such a campaign.</s><s xml:id="_5qyreCk">Thus, although we are confident that we showed that the generated messages-after going through the human content curation process-are on par with human-generated baseline messages, we did not actually show that these messages improved public health and especially not with regard to more distal outcomes such as attitude change and behavior.</s><s xml:id="_VpbAJr6">This should be the topic for future research.</s></p><p xml:id="_Kka3ARX"><s xml:id="_GXMYEan">Similarly, we note that our sample comprised college students who were not intended to be representative of the larger population.</s><s xml:id="_v6vTfjW">However, given that our focus was on evaluations of message clarity and quality rather than more idiosyncratically defined responses, this sample seems appropriate.</s><s xml:id="_bdjjS4Y">This is also underscored by the fact that evaluations were highly consistent across subgroups of women and men raters.</s><s xml:id="_6548REG">Nevertheless, future work on, for example, message effects on attitudes, beliefs, and other variables beyond basic clarity and quality should also focus on outcomes in specific health audiences, such as people who intend to have a child.</s></p><p xml:id="_xwASSdH"><s xml:id="_faq8Q5M">Regarding broader implications and risks, recent events in the political domain have highlighted the danger of algorithmic bots deployed to create or spread misinformation <ref type="bibr" target="#b90">[90]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b91">[91]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b92">[92]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b93">[93]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_4URqD7N">Several malicious actors seem to be using natural language generators to produce fake or divisive messages; thus, several empirical studies have examined the dangers of using NLG technology to create content that is harmful to society <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[49,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b94">94]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ctgqV6g">The same problems arise concerning the marketing of products that might harm health or use bots to promote certain brands <ref type="bibr" target="#b95">[95]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b96">[96]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b97">[97]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_txVrhQx"><s xml:id="_N3HRkWw">Our study speaks to these issues by showing that it is also possible that benevolent actors can use NLG methods to promote public health.</s><s xml:id="_mM6gChy">As with all technologies, risk and benefit are correlated, because otherwise the technology would be abandoned <ref type="bibr" target="#b98">[98]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_hnAkTq3">As such, we hope that our study will help explore the potential of AI as a force for promoting positive outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_7B8qsev">However, this does not mean that we advocate for a laissez-faire strategy.</s><s xml:id="_VuUvKQq">Instead, a discussion of the ethical consequences of these technologies is needed and ongoing <ref type="bibr" target="#b99">[99,</ref><ref type="bibr">100]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Y4kKcFK">However, the field of health communication seems to be a particularly strong example of how human-centered AI could be used for social good.</s></p><p xml:id="_Eef4FEE"><s xml:id="_Sam2reS">Another risk and major limitation of the system is its lack of common sense knowledge.</s><s xml:id="_cc4hTcP">People who are not familiar with NLG technology are sometimes ambivalent about the idea of a message engine, finding it both magical and critical.</s><s xml:id="_5PDtNG6">Many also expect the systems to operate in a human-like fashion; however, this is not at all the case.</s><s xml:id="_SWtKW8f">On the surface, the generated tweets have a human-like look and feel to them; however, closer inspection reveals that GPT-2-style language models lack the deeper understanding and reasoning capacity that would be necessary for calling them intelligent.</s><s xml:id="_qxSCFCx">Indeed, some AI-generated tweets are ludicrous, and others contain false information that is presented as fact <ref type="bibr">[101]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_XQFfwn6">For example, a tweet that emerged with little pretraining material was, "Make sure you drink 4 breads of #folicacid per day!"</s><s xml:id="_u7nrfjU">Such examples reflect a lack of common sense knowledge that one cannot drink bread.</s><s xml:id="_EexfpeT">These examples arise only as GPT-2, although very sophisticated, ultimately boils down to a statistical association machine that links the domains nutrition and FA but does not have knowledge about fluid versus solid substances.</s><s xml:id="_xzQmTfP">The computer programs' inability to draw connections between categories or classify knowledge outside the training set has been a fundamental challenge since the early days of AI research <ref type="bibr">[102]</ref><ref type="bibr">[103]</ref><ref type="bibr">[104]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_ZSysFFf"><s xml:id="_GRKQxPJ">This issue becomes particularly sensitive when generations contain wrong medical advice, such as "Take 4 lbs of FA per day!" Again, this reveals that the language model only picks up on statistical regularities in how words are used; however, it possesses no actual knowledge about pregnancy, nutrition, quantities, the developing fetus, and the causal relations between these concepts.</s><s xml:id="_ku5kK65">These challenges are relatively easy to overcome with human supervision and insight.</s><s xml:id="_SkrJ4p7">However, a trickier issue concerns issues in which the underlying knowledge is still evolving or uncertain.</s><s xml:id="_Mvaawbp">Such situations can provide fertile grounds for health myths or speculations about side effects.</s><s xml:id="_XpNceQM">Such information will enter the message engine if it is present in the training data set, which again emphasizes the need for human curation.</s></p><p xml:id="_F3ZaVv9"><s xml:id="_6YUyntP">In addition to the lack of domain knowledge about health and biology beyond that provided in the training set, we have already pointed out that the system also has no theoretical understanding of communication and persuasion.</s><s xml:id="_eQ5gQWZ">The message engine only mimics and varies word use, albeit very eloquently.</s><s xml:id="_fu8Awxk">For a nonnative speaker who has to learn a foreign language for years, this skill may seem enviable; the ability to swiftly come up with 1000 sentences about FA may also impress and help health campaigners who spend hours coming up with 100 new candidate messages.</s><s xml:id="_D2mZdbM">However, the fact that such language models may talk without real understanding also means that they should only be used under the supervision of medical and communication experts.</s><s xml:id="_kQqNFeu">However, this is also true for more human-centric methods, such as focus groups or user-generated content.</s></p><p xml:id="_UXUtrzq"><s xml:id="_SMpFqGk">Despite these limitations, the underlying technology can be expected to improve rapidly, and health communication researchers are well-advised to keep an eye on these developments.</s><s xml:id="_a2Z5vFa">For instance, a successor model to GPT-2 has already been developed <ref type="bibr">[105]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_EJmM3je">This model, called GPT-3, significantly improves some of the limitations that characterize GPT-2.</s><s xml:id="_Du2aw2B">Together with systems that are capable of generating persuasive arguments, selecting best-matching arguments for specific groups, and several other advances, we anticipate that the field of AI-assisted health message generation will see significant progress over the next decade <ref type="bibr" target="#b65">[65,</ref><ref type="bibr">[106]</ref><ref type="bibr">[107]</ref><ref type="bibr">[108]</ref><ref type="bibr">[109]</ref><ref type="bibr">[110]</ref>.</s></p></div>
