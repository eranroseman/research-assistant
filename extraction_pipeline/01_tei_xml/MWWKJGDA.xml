Trials), we proposed a simple non-iterative method to integrate the findings from a number of related clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of a certain treatment for a specified medical condition <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3zuNy3J">Our approach, the random-effects model for meta-analysis, now commonly referred to as the "DerSimonian and Laird method", has become extremely popular in medical research and other applications.</s><s xml:id="_AmtBbtV">According to the Web of Science Core Collection, there are more than BACKGROUND Eugene Glass first coined the phrase meta-analysis in 1976 to mean the statistical analysis of the findings of a collection of individual studies <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_kPMqJzA">In the following decade, meta-analysis was primarily used in the social sciences to summarize the results of a large number of studies on many behavioral, educational and psychosocial studies and experiments.</s><s xml:id="_q9VxY6R">For instance, Rosenthal <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref> analyzed accumulating data from studies done by others to assess if a teacher's expectations can influence a student's performance.</s><s xml:id="_g8uSrFH">Similarly, Glass <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2]</ref> was interested in assessing if psychotherapy is effective while Mosteller <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> set out to determine the optimal class size for learning.</s></p><p xml:id="_TSXGkGA"><s xml:id="_UxjYetN">Early papers in the field were mostly descriptive and stressed the need to systematically report relevant details on study characteristics, not only about design of the studies, but characteristics of subjects, investigators, interventions, measures, study follow-up, etc.</s><s xml:id="_eB5RdQk">However, a formal statistical framework for creating summaries that incorporated heterogeneity was lacking.</s></p><p xml:id="_nWTaPx3"><s xml:id="_nB5wTmh">An article exemplifying the approach in those early years addressed an important contemporaneous educational controversy to assess the effectiveness of coaching students for the Scholastic Aptitude Tests (SAT).</s><s xml:id="_VyTk6YS">In a meta-analysis of data from 23 studies evaluating the effect of coaching on SAT scores, Slack and Porter <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[6]</ref> concluded that coaching is effective on raising aptitude scores, contradicting the principle that the SATs measure "innate" ability or aptitude.</s></p><p xml:id="_CzSbuta"><s xml:id="_r8AhSdm">What was interesting about the data set analyzed by Slack and Porter was a striking relationship between the magnitude of the coaching effect and the degree of control for the coached group.</s><s xml:id="_FK3NakW">Many studies evaluated only coached students and compared their before and after coaching scores with national norms provided by the Educational Testing Service (ETS) on the average gains achieved by repeat test takers.</s><s xml:id="_DSJGQ2p">Other studies used convenience samples as comparison groups, and some studies employed either matching or randomization.</s></p><p xml:id="_HSGTUsx"><s xml:id="_NFMHtGJ">Using the same data set, we published a follow-up to Slack and Porter and introduced the random-effects approach for meta-analysis in this setting <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_VbRGYP2">Our analysis geared towards explaining heterogeneity in the results and found gains in SAT scores depended highly on evaluation design.</s><s xml:id="_NH3xnDK">Studies without concurrent controls tended to show large gains for coaching, whereas in matched and randomized evaluations, the gain due to coaching was too small to be of practical use.</s></p><p xml:id="_KZVYEGQ"><s xml:id="_PswSJB4">In contrast to that of Slack and Porter, our results were consistent with the principle advocated by ETS that the evidence did not support a positive effect of coaching on SAT scores.</s><s xml:id="_ZQgVzFK">At the time, our paper attracted considerable media attention, with hundreds of US newspapers reporting on it, reflecting that the topic was of great interest to the general public.</s><s xml:id="_TKX3TR8">Although the number of citations related to this article in the scientific literature is comparatively modest, the ETS does continue to reference [8] our work in support of the notion that high scores simply reflect long-term rigorous academic training rather than some short-term coaching program.</s></p><p xml:id="_SSvy2yr"><s xml:id="_N73ytgS">Our approach for meta-analysis of the studies to assess if coaching improves SAT scores followed that of Cochran <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[9]</ref> who wrote about combining the effects of different experiments with measured outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_aaKs2x7">Cochran introduced the idea that the observed effect of each study could be partitioned into the sum of a "true" but random effect plus a sampling (or within-study) error.</s><s xml:id="_qph9zqR">Similarly, the variance of the observed effect can also be partitioned into the sum of a variation in true means, plus a within study variance.</s><s xml:id="_Yp5UQM6">Following Cochran, we proposed a method for estimating the mean of the "true" effects of coaching, as well as the variation in "true" effects across studies.</s><s xml:id="_EvSD6kf">This random effects model for meta-analysis is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_0">1</ref>, and our approach to the estimation is shown in Figure <ref type="figure" target="#fig_1">2</ref>. We used a method of moments approach to estimate the variation in the true effects, but ML or REML are also possible.</s><s xml:id="_qrHpz4D">In the SAT application, we assumed that the observed effect for the i-th study, Y i , was the difference in two means between coached and un-coached students, and T i was the true, but unobserved, effect.</s><s xml:id="_DCfcgse">Allowing T i to vary across studies permits different studies to have different coaching effects.</s><s xml:id="_eeCyUmk">We used an estimate of the within-study error assumed from each individual study, s i 2 , to estimate the variation in the "true" effects, σ 2 .</s><s xml:id="_JcvDTxT">In this setting, the primary purpose is to provide an estimate of the overall coaching effect, μ, and characterize the variation, σ 2 , of the effects across studies.</s></p></div>
