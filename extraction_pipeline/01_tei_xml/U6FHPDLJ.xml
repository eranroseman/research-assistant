cuff-calibrated and calibration-free cuffless BP measurement devices have been increasingly appearing in the literature. <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> More significantly, cuff-calibrated cuffless devices are increasingly emerging in the marketplace. <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[4]</ref></s><s xml:id="_QABVrev">4]<ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[5]</ref> Thus, understanding how well these devices work is more important now than ever.</s><s xml:id="_aFzYtqz">However, the evaluation of the BP measurement accuracy of cuffless devices against standard cuff devices is not straightforward and has several methodological issues that need to be addressed.</s><s xml:id="_YyE6nqq">There are at least 3 challenges.</s></p><p xml:id="_V3JbXHs"><s xml:id="_a8sAqEt">First, in the last 3 decades established validation protocols, including the Association for Advancement of Medical Instrumentation (AAMI) protocol, the British Hypertension Society protocol, and the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) International Protocol, have served as the standard methodology for testing the accuracy of BP measurement devices, <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6</ref> but these protocols are not intended for cuffless BP measurement devices.</s><s xml:id="_PcStZAW">The 2018 AAMI/ESH/International Organization for Standardization (ISO) Universal Standard 7 is designed to assess automated cuff devices (mostly oscillometric but also others) against reference manual auscultatory BP measurements taken by 2 observers simultaneously.</s><s xml:id="_Agk9rAE">Three pairs of measurements of the test and reference devices must be obtained from at least 85 individuals of diverse characteristics (eg, ≥5% of the reference systolic BP readings must be ≥160 mm Hg, ≥20% must be ≥140 mm Hg, and ≥5% must be ≤100 mm Hg).</s><s xml:id="_BWv5jSZ">The AAMI/ ESH/ISO Universal Standard requires a device to pass specific criteria assessing individual BP readings (Criterion 1) and individual participant average BP readings (Criterion 2). <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s xml:id="_YpRuJdd">The well-known Criterion 1 is bias and precision errors of individual BP readings (ie, mean and SD of the ≥255 BP errors) within 5 and 8 mm Hg (for test-reference BP comparisons), respectively. <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s xml:id="_a3cN68W">Criterion 2 investigates the precision errors of individual participants (SD of the ≥85 average BP differences of triplicate comparisons per individual). <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s xml:id="_HhkppQM">Since the Universal Standard does not include invoking BP changes within an individual, it is not at all applicable to cuff-calibrated devices.</s><s xml:id="_f8d2d6U">The Universal Standard may make sense for assessing the accuracy of calibration-free devices, yet again certain aspects need to be reconsidered as they operate differently from automated cuff devices.</s><s xml:id="_HHnF4D5">Unfortunately, there is an increasing number of publications presenting data on the accuracy of novel cuffless BP measurement devices, with inadequate methodology and potentially misleading conclusions. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">[8]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">[9]</ref></s><s xml:id="_Gw9CN4d">]<ref type="bibr" target="#b9">[10]</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[11]</ref> More importantly, a recent search of self-home BP monitors which are commercially available in the Australian online market found that

measurement do not recommend cuffless devices for clinical use. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref></s><s xml:id="_zKPt8UK">econd, the inclusion of inter-and intraindividual BP variations are crucial for cuffless device evaluation but difficult to obtain.</s><s xml:id="_PJkfkKY">For cuff-calibrated devices, evaluation of accuracy in static conditions shortly after calibration is certainly not enough, and it is mandatory to evaluate the accuracy during BP changes within each individual.</s><s xml:id="_cuGMbrX">Interventions may be performed to invoke BP changes (exercise, cold pressor test, mental test, drug effects, and others <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> ), or naturally occurring variations during daily life (due to, eg, stress, meals, and activity) may be leveraged.</s><s xml:id="_bXSNQGs">However, interventions for decreasing and even increasing BP may pose risk to some individuals, and it may require numerous reference cuff BP measurements to attain sufficiently large spontaneous BP variations in a person.</s><s xml:id="_u5g4Jkv">While exercise significantly increases BP and post-exercise BP can be lower than preexercise levels, <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref> it may be relatively easy to detect exercise-induced BP changes (eg, heart rate and arterial pulse amplitude rise significantly</s></p><p
