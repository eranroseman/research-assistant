<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_cqFjD99">Background</head><p xml:id="_C9Eccgp"><s xml:id="_xYyHDZR">Mobile health (mHealth) is defined as "medical and public health practice supported by mobile devices such as mobile phones, personal digital assistants and other wireless devices" ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b50">[53,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b51">54]</ref>; p. 6).</s><s xml:id="_NWMsT6g">mHealth applications can use both the phone's basic functionalities (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_Qr9HH3T">voice call and short messaging service) and more complex functionalities (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_a35MhvP">third generation mobile telecommunications (3G) or Bluetooth technology).</s><s xml:id="_j96t45m">mHealth programmes cover a wide array of functions both in communicating with and monitoring the patient population, and for consultation, communication, training and development in healthcare professionals <ref type="bibr" target="#b52">[55]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_9MEdnuM">Types of programmes include SMS or telephone call appointment reminders for patients, mobile applications for continued education in healthcare workers and remote data collection for tracking and monitoring disease outbreaks <ref type="bibr" target="#b44">[46]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_XpCVPaw">One increasingly popular application for mHealth, particularly in low income countries, is its use in public health campaigns to provide preventative health education, due to its ability to increase participant reach in a relatively cheap and easy way <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[3,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_6jSZ7ba">For the purpose of this paper, mHealth refers to the use of mobile phones for preventative health education communication.</s></p><p xml:id="_gH3FhpC"><s xml:id="_J2aRe5x">Mobile phone accessibility is imperative for mHealth interventions and ownership of mobile phones in low income countries has improved dramatically in recent years.</s><s xml:id="_7X7qUap">In Malawi, 34% of the population own a personal mobile phone (29.1% in rural areas and 69.8% in urban areas), while 45.5% have a mobile phone in their household <ref type="bibr">(40.</ref>2% in rural areas and 85.1% in urban areas) <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_3ev7FfM">This is similar in Chikwawa, the study setting, where proportions of phone ownership in rural Southern Malawi, is 27.8% for individuals and 40.1% for households <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_Mgwhetc">In addition, Malawians have the highest annual mobile phone expenditure (out of a 166 country study) at 56.6% Gross National Income per capita <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">[21]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_D8FF5Wc">The cost of the device handset has been found to be this biggest barrier to mobile phone ownership, and 57.9% of individuals in rural Malawi are willing to pay between K2000-K5000 (equivalent of 3-7 US dollars) on a mobile handset <ref type="bibr" target="#b34">[36]</ref>, which would provide them with a basic mobile phone as smartphones are much more expensive.</s><s xml:id="_euah8c6">This is a substantial amount of money considering 87.6% of working adults in Malawi live on less than $3.10 per day <ref type="bibr">[47]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_J4KPyh4">From this evidence it would appear that those without mobile phones are willing to spend a significant proportion of their income on a mobile device, suggesting that mobile phone ownership is a priority to these individuals.</s></p><p xml:id="_dnxGaQc"><s xml:id="_Bbd2FVk">Health care in Malawi, although free, is poorly resourced, and hard to reach for many individuals, where they may face geographical barriers to access healthcare, poor infrastructure, and lack funds to travel <ref type="bibr" target="#b45">[48]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_BmF8X63">Even when health care is accessed, Malawi has one of the highest doctor to patient ratios in the world at 0.019 physicians per 1000 people compared to 2.8 physicians in the UK <ref type="bibr">[56]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_dVaMZGt">The extensive staff and resource limitations in Malawian healthcare are underpinned by financial constraints, lack of trained workforce, and workforce migration <ref type="bibr" target="#b0">[1,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b39">41,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b53">58]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_WVerXUN">This affects not only curative but also preventative health care, which if implemented effectively, could have a significant impact on reducing the main causes of morbidity and mortality e.g.</s><s xml:id="_n5HNGef">HIV/ AIDS and Malaria <ref type="bibr">[57]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_K52fank"><s xml:id="_tUN5mnG">Health promotion is an integral part of the government's healthcare strategic plan in Malawi <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref>, however with rapid increases in population growth <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> and the already overstretched healthcare system <ref type="bibr" target="#b49">[52]</ref>, more needs to be done to intervene in this sector, including the use of innovative ways to delivery health messages and achieve behaviour change.</s><s xml:id="_9r9rNPV">Therefore, with the ever increasing mobile phone usage, which is projected to double by 2020 <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">[17]</ref>, coupled with barriers in staffing and access to preventative healthcare, this low income country is a prime target for mHealth educational interventions.</s></p><p xml:id="_rnBcQY7"><s xml:id="_8xFxRS3">mHealth interventions have the potential to overcome major problems in preventative healthcare delivery in developing countries.</s><s xml:id="_RQs6AuX">However, it is essential that their development and implementation are carried out with scientific rigour.</s><s xml:id="_VuXk3Us">Reviews of mHealth research both globally <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[7,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b10">11,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b43">45]</ref> and specific to developing countries <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[2,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b16">18,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b17">19]</ref> warn of the desperate need for adequately powered, rigorously tested and thoroughly evaluated scientific studies.</s><s xml:id="_Zx8Pr6v">In addition, intervention content must be tailored to the needs of the target population, for example, be sensitive to cultural context and demographic factors such as age and gender, in order to enhance intervention effectiveness <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">[23]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_xHjDS7c">Furthermore, participant level of understanding, language and literacy capabilities and technology skills also need to be considered <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">[18]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_5Zzjv6Z">Therefore participatory research, which involves all relevant stakeholders in intervention design and development, is imperative to increase the likelihood of intervention success and engagement <ref type="bibr" target="#b31">[33]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_Nhd3mgn"><s xml:id="_NAvYsQe">Previous health education campaigns in Malawi, with a mobile component, have included 'Chipatala Cha Pa Foni' a hotline for expectant mothers <ref type="bibr" target="#b47">[50]</ref> 'Youth Alert!' a reproductive health radio programme predominantly accessed via mobile phone <ref type="bibr" target="#b38">[40]</ref>, and health education 'jingles' via mobile phone platforms in the Millennium Village Project <ref type="bibr" target="#b28">[30]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_TZEUb3B">mHealth appears to be a popular mode of health education campaign delivery in Malawi.</s><s xml:id="_9T42BeQ">However peer reviewed research in Malawi has had a predominant focus on up-skilling community health workers to deliver messages <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">[27,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b27">29,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b29">31]</ref>, or implementing hotline or radio campaigns to specific groups of people ( <ref type="bibr" target="#b37">[39,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b47">50]</ref>).</s><s xml:id="_Xt75hyw">There is little evidence regarding the impact of mhealth education campaigns at a community level.</s></p><p xml:id="_hz2nwV4"><s xml:id="_p2NtJq8">Due to this gap in the current evidence base for community mHealth interventions, it is essential to conduct participatory action research to inform the design and development of an mHealth messaging service, which will provide health information to the community; this paper uses Chikwawa, Malawi as a case study.</s><s xml:id="_eekTQg3">This two stage qualitative study involved local residents to identify health topic priorities and used these topics to inform a more detailed discussion of health education need, and the acceptability and feasibility of implementing an mHealth intervention in this
