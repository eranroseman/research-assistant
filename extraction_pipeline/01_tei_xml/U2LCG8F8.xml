consequences of cigarette smoking in 1964, 1 many public health efforts have been devoted to communicating dangers of cigarette smoking.</s><s xml:id="_hx4s2zN">These educational efforts have been carried out through various types of messages and channels such as national, state, and local antitobacco campaigns <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">2</ref> and warning labels on tobacco products.</s><s xml:id="_TPKtu2B">As a result of continuous antitobacco messaging and other multi-pronged efforts to reduce smoking, cigarette smoking rates declined from 42.4% in 1965 <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">3</ref> to 15.1% in 2015. <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref></s><s xml:id="_ZBa5XH3">Despite the decline in smoking rates, cigarette smoking remains the leading cause of preventable death in the United States (US). <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">4</ref> Many factors are responsible for the persistent smoking rates, but mainly the highly addictive nature of nicotine <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">5</ref> and the tobacco companies' efforts to promote addiction. <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">7</ref></s><s xml:id="_cNhdPhh">iven the decades-long dissemination of anti-tobacco messages, another contributor that is worth examining concerns overexposure to a class of health messages about the same health issue (eg, anti-tobacco messages) that may generate counterproductive, unintended effects, such as message fatigue. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s xml:id="_Apzhxa4">Message fatigue is an aversive motivational state of exhaustion and boredom caused by repeated exposure to a category of messages with a common goal (eg, anti-tobacco messages) over a prolonged period of time. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s xml:id="_dxcjnER">As health communication research has been generally more concerned with audiences' limited exposure rather than overexposure to health promotion messages, research on message fatigue is nascent and, consequently, scarce.</s></p><p xml:id="_DCSV98h"><s xml:id="_EgYW8Nu">Although limited in its extensiveness, available research on message fatigue consistently shows that it is counterproductive and dampens persuasive effects of health promotion messages.</s><s xml:id="_852bHSp">For example, safe sex message fatigue among college students was associated with greater message avoidance tendency, annoyance, and desensitization-or a lack of emotional arousal-to safe sex messages, and negatively predicting seeking of safe sex information. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s xml:id="_hE5qJcm">Similarly, research on safe sex message fatigue among men who have sex with men found that safe sex message fatigue was related to the loss of interest in HIV prevention messages, programs, or counseling. <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">9</ref></s><s xml:id="_PuaEAdz">Relatedly, overweight and obese individuals who were more fatigued about anti-obesity messages were less likely to elaborate on and pay attention to an anti-obesity message in an experiment, while showing greater tendency to argue back to the message (ie, greater counterargument). <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s xml:id="_hsbZsMc">In sum, extant research demonstrates that message fatigue may be a significant barrier to effective health communication and promotion of health behaviors.</s></p><p xml:id="_2qX7kw3"><s xml:id="_S2up6Jc">Message fatigue is particularly relevant in the context of anti-tobacco messages because a large volume of anti-tobacco messages has been communicated for decades.</s><s xml:id="_ePKVwmW">Despite the relevance, however, no research to date has examined anti-tobacco message fatigue.</s><s xml:id="_gR2DVE7">Numerous issues related to anti-tobacco message fatigue warrant our attention.</s><s xml:id="_tNXPaEs">One critical step towards understanding and addressing message fatigue is to identify who is fatigued about anti-tobacco messages.</s><s xml:id="_kn6wdQk">Profiling characteristics of individuals who tend to exhibit higher anti-tobacco message fatigue will allow us to achieve 2 important goals: First, by understanding who is more likely to be fatigued than others, we can gain useful information on potential causes of fatigue, which is instrumental in devising message strategies that can mitigate fatigue.</s><s xml:id="_F3H2cnc">Second, on a more practical level, we can create more effective antitobacco messages by taking a tailored approach utilizing the findings from this study.</s><s xml:id="_q55hMTX">For example, health communication practitioners may design fatigue-minimizing messages to subgroups that are more likely to be fatigued and create more conventional informationbased messages to subgroups that exhibit low levels of fatigue.</s><s xml:id="_feFYpa2">To these ends, we sought to identify individual-level factors that predict anti-tobacco message fatigue, including smoking status, tobacco dependency, daily cigarette consumption, age, sex, race, income, and education.</s></p></div>

<div xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0"><head xml:id="_kEv6QDJ">DISCUSSION</head><p xml:id="_d9ES42C"><s xml:id="_vgkQSJW">A burgeoning body of research on message fatigue in the context of other health topics such as obesity and safe sex suggests that repeated exposure to a class of messages might make individuals experience message fatigue.</s><s xml:id="_KwB4QCA">While decades of anti-tobacco messages may have also resulted in fatigue toward such messages, no empirical research to date has gauged target audiences' fatigue or factors that predict their fatigue.</s><s xml:id="_pu7ueFG">Such investigations are crucial to developing effective anti-tobacco messages because emerging research suggests that message fatigue is associated with message avoidance, inattention, and counterargument and, therefore, can be a contributing barrier to effective communication. <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">8</ref></s><s xml:id="_JfFV9R2">As an important first step towards enhancing our understanding of anti-tobacco message fatigue, we sought to present an overall profile of individuals who are likely to feel greater fatigue towards smoking-related messages.</s></p><p xml:id="_VxN9sGh"><s xml:id="_KuN9Uas">In this study, we found several significant predictors of anti-tobacco message fatigue, each of which made unique contributions in the multivariable model.</s><s xml:id="_KRBEHUc">In the analysis involving all participants, all variables that were entered in the multivariable model, including age, sex, race, income, education, and smoking status, were statistically significant predictors of anti-tobacco message fatigue.</s><s xml:id="_UrRaQ8Y">Participants who were younger, male, had higher income and higher education reported greater anti-tobacco message fatigue than their counterparts.</s><s xml:id="_9xhKHJs">This finding is somewhat consistent with research that shows male youth's tendency to resist and adversely respond to other's persuasive intent, <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">13</ref> which is likely evident in most anti-tobacco messages, <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">14</ref> and is likely to be more salient with greater frequency of message exposure. <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref></s><s xml:id="_y9BbdU5">igher income and education also were associated with greater message fatigue.</s><s xml:id="_hmvKSHH">We speculate that higher income and education may have served as proxies for greater exposure to health messages and information from news media, which are more likely to be consumed by individuals with higher education and greater wealth. <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">16</ref></s><s xml:id="_yS6PPxQ">addition, individuals with higher income and education tend to have easier access to healthcare <ref type="bibr" target="#b16">17</ref> and tend to be more health conscious in general. <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">18</ref></s><s xml:id="_cU7nJbz">Thus, they might receive additional anti-tobacco messages from healthcare professionals or other health conscious people in their interpersonal networks, resulting in greater repeated exposure to anti-tobacco messages and subsequent message fatigue.</s><s xml:id="_3Q56TeF">As a prolonged and accumulated exposure to similar messages is an essential antecedent to message fatigue, <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">19</ref> message exposure may be the mechanism underlying the effects of income and education on anti-tobacco message fatigue.</s><s xml:id="_GWqxdqh">Because our dataset did not include data on daily media diet or access to healthcare, this line of reasoning awaits future empirical examination.</s></p><p xml:id="_vGfCzDc"><s xml:id="_E6qgHxR">Race was also a unique predictor of fatigue in that African-American participants were significantly less likely to be fatigued than all other races, including Whites and Hispanics.</s><s xml:id="_a9pHGra">One explanation for this finding could be that anti-tobacco messages rarely focus explicitly on African-American smokers, resulting in African Americans possibly feeling less 'targeted' by the anti-tobacco messages than, for example, Whites, who are much more frequently portrayed in those messages.</s><s xml:id="_CkQhN4X">Indeed, an analysis of the target audiences of massmediated anti-tobacco campaigns showed that only 5% of all anti-tobacco campaign messages targeted African-American communities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref></s><s xml:id="_FmrXvG7">One exception is the US Food and Drug Administration's Fresh Empire campaign targeting hip-hop youth and highlighting African-American youth culture. <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">21</ref></s><s xml:id="_svxkc8F">However, this type of messages remains uncommon.</s><s xml:id="_ZPXuZgC">As research on message fatigue shows that the feeling of being a target of health messages renders people more worn out and fatigued, <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> the feeling of not being targeted may have resulted in African Americans feeling less fatigued about anti-tobacco messages.</s></p><p xml:id="_VQF6sv7"><s xml:id="_XkZGtHe">Another explanation could be a significantly lower reach of anti-tobacco campaign messages relative to tobacco industry's cigarette advertisements in African-American communities. <ref type="bibr" target="#b23">24,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b24">25</ref></s><s xml:id="_tKQEaNH">The tobacco industry has been actively targeting African Americans by building longstanding social connections with the African-American leadership organizations and, thereby, covertly promoting tobacco consumption in this racial group. <ref type="bibr" target="#b25">26</ref></s><s xml:id="_j3NUQUS">However, public health campaigns have rarely focused on African Americans as their target audience, <ref type="bibr" target="#b19">20</ref> which likely contributed to the widening gap between messages promoting tobacco consumption and those communicating harmfulness of tobacco reaching African Americans.</s><s xml:id="_uAeYtQs">If this is indeed the underlying reason for lower fatigue level among African Americans, message fatigue may not be an issue for this subgroup, and more health messages highlighting health consequences of smoking may work well for this racial group.</s><s xml:id="_AJs85x5">This finding resonates with extant research on health disparity that documents a relatively lower reach of health promotion messages in minority communities in comparison to the general population, in part, due to the longstanding difficulty of reaching them. <ref type="bibr" target="#b26">27</ref></s><s xml:id="_hZb8AbM">oking status explained the greatest amount of variance in message fatigue in the multivariable model.</s><s xml:id="_SpKJ39K">Specifically, current smokers exhibited significantly higher levels of message fatigue than both transitioning smokers and non-smokers.</s><s xml:id="_rzNrdEV">Likewise, transitioning smokers were also significantly more fatigued than non-smokers.</s><s xml:id="_fGKsRrx">This finding is somewhat consistent with research on safe sex message fatigue <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">22,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b22">23</ref> that shows that men who have sex with men (ie, high risk subgroup for STIs) frequently complain about being tired of being a target of safe sex messages.</s><s xml:id="_m26cVXp">As anti-tobacco messages typically target individuals who are at greater risk (eg, smokers in general, current smokers in particular) by communicating health consequences of smoking, <ref type="bibr" target="#b27">28,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b28">29</ref> it is plausible that current smokers perceived themselves to be the core target of anti-tobacco messages, which likely generated greater sense of fatigue than in others.</s><s xml:id="_T2gNpGb">It is also plausible that current smokers are actually exposed to a greater volume of anti-tobacco messages in comparison to the other smoking status groups.</s><s xml:id="_znERXnZ">For example, current smokers are exposed to warning labels on cigarette packs each time they smoke, which likely resulted in a much greater dose of exposure to those messages than for transitional smokers or nonsmokers.</s></p><p xml:id="_X84fA4f"><s xml:id="_BMFmvtA">This finding also can be interpreted in terms of potential difference in perceived persuasive intent of anti-tobacco messages among the 3 smoking status groups.</s><s xml:id="_SgUERpz">Whereas anti-tobacco messages portraying, for example, health consequences of smoking may be perceived by nonsmokers as a prosocial message containing useful health information, smokers may perceive the same exact message as a message with a clear persuasive intent that targets them specifically.</s><s xml:id="_bnrCRQd">As perceived persuasive intent has been shown to decrease positive effects of repeated message exposure on persuasive outcomes, <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">15</ref> the potential difference in perceived persuasive intent of anti-tobacco messages among the 3 groups also may explain the difference in the levels of message fatigue.</s></p><p xml:id="_v5KCNeC"><s xml:id="_Y98RkyA">Because smoking status emerged as the most significant predictor of anti-tobacco message fatigue, we ran separate multivariable models for each of the 3 groups.</s><s xml:id="_J4Za7uE">Among transitioning smokers, age and race significantly predicted fatigue but the rest of the predictors including tobacco dependency, which was operationalized as daily cigarette consumption and time to first cigarette in the morning, were not associated with message fatigue.</s><s xml:id="_8KZYqfv">Contrarily, among current smokers, daily cigarette consumption and time to first cigarette were all statistically significant predictors of message fatigue.</s><s xml:id="_dXxpGBj">Specifically, those who smoked more than 20 cigarettes per day had significantly higher message fatigue than those who consumed 11 to 20 and 1 to 10 cigarettes per day.</s><s xml:id="_JfDz3eu">Tobacco dependence assessed in terms of time to first cigarette also predicted message fatigue.</s><s xml:id="_yFvNyzP">Current smokers who reached out to their first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up exhibited significantly higher levels of fatigue than those who initiated smoking more than 30 minutes of waking up.</s><s xml:id="_h8ujmWc">Whether current smokers who are more addicted to tobacco are exposed to greater volumes of anti-tobacco messages from a variety of sources including interpersonal network (eg, physicians, family members) or they just simply respond to anti-tobacco messages in a more defensive way would be an important piece of information that would help tobacco control advocates to devise the most effective way to combat fatigue among the current smokers.</s></p><p xml:id="_DMFzT3S"><s xml:id="_34uudn5">Among current smokers, readiness to quit smoking was also a statistically significant predictor of message fatigue.</s><s xml:id="_uRTZYDa">Current smokers who never expect to quit reported to have significantly higher levels of fatigue than those who intended to quit in the next month.</s><s xml:id="_aKRpk36">In other words, current smokers who were most resistant to smoking cessation were significantly more tired of anti-tobacco messages than those who were much more open to smoking cessation and were considering quitting in the near future.</s><s xml:id="_Gvc9awt">The explanation offered earlier -that concerned perceptions of being a target of anti-tobacco messages and perceived persuasive intent lead to message fatigue -also may be useful here.</s><s xml:id="_9b6GxzR">Current smokers who just do not see themselves quitting smoking at all (ie, smokers in precontemplation stage) likely perceive anti-tobacco messages to be specifically "speaking to them" with a clear intent to change their behaviors, whereas current smokers who are open to the idea enough to consider quitting next month (ie, smokers in preparation stage) may not think that way because the message is already consistent with what they believe (eg, smoking is harmful and I need to quit).</s></p><p xml:id="_Q3hdUPY"><s xml:id="_swd2KDx">This study has several limitations.</s><s xml:id="_7X2ybhU">The findings are limited by its cross-sectional nature.</s><s xml:id="_32c26CP">Thus, conclusions inferring causality cannot be made with the current data.</s><s xml:id="_rgnAxRE">In addition, although the pool of participants was diverse, it was not a probability-based sample, which limits the generalizability of the findings.</s><s xml:id="_b9yFqQn">For example, the sample we recruited had more female participants and individuals with college degree or higher than the overall US population.</s><s xml:id="_fFzXZdW">Smoking-related variables were self-reported, and not biologically validated.</s><s xml:id="_ES2FrWz">Whereas the experimental exposure to 9 cigarette warning labels might not have been enough to increase one's preexisting level of anti-tobacco message fatigue, it likely made it more salient due to priming effects.</s><s xml:id="_ws3ptz3">Repeated exposure to cigarette warning labels before the assessment of the fatigue level likely made the construct more accessible, and might have slightly heightened it.</s><s xml:id="_6w6GB9U">Thus, the findings from this study should be interpreted with this in mind.</s><s xml:id="_X2B9kG3">Lastly, the study purported to examine predictors of message fatigue towards overall anti-tobacco message categories, which may be in various formats and sources such as antitobacco media campaigns and cigarette warning labels.</s><s xml:id="_StSJSrB">However, in this study, cigarettewarning labels that constitute a specific type of anti-tobacco message were shown to the participants as a part of a larger study.</s><s xml:id="_kGWYnfd">Although exposure to such messages was not a key variable we studied here, it may have influenced the assessments of the variables we used in the analyses.</s><s xml:id="_9AEVrqU">For example, a relatively restrictive form of communication typically reflected in warning labels might have prompted higher levels of anti-tobacco message fatigue than other types of anti-tobacco messages, which may utilize a significant level of executional variations in terms of tone, character, and other message features.</s><s xml:id="_6cDyXjq">Nonetheless, warning labels succinctly communicate harmfulness of smoking, which is an essential element contained across different forms of anti-tobacco messages, and should not influence the nature of associations observed in this study.</s></p><p xml:id="_9w4dfdM"><s xml:id="_fxgwbfE">The findings from this study present several avenues for future research.</s><s xml:id="_44U9dsr">First, anti-tobacco message fatigue was found to be most relevant for the current smoker group.</s><s xml:id="_XnNkRV2">More information on how this group responds to anti-tobacco messages and which aspects of the messages render them more fatigued would be instrumental in devising ways to overcome negative effects of fatigue.</s><s xml:id="_SESDC5e">Because research on message fatigue is currently in its infancy, a more ground-up approach involving qualitative interviews may be particularly useful.</s><s xml:id="_CfCHuS5">For example, focus group interviews with highly educated, white, current smokers, who are in the precontemplation stage in terms of smoking cessation would provide much needed information about what makes them feel tired of anti-tobacco messages.</s><s xml:id="_cd9X9VU">The findings also point to the importance of segmenting audiences when communicating risks of smoking.</s><s xml:id="_fxeHTCw">Individuals had significantly different levels of anti-tobacco message fatigue in terms of race, education levels, and most importantly, smoking status.</s><s xml:id="_SR2UNDZ">Stated differently, fatigue may not be an issue for some subgroups (eg, nonsmokers, African Americans) but may be an important issue to address for some other subgroups (eg, current smokers, Whites).</s><s xml:id="_exQPUAg">In sum, it is important to be cognizant of the differences among diverse audiences and tailor the messages and ways of disseminating them when communicating negative consequences of tobacco consumption.</s></p></div>			<note xmlns="http://www.tei-c.org/ns/1.0" place="foot" xml:id="foot_0"><p xml:id="_eDadb2X"><s xml:id="_3h3k9Cz">Am J Health Behav.</s><s
