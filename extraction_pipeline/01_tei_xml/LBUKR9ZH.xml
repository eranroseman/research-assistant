obesity more than doubled between 1980 and 2012 <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">[1]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_vMy8We5">In Korea, the prevalence of obesity has increased over the past 10 years (20.6% to 24.6% in men, 16.2% to 17.3% in women from 2006 to 2015) <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">[2]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_bc9seWj">These changes are particularly important given the known association between obesity with cardiovascular disease (CVD), diabetes, and death <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">[3]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_r5apKe4"><s xml:id="_vrFV965">Intriguingly, obesity is not synonymous with metabolic disease, as people who are overweight or obese do not always have no metabolic dysfunction, especially cardio-metabolic dysfunction.</s><s xml:id="_cmhdXpr">These populations have been called the metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) phenotype.</s><s xml:id="_f3bchn5">The underlying mechanisms which cause MHO phenotype among obese people are multiple and complex.</s><s xml:id="_CGRJa6Z">This phenotype is the result of complex interaction between genetic, environmental, and behavioral factors <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_wrhGGhy">The absence of genetic traits associated with fat distribution, reduced visceral fat mass and ectopic fat accumulation in liver, muscle, and pancreatic beta cells, and low systemic inflammation all contribute to metabolically healthy obesity <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">[4]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_vczHChh"><s xml:id="_UbtUBms">The diagnostic criteria for MHO is controversial, and therefore the prevalence of MHO is difficult to quantify and varies according to the definition used <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">[5]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_mARSckk">The prevalence of MHO has been reported to be 10-25% worldwide <ref type="bibr" target="#b6">[6,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">7]</ref>, while the estimated prevalence among middle-age men in Korea is 24.2-28.5% <ref type="bibr"

xml:id="_bgNWvDV"><s xml:id="_jxKuX4G">Although, by definition, people with MHO are metabolically 'healthy', the metabolic outcomes of MHO remain unclear.</s><s xml:id="_nugMB7c">Regarding cardiovascular outcomes in this group of patients, Hamer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b10">[10]</ref> observed 22,203 subjects without CVD for more than 7 years.</s><s xml:id="_KhGjS2f">This observational study revealed that MHO did not increase the risk for all-cause or cardiovascular mortality.</s><s xml:id="_RPxPnYD">Furthermore, MHO has little association with heart failure <ref type="bibr" target="#b11">[11]</ref> and with coronary atherosclerosis <ref type="bibr">[12]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_x99DK2r">On the contrary, several large observational studies reported that MHO is a significant risk factor for CVD.</s><s xml:id="_Bn5umvu">Ogorodnikova et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b12">[13]</ref> conducted a 12-year observational study and demonstrated patients with MHO had high risk of CVD compared to metabolically healthy normal weight individuals.</s><s xml:id="_CYfDGXC">Kramer et al. <ref type="bibr" target="#b13">[14]</ref> reviewed 8 studies about all-cause mortality and cardiovascular events and concluded that obesity is an independent risk factor for CVD in patients with and without metabolic disorders.</s></p><p xml:id="_6WKfnrc"><s xml:id="_6cp8RsH">These discrepancies suggest that MHO alone is not sufficient to predict metabolic outcome and patients with MHO likely represent a heterogeneous group.</s><s xml:id="_WZUve9x">Therefore, it remains important to identify the key factors that determine healthy outcomes in MHO and to re-define metabolically healthy obesity.</s></p><p xml:id="_mQebzbs"><s xml:id="_uTH6qPg">In this study, we focused on physical activity (PA) as a key factor, since it is well known to influence obesity, and because physical inactivity contributes to the development of metabolic disorders such as heart disease, hypertension, and type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) <ref type="bibr" target="#b14">[15]</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_ZRjMDAK">The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends that adults should perform at least 150 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity (PA) or 75 minutes of vigorous-intensity aerobic PA throughout the week <ref type="bibr"

target="#b16">[17]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_CCtgtP5"><s xml:id="_pQemP9E">Many studies have reported that the amount of PA has inverse dose-response associations with coronary heart disease and CVD <ref type="bibr" target="#b17">[18]</ref> and regular exercise improves insulin sensitivity and reduces glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels in T2DM patients <ref type="bibr" target="#b18">[19]</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_5BdT3ve"><s xml:id="_b5KXc6J">In the present study, patients with MHO were divided into four groups based on their level of PA, and we evaluated the risk of CVD in a Korean population-based cohort.</s><s xml:id="_3xbsgw6">The aim of the present study was to determine the effect of PA on CVD outcomes of MHO and to re-define the concept of "real"
