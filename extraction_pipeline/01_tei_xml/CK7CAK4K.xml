an "all or nothing" phenomenon.</s><s xml:id="_QfYZDE7">Empirical evidence suggests that individuals attempting to change their physical activity behavior move through a series of stages.</s><s xml:id="_qQrTztW">The stages are characterized by a temporal dimension of "readiness" to change.</s><s xml:id="_FzaEyhV">Five stages have been proposed that differ according to an individual's intention and behavior.</s><s xml:id="_FDqkwcF">The stages have been labeled Precontemplation (no intention of becoming physically active), Contemplation (thinking about starting to become physically active within the next 6 months), Preparation (making small changes in behavior but still not meeting a criterion for physical activity), Action (meeting a criterion of physical activity, but only recently-usually within the past 6 months), and Maintenance (meeting a criterion for physical activity for 6 months or longer).</s><s xml:id="_Ewt2TRt">Original formulations of the model proposed that individuals moved through the stages in a linear fashion <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">(4)</ref>, but it is now recognized that stage progression is more likely to follow a cyclical pattern <ref

change process.</s><s xml:id="_JeVPr2C">These are an individual's self-efficacy for change, the decisional balance of perceived advantages and disadvantages of change, and the strategies and techniques (the processes of change) individuals use to modify their thoughts, feelings, and behavior.</s></p><p xml:id="_TJWcWgm"><s xml:id="_vf9KVQg">The importance of self-efficacy for initiating and maintaining a pattern of regular physical activity derives from social-cognitive theories of behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b15">(17)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_gJftjYZ">Self-efficacy describes the

decision making <ref type="bibr" target="#b20">(22)</ref>, behavior change is assumed to involve a systematic evaluation of the potential gains (pros) and losses (cons) associated with the new behavior <ref type="bibr" target="#b21">(23)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_SqFAYH5">These constructs have emerged as relevant for understanding health behavior change such as physical activity <ref

target="#b7">9)</ref>.</s></p><p xml:id="_t9XDgMD"><s xml:id="_juKwsAg">Ten basic processes of change that describe the techniques and strategies individuals use to modify their thoughts, feelings,

target="#b24">(26)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_JSPjKck">The five experiential processes are Consciousness Raising, Dramatic Relief, Environmental Reevaluation, Self-Reevaluation, and Social Liberation.</s><s xml:id="_r8b58hF">The five behavioral processes are Counterconditioning, Helping Relationships, Reinforcement Management, Self-Liberation, and Stimulus Control.</s></p><p xml:id="_43w7b8P"><s xml:id="_r96Nrvs">A series of cross-sectional, prospective, and longitudinal studies of smoking cessation have demonstrated that different processes appear to be emphasized at different stages of change <ref type="bibr" target="#b8">(10)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_h5RezgU">Narrative reviews in the physical activity domain have also concluded that a two-factor model is appropriate, and stage-specific trends exist for these higher order constructs <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">(7)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b6">(8)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(9)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_d9f3Fhj">The general consensus is that experiential processes are more important during the early stages, with behavioral processes important at later stages <ref type="bibr" target="#b7">(9,</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b25">27)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_RbdPZnf">However, these conclusions are offered with limited empirical evidence to support them.</s><s

target="#b29">(31)</ref><ref type="bibr" target="#b30">(32)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_bw2EvQy">Despite these arguments, narrative reviews are consistent in providing support for the TTM in the physical

useful for reviewing a research literature, there is considerable evidence to suggest that meta-analytic techniques are superior for building cumulative knowledge <ref type="bibr" target="#b32">(34)</ref>.</s><s xml:id="_cgwt8Fw">A limitation of the narrative review is that results of primary studies are often interpreted at face value (e.g., usually based on the result of a
