during the past decade 1 , 21.0% of men and 27.1% of women report no leisure-time physical activity at all 2 and the majority (54.1%) of US adults are still not meeting national physical activity guidelines <ref type="bibr" target="#b1">3</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_Z34JSaC">Given the potentially numerous health benefits and relatively low cost of exercise as a method of disease prevention and health promotion, the development of interventions to encourage physical activity initiation and maintenance will continue to be of interest to health researchers and policymakers alike.</s><s xml:id="_k3RtukB">Even within rigorous clinical trials aimed specifically at increasing physical activity, many individuals will fail to adhere to the recommended amount of activity <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">4</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_6cVS2av">The reasons for low adherence are highly relevant to the design and conduct of future trials as well as to the study of population-level exercise promotion.</s></p><p xml:id="_KAVvfvd"><s xml:id="_CSk7uzH">Few exercise trials specify which participant characteristics were associated with adherence or describe the trajectory of adherence across the intervention period.</s><s xml:id="_sc77Stp">These oftenoverlooked elements are not only critical for proper interpretation of the main study findings but also provide immensely useful information for researchers planning similar intervention studies.</s></p><p xml:id="_huc3bxr"><s xml:id="_duxQn6T">The utility of randomized controlled trials examining the effects of exercise on physical or psychological health is highly dependent on the level of adherence that can be achieved, and how well adherence is maintained throughout the entire intervention period.</s><s xml:id="_jUAwJPG">Poor initial adherence or adherence that decays dramatically during the course of the intervention reduces effect sizes and statistical power, biasing the results of the trial towards the null hypothesis.</s><s xml:id="_ejUaNdj">Conversely, well-informed interventions with excellent adherence can provide a better estimation of treatment effects with fewer participants and lower study costs.</s></p><p xml:id="_7qthnYq"><s xml:id="_7K5B6H7">More generally, the study of adherence to exercise interventions provides valuable information about how different demographic, psychological, social, economic, and physiological factors may influence the ease or difficulty with which individuals adopt and maintain this new behavior.</s><s xml:id="_yrRHJEA">This information can then be applied to physical activity programs in community settings or to broader public health policy to assist people in overcoming the barriers to becoming and staying active.</s><s xml:id="_rfwZfV8">A wide variety of correlates of physical activity adherence have been examined in previous research among middle-aged and older adults, with higher baseline fitness level, a history of being physically active, absence of tobacco use, and high self-efficacy for exercise most reliably predicting better adherence <ref type="bibr" target="#b2">4</ref> .</s><s xml:id="_6M7uJgF">The factors that are associated with good adherence tend to vary according to the type, intensity, and duration of prescribed exercise as well as with the overall duration of the intervention, the mode of delivery (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_J7YmVWB">home-based vs. supervised), and the study population.</s></p><p xml:id="_RqAn3yJ"><s xml:id="_VTFN9Ry">The "A Program Promoting Exercise and Active Lifestyles" (APPEAL) Study was a yearlong randomized controlled trial of moderate-to-vigorous intensity exercise vs. usual care among 202 healthy, sedentary adults recruited primarily through physician practices.</s><s xml:id="_xTmzcTV">The trial was designed to test the effects of exercise on adiposity <ref type="bibr" target="#b3">5</ref> , biomarkers for colon cancer (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_kpGDunf">markers of apoptosis <ref type="bibr" target="#b4">6</ref> and cell proliferation <ref type="bibr" target="#b5">7</ref> ), and other physiologic and psychosocial outcomes.</s><s xml:id="_Sf7CNBU">The APPEAL trial featured a combined supervised and home-based exercise intervention that prescribed a larger amount of exercise (360 min/week of moderate-to-vigorous activity) than many previous trials and for a longer duration (12  months), presenting an unusually challenging protocol for participants and interesting opportunities for the study of adherence and behavior change.</s><s xml:id="_vvvKvs4">Analyzing data separately for men and women, this paper provides a detailed description of adherence to the APPEAL intervention throughout each phase of the study period (months 0-3, 4-6, 7-9, and 10-12) and examines the influence of relevant demographic, psychosocial, anthropometric, and physiological characteristics on overall adherence during the 12 months.</s><s xml:id="_Ctqvt8n">We hypothesized that baseline physical activity, cardiopulmonary fitness, obesity (e.g.</s><s xml:id="_NfQnQBX">body mass index, % body fat), self-efficacy, and perceived barriers to and benefits of exercise would be associated with exercise adherence.</s></p></div>
